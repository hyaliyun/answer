Smartphones are typically pocket-sized, as opposed to tablets, which are much larger. They are able to run a variety of software components, known as apps. Most basic apps (e.g. event calendar, camera, web browser) come pre-installed with the system, while others are available for download from places like the Google Play Store or Apple App Store. Apps can receive bug fixes and gain additional functionality through software updates; similarly, operating systems are able to update. Modern smartphones have a touchscreen color display with a graphical user interface that covers the front surface and enables the user to use a virtual keyboard to type and press onscreen icons to activate \\"app\\" features. Mobile payment is now a common theme amongst most smartphones.\\r\\nToday, smartphones largely fulfill most people's needs for a telephone, digital camera and video camera, GPS navigation, a media player, clock, news, calculator, web browser, handheld video game player, flashlight, compass, an address book, note-taking, digital messaging, an event calendar, etc. Typical smartphones will include one or more of the following sensors: magnetometer, proximity sensor, barometer, gyroscope, or accelerometer. Since 2010, smartphones adopted integrated virtual assistants, such as Apple Siri, Amazon Alexa, Google Assistant, Microsoft Cortana, BlackBerry Assistant and Samsung Bixby. Most smartphones produced from 2012 onward have high-speed mobile broadband 4G LTE capability.\\r\\nIn 1999, the Japanese firm NTT DoCoMo released the first smartphones to achieve mass adoption within a country.[1] Smartphones became widespread in the late 2000s. In the third quarter of 2012, one billion smartphones were in use worldwide.[2] Global smartphone sales surpassed the sales figures for feature phones in early 2013.[3]\\r\\nThe first commercially available device that could be properly referred to as a \\"smartphone\\" began as a prototype called \\"Angler\\" developed by Frank Canova in 1992 while at IBM and demonstrated in November of that year at the COMDEX computer industry trade show.[5][6][7] A refined version was marketed to consumers in 1994 by BellSouth under the name Simon Personal Communicator. In addition to placing and receiving cellular calls, the touch screen-equipped Simon could send and receive faxes and emails. It included an address book, calendar, appointment scheduler, calculator, world time clock and notepad, as well as other visionary mobile applications such as maps, stock reports and news.[8] The term \\"smart phone\\" or \\"smartphone\\" was not coined until a year after the introduction of the Simon, appearing in print as early as 1995, describing AT&T's PhoneWriter Communicator.[9][non-primary source needed]\\r\\nThe first integration of data signals with telephony was conceptualized by Nikola Tesla in 1909 and pioneered by Theodore Paraskevakos beginning in 1968 with his work on transmission of electronic data through telephone lines. In 1971, while he was working with Boeing in Huntsville, Alabama, Paraskevakos demonstrated a transmitter and receiver that provided additional ways to communicate with remote equipment. This formed the original basis for what is now known as caller ID.[10] The first caller ID equipment was installed at Peoples' Telephone Company in Leesburg, Alabama and was demonstrated to several telephone companies. The original and historic working models are still in the possession of Paraskevakos.[11]\\r\\nIn the mid-late 1990s, many people who had mobile phones carried a separate dedicated PDA device, running early versions of operating systems such as Palm OS, Newton OS, Symbian or Windows CE/Pocket PC. These operating systems would later evolve into early mobile operating systems. Most of the \\"smartphones\\" in this era were hybrid devices that combined these existing familiar PDA OSes with basic phone hardware. The results were devices that were bulkier than either dedicated mobile phones or PDAs, but allowed a limited amount of cellular Internet access. The trend at the time, however, that manufacturers competed on in both mobile phones and PDAs was to make devices smaller and slimmer. The bulk of these smartphones combined with their high cost and expensive data plans, plus other drawbacks such as expansion limitations and decreased battery life compared to separate standalone devices, generally limited their popularity to \\"early adopters\\" and business users who needed portable connectivity.\\r\\nIn March 1996, Hewlett-Packard released the OmniGo 700LX, a modified HP 200LX palmtop PC with a Nokia 2110 mobile phone piggybacked onto it and ROM-based software to support it. It had a 640G200 resolution CGA compatible four-shade gray-scale LCD screen and could be used to place and receive calls, and to create and receive text messages, emails and faxes. It was also 100% DOS 5.0 compatible, allowing it to run thousands of existing software titles, including early versions of Windows.\\r\\nIn August 1996, Nokia released the Nokia 9000 Communicator, a digital cellular PDA based on the Nokia 2110 with an integrated system based on the PEN/GEOS 3.0 operating system from Geoworks. The two components were attached by a hinge in what became known as a clamshell design, with the display above and a physical QWERTY keyboard below. The PDA provided e-mail; calendar, address book, calculator and notebook applications; text-based Web browsing; and could send and receive faxes. When closed, the device could be used as a digital cellular telephone.\\r\\nIn June 1999 Qualcomm released the \\"pdQ Smartphone\\", a CDMA digital PCS smartphone with an integrated Palm PDA and Internet connectivity.[12]\\r\\nSubsequent landmark devices included:\\r\\nIn 1999, the Japanese firm NTT DoCoMo released the first smartphones to achieve mass adoption within a country. These phones ran on i-mode, which provided data transmission speeds up to 9.6 kbit/s.[19] Unlike future generations of wireless services, NTT DoCoMo's i-mode used cHTML, a language which restricted some aspects of traditional HTML in favor of increasing data speed for the devices. Limited functionality, small screens and limited bandwidth allowed for phones to use the slower data speeds available.[20] The rise of i-mode helped NTT DoCoMo accumulate an estimated 40 million subscribers by the end of 2001. It was also ranked first in market capitalization in Japan and second globally. This power would later wane in the face of the rise of 3G and new phones with advanced wireless network capabilities.[21]\\r\\nSmartphones were still rare outside Japan until the introduction of the Danger Hiptop in 2002, which saw moderate success among U.S. consumers as the T-Mobile Sidekick. Later, in the mid-2000s, business users in the U.S. started to adopt devices based on Microsoft's Windows Mobile, and then BlackBerry smartphones from Research In Motion. American users popularized the term \\"CrackBerry\\" in 2006 due to the BlackBerry's addictive nature.[22]\\r\\nOutside the U.S. and Japan, Nokia was seeing success with its smartphones based on Symbian, originally developed by Psion for their personal organisers, and it was the most popular smartphone OS in Europe during the middle to late 2000s. Initially, Nokia's Symbian smartphones were focused on business with the Eseries,[23] similar to Windows Mobile and BlackBerry devices at the time. From 2006 onwards, Nokia started producing consumer-focused smartphones, popularized by the entertainment-focused Nseries. In Asia, with the exception of Japan, the trend was similar to that of Europe.[citation needed] Until 2010, Symbian was the world's most widely used smartphone operating system.[24]\\r\\nIn the early to mid 2000s, it was common for smartphones to have a physical T9 numeric keypad or QWERTY keyboard in either a candybar or sliding form factor. At that time, many smartphones had resistive touchscreens, which allowed for input with a stylus in addition to fingers, thus allowing the entry of Asian characters.[25]\\r\\nIn 2007, the LG Prada was the first mobile phone released with a large capacitive touchscreen.[26] Later that year, Apple Inc. introduced the iPhone, which uses a multi-touch capacitive touch screen.[27] Such phones were notable for abandoning the use of a stylus, keyboard, or keypad typical for smartphones at the time, in favor of a capacitive touchscreen for direct finger input as its only input type. The iPhone was \\"not a smartphone by conventional terms, being that a smartphone is a platform device that allows software to be installed,\\"[28] until the opening of Apple's App Store a year later, which became a common means for smartphone software distribution and installation.\\r\\nIn October 2008, the first phone to use Google's Android operating system called the HTC Dream (also known as the T-Mobile G1) was released.[29][30] It was also a smartphone with a large multi-touch touchscreen, but still retained a slide-out physical keyboard. Later versions of Android added and then improved on-screen keyboard support, and physical keyboards on Android devices quickly became rare. Although Android's adoption was relatively slow at first, it started to gain widespread popularity in 2010, and in early 2012 dominated the smartphone market share worldwide, which continues to this day.[31]\\r\\nThe iPhone and Android phones with their capacitive touchscreens popularized the smartphone form factor based on a large capacitive touchscreen and led to the decline of earlier, keyboard- and keypad-focused platforms. Microsoft, for instance, discontinued Windows Mobile and started a new touchscreen-oriented OS from scratch, called Windows Phone. Nokia abandoned Symbian and partnered with Microsoft to use Windows Phone on its smartphones. Windows Phone became the third-most-popular smartphone OS, before being replaced by Windows 10 Mobile, which declined in share to become \\"largely irrelevant\\" at less than 0.5% of the smartphone market.[32] Palm replaced their Palm OS with webOS, which was bought by Hewlett-Packard and later sold to LG Electronics for use on LG smart TVs. BlackBerry Limited, formerly known as Research In Motion, made a new platform based on QNX, BlackBerry 10, with which it was possible to control a device without having to press any physical buttons; this platform was later discontinued.\\r\\nBy the mid 2010s, almost all smartphones were touchscreen-only, and Android and iPhone smartphones dominated the market.\\r\\nIn 2013, Fairphone launched its first \\"socially ethical\\" smartphone at the London Design Festival to address concerns regarding the sourcing of materials in the manufacturing.[33] In late 2013, QSAlpha commenced production of a smartphone designed entirely around security, encryption and identity protection.[34] Some companies began to release smartphones incorporating flexible displays to create curved form factors, such as the Samsung Galaxy Round and LG G Flex.[35][36][37]\\r\\nIn October 2013, Motorola Mobility announced Project Ara, a concept for a modular smartphone platform that would allow users to customize and upgrade their phones with add-on modules that attached magnetically to a frame.[38][39] Ara was retained by Google following its sale of Motorola Mobility to Lenovo,[40] but was shelved in 2016.[41] That year, LG and Motorola both unveiled smartphones featuring a limited form of modularity for accessories; the LG G5 allowed accessories to be installed via the removal of its battery compartment,[42] while the Moto Z utilizes accessories attached magnetically to the rear of the device.[43]\\r\\nBy 2014, 1440p displays began to appear on high-end smartphones.[44] In 2015, Sony released the Xperia Z5 Premium, featuring a 4K resolution display, although only images and videos could actually be rendered at that resolution (all other software is upscaled from 1080p).[45] Microsoft, expanding upon the concept of Motorola's short-lived \\"Webtop\\", unveiled functionality for its Windows 10 operating system for phones that allows supported devices to be docked for use with a PC-styled desktop environment.[46][47] Other major technologies began to trend in 2016, including a focus on virtual reality and augmented reality experiences catered towards smartphones, the newly introduced USB-C connector, and improving LTE technologies.[48] As of 2015, the global median for smartphone ownership was 43%.[49] Statista has forecast that 2.87 billion people will own smartphones in 2020.[50]\\r\\nFoldable OLED smartphones have been anticipated for years but have failed to materialize because of the relatively high failure rate when producing these screens.[citation needed] Creating a battery that can be folded is another hurdle.[51]\\r\\nOne of the main characteristics of smartphones is their screen. It fills some of the device's front surface (about 70%), however, with the newest smartphones like the Galaxy S8 and iPhone X, most of the available space on the front is dedicated to the display in a style referred to as \\"edge-to-edge.\\" Many of the displays have an aspect ratio of 16:9; some are 4:3 or other ratios. They are measured in diagonal inches, starting from 2.45 inches.[52] Phones with screens larger than 5.2 inches are often called \\"phablets.\\" Smartphones with screens over 4.5 inches commonly are difficult to use with only a single hand, since most thumbs cannot reach the entire screen surface; they may need to be shifted around in the hand, held in one hand and manipulated by the other, or used in place with both hands. Liquid-crystal displays are the most common; others are IPS, LED, OLED, AMOLED and E Ink displays. In the 2010s, Braille screens, which can be used by visually impaired people are being developed. It is expected that Braille screens will use some type of microfluidics technology.[53] In addition, some displays are integrated with pressure-sensitive digitizers, such as those developed by Wacom and Samsung. Wacoms models allows users to have greater precision when drawing.[54] Starting with the iPhone 6S, Apple released pressure sensitivity for their mobiles under the name 3D Touch. Apples 3D Touch uniquely utilizes the digitizer by giving users the availability to display additional menus and options by applying pressure to specified icons.\\r\\nA wide range of accessories are sold for smartphones, including cases, screen protectors, power charging cables, wireless power stations, USB On-The-Go adapters (for connecting USB drives and or, in some cases, a HDMI cable to an external monitor), add-on batteries, headphones, combined headphone-microphones (which, for example, allow a person to privately conduct calls on the device without holding it to the ear), and Bluetooth-enabled powered speakers that enable users to listen to media from their smartphones wirelessly. Cases range from relatively inexpensive rubber or soft plastic cases which provide moderate protection from bumps and good protection from scratches to more expensive, heavy-duty cases that combine a rubber padding with a hard outer shell. Some cases have a \\"book\\"-like form, with a cover that the user opens to use the device; when the cover is closed, it protects the screen. Some \\"book\\"-like cases have additional pockets for credit cards, thus enabling people to use them as wallets. Accessories include products sold by the manufacturer of the smartphone and compatible products made by other manufacturers.\\r\\nSmartphone battery life, nowadays, is generally adequate,[55] however, earlier smartphone battery life was poor due to the weak batteries that could not handle the significant power requirements of the smartphones' computer systems and color screens.[56][57][58] There is a trend towards using batteries that the user cannot replace.[59] To extend talktime, smartphone users purchase additional chargers for use outside the home, at work, and in cars and by buying portable external \\"battery packs\\". External battery packs include generic models which are connected to the smartphone with a cable and custom-made models that \\"piggyback\\" onto a smartphone's case. Most recently, Samsung had to recall millions of the Galaxy Note 7 smartphones due to an explosive battery issue.[60] For consumer convenience, wireless charging stations have been introduced in some hotels, bars, and other public spaces.[61]\\r\\nAndroid is a mobile operating system founded by Andy Rubin, now owned and developed by Google, and backed by an industry consortium known as the Open Handset Alliance.[62][63] It is an open source platform with optional proprietary components, including a suite of flagship software for Google services, and the application and content storefront Google Play.[64] Android was officially introduced via the release of its inaugural device, the HTC Dream (T-Mobile G1) on 20 October 2008.[65] As an open source product, Android has also been the subject of third-party development. Development groups have used the Android source code to develop and distribute their own modified versions of the operating system, such as CyanogenMod (now LineageOS), to add features to the OS and provide newer versions of Android to devices that no longer receive official updates from their vendor.[66][67][68] Forked versions of Android have also been adopted by other vendors, such as Amazon.com, who used its \\"Fire OS\\" on a range of tablets and the Fire Phone.[69][70] As it is a non-proprietary platform that has shipped on devices covering a wide range of market segments, Android has seen significant adoption. Gartner Research estimated that 325 million Android smartphones were sold during the fourth quarter of 2015, leading all other platforms. Samsung Electronics, who produces Android devices, was also the top smartphone vendor across all platforms in the same period of time.[71] Android is the top-selling smartphone OS in 2016.[72][73] Android Pay is available on Android software.[74]\\r\\niOS (formerly iPhone OS) is a proprietary mobile operating system developed by Apple Inc. primarily for its iPhone product line. The iPhone was first unveiled in January 2007. The device introduced the use of multi-touch gestures for navigation.[75][76] In 2008, Apple introduced the App Store, a centralized storefront for purchasing new software for iPhone devices.[77][78] iOS can also integrate with Apple's desktop music program iTunes to sync media to a personal computer.[79][80] The dependency on a PC was removed with the introduction of iCloud on later versions of iOS, which provides synchronization of user data via internet servers between multiple devices.[81] The iPhone line's early dominance was credited with helping make Apple one of the world's most valuable publicly traded companies by 2011. However, the iPhone and iOS have generally been in second place in worldwide market share.[71][82][83]\\r\\nTizen is a Linux-based operating system for devices, including smartphones, tablets, in-vehicle infotainment (IVI) devices, smart TVs, laptops and smart cameras. Tizen is a project within the Linux Foundation and is governed by a Technical Steering Group (TSG) composed of Samsung and Intel among others. In April 2014, Samsung released the Samsung Gear 2 and the Gear 2 Neo, running Tizen.[84] The Samsung Z1 is the first smartphone produced by Samsung that runs Tizen; it was released in the Indian market on January 14, 2015.[85]\\r\\nThe Sailfish OS is based on the Linux kernel and Mer.[86] Additionally Sailfish OS includes a partially or completely proprietary multi-tasking user interface programmed by Jolla. This user interface differentiate Jolla smartphones from others.[87] Sailfish OS is intended to be a system made by many of the MeeGo team, which left Nokia to form Jolla, utilizing funding from Nokia's \\"Bridge\\" program which helps establish and support start-up companies formed by ex-Nokia employees.[88][89][90]\\r\\nIn 1999, RIM released its first BlackBerry devices, providing secure real-time push-email communications on wireless devices. Services such as BlackBerry Messenger provide the integration of all communications into a single inbox. In September 2012, RIM announced that the 200 millionth BlackBerry smartphone was shipped. As of September 2014, there were around 46 million active BlackBerry service subscribers.[91] In the early 2010s, RIM underwent a platform transition, changing its company name to BlackBerry Limited and releasing devices on a new platform named \\"BlackBerry 10\\".[92]\\r\\nWindows Mobile was based on the Windows CE kernel and first appeared as the Pocket PC 2000 operating system. Throughout its lifespan, the operating system was available in both touchscreen and non-touchscreen formats. It was supplied with a suite of applications developed with the Microsoft Windows API and was designed to have features and appearance somewhat similar to desktop versions of Windows. Third parties could develop software for Windows Mobile with no restrictions imposed by Microsoft. Software applications were eventually purchasable from Windows Marketplace for Mobile during the service's brief lifespan. Windows Mobile was eventually phased out in favor of Windows Phone OS.\\r\\nSymbian was originally developed by Psion as EPOC32. It was the world's most widely used smartphone operating system until Q4 2010, though the platform never gained popularity in the U.S., as it did in Europe and Asia. The first Symbian phone, the touchscreen Ericsson R380 Smartphone, was released in 2000,[93][94] and was the first device marketed as a \\"smartphone\\".[95] It combined a PDA with a mobile phone.[15] Variants of Symbian OS began to emerge, most notably Symbian UIQ, MOAP and S60, each supported by different manufacturers. With the creation of Symbian Foundation in 2008, Symbian OS was unified under one variant under the stewardship of Nokia. In February 2011, Nokia announced that it would replace Symbian with Windows Phone as the operating system on all of its future smartphones, with the platform being abandoned over the following few years.[96]\\r\\nFirefox OS was demonstrated by Mozilla in February 2012. It was designed to have a complete community-based alternative system for mobile devices, using open standards and HTML5 applications. The first commercially available Firefox OS phones were ZTE Open and Alcatel One Touch Fire. As of 2014, more companies had partnered with Mozilla including Panasonic (which was making a smart TV with Firefox OS) and Sony.[97] In December 2015, Mozilla announced that it would phase out development of Firefox OS for smartphones, and would reposition the project to focus on other forms of Internet-connected devices.[98]\\r\\nThe Bada operating system for smartphones was announced by Samsung in November 2009.[99][100] The first Bada-based phone was the Samsung Wave S8500, released in June 2010.[101][102] Samsung shipped 4.5 million phones running Bada in Q2 of 2011.[103] In 2013, Bada merged with a similar platform called Tizen.\\r\\nwebOS is a proprietary mobile operating system running on the Linux kernel, initially developed by Palm, which launched with the Palm Pre. After being acquired by HP, two phones (the Veer and the Pre 3) and a tablet (the TouchPad) running webOS were introduced in 2011. On August 18, 2011, HP announced that webOS hardware was to be discontinued[104] but would continue to support and update webOS software and develop the webOS ecosystem.[105] HP released webOS as open source under the name Open webOS, and plans to update it with additional features.[106] On February 25, 2013 HP announced the sale of WebOS to LG Electronics, who used the operating system for its current \\"smart\\" or Internet-connected TVs, but not smartphones. In January 2014, Qualcomm has announced that it has acquired technology patents from HP, which includes all the WebOS patents.[107]\\r\\nIn late 2001, Handspring launched the Springboard GSM phone module with limited success. In May 2002, Handspring released the Palm OS Treo 270 smartphone, which did not support Springboard, with both a touchscreen and a full keyboard. The Treo had wireless web browsing, email, calendar, a contact organizer and mobile third-party applications that could be downloaded or synced with a computer.[108] Handspring was purchased by Palm, Inc which released the Treo 600 and continued releasing Treo devices with a few Treo devices using Windows Mobile.\\r\\nMeeGo is an operating system created from the source code of Moblin (produced by Intel) and Maemo (produced by Nokia). Before that, Nokia used Maemo on some of its smartphones and internet tablets (such as Nokia N810 and N900). MeeGo was originally envisioned to power a variety of devices from netbooks, tablets to smartphones and smart TVs. However, the only smartphones which used MeeGo was the Nokia N9 and Nokia N950 (MeeGo v1.2 Harmattan). Following Nokia's decision to move to Windows Phone OS in 2011 and to cease MeeGo development, the Linux Foundation canceled MeeGo in September 2011 in favor of the development of Tizen.\\r\\nUbuntu Touch (also known as Ubuntu Phone) is a mobile version of the Ubuntu operating system developed by Canonical UK Ltd and Ubuntu Community.[109] It is designed primarily for touchscreen mobile devices such as smartphones and tablet computers.\\r\\nIn 2003, Motorola launched the first smartphone to use Linux, the A760 handset.[110] While the initial release was limited to a single high-end handset only available in the Asia-Pacific region, the maker's intention was to eventually use Linux on most of its handsets, including the lower-end models. Further models to use Linux such as the Motorola Ming A1200i in 2005 and several successors to the Ming line would be unveiled through 2010. In late 2009, Motorola released the Motorola Cliq,[111] the first of Motorola's smartphones to run the Linux-based Android operating system. Subsequently, Motorola stopped developing phones based on other Linux variants.\\r\\nWindows 10 Mobile (formerly known as Windows Phone) is from Microsoft. It is closed source and proprietary. It has the third largest installed base on smartphones behind Android and iOS.\\r\\nUnveiled on February 15, 2010, Windows Phone includes a user interface inspired by Microsoft's Metro Design Language. It is integrated with Microsoft services such as OneDrive and Office, Xbox Music, Xbox Video, Xbox Live games and Bing, but also integrates with many other non-Microsoft services such as Facebook and Google accounts. Windows Phone devices are made primarily by Microsoft Mobile/Nokia, and also by HTC and Samsung.\\r\\nIn January 2015, Microsoft announced that its Windows Phone brand will be phased out and replaced with Windows 10 Mobile, bringing tighter integration and unification with its PC counterpart Windows 10, and provide a platform for smartphones and tablets with screen sizes under 8 inches.\\r\\nWindows Mobile smartphone series has had poor adoption, that also led to a decrease in third-party applications, and some vendors ended their support for Windows Mobile altogether.[112][113] As of 2016, Windows 10 Mobile global market share dropped below 0.6%.[114]\\r\\nIn the early 2010s, BlackBerry Limited started making new devices on a new platform named \\"BlackBerry 10\\", which is based on their BlackBerry Tablet OS, to replace the BlackBerry OS.[92] In 2015, BlackBerry said there would be no new devices with BB10 but they will still support the OS for existing devices.[115] In 2016, BlackBerry Limited ceased making smartphones and licensed TCL Communication to manufacture them under the name BlackBerry Mobile. BlackBerry Mobile smartphones abandoned BlackBerry 10 in favor of the Android operating system, beginning with the 2017 BlackBerry KEYone.[116] The first BlackBerry phone to ship with Android, however, was BlackBerry Limited's Priv.\\r\\nThe introduction of Apple's App Store for the iPhone and iPod Touch in July 2008 popularized manufacturer-hosted online distribution for third-party applications (software and computer programs) focused on a single platform. There are a huge variety of apps, including video games, music products and business tools. Up until that point, smartphone application distribution depended on third-party sources providing applications for multiple platforms, such as GetJar, Handango, Handmark, and PocketGear. Following the success of the App Store, other smartphone manufacturers launched application stores, such as Google's Android Market (now Google Play Store) and RIM's BlackBerry App World in April 2009. In February 2014, 93% of mobile developers were targeting smartphones first for mobile app development.[117]\\r\\nSince 1996, smartphone shipments have had positive growth. In November 2011, 27% of all photographs created were taken with camera-equipped smartphones.[118] In September 2012, a study concluded that 4 out of 5 smartphone owners use the device to shop online.[119] Global smartphone sales surpassed the sales figures for feature phones in early 2013.[3] Worldwide shipments of smartphones topped 1 billion units in 2013, up 38% from 2012's 725 million, while comprising a 55% share of the mobile phone market in 2013, up from 42% in 2012.[120] In Q1 2016 for the first time the shipments dropped by 3 percent year on year. The situation was caused by the maturing China market.[121]\\r\\nIn 2011, Samsung had the highest shipment market share worldwide, followed by Apple. In 2013, Samsung had 31.3% market share, a slight increase from 30.3% in 2012, while Apple was at 15.3%, a decrease from 18.7% in 2012. Huawei, LG and Lenovo were at about 5% each, significantly better than 2012 figures, while others had about 40%, the same as the previous years figure. Only Apple lost market share, although their shipment volume still increased by 12.9 percent; the rest had significant increases in shipment volumes of 36 to 92 percent.[124] In Q1 2014, Samsung had a 31% share and Apple had 16%.[125] In Q4 2014, Apple had a 20.4% share and Samsung had 19.9%.[126] In Q2 2016, Samsung had a 22.3% share and Apple had 12.9%.[122] In Q1 2017, IDC reported that Samsung was first placed, with 80 million units, followed by Apple with 50.8 million, Huawei with 34.6 million, Oppo with 25.5 million and Vivo with 22.7 million.[127]\\r\\nSamsung's mobile business is half the size of Apple's, by revenue. Apple business has been increasing very rapidly over the past 4 years.[128]\\r\\nThe market has been dominated by the Android operating system since 2010. Android's market share (measured by units shipment) rose from 33.2% in Q4 2011 to 81.7% of the market in Q4 2016. Apple's market share oscillated between 18% and 12.5% during the same period. Windows Phone market share also oscillated between 1.5% and 0.3% during the same time frame. As of the end of Q4 2016, Android was the most popular operating system sold with new smartphones with an 81.7% market share, followed by iOS with 17.9%, Windows 10 Mobile with 0.3% and other OSes at 0.1%.[129]\\r\\nA 2012 University of Southern California study found that unprotected adolescent sexual activity was more common among owners of smartphones.[136] A study conducted by the Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute's (RPI) Lighting Research Center (LRC) concluded that smartphones, or any backlit devices, can seriously affect sleep cycles.[137] Some persons might become psychologically attached to smartphones resulting in anxiety when separated from the devices.[138] A \\"smombie\\" (a combination of \\"smartphone\\" and \\"zombie\\") is a walking person using a smartphone and not paying attention as they walk, possibly risking an accident in the process, an increasing social phenomenon.[139] The issue of slow-moving smartphone users led to the temporary creation of a \\"mobile lane\\" for walking in Chongqing, China.[140] The issue of distracted smartphone users led the city of Augsburg, Germany to embed pedestrian traffic lights in the pavement.[141]\\r\\nMobile phone use while drivingincluding talking on the phone, texting, playing media, web browsing, gaming, using mapping apps or operating other phone featuresis common but controversial, since it is widely considered dangerous due to what's known as distracted driving. Being distracted while operating a motor vehicle has been shown to increase the risk of accidents. In September 2010, the US National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) reported that 995 people were killed by drivers distracted by phones. In March 2011 a US insurance company, State Farm Insurance, announced the results of a study which showed 19% of drivers surveyed accessed the Internet on a smartphone while driving.[142] Many jurisdictions prohibit the use of mobile phones while driving. In Egypt, Israel, Japan, Portugal and Singapore, both handheld and hands-free calling on a mobile phone (which uses a speakerphone) is banned. In other countries including the UK and France and in many US states, only the use of calling on handheld phones is banned, while hands-free use is permitted.\\r\\nA 2011 study reported that over 90% of college students surveyed text (initiate, reply or read) while driving.[143] The scientific literature on the danger of driving while sending a text message from a mobile phone, or texting while driving, is limited. A simulation study at the University of Utah found a sixfold increase in distraction-related accidents when texting.[144] Due to the complexity of smartphones, this has introduced additional difficulties for law enforcement officials when attempting to distinguish one usage from another in drivers using their devices. This is more apparent in countries which ban both handheld and hands-free usage, rather than those which ban handheld use only, as officials cannot easily tell which function of the phone is being used simply by looking at the driver. This can lead to drivers being stopped for using their device illegally for a call when, in fact, they were using the device legally, for example, when using the phone's incorporated controls for car stereo, GPS or satnav.\\r\\nA 2010 study reviewed the incidence of phone use while cycling and its effects on behavior and safety.[145] In 2013 a national survey in the US reported the number of drivers who reported using their phones to access the Internet while driving had risen to nearly one of four.[146] A study conducted by the University of Vienna examined approaches for reducing inappropriate and problematic use of mobile phones, such as using phones while driving.[147]\\r\\nAccidents involving a driver being distracted by being in a call on a phone have begun to be prosecuted as negligence similar to speeding. In the United Kingdom, from 27 February 2007, motorists who are caught using a hand-held phone while driving will have three penalty points added to their license in addition to the fine of S60.[148] This increase was introduced to try to stem the increase in drivers ignoring the law.[149] Japan prohibits all use of phones while driving, including use of hands-free devices. New Zealand has banned handheld phone use since 1 November 2009. Many states in the United States have banned text messaging on phones while driving. Illinois became the 17th American state to enforce this law.[150] As of July 2010, 30 states had banned texting while driving, with Kentucky becoming the most recent addition on July 15.[151]\\r\\nPublic Health Law Research maintains a list of distracted driving laws in the United States. This database of laws provides a comprehensive view of the provisions of laws that restrict the use of mobile devices while driving for all 50 states and the District of Columbia between 1992, when first law was passed through December 1, 2010. The dataset contains information on 22 dichotomous, continuous or categorical variables including, for example, activities regulated (e.g., texting versus talking, hands-free versus handheld calls, web browsing, gaming), targeted populations, and exemptions.[152]\\r\\nA \\"patent war\\" between Samsung and Apple started when the latter claimed that the original Galaxy S Android phone copied the interface??and possibly the hardware??of Apple's iOS for the iPhone 3GS. There was also smartphone patents licensing and litigation involving Sony Mobile, Google, Apple Inc., Samsung, Microsoft, Nokia, Motorola, HTC, Huawei and ZTE, among others. The conflict is part of the wider \\"patent wars\\" between multinational technology and software corporations. To secure and increase market share, companies granted a patent can sue to prevent competitors from using the methods the patent covers. Since 2010 the number of lawsuits, counter-suits, and trade complaints based on patents and designs in the market for smartphones, and devices based on smartphone OSes such as Android and iOS, has increased significantly. Initial suits, countersuits, rulings, license agreements, and other major events began in 2009 as the smartphone market grew more rapidly.\\r\\nWith the rise in number of mobile medical apps in the market place, government regulatory agencies raised concerns on the safety of the use of such applications. These concerns were transformed into regulation initiatives worldwide with the aim of safeguarding users from untrusted medical advice.[153]\\r\\nSmartphone malware is easily distributed through an insecure app store.[154][155] Often malware is hidden in pirated versions of legitimate apps, which are then distributed through third-party app stores.[156][157] Malware risk also comes from what's known as an \\"update attack\\", where a legitimate application is later changed to include a malware component, which users then install when they are notified that the app has been updated.[158] As well, one out of three robberies in 2012 in the United States involved the theft of a mobile phone. An online petition has urged smartphone makers to install kill switches in their devices.[159] In 2014, Apple's \\"Find my iPhone\\" and Google's \\"Android Device Manager\\" can disable phones that have been lost/stolen. With BlackBerry Protect in OS version 10.3.2, devices can be rendered unrecoverable to even BlackBerry's own Operating System recovery tools if incorrectly authenticated or dissociated from their account.[160]\\r\\nUsing smartphones late at night can disturb sleep, due to the brightly lit screen affecting melatonin levels and sleep cycles. In an effort to alleviate these issues, several apps that change the color temperature of a screen to a warmer hue based on the time of day to reduce the amount of blue light generated have been developed for Android, while iOS 9.3 integrated similar, system-level functionality known as \\"Night Shift\\". Amazon released a feature known as \\"blue shade\\" in their Fire OS \\"Bellini\\" 5.0 and later. It has also been theorized that for some users, addicted use of their phones, especially before they go to bed, can result in \\"ego depletion\\". Many people also use their phones as alarm clocks, which can also lead to loss of sleep.[161][162][163][164][165]\\r\\n\\"Phablet\\", a portmanteau of the words phone and tablet, describes smartphones with larger screens.[166][167]\\r\\n\\"Superphone\\" is also used by some companies to market phones with unusually large screens and other expensive features.[168][169]\\r\\n\\"Ultra Premium\\" is a term used to identify a smartphone which has top of the line materials.[170]","input":"What is the first smart phone in the world?"},{"output":"Deerfield Beach, Florida","context":"Reality\\r\\n\\r\\nDr. K's Exotic Animal ER is a television series on the Nat Geo Wild network.

Typical white-collar crimes could include fraud, bribery, Ponzi schemes, insider trading, labor racketeering, embezzlement, cybercrime, copyright infringement, money laundering, identity theft, and forgery.[2] Lawyers can be specialized in white-collar crime.[3]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nModern criminology generally rejects a limitation of the term by reference, rather classifies the type of crime and the topic:\\r\\nThe types of crime committed are a function of what is available to the potential offender. Thus, those employed in relatively unskilled environments and living in inner-city areas have fewer opportunities to exploit than those who work in situations where large financial transactions occur and live in areas where there is relative prosperity.[6] Blue-collar crime tends to be more obvious and thus attracts more active police attention such as vandalism or shoplifting. In contrast, white-collar employees can incorporate legitimate and criminal behavior, thus making themselves less obvious when committing the crime. Therefore, blue-collar crime will more often use physical force, whereas in the corporate world, the identification of a victim is less obvious and the issue of reporting is complicated by a culture of commercial confidentiality to protect shareholder value. It is estimated that a great deal of white-collar crime is undetected or, if detected, it is not reported.\\r\\nCorporate crime deals with the company as a whole. The crime benefits the investors or the individuals who are in high positions in the company or corporation. The relationship white-collar crime has with corporate crime is that they are similar because they both are involved within the business world. Their difference is that white-collar crime benefits the individual involved, and corporate crime benefits the company or the corporation.\\r\\nOne well-known insider trading case in the United States is the ImClone stock trading case. In December 2001, top-level executives sold their shares in ImClone Systems, a pharmaceutical company that manufactured an anti-cancer drug. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission investigated numerous top-level executives, as well as Martha Stewart, a friend of ImClone's former chief executive who had also sold her shares at the same time. The SEC reached a settlement in 2005.[7][8]\\r\\nThe negotiation of agreements between a state and a corporation will be at a relatively senior level on both sides, this is almost exclusively a white-collar \\"situation\\" which offers the opportunity for crime. Although law enforcement claims to have prioritized white-collar crime,[9] evidence shows that it continues to be a low priority.[10]\\r\\nWhen senior levels of a corporation engage in criminal activity using the company this is sometimes called control fraud.\\r\\nOrganized transnational crime is organized criminal activity that takes place across national jurisdictions, and with advances in transportation and information technology, law enforcement officials and policymakers have needed to respond to this form of crime on a global scale. Some examples include human trafficking, money laundering, drug smuggling, illegal arms dealing, terrorism, and cybercrime. Although it is impossible to precisely gauge transnational crime, the Millennium Project, an international think tank, assembled statistics on several aspects of transnational crime in 2009:[7]\\r\\nIndividuals may commit crime during employment or unemployment. The two most common forms are theft and fraud. Theft can be of varying degrees, from a pencil to furnishings to a car. Insider trading, the trading of stock by someone with access to publicly unavailable information, is a type of fraud.[7]\\r\\nIn the modern world, there are a lot of nations which divide the crimes into some laws. \\"Crimes Related to Inducement of Foreign Aggression\\" is the crime of communicating with aliens secretly to cause foreign aggression or menace. \\"Crimes Related to Foreign Aggression\\" is the treason of cooperating with foreign aggression positively regardless of the national inside and outside. \\"Crimes Related to Insurrection\\" is the internal treason. Depending on a country, conspiracy is added to these.\\r\\nIn the United States, sentences for white-collar crimes may include a combination of imprisonment, fines, restitution, community service, disgorgement, probation, or other alternative punishment.[11][12] These punishments grew harsher after the Jeffrey Skilling and Enron scandal, when the SarbanesÿOxley Act of 2002 was passed by the United States Congress and signed into law by President George W. Bush, defining new crimes and increasing the penalties for crimes such as mail and wire fraud. In other countries, such as China, white-collar criminals can be given the death penalty[13], yet some countries have a maximum of 10-25 years imprisonment, Certain countries like Canada consider the relationship between the parties to be a significant feature on sentence when there is a breach of trust component involved.[14] Questions about sentencing disparity in white-collar crime continue to be debated. [15] Although, white-collar crime poses a serious threat in today's society, it becomes extremely difficult to identify. The FBI, concerned with identifying this type of offense, collects annual statistical information on only three categories: fraud, counterfeiting/forgery, and embezzlement. All other types of white-collar crime are listed in an, \\"miscellaneous\\" category.[16]\\r\\nFounder and former chairmanand chief executive officer of HealthSouth Corporation,\\r\\nformer chairman and chief executive officer of MedPartners, Inc.","input":"What is an example of a white collar crime?"},{"output":"522,419 acres","context":"Great Smoky Mountains National Park is a United States National Park and UNESCO World Heritage Site that straddles the ridgeline of the Great Smoky Mountains, part of the Blue Ridge Mountains, which are a division of the larger Appalachian Mountain chain. The border between Tennessee and North Carolina runs northeast to southwest through the centerline of the park. It is the most visited national park in the United States[4] with over 11.3 million recreational visitors in 2016.[2] On its route from Maine to Georgia, the Appalachian Trail also passes through the center of the park. The park was chartered by the United States Congress in 1934 and officially dedicated by President Franklin Delano Roosevelt in 1940.[5]\\r\\nThe park encompasses 522,419 acres (816.28?sq?mi; 211,415.47?ha; 2,114.15?km2),[1] making it one of the largest protected areas in the eastern United States. The main park entrances are located along U.S. Highway 441 (Newfound Gap Road) at the towns of Gatlinburg, Tennessee, and Cherokee, North Carolina. It was the first national park whose land and other costs were paid for in part with federal funds; previous parks were funded wholly with state money or private funds.[6] Due to the 2016 Great Smoky Mountains wildfires, the Park was under evacuation orders, along with some towns and cities located nearby.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nBefore the arrival of European settlers, the region was part of the homeland of the Cherokees. Frontiers people began settling the land in the 18th and early 19th century. In 1830 President Andrew Jackson signed the Indian Removal Act, beginning the process that eventually resulted in the forced removal of all Indian tribes east of the Mississippi River to what is now Oklahoma. Many of the Cherokee left, but some, led by renegade warrior Tsali, hid out in the area that is now the Great Smoky Mountains National Park. Some of their descendants now live in the Qualla Boundary to the south of the park.\\r\\nAs white settlers arrived, logging grew as a major industry in the mountains, and a rail line, the Little River Railroad, was constructed in the late-19th Century to haul timber out of the remote regions of the area. Cut-and-run-style clearcutting was destroying the natural beauty of the area, so visitors and locals banded together to raise money for preservation of the land. The U.S. National Park Service wanted a park in the eastern United States, but did not have much money to establish one. Though Congress had authorized the park in 1926, there was no nucleus of federally owned land around which to build a park. John D. Rockefeller, Jr., contributed $5 million, the U.S. government added $2 million, and private citizens from Tennessee and North Carolina pitched in to assemble the land for the park, piece by piece. Slowly, mountain homesteaders, miners, and loggers were evicted from the land. Farms and timbering operations were abolished to establish the protected areas of the park. Travel writer Horace Kephart, for whom Mount Kephart was named, and photographer George Masa were instrumental in fostering the development of the park.[6] Former Governor Ben W. Hooper of Tennessee was the principal land purchasing agent for the park,[7] which was officially established on 15 June 1934. During the Great Depression, the Civilian Conservation Corps, the Works Progress Administration, and other federal organizations made trails, fire watchtowers, and other infrastructure improvements to the park and Smoky Mountains.\\r\\nIt was also a site for filming of parts of Disney's hit 1950s TV series, Davy Crockett, King of the Wild Frontier.\\r\\nThis park was designated an International Biosphere Reserve in 1976, was certified as a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1983, and became a part of the Southern Appalachian Biosphere Reserve in 1988.[8]\\r\\nA 75th anniversary re-dedication ceremony was held on 2 September 2009. Among those in attendance were all four US Senators, the three US Representatives whose districts include the park, the governors of both states, and Secretary of the Interior Ken Salazar. Tennessee native, singer, and actress Dolly Parton also attended and performed.[9]\\r\\nThe majority of rocks in the Great Smoky Mountains National Park are Late Precambrian rocks that are part of the Ocoee Supergroup. This group consists of metamorphosed sandstones, phyllites, schists, and slate. Early Precambrian rocks are not only the oldest rocks in the park but also the dominant rock type in sites such as the Raven Fork Valley and upper Tuckasegee River between Cherokee and Bryson City. They primarily consist of metamorphic gneiss, granite, and schist. Cambrian sedimentary rocks can be found among the bottom of the Foothills to the northwest and in limestone coves such as Cades Cove.[10] One of the most visited attractions in the mountains is Cades Cove which is a window or an area where older rocks made out of sandstone surround the valley floor of younger rocks made out of limestone.\\r\\nThe oldest rocks in the Smokies are the Precambrian gneiss and schists which were formed over a billion years ago from the accumulation of marine sediments and igneous rock. In the Late Precambrian, the primordial ocean expanded and the more recent Ocoee Supergroup rocks formed from the accumulation of eroding land mass onto the continental shelf. In the Paleozoic Era, the ocean deposited a thick layer of marine sediments which left behind sedimentary rock. During the Ordovician Period, the collision of the North American and African tectonic plates initiated the Alleghenian orogeny that created the Appalachian range. During the Mesozoic Era rapid erosion of softer sedimentary rocks re-exposed the older Ocoee Supergroup formations.[11]\\r\\nElevations in the park range from 876 feet (267?m) at the mouth of Abrams Creek to 6,643 feet (2,025?m) at the summit of Clingmans Dome. Within the park a total of sixteen mountains reach higher than 6,000 feet (1,830?m).[12]\\r\\nThe wide range of elevations mimics the latitudinal changes found throughout the entire eastern United States. Indeed, ascending the mountains is comparable to a trip from Tennessee to Canada. Plants and animals common in the country's Northeast have found suitable ecological niches in the park's higher elevations, while southern species find homes in the balmier lower reaches.\\r\\nDuring the most recent ice age, the northeast-to-southwest orientation of the Appalachian mountains allowed species to migrate southward along the slopes rather than finding the mountains to be a barrier. As climate warms, many northern species are now retreating upward along the slopes and withdrawing northward,[13] while southern species are expanding.[14]\\r\\nThe park normally has very high humidity and precipitation, averaging from 55 inches (1,400?mm) per year in the valleys to 85 inches (2,200?mm) per year on the peaks. This is more annual rainfall than anywhere in the United States outside the Pacific Northwest and parts of Alaska and Hawaii. It is also generally cooler than the lower elevations below, and most of the park has a humid continental climate more comparable to locations much farther north, as opposed to the humid subtropical climate in the lowlands. The park is almost 95 percent forested, and almost 36 percent of it, 187,000 acres (76,000?ha), is estimated by the Park Service to be old growth forest with many trees that predate European settlement of the area.[15] It is one of the largest blocks of deciduous, temperate, old growth forest in North America.\\r\\nThe variety of elevations, the abundant rainfall, and the presence of old growth forests give the park an unusual richness of biota. About 10,000 species of plants and animals are known to live in the park, and estimates as high as an additional 90,000 undocumented species may also be present.\\r\\nPark officials count more than 200 species of birds, 50 species of fish, 39 species of reptiles, and 43 species of amphibians, including many lungless salamanders. The park has a noteworthy black bear population, numbering about 1,500.[16] An experimental re-introduction of elk (wapiti) into the park began in 2001.\\r\\nIt is also home to species of mammals such as the raccoon, bobcat, two species of fox, river otter, woodchuck, beaver, two species of squirrel, opossum, coyote, white-tailed deer, chipmunk, two species of skunk, and various species of bats.\\r\\nOver 100 species of trees grow in the park. The lower region forests are dominated by deciduous leafy trees. At higher altitudes, deciduous forests give way to coniferous trees like Fraser fir. In addition, the park has over 1,400 flowering plant species and over 4,000 species of non-flowering plants.\\r\\nThe Great Smoky Mountains National Park is a major tourist attraction in the region. Over 11.3 million recreational visitors (tourists) and an additional 11 million non-recreational visitors traveled to, or through, the park in 2016.[17] The recreational figure represents nearly twice as many tourists as the Grand Canyon which received nearly 6 million visitors the same year, making it the second most visited national park in the country.[2] Surrounding towns, notably Gatlinburg, Pigeon Forge, Sevierville, and Townsend, Tennessee, and Cherokee, Sylva, Maggie Valley, and Bryson City, North Carolina receive a significant portion of their income from tourism associated with the park.\\r\\nThe two main visitors' centers inside the park are Sugarlands Visitors' Center near the Gatlinburg entrance to the park and Oconaluftee Visitor Center near Cherokee, North Carolina at the eastern entrance to the park. These ranger stations provide exhibits on wildlife, geology, and the history of the park. They also sell books, maps, and souvenirs.\\r\\nU.S. Highway 441 (known in the park as Newfound Gap Road) bisects the park, providing automobile access to many trailheads and overlooks, most notably that of Newfound Gap. At an elevation of 5,048 feet (1,539?m), it is the lowest gap in the mountains and is situated near the center of the park, on the Tennessee/North Carolina state line, halfway between the border towns of Gatlinburg and Cherokee. It was here that in 1940, from the Rockefeller Memorial, Franklin Delano Roosevelt dedicated the national park. On clear days Newfound Gap offers arguably the most spectacular scenes accessible via highway in the park.\\r\\nThe park has a number of historical attractions. The most well-preserved of these (and most popular) is Cades Cove, a valley with a number of preserved historic buildings including log cabins, barns, and churches. Cades Cove is the single most frequented destination in the national park. Self-guided automobile and bicycle tours offer the many sightseers a glimpse into the way of life of old-time southern Appalachia. Other historical areas within the park include Roaring Fork, Cataloochee, Elkmont, and the Mountain Farm Museum and Mingus Mill at Oconaluftee.\\r\\nThere are 850 miles (1,370?km) of trails and unpaved roads in the park for hiking, including seventy miles of the Appalachian Trail.[18] Mount Le Conte is one of the most frequented destinations in the park. Its elevation is 6,593 feet (2,010?m)  the third highest summit in the park and, measured from its base to its highest peak, the tallest mountain east of the Mississippi River. Alum Cave Trail is the most heavily used of the five paths en route to the summit. It provides many scenic overlooks and unique natural attractions such as Alum Cave Bluffs and Arch Rock. Hikers may spend a night at the LeConte Lodge, located near the summit, which provides cabins and rooms for rent (except during the winter season). Accessible solely by trail, it is the only private lodging available inside the park.\\r\\nAnother popular hiking trail led to the pinnacle of the Chimney Tops, so named because of its unique dual-humped peaktops. This short but strenuous trek rewarded nature enthusiasts with a spectacular panorama of the surrounding mountain peaks. It was the flashpoint for the 2016 wildfires and therefore sustained extensive damage, evident still today in clearly visible burn scars. The trail and the peak have been closed to tourists ever since.\\r\\nBoth the Laurel Falls and Clingman's Dome trails offer relatively easy, short, paved paths to their respective destinations. The Laurel Falls Trail leads to a powerful 80-foot (24?m) waterfall, and the Clingman's Dome Trail takes visitors on an uphill climb to a fifty-foot observation deck, which on a clear day offers views for many miles over the Tennessee, North Carolina, and Georgia mountains.\\r\\nIn addition to day hiking, the national park offers opportunities for backpacking and camping. Camping is allowed only in designated camping areas and shelters. Most of the park's trail shelters are located along the Appalachian Trail or a short distance away on side trails. In addition to the Appalachian Trail shelters used mostly for extended backpacking trips there are three shelters in the park that are not located on the Appalachian Trail.\\r\\nDesignated backcountry campsites are scattered throughout the park. A permit, available at ranger stations and via the Park website, is required for all backcountry camping. Additionally, reservations are required for all of the shelters and backcountry campsites. A maximum stay of one night, in the case of shelters, or three nights, in the case of campsites, may limit the traveler's itinerary.\\r\\nAfter hiking and simple sightseeing, fishing (especially fly fishing) is the most popular activity in the national park. The park's waters have long had a reputation for healthy trout activity as well as challenging fishing terrain. Brook trout are native to the waters, while both brown and rainbow were introduced to the area. Partially due to the fact of recent droughts killing off the native fish, there are strict regulations regarding how fishing may be conducted. Horseback riding (offered by the national park and on limited trails), bicycling (available for rent in Cades Cove) and water tubing are all also practiced within the park.\\r\\nThe park service maintains four historic districts and one archaeological district within park boundaries, as well as nine individual listings on the National Register of Historic Places. Notable structures not listed include the Mountain Farm Museum buildings at Oconaluftee and buildings in the Cataloochee area.

Custodio [note 1] (born 1953) is a former United States Air Force officer who became the first female Hispanic U.S. military pilot. She was the first Hispanic woman to complete U.S. Air Force military pilot training. Upon retiring from the military, she became one of the first female Hispanic commercial airline captains.[1]\\r\\n\\r\\nCustodio was born in San Juan, Puerto Rico. Her father, a sergeant in the United States Army, was often stationed in various countries where the United States has its military installations. Custodio and the rest of the family would accompany him on his overseas assignments. Custodio began her primary education in Taiwan. She also attended schools in New Jersey, Iran and  Paraguay.[1]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe family returned to Puerto Rico when she was 15 years old. She graduated high school at age 16, and was immediately accepted into the University of Puerto Rico. Custodio's father, and all the traveling she did at a young age, were key factors in her choice of career - she decided to join the military. While in college she attempted to join the universitys ROTC (Reserve Officer Training Corps), but at the time only men were admitted into the program.[1]\\r\\n\\r\\nCustodio earned a Bachelor of Arts degree from the University of Puerto Rico and worked for various industries before landing a job in the accounting department of Prinair (Puerto Rico International Airlines). There she met Edwin Custodio, with whom she would eventually have two children. She later worked for the US Department of Defense (DoD) in Panama. With the support of her husband, she presented herself before Headquarters, Air Force Military Personnel Center (AFMPC) to apply for the United States Air Force Officer Training School. Upon admission, Custodio was accepted as a pilot candidate to become a United States Air Force pilot.[1]\\r\\n\\r\\nShe entered the Flight Screening Pilot Officer Training School in January 1980.  After successful completion of Flight Screening she entered Officer Training School and was commissioned a Second Lieutenant. She qualified for Undergraduate Pilot Training (UPT) at Laughlin Air Force Base in Texas and graduated the following year, thus becoming the first Latina to complete the U.S. Air Force military pilot training.[1]\\r\\n\\r\\nHer first military assignment was that of instructor pilot at Laughlin AFB. She was the first female to become a Northrop T-38 Talon (T-38) UPT flight instructor at that base.[1] The T-38 Talon is the Air Forces two-seat, supersonic jet trainer.  On one occasion a bird struck the engine of her plane in bad weather while she was in flight. She was able to overcome the emergency and safely land her plane. Because of this she was recognized by the Air Force, and awarded the HQ AETC Aviation Safety Award for superior airmanship.[2]\\r\\n\\r\\nCustodio was later assigned to Randolph Air Force Base where she was also the first female T-38 Instructor Pilot.[1] During her career she also served as Pilot Instructor Training; T-41 Flight Screening - Operations Officer and Check Pilot.\\r\\n\\r\\nCustodio retired from the Air Force with the rank of lieutenant colonel in October 2003, after serving in the military for 23 years and 10 months. Her last assignment as an Air Force Reserve officer was that of accountability and readiness the Directorate of Personnel, HQ USAF.[3]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn June 1988, while she was serving in the US Air Force Reserve, she was hired by American Airlines as a commercial pilot. Custodio became one of the first Latina commercial airline captains.[4] During her years with American, she flew various types of aircraft. She piloted the Boeing 727, Fokker 100, Boeing 757 and Boeing 767 to various countries in Europe, the Caribbean, Central America and South America. She also flew to Mexico, Canada and to various cities in the United States.

Removal actions (voluntary, reluctantly or forcibly) occurred to other American Indian groups in the American South, North, Midwest, Southwest, and the Plains regions. The Chickasaw, Choctaw, Creek and (Muskogee) were removed reluctantly. The Seminole in Florida responded to removal by the United States Army for decades (1817ÿ1850) with guerrilla warfare, part of the intermittent Native American Wars that lasted from 1540 to 1924. Some Seminole remained in their Florida home country, while others were transported to Native American Territory in shackles.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe phrase \\"Trail of Tears\\" is used to refer to similar events endured by other Indian groups, especially among the \\"Five Civilized Tribes\\". The phrase originated as a description of the voluntary removal of the Choctaw Nation in 1831.[1]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the fall of 1835, a census was taken by civilian officials of the US War Department to enumerate Cherokee residing in Alabama, Georgia, North Carolina, and Tennessee, with a count of 16,542 Cherokee, 201 inter-married whites, and 1592 slaves (total: 18,335 people). Tensions between the indigenous Cherokee and white settlers developed over ownership of the land rich in gold deposits and fertile soil that could be used for farming cotton.[2] In October of that year, Principal Chief John Ross and an Eastern visitor, John Howard Payne, were kidnapped from Ross' Tennessee home by a renegade group of the Georgia militia. Released, Ross and a delegation of tribal leaders traveled to Washington, DC to protest this high-handed action, and to lobby against the removal policy of President Andrew Jackson. In an effort to reach an agreeable compromise Principal Chief John Ross met with President Jackson to discuss the possibility that Cherokee might give up some of their land for money and land to the west of the Mississippi River. Jackson turned this deal down resulting in Ross suggesting $20 million as a base for negotiating the sale of the land and eventually agreeing to let the US Senate decide the sale price.[3]\\r\\n\\r\\nJohn Ross estimated the value of Cherokee Land at $7.23 million. A conservative estimate by Matthew T. Gregg in 2009 puts Cherokee's land value for the 1838 market at $7,055,469.70, more than $2 million over the $5 million the senate agreed to pay.[3] In this power vacuum, U.S. Agent John F. Schermerhorn gathered a group of dissident Cherokee in the home of Elias Boudinot at the tribal capital, New Echota, Georgia. There on December 29, 1835, this rump group signed the unauthorized Treaty of New Echota,[4] which exchanged Cherokee land in the East for lands west of the Mississippi River in Indian Territory. This agreement was never accepted by the elected tribal leadership or a majority of the Cherokee people.[5] In February 1836, two councils convened at Red Clay, Tennessee and at Valley Town, North Carolina (now Murphy, North Carolina) and produced two lists totaling some 13,000 names written in the Sequoyah writing script of Cherokee opposed to the Treaty. The lists were dispatched to Washington, DC and presented by Chief Ross to Congress. Nevertheless, a slightly modified version of the treaty was ratified by the U.S. Senate by a single vote on May 23, 1836, and signed into law by President Jackson. The treaty provided a grace period until May 1838 for the tribe to voluntarily remove themselves to Indian Territory.\\r\\n\\r\\nUntil widespread use of the cotton gin, short-staple cotton had been such an arduous crop to grow and process because of the time-consuming process of removing the sticky seeds from each of the individual boles of cotton. This process took so long that it was nearly unprofitable to grow cotton. The increased ease of cotton production due to access to the Cotton Gin, invented in 1793 by Eli Whitney, which used teeth to comb through the fluffy fibers and remove all of the seeds in a much more efficient manner, led to a major rise in the production of cotton in the south near North Carolina, Tennessee and Georgia. Production increased from 750,000 bales in 1830 to 2.85 million bales in 1850, earning the south the nickname King Cotton for its success.[6][7] Matthew T. Gregg writes that \\"According to the 1835 Cherokee census enumerators, 1,707,900 acres in the Cherokee Nation in Georgia were tillable.\\"[8] This land was valuable farming land, with the ideal climate and the necessary 200 frost-free days for growing cotton, and would have been crucial in supporting the cotton industry's monumental growth, as would have increased ease of transportation due to railroads. The Cherokee Indians typically grew small family farms and only planted what was needed to survive alongside hunting and gathering.[9] Some, however, heeded Silas Dinsmoor's advice. They took advantage of the growing demand for cotton and began to farm it themselves, asking for cotton cards, cotton gins, and spinning wheels from the United States Government.[10] As immigration increased rapidly throughout the 1820s and 1830s, and by 1850 approximately 2.6 million people immigrated to the United States,[11] the government saw that the land could be used for more than just small family crops and could provide a source of income for the farmers immigrating to the south and needing farmable land. The Cherokees that did farm cotton in excess for selling became a threat to the settlers that were hoping to capitalize on the cotton industry by taking away not only valuable farm land but also adding more cotton to the market which could reduce the demand and the price, thus prompting the pursuit of a removal treaty.\\r\\n\\r\\nThese tensions between Georgia's and the Cherokee Nation were brought to a crisis by the discovery of gold near Dahlonega, Georgia, in 1828, resulting in the Georgia Gold Rush, the first gold rush in U.S. history. Hopeful gold speculators began trespassing on Cherokee lands, and pressure began to mount on the Georgia government to fulfill the promises of the Compact of 1802.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen Georgia moved to extend state laws over Cherokee tribal lands in 1830, the matter went to the U.S. Supreme Court. In Cherokee Nation v. Georgia (1831), the Marshall court ruled that the Cherokee were not a sovereign and independent nation, and therefore refused to hear the case. However, in Worcester v. State of Georgia (1832), the Court ruled that Georgia could not impose laws in Cherokee territory, since only the national government  not state governments  had authority in Indian affairs.\\r\\n\\r\\nPresident Andrew Jackson has often been quoted as defying the Supreme Court with the words, \\"John Marshall has made his decision; now let him enforce it!\\" Jackson probably never said this, but he was fully committed to the policy. He had no desire to use the power of the national government to protect the Cherokee from Georgia, since he was already entangled with states' rights issues in what became known as the nullification crisis. With the Indian Removal Act of 1830, the U.S. Congress had given Jackson authority to negotiate removal treaties, exchanging Indian land in the East for land west of the Mississippi River. Jackson used the dispute with Georgia to put pressure on the Cherokee to sign a removal treaty.[12]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe rapidly expanding population of the United States early in the 19th century created tensions with Native American tribes located within the borders of the various states. While state governments did not want independent Indian enclaves within state boundaries, Indian tribes did not want to relocate or to give up their distinct identities.\\r\\n\\r\\nWith the Compact of 1802, the state of Georgia relinquished to the national government its western land claims (which became the states of Alabama and Mississippi). In exchange, the national government promised to eventually conduct treaties to relocate those Indian tribes living within Georgia, thus giving Georgia control of all land within its borders.\\r\\n\\r\\nHowever, the Cherokee, whose ancestral tribal lands overlapped the boundaries of Georgia, Tennessee, North Carolina, and Alabama, declined to move. They established a capital in 1825 at New Echota (near present-day Calhoun, Georgia). Furthermore, led by principal Chief John Ross and Major Ridge, the speaker of the Cherokee National Council, the Cherokee adopted a written constitution on 26 July 1827, declaring the Cherokee Nation to be a sovereign and independent nation.\\r\\n\\r\\nWith this constitution, an election was held for Principal Chief. John Ross won the first election and became the leader and representative of the tribe. In 1828, the Cherokee government established a law that addressed the issue of removal. The law stated that anyone who signed an agreement with the United States that addressed the Cherokee land without consent of the Cherokee government would be considered treasonous and could be punishable by death.[13]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Cherokee land that was lost proved to be extremely valuable. Upon these lands were the alignments for the future rights-of-way for rail and road communications between the eastern Piedmont slopes of the Appalachian Mountains, the Ohio River in Kentucky and the Tennessee River Valley at Chattanooga. This location is still a strategic economic asset and is the basis for the tremendous success of Atlanta, Georgia, as a regional transportation and logistics center. Georgia's appropriation of these lands from the Cherokee kept the wealth out of the hands of the Cherokee Nation.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Cherokee lands in Georgia were settled upon by the Cherokee for the simple reason that they were and still are the shortest and most easily traversed route between the only fresh water sourced settlement location at the southeastern tip of the Appalachian range (the Chattahoochee River), and the natural passes, ridges, and valleys which lead to the Tennessee River at what is today, Chattanooga.[citation needed] From Chattanooga there was and is the potential for a year-round water transport to St. Louis and the west (via the Ohio and Mississippi rivers), or to as far east as Pittsburgh, PA.\\r\\n\\r\\nWith the landslide reelection of Andrew Jackson in 1832, some of the most strident Cherokee opponents of removal began to rethink their positions. Led by Major Ridge, his son John Ridge, and nephews Elias Boudinot and Stand Watie, they became known as the \\"Ridge Party\\", or the \\"Treaty Party\\". The Ridge Party believed that it was in the best interest of the Cherokee to get favorable terms from the U.S. government, before white squatters, state governments, and violence made matters worse. John Ridge began unauthorized talks with the Jackson administration in the late 1820s. Meanwhile, in anticipation of the Cherokee removal, the state of Georgia began holding lotteries in order to divide up the Cherokee tribal lands among white Georgians.\\r\\n\\r\\nHowever, Principal Chief John Ross and the majority of the Cherokee people remained adamantly opposed to removal. Political maneuvering began: Chief Ross canceled the tribal elections in 1832, the Council threatened to impeach the Ridges, and a prominent member of the Treaty Party (John Walker, Jr.) was murdered. The Ridges responded by eventually forming their own council, representing only a fraction of the Cherokee people. This split the Cherokee Nation into two factions: those following Ross, known as the National Party, and those of the Treaty Party, who elected \\r\\nWilliam A. Hicks, who had briefly succeeded his brother Charles R. Hicks as Principal Chief of the Cherokee Nation to act as titular leader of the pro-Treaty faction, with former National Council clerk Alexander McCoy as his assistant.\\r\\n\\r\\nJohn Ross states in his letter to congress, \\"By the stipulations of this instrument, we are despoiled of our private possessions, the indefeasible property of individuals. We are stripped of every attribute of freedom and eligibility for legal self-defence. Our property may be plundered before our eyes; violence may be committed on our persons; even our lives may be taken away, and there is none to regard our complaints. We are denationalized; we are disfranchised. We are deprived of membership in the human family! We have neither land nor home, nor resting place that can be called our own. And this is effected by the provisions of a compact which assumes the venerated, the sacred appellation of treaty. We are overwhelmed! Our hearts are sickened, our utterance is paralyzed, when we reflect on the condition in which we are placed, by the audacious practices of unprincipled men, who have managed their stratagems with so much dexterity as to impose on the Government of the United States, in the face of our earnest, solemn, and reiterated protestations.\\"\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1835, Jackson appointed Reverend John F. Schermerhorn as a treaty commissioner. The U.S. government proposed to pay the Cherokee Nation US$4.5 million (among other considerations) to remove themselves. These terms were rejected in October 1835 by the Cherokee Nation Council meeting at Red Clay. Chief Ross, attempting to bridge the gap between his administration and the Ridge Party, traveled to Washington with a party that included John Ridge and Stand Watie to open new negotiations, but they were turned away and told to deal with Schermerhorn.\\r\\n\\r\\nMeanwhile, Schermerhorn organized a meeting with the pro-removal council members at New Echota, Georgia. Only five hundred Cherokee (out of thousands) responded to the summons, and, on December 30, 1835, twenty-one proponents of Cherokee removal (Major Ridge, Elias Boudinot, James Foster, Testaesky, Charles Moore, George Chambers, Tahyeske, Archilla Smith, Andrew Ross (younger brother of Chief John Ross), William Lassley, Caetehee, Tegaheske, Robert Rogers, John Gunter, John A. Bell, Charles Foreman, William Rogers, George W. Adair, James Starr, and Jesse Halfbreed), signed or left \\"X\\" marks on the Treaty of New Echota after those present voted unanimously for its approval. John Ridge and Stand Watie signed the treaty when it was brought to Washington. Chief Ross, as expected, refused.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis treaty gave up all the Cherokee land east of the Mississippi in return for five million dollars to be disbursed on a per capita basis, an additional half-million dollars for educational funds, title in perpetuity to an amount of land in Indian Territory equal to that given up, and full compensation for all property left in the East. There was also a clause in the treaty as signed allowing Cherokee who so desired to remain and become citizens of the states in which they resided on 160 acres (0.65?km2) of land, but that was later stricken out by President Jackson.\\r\\n\\r\\nDespite the protests by the Cherokee National Council and principal Chief Ross that the document was a fraud, Congress ratified the treaty on May 23, 1836, by just one vote.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe process of Cherokee removal took place in three stages. It began with the voluntary removal of those in favor of the treaty, who were willing to accept government support and move west on their own in the two years after the signing of the Treaty of New Echota in 1835. Most of the Cherokee, including Chief John Ross, were outraged and unwilling to move, and they reacted with opposition. They did not believe the government would take any action against them if they elected to stay. However, the U.S. army was sent in, and the forced removal stage began. The Cherokee were herded violently into internment camps, where they were kept for the summer of 1838. The actual transportation west was delayed by intense heat and drought, but in the fall, the Cherokee reluctantly agreed to transport themselves west under the supervision of Chief Ross in the reluctant removal stage.[14][15]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Treaty provided a two-year grace period for Cherokee to willingly emigrate to Indian Territory. However, President Andrew Jackson dispatched General John E. Wool to begin the process of rounding up all those who would accept government provisions and prepare them for removal. Upon arrival, the staunch opposition to the treaty was evident to General Wool as the provisions were rejected by nearly all that he came in contact with, and it seemed that no one would voluntarily remove themselves. Due to the staunch opposition, preparations did not begin for several months, which greatly frustrated General Wool, who reported that the Indians were \\"almost universally opposed to the treaty.\\"[16] During this time, efforts were also being made by pro-removal advocates within the Cherokee to persuade the rest of the people to accept government subsistence and therefore give in to the inevitable. The treaty party called a meeting of the Cherokee on September 12, 1836 to do just that, but the meeting was canceled due to John Ross's subsequent call for another meeting that opposed the goals of the first in every way. Ross urged the people to continue to reject any government handout, stressing that the acceptance of any such gift also meant the acceptance of the treaty terms. Seeing that all efforts to sway their brethren were fruitless, a number of Cherokee (mostly members of the Ridge faction) ceased their delay and accepted government funds for subsistence and transportation. An approximate total of 10,000 Cherokee voluntarily removed themselves to the west, leaving around 1,000 of their brethren behind, who continued their opposition. Many travelled as individuals or families, but there were several organized groups:\\r\\n\\r\\nThere are muster rolls for groups # 1, 3 ÿ 6 and daily journals of conductors for groups # 2 and 5 among records of the Bureau of Indian Affairs in the National Archives. Despite the government blandishments, only a few hundred volunteered to accept the Treaty terms for Removal.\\r\\n\\r\\nMany white Americans were outraged by the dubious legality of the treaty and called on the government not to force the Cherokee to move. For example, on April 23, 1838, Ralph Waldo Emerson wrote a letter to Jackson's successor, President Martin Van Buren, urging him not to inflict \\"so vast an outrage upon the Cherokee Nation.\\"[17]\\r\\n\\r\\nNevertheless, as the May 23, 1838, deadline for voluntary removal approached, President Van Buren assigned General Winfield Scott to head the forcible removal operation. He arrived at New Echota on May 17, 1838, in command of U.S. Army and state militia totalling about 7,000 soldiers. Scott discouraged mistreatment of the Native Americans, ordering his troops to \\"show every possible kindness to the Cherokee and to arrest any soldier who inflicted a wanton injury or insult on any Cherokee man, woman, or child.\\"[18] They began rounding up Cherokee in Georgia on May 26, 1838; ten days later, operations began in Tennessee, North Carolina, and Alabama. Men, women, and children were removed at gunpoint from their homes over three weeks and gathered together in concentration camps, often with very few of their possessions. About 1,000 Cherokee took refuge in the mountains to the east, and some who owned private property also escaped the evacuation.[19] Private John G. Burnett later wrote \\"Future generations will read and condemn the act and I do hope posterity will remember that private soldiers like myself, and like the four Cherokee who were forced by General Scott to shoot an Indian Chief and his children, had to execute the orders of our superiors. We had no choice in the matter.\\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThis story is perhaps a garbled version of the episode when a Cherokee named Tsali or Charley and three others killed two soldiers in the North Carolina mountains during the round-up.[citation needed] The two Indians were subsequently tracked down and executed by Chief Euchella's band of Cherokee in exchange for a deal with the Army to avoid their own removal. The Cherokee were then marched overland to departure points at Ross's Landing (Chattanooga, Tennessee) and Gunter's Landing (Guntersville, Alabama) on the Tennessee River, and forced on to flatboats and the steamers \\"Smelter\\" and \\"Little Rock\\". Unfortunately, a drought brought low water levels on the rivers, requiring frequent unloading of vessels to evade river obstacles and shoals. The Army directed Removal was characterized by many deaths and desertions, and this part of the Cherokee Removal proved to be a fiasco and Gen. Scott ordered suspension of further removal efforts. The Army-operated groups were?:\\r\\n\\r\\nMuster rolls for groups # 1 and 4 are in the records of the Bureau of Indian Affairs and # 2 in records of the Army Continental Commands (Eastern Division, Gen. Winfield Scott's papers) in the National Archives. There are daily journals of conductors for groups # 1 and 3 among Special Files of the Bureau of Indian Affairs.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe deaths and desertions in the Army's boat detachments caused Gen Scott to suspend the Army's Removal efforts, and the remaining Cherokee were put into eleven internment camps, mostly located near Ross' Landing (now Chattanooga, TN) and at Red Clay, Bedwell Springs, Chatata, Mouse Creek, Rattlesnake Springs, Chestoee, and Calhoun (site of the former Cherokee Agency) located within Bradley County, TN and one camp (Fort Payne) in Alabama.\\r\\n\\r\\nCherokee remained in the camps during the summer of 1838 and were plagued by dysentery and other illnesses, which led to 353 deaths. A group of Cherokee petitioned General Scott for a delay until cooler weather made the journey less hazardous. This was granted; meanwhile Chief Ross, finally accepting defeat, managed to have the remainder of the removal turned over to the supervision of the Cherokee Council. Although there were some objections within the U.S. government because of the additional cost, General Scott awarded a contract for removing the remaining 11,000 Cherokee under the supervision of Principal Chief Ross, with expenses to be paid by the Army, which outraged President Jackson and surprised many.[16]\\r\\n\\r\\nChief John Ross made sure to confirm and secure his position as leader of the removal process by conferring with other Cherokee leaders, who granted him full responsibility of this daunting task. He then wasted no time in forming a plan, in which he organized 12 wagon trains, each with about 1000 persons and conducted by veteran full-blood tribal leaders or educated mixed bloods. Each wagon train was assigned physicians, interpreters (to help the physicians), commissaries, managers, wagon masters, teamsters, and even grave diggers.[16] Chief Ross also purchased the steamboat \\"Victoria\\" in which his own and tribal leaders' families could travel in some comfort. Lewis Ross, the Chief's brother, was the main contractor and furnished forage, rations, and clothing for the wagon trains. Although this arrangement was an improvement for all concerned, disease and exposure still took many lives. This is the part of the Removal usually identified as\\r\\nThe \\"Trail of Tears.\\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThese detachments were forced to trek through various trails, crossing through Kentucky, Illinois, Tennessee, Mississippi, Arkansas, and even Missouri to the final destination of Oklahoma. One of the main routes began in Chattanooga, TN and took a northwestern route through eastern Kentucky and southern Illinois before bearing to the southwest near the center of Missouri. The entire trip was roughly 2,200 miles. The Cherokee endured freezing temperatures, snowstorms, and pneumonia. The harshness of the trail and the intense weather conditions claimed around 4,000 lives, although estimates vary.[18][19]\\r\\n\\r\\nThere exist muster rolls for four (Benge, Chuwaluka, G. Hicks, and Hildebrand) of the 12 wagon trains and payrolls of officials for all 13 detachments among the personal papers of Principal Chief John Ross in the Gilcrease Institution in Tulsa, OK.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe number of people who died as a result of the Trail of Tears has been variously estimated. American doctor and missionary Elizur Butler, who made the journey with the Daniel Colston wagon train, estimated 2,000 deaths in the Army removal and internment camps and perhaps another 2,000 on the trail; his total of 4,000 deaths remains the most cited figure, although he acknowledged these were estimates without having seen government or tribal records. A scholarly demographic study in 1973 estimated 2,000 total deaths; another, in 1984, concluded that a total of 6,000 people died.[20] The 4000 figure or one quarter of the tribe was also used by the Smithsonian anthropologist, James Mooney. Since 16,000 Cherokee were enumerated on the 1835 Census, and about 12,000 emigrated in 1838, ergo 4000 needed accounting for. Note that some 1500 Cherokee remained in North Carolina, many more in South Carolina, and Georgia, so the higher fatality numbers are unlikely. In addition, nearly 400 Creek or Muskogee Indians who had avoided being removed earlier, fled into the Cherokee Nation and became part of the latter's Removal.\\r\\n\\r\\nAn accounting of the exact number of fatalities during the Removal is also related to discrepancies in expense accounts submitted by Chief John Ross after the Removal that the Army considered inflated and possibly fraudulent. Ross claimed rations for 1600 more Cherokee than were counted by an Army officer, Captain Page, at Ross' Landing as Cherokee groups left their homeland and another Army officer, Captain Stephenson, at Fort Gibson counted them as they arrived in Indian Territory. Ross' accounts are consistently higher numbers than that of the Army disbursing agents.[21] The Van Buren administration refused to pay Ross, but the later Tyler administration eventually approved disbursing more than $500,000 to the Principal Chief in 1842.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn addition, some Cherokee traveled from east to west more than once. Many deserters from the Army's boat detachments in June 1838 later emigrated in the twelve Ross wagon trains. There were transfers between groups, and later join ups and desertions were not always recorded. Jesse Mayfield was a white man with a Cherokee family went twice (first voluntarily in B.B. Cannon's detachment in 1837 to Indian Territory; unhappy there, he returned to the Cherokee Nation; and in Oct. 1838 was Wagon Master for the Bushyhead Detachment). An Army disbursing agent discovered that a Cherokee named Justis Fields travelled with government funds three times under different aliases. A mixed-blood named James Bigby, Jr. travelled to Indian Territory five times (three as government interpreter for different detachments, as Commissary for the Colston detachment, and as an individual in 1840). In addition, a small but significant number of mixed-bloods and whites with Cherokee families petitioned to become citizens of Alabama, Georgia, North Carolina, South Carolina, or Tennessee and thus ceased to be considered Cherokee.\\r\\n\\r\\nDuring the journey, it is said that the people would sing \\"Amazing Grace\\", using its inspiration to improve morale. The traditional Christian hymn had previously been translated into Cherokee by the missionary Samuel Worcester with Cherokee assistance. The song has since become a sort of anthem for the Cherokee people.[22]\\r\\n\\r\\nCherokee who were removed initially settled near Tahlequah, Oklahoma. The political turmoil resulting from the Treaty of New Echota and the Trail of Tears led to the assassinations of Major Ridge, John Ridge, and Elias Boudinot; of those targeted for assassination that day, only Stand Watie escaped his assassins. The population of the Cherokee Nation eventually rebounded, and today the Cherokee are the largest American Indian group in the United States.[23]\\r\\n\\r\\nThere were some exceptions to removal. Those Cherokee who lived on private, individually owned lands (rather than communally owned tribal land) were not subject to removal. In North Carolina, about 400 Cherokee led by Yonaguska lived on land along the Oconaluftee River in the Great Smoky Mountains owned by a white man named William Holland Thomas (who had been adopted by Cherokee as a boy), and were thus not subject to removal, and these were joined by a smaller band of about 150 along the Nantahala River led by Utsala. Along with a group living in Snowbird and another along the Cheoah River in a community called Tomotley, these North Carolina Cherokee became the Eastern Band of the Cherokee Nation, numbering approximately 1000. According to a roll taken the year after the removal (1839), there were in addition some estimated about 400 of Georgia, South Carolina, Tennessee, and Alabama, and these also joined the EBCI.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Trail of Tears is generally considered to be one of the most regrettable episodes in American history. To commemorate the event, the U.S. Congress designated the Trail of Tears National Historic Trail in 1987.[24] It stretches across nine states for 2,200 miles (3,500?km).\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 2004, during the 108th Congress, Senator Sam Brownback (Republican of Kansas) introduced a joint resolution (Senate Joint Resolution 37) to \\"offer an apology to all Native Peoples on behalf of the United States\\" for past \\"ill-conceived policies\\" by the United States Government regarding Indian Tribes. It passed in the U.S. Senate in February 2008.[25]\\r\\n\\r\\nAs of 2014, Cherokee Nation members can request heritage seeds for a species of beans carried on the Trail of Tears from the Cherokee Seed Project.[26]","input":"What was the journey of the cherokee to indian territory called?"},{"output":"quadriceps femoris","context":"The quadriceps femoris (/?kw?dr?s?ps ?f?m?r?s/, also called the quadriceps extensor, quadriceps or quads), is a large muscle group that includes the four prevailing muscles on the front of the thigh.\\r\\nIt is the great extensor muscle of the knee, forming a large fleshy mass which covers the front and sides of the femur. The name derives from Latin four-headed muscle of the femur.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nIt is subdivided into four separate portions or 'heads', which have received distinctive names:\\r\\nAll four parts of the quadriceps muscle ultimately insert into the tuberosity of the tibia via the patella, where the quadriceps tendon becomes the patellar ligament.\\r\\nThere is a fifth muscle of the quadriceps complex that is often forgotten and rarely taught called articularis genus.\\r\\nIn addition, recent cadaver studies have confirmed the presence of a sixth muscle, the tensor vastus intermedius.[1] While the muscle has variable presentations, it consistently originates at the proximal femur, runs between the vastus lateralis and vastus intermedius muscles, and inserts distally at the medial aspect of the patellar base.[1] Historically considered a part of the vastus lateralis, the tensor vastus intermedius muscle is innervated by an independent branch of the femoral nerve and its tendinous belly can be separated from the vasti lateralis and intermedius muscles in most cases.[1]\\r\\nFemoral nerve (L2, L3, L4).\\r\\nAll four quadriceps are powerful extensors of the knee joint. They are crucial in walking, running, jumping and squatting. Because the rectus femoris attaches to the ilium, it is also a flexor of the hip. This action is also crucial to walking or running as it swings the leg forward into the ensuing step. The quadriceps, specifically the vastus medialis, play the important role of stabilizing the patella and the knee joint during gait.[2]\\r\\nIn strength training, the quadriceps are trained by several leg exercises. Effective exercises include the squat and leg press. The isolation movement (i.e. targets solely the quadriceps) is the leg extension exercise.\\r\\nIn body building communities, this muscle is colloquially referred to as the \\"leg triceps\\".[3]\\r\\nThe proper Latin plural form of the adjective quadriceps would be quadricipites.

In addition, oozing from mucocutaneous surfaces causing nosebleeds, bloodstained tears, and vicarious menstruation are common.[2] The episodes may be preceded by intense headache and abdominal pain and are usually self-limiting. In some conditions, the secreted fluid is more dilute and appears to be blood-tinged, while others may have darker bright red secretions resembling blood.[3]\\r\\nWhile the extent of blood loss generally is minimal, hematidrosis also results in the skin becoming extremely tender and fragile.\\r\\nHematidrosis is a condition in which capillary blood vessels that feed the sweat glands rupture, causing them to exude blood, occurring under conditions of extreme physical or emotional stress.[4] Severe mental anxiety activates the sympathetic nervous system to invoke the stress-fight or flight reaction to such a degree as to cause hemorrhage of the vessels supplying the sweat glands into the ducts of the sweat glands.[5] It has been suggested that acute fear and extreme stress can cause hematidrosis.[6]\\r\\nInvestigation such as platelets count, platelet aggregation test, coagulation profile and skin biopsy reveal no abnormalities and direct light microscopy of fluid demonstrates presence of normal red blood cells. Investigations also failed to show any vasculitis or skin appendages (i.e. sweat glands, sebaceous glands and hair follicles) abnormalities.[3][7]\\r\\nA 2015 case study investigated hematidrosis with a patient who has epilepsy.[8]\\r\\nEffect on the body is weakness and mild to moderate dehydration from the severe anxiety and both blood and sweat loss.[9]\\r\\nThe condition is very rare but there are reports in medical literature of successful treatment with beta blockers (propranolol 10?mg)[10][11] with significant reduction in the frequency of spontaneous blood oozing. The successful use of beta blockers supports the theory that the condition is induced by stress and anxiety yet this etiology is not established yet as the high prevalence of stress and anxiety in the modern era did not change the incidence of this extremely rare disease, suggesting that other co-abnormality also play a key role in this disease.[7] Atropine sulfate transdermal patches have also been used successfully.[3]\\r\\nFavorable results with psychiatric counselling to reduce stress highlight the relationship between psychogenic causes and hematohidrosis.[5]\\r\\nDermatological research notes the presence of hematidrosis in people awaiting execution.[5] It has also been proposed as a possible explanation for Jesus' agony in the garden of Gethsemane (Luke 22:44)[12] and for claims associated with stigmata.[13][14]\\r\\nLeonardo da Vinci described a soldier who sweated blood before battle.

At Indiana, he earned first team All-Big Ten honors three times and became Indiana's all-time leading scorer at the time.\\r\\nAlford played four years in the NBA for the Dallas Mavericks and Golden State Warriors. After retiring in 1991, he became a college basketball coach. He coached at Manchester University, Southwest Missouri State University, the University of Iowa and the University of New Mexico before arriving at UCLA.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nAlford was born in Franklin, Indiana and grew up in New Castle.\\r\\nAlford learned to count as a three-year-old by watching the numbers tick off the scoreboard in Monroe City, where his father, Sam Alford, coached the high school team. Sam often moved for various coaching jobs. Steve missed only two of his father's games, once when he had chicken pox and once when he made the regionals of the Elks Club free-throw shooting contest.[1] When Alford was nine years old, he attended a basketball camp put on by Coach Bob Knight.[1] Eventually the Alfords settled in New Castle, Indiana, where Steve played on the New Castle Chrysler High School basketball team with his dad as coach. Alford was known to practice shooting so much that he would wear out six or seven nets a summer and frequently forego social activities.[1]\\r\\nAs a high school freshman Alford barely averaged a point a game, but then averaged 18.7 the next season.[1] By his senior year in 1983, before the three-point line was even implemented, Alford averaged 37.7 points per game and earned the Indiana \\"Mr. Basketball\\" award.[2] His team advanced to the state quarterfinal but lost to Connersville in the 1983 state tournament. Later, shortly after Alford won a gold medal as a member of Bob Knight's U.S. Olympic team, he gave the medal to his dad in a tearful ceremony at the high school in tribute to the loss.[1]\\r\\nAlford decided to play basketball for Bob Knight and the Indiana Hoosiers men's basketball team. At Indiana, he became the university's all-time leading scorer with 2,438 points (a record later eclipsed by Calbert Cheaney, who went on to become the Big Ten's all-time leading scorer). Alford was the first player to be named the team's MVP four times. During his final three seasons, Alford earned first team all-Big Ten honors. In the Legends of College Basketball by The Sporting News Alford was #35 on the list of the 100 greatest Division-I college basketball players. When The Sporting News named its top ten NCAA basketball players of the 1980s in December 1989, Alford was listed at number ten.\\r\\nAs a freshman, Alford quickly earned the favor of Coach Knight. Dan Dakich, Alford's former teammate and later an interim Indiana coach, said \\"Steve was incredibly mature as a freshman. He was getting thrown out of practice then. If Coach respects you and knows you can handle it, he'll do that. When I was a freshman, only Randy Wittman and Ted Kitchel, the seniors, were thrown out.\\" [1] That year Alford helped lead Indiana to an upset of the Michael Jordan-led North Carolina Tar Heels in the 1984 NCAA tournament. As a sophomore Alford was named to the 1985 NIT Tournament All-Tournament team after the Hoosiers finished second behind UCLA.\\r\\nAs a junior, Alford and the 1985-86 Hoosiers were profiled in a best-selling book A Season on the Brink. Author John Feinstein was granted unprecedented access to the Indiana basketball program and insights into Knight's coaching style. The book recounts how Knight once criticized Alford's work habits and leadership ability, telling him he couldn't \\"lead a whore into bed.\\" [1] Knight later admitted Alford was in fact an incredible worker and leader and the comments were just Knight's method of motivating players.[1] The Hoosiers went 21-8 that year and finished second in the Big Ten, with Alford earning All-America and Big Ten Player of the Year honors.\\r\\nIn his senior year, the Alford-led 1986-87 Hoosiers won Indiana's fifth national championship, when the team defeated Syracuse in title game of the tournament. The game was decided by a game-winning jump shot by Keith Smart with five seconds remaining.[3] Alford shot 7ÿ10 from the three-point line, scored 23 points, including a buzzer-beating three-pointer at the end of the first half that put the Hoosiers ahead by one point to start the second half.\\r\\nFor the 1984 Summer Olympics Alford, just 19 years old and a sophomore, was selected to play on the U.S. basketball team, coached by Bob Knight. Alford averaged 10.3 points per game, was second in assists, and shot .644 from the field. He and his teammates went on to win the gold medal at the 1984 games. In this game Alford played alongside Michael Jordan, Patrick Ewing, Sam Perkins, Chris Mullin and Wayman Tisdale. Alford has recounted that during the Olympic training camp, Jordan bet him $100 that he would not last four years on Knight's Indiana team.\\r\\nAlford was drafted 26th in the 1987 NBA draft.[4] Many fans in Indiana expected Alford to be drafted by the Indiana Pacers, but the Pacers selected Reggie Miller and Alford fell to the Dallas Mavericks.[5] Initially the choice angered Indiana fans but ultimately they and even Alford embraced the decision. Years later, Alford said \\"not only was it a much better draft choice than drafting me... Reggie turned out not to be a great pick, he turned out to be great for the state of Indiana.\\"[2] Alford played in the NBA for four seasons, mostly with the Dallas Mavericks, although he spent a portion of one season with Golden State Warriors. Over his career, he started three games, scored 744 points, had 176 assists and shot free throws with an accuracy of 87 percent.\\r\\nAlford quickly became the face of Indiana basketball and a fan favorite throughout the state. Dan Dakich, Alford's former teammate and later an interim Indiana coach, said of him, \\"Basically, he owns all of Indiana.\\" [1] Alford's wife Tanya said, \\"Everybody talks about his hair, his all-American image, how mothers would want him to marry their daughter. Everybody thinks he's so perfect. Well, that's a pretty accurate image. That's exactly what he is.\\" [1]\\r\\nAlford embodied the \\"David versus Goliath\\" image of Indiana basketball popularized in the hit movie Hoosiers (released in 1986 while Alford was at Indiana). He was small for a major-college guard, slow without any compensatory quickness and strong only because he ate and flexed himself up to 185 pounds from 150 as a freshman.[1] According to commentators, Alford owed his success to repetition and work.[1] In his workouts he would pick a spot on the floor and take ten shots. If he did not make eight, he would punish himself with fingertip push-ups or wind sprints. At the end of his college career, Coach Knight said, \\"He's gotten more out of his abilities offensively than anybody I've seen play college basketball. He's about as good a scorer for being strictly a jump shooter as I've ever seen. He's scored more than 2,400 points that way, and that's incredible, considering he doesn't get any tip-ins, drives or dunks.\\" [1]\\r\\nAlford is considered one of the best free throw shooters in the history of the game.[1] Alford's free throw percentage of .897 (535-596) is ninth best in the history of the NCAA.[6] His form at the foul line is so routine that it inspired a famous mantra from Indiana fans: \\"Socks, shorts, 1-2-3 swish\\". Before releasing a free throw, Alford told himself, \\"Soft over the front edge of the rim,\\" and some people believed they could see his lips move.[1]\\r\\nAlford began his college coaching career in North Manchester, Indiana in 1991 as head coach of the Division III Manchester University's basketball program. During his four seasons with the team, Alford had a record of 78ÿ29. When Alford began coaching that team, the team had lost its first eight games. During his first season there Alford won four of 20 games. In his first full season as coach the team posted a record of 20ÿ8. In the next season Manchester posted a record of 23ÿ4, and in his fourth and final season his team finished 31ÿ1.\\r\\nIn 1994 and 1995 Manchester won conference titles, and in Alford's final three seasons the team competed in the NCAA Division III Tournament. Under Alford, the team won three straight conference tournament titles (1993, 1994, 1995). The team advanced to the Division III championship game in 1995, placing second in the nation after suffering its first defeat in 32 games. The loss to Bo Ryan's University of Wisconsin-Platteville team marked the only title game in NCAA history matching two undefeated squads.\\r\\nIn 1993, 1994, and 1995 Alford was named the Indiana Collegiate Conference Coach of the Year. In the 1994-95 season the Manchester team was inducted into the school Hall of Fame. In 1999 Alford was also inducted into Manchester's Hall of Fame.\\r\\nFollowing his time at Manchester, Alford was named the head coach at Southwest Missouri State University. He began his position there in the 1995-96 season, and would remain there until 1999. During his time at Missouri State, his teams posted a 78ÿ48 record. In 1999, the Bears advanced to the Sweet 16 of the NCAA Tournament before losing to Duke.\\r\\nSteve Alford was named the head coach of the University of Iowa Hawkeyes men's basketball program on March 22, 1999.\\r\\nAlthough Alford's first game as coach was a 70ÿ68 victory against the defending national champion Connecticut Huskies at Madison Square Garden, his team went 14-16 during his first season at Iowa. During his second year (2000ÿ01) the Hawkeyes went 23ÿ12 in the regular season and 7ÿ9 in the Big Ten Conference regular season, but they won the Big Ten Conference Men's Basketball Tournament with four straight wins against Northwestern, Ohio State, Penn State, and Indiana. This earned them a #7 seed in the 2001 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament, where they defeated Creighton in the first round but lost to Kentucky in the second round.\\r\\nThe Hawkeyes' conference record dropped to 5ÿ11 during the 2001ÿ02 season, but they defeated Purdue, Wisconsin, and Indiana in the Big Ten Tournament before losing to Ohio State in the finals. The Hawkeyes played in the National Invitation Tournament that season, but lost to LSU in the first round to finish with a 19ÿ16 record. This was the first of three straight seasons that the Hawkeyes played in the NIT under Alford. They won the first two rounds of the 2003 tournament against Valparaiso and Iowa State before losing to Georgia Tech, finishing with a 17ÿ14 record. That season, leading scorer Pierre Pierce was charged with raping a female Iowa athlete. Alford was adamant about Pierce's innocence. A plea bargain was reached where Pierce pleaded guilty to a lesser charge. He was suspended from the team and redshirted.[7] In 2004, Iowa lost to St. Louis in the first round of the NIT to finish 16ÿ13 despite a 9ÿ7 conference record (the first winning Big Ten Conference record under Alford).\\r\\nThe Hawkeyes finished 21-12 with a 7-9 conference record in the 2004-2005 regular season, but they won their first two Big Ten Tournament games against Purdue and Michigan State before losing the third game to Wisconsin, 59-56. They earned an at-large invitation to the 2005 NCAA Tournament as a #10 seed, where they lost 76-64 to Cincinnati in the first round. In 2005, Pierce was charged with sexual assault of his girlfriend, and he was dismissed from the team before charges were filed.[7][8] However, Alford's reputation among Iowa fans suffered.[8] Pierce later served 11 months in a correctional facility.[9]\\r\\nDuring the 2005ÿ06 season, the Hawkeyes went undefeated at Carver-Hawkeye Arena and finished in a second-place tie with Illinois with an 11-5 conference record, one game behind Ohio State. However, the Hawkeyes defeated Minnesota, Michigan State, and Ohio State to win the Big Ten Tournament and finish 25-8 going into its third NCAA Tournament under Alford. They were seeded #3 in the Atlanta Regional of the 2006 NCAA Tournament, but lost in a first-round upset to #14 seed Northwestern State 64-63, leaving Alford with only one NCAA Tournament win since taking over at Iowa.\\r\\nDuring the 2006ÿ2007 season, Alford led the Hawkeyes to an 8ÿ6 non-conference record (losing to in-state rivals Drake and Northern Iowa) and a 9ÿ7 record in the Big Ten Conference (17-14 overall). Iowa failed to make the NCAA tournament or the NIT. It marked the first time since the 1976ÿ1977 season that an Iowa team with a winning record has failed to make either the NCAA tournament or the NIT.\\r\\nAt the conclusion of the 2006ÿ2007 season, Alford resigned from the University of Iowa to accept the coaching position at the University of New Mexico.\\r\\nAlford was named head coach at the University of New Mexico on March 23, 2007 replacing the fired Ritchie McKay. In his first year as the Lobos coach Alford posted a record of 24ÿ9, 11ÿ5 in league play. Twenty-four wins is the most for a New Mexico head coach in their first year. The Lobos were led by future 1st round Boston Celtics draft pick J. R. Giddens. The Lobos were eliminated in the first round of the NIT by Cal.\\r\\nIn his second season, led by seniors Daniel Faris, Tony Danridge and Chad Toppert, Alford guided the Lobos to their first conference championship in 15 years. He earned the MWC Coach of the Year Award for his team's performance. Alford also set a record for most wins in the first two seasons for a UNM head coach. Alford and his New Mexico squad fell just short of the NCAA tourney and ended up with their second consecutive NIT bid. They won a first round home game against Nebraska and lost on a last second buzzer beater on the road to Notre Dame.\\r\\nHis third year, coaching a mostly young, untested team, Alford's Lobos nevertheless won the regular season MWC title for the second year in a row, were ranked in the top 15 for the majority of the year, and earned a #3 seed in the NCAA Tournament, the team's first bid since 2005. In the first round, they survived a tough game against Montana 62ÿ57, but despite Dairese Gary's 28 points, fell in the second round to an upstart Washington side. At the end of the season Coach Alford received a ten-year contract extension through the 2019ÿ2020 season.\\r\\nThe 2010-2011 season started with Alford's group at 12-4 after non-conference play, but the team struggled to an 8-8 conference regular season record. Drew Gordon and Dairese Gary led a talented team that underachieved much throughout the year into the conference tournament. The team seemed poised to make a run in the MWC conference tournament, but a tragic ACL injury to Gary in the semi-finals against BYU proved to be too much to overcome for this young UNM squad. Their 2010-2011 season ended with an NIT loss to Alabama 74-67. However, with everyone coming back (with the exception of Gary), the following season seemed to hold promise.\\r\\nThe 2011-2012 season began with a rough patch. UNM was picked to win the league for the first time in Alford's five years at the helm, but the team started a questionable 2-2 with losses to home state rival NMSU and a bottom feeder WCC team in Santa Clara. UNM then raced off to a twelve-game win streak and finished the non-conference season at 14-2. UNM then went on to have a 10-4 conference regular season record and a share of the conference title with arch-rival San Diego State. It was only fitting that the regular season co-champions would square off in the MWC tournament title game. With Drew Gordon and Demetrius Walker leading a battle tested UNM team in the championship, Alford and his Lobos prevailed to a 69-58 conference tournament title. UNM received a fifth seed in the NCAA West region, and they defeated Casper Ware and the Long Beach State 49ers in their first game of the NCAA Tournament. The Lobos lost to the Louisville Cardinals in their next game.\\r\\nIn the 2012-2013 season, with a vicious defensive team, Alford led his Lobo squad to a 26-5 regular season record, winning the Mountain West Regular Season conference title. Alford won his third MWC coach of the year honor, and New Mexico garnered another Player of the Year award in Kendall Williams. New Mexico was primed to make a deep run in the NCAA tournament after winning the MWC conference tournament for the second straight year. At 29-5 entering the tournament, New Mexico was an early favorite as a Final Four participant by several analysts and publications, but Alford and his Lobos were upset by an underdog Harvard team, who won their first NCAA tournament game in school history.\\r\\nOn March 30, 2013, Alford signed a seven-year, $18.2-million contract to become the head coach of the UCLA Bruins, replacing the fired Ben Howland.[10] Ironically, Alford's decision to take the UCLA job came just three days after he had signed a 10-year extension at New Mexico.[11] At UCLA's introductory news conference, Alford was questioned about his handling of Pierce in Iowa, and he stated that he did \\"everything that [he] was told to do.\\"[7] Criticism grew over his hiring, especially over his handling of Pierce. Two weeks after his hiring, Alford apologized for declaring Pierce's innocence \\"before the legal system had run its course. This was inappropriate, insensitive and hurtful, especially to the young female victim involved, and I apologize for that.\\"[7]\\r\\nSoon after his hiring, Alford filled his head assistant coaching staff position with good friend and former John Calipari assistant Ed Schilling. Also hired were David Grace, a rising assistant who spent 2008ÿ2013 on the Oregon State staff, and Duane Broussard, who spent 2008ÿ2013 as Alford's assistant at New Mexico. Tyus Edney, who starred on UCLA's 1995 national championship team, continued as director of operations.[12] In his first season, Alford directed the Bruins to the title in the 2014 Pac-12 Tournament, the school's first conference tournament title in six years.[13] They advanced to the Sweet 16 of the 2014 NCAA Tournamenttheir first regional semifinal appearance since 2008before falling to Florida, who improved to 4ÿ0 all-time against UCLA in the NCAA tournament.[14]\\r\\nThe Bruins began the 2014ÿ15 season at 4ÿ0 and ranked No. 22 before losing two of three games at the Battle 4 Atlantis tournament.[15][16] Beginning with their December loss at home to Gonzaga, the Bruins lost five consecutive games, their longest streak since 2009ÿ10.[17] Losses included a 39-point defeat to No. 1 Kentuckythey fell behind 24ÿ0 and trailed 41ÿ7 at halftimeand by 32 points against Utah.[18][19][20] UCLA closed out the regular season with three straight home wins to finish undefeated (9ÿ0) at home in the conference for the first time since 2006ÿ07.[21] The Bruins went 1ÿ1 in the 2015 Pac-12 Tournament,[22] but proved most major projections wrong by receiving an invitation to the 2015 NCAA tournament, earning a No. 11 seed.[22][23] They advanced to the Sweet 16, when they lost again to Gonzaga.[24] The squad became the lowest-seed UCLA team to ever reach the regional semifinals.[25]\\r\\nBecause of these successes on the court, on June 9, 2015, Alford was honored as the 2015 Big Ten Club of Southern California's Person of the Year at the Tournament House, home of the Tournament of Roses in Pasadena.[26]\\r\\nAlford has three children, Kory, Bryce and Kayla. Kory played for the elder Alford at New Mexico and transferred with him to UCLA. Bryce also played under Alford at UCLA, and ended his career as the school's career leader in three-pointers made.[28] He became a professional basketball player.\\r\\nAlford is a Christian. He has spoken openly about his faith, saying, \\"Im a Christian first. Im a family guy second. As much as I like coaching, as much as I like basketball, its third, fourth, or fifth down the line.\\"[29]\\r\\n??????National champion?? ??????Postseason invitational champion??\\r\\n??????Conference regular season champion?? ??????Conference regular season and conference tournament champion\\r\\n??????Division regular season champion ??????Division regular season and conference tournament champion\\r\\n??????Conference tournament champion","input":"What was steve alford free throw percentage in college?"},{"output":"the economic consequences of Ricardo's Law of Economic rent and the Georgist concepts of economic privilege and land value taxation","context":"The history of the board game Monopoly can be traced back to the early 20th century. The earliest known version of Monopoly, known as The Landlord's Game, was designed by an American, Elizabeth Magie, and first patented in 1904 but existed as early as 1902.[1][2] Magie, a follower of Henry George, originally intended The Landlord's Game to illustrate the economic consequences of Ricardo's Law of Economic rent and the Georgist concepts of economic privilege and land value taxation.[3] A series of board games were developed from 1906 through the 1930s that involved the buying and selling of land and the development of that land. By 1933, a board game had been created much like the version of Monopoly sold by Parker Brothers and its related companies through the rest of the 20th century, and into the 21st. Several people, mostly in the Midwestern United States and near the East Coast, contributed to the game's design and evolution.\\r\\nBy the 1970s, the idea that the game had been created solely by Charles Darrow had become popular folklore; it was printed in the game's instructions for many years, in a 1974 book devoted to Monopoly, and was cited in a general book about toys even as recently as 2007.[4][5][6][7] Even a guide to family games published for Reader's Digest in 2003 only gave credit to Darrow and Elizabeth Magie, erroneously stating that Magie's original game was created in the 19th century, and not acknowledging any of the game's development between Magie's creation of the game, and the eventual publication by Parker Brothers.[8]\\r\\nAlso in the 1970s, Professor Ralph Anspach, who had himself published a board game intended to illustrate the principles of both monopolies and trust busting, fought Parker Brothers and its then parent company, General Mills, over the copyright and trademarks of the Monopoly board game. Through the research of Anspach and others, much of the early history of the game was \\"rediscovered\\" and entered into official United States court records. Because of the lengthy court process, including appeals, the legal status of Parker Brothers' copyright and trademarks on the game was not settled until 1985. The game's name remains a registered trademark of Parker Brothers, as do its specific design elements; other elements of the game are still protected under copyright law. At the conclusion of the court case, the game's logo and graphic design elements became part of a larger Monopoly brand, licensed by Parker Brothers' parent companies onto a variety of items through the present day. Despite the \\"rediscovery\\" of the board game's early history in the 1970s and 1980s, and several books and journal articles on the subject, Hasbro (Parker Brothers' current parent company) did not acknowledge any of the game's history before Charles Darrow on its official Monopoly website as recently as June 2012.[9] Nor did Hasbro acknowledge anyone other than Darrow in materials published or sponsored by them, at least as recently as 2009.[10]\\r\\nInternational tournaments, first held in the early 1970s, continue to the present, although the last national tournaments and world championship were held in 2009. Starting in 1985, a new generation of spin-off board games and card games appeared on both sides of the Atlantic Ocean. In 1989, the first of many video game and computer game editions was published. Since 1994,[11] many official variants of the game, based on locations other than Atlantic City, New Jersey (the official U.S. setting) or London (the official Commonwealth setting, excepting Canada), have been published by Hasbro or its licensees. In 2008, Hasbro permanently changed the color scheme and some of the gameplay of the standard U.S. Edition of the game to match the UK Edition, although the U.S. standard edition maintains the Atlantic City property names.[12] Hasbro also modified the official logo to give the \\"Mr. Monopoly\\" character a 3-D computer-generated look, which has since been adopted by licensees USAopoly, Winning Moves and Winning Solutions. And Hasbro has also been including the Speed Die, introduced in 2006's Monopoly: The Mega Edition by Winning Moves Games, in versions produced directly by Hasbro (such as the 2009 Championship Edition).[13][14]\\r\\nIn 1903, the Georgist Lizzie Magie applied for a patent on a game called The Landlord's Game with the object of showing that rents enriched property owners and impoverished tenants. She knew that some people would find it hard to understand the logic behind the idea, and she thought that if the rent problem and the Georgist solution to it were put into the concrete form of a game, it might be easier to demonstrate. She was granted the patent for the game in January 1904. The Landlord's Game became one of the first board games to use a \\"continuous path\\", without clearly defined start and end spaces on its board.[15][16] Another innovation in gameplay attributed to Magie is the concept of \\"ownership\\" of a place on a game board, such that something would happen to the second (or later) player to land on the same space, without the first player's piece still being present.[16] A copy of Magie's game that she had left at the Georgist community of Arden, Delaware and dating from 1903ÿ1904, was presented for the PBS series History Detectives.[17] This copy featured property groups, organized by letters, later a major feature of Monopoly as published by Parker Brothers.[18][19]\\r\\nAlthough The Landlord's Game was patented, and some hand-made boards were made, it was not actually manufactured and published until 1906. Magie and two other Georgists established the Economic Game Company of New York, which began publishing her game.[20] Magie submitted an edition published by the Economic Game Company to Parker Brothers around 1910, which George Parker declined to publish.[20] In the UK, it was published in 1913 by the Newbie Game Company under the title Brer Fox an' Brer Rabbit.[21][22] Shortly after the game's formal publication, Scott Nearing, a professor in what was then known as the Wharton School of Finance and Commerce at the University of Pennsylvania, began using the game as a teaching tool in his classes. His students made their own boards, and taught the game to others.[23] After Nearing was dismissed from the Wharton School, he began teaching at the University of Toledo. A former student of Nearing, Rexford Guy Tugwell, also taught The Landlord's Game at Wharton, and took it with him to Columbia University.[24] Apart from commercial distribution, it spread by word of mouth and was played in slightly variant homemade versions over the years by Quakers, Georgists, university students (including students at Smith College, Princeton, and MIT), and others who became aware of it.[25][26]\\r\\nA shortened version of Magie's game, which eliminated the second round of play that used a Georgist concept of a single land value tax, had become common during the 1910s, and this variation on the game became known as Auction Monopoly.[27] The auctioning part of the game came through a rule that auctioned any unowned property to all game players when it was first landed on.[28] This rule was later dropped by the Quakers, and in the current game of Monopoly an auction takes place only when an unowned property is not purchased outright by the player that first lands on it.[28][29] That same decade, the game became popular around the community of Reading, Pennsylvania.[28] Another former student of Scott Nearing, Thomas Wilson, taught the game to his cousin, Charles Muhlenberg, around 1915ÿ1916.[28] The original patent on The Landlord's Game expired in 1921. By this time, the hand-made games became known simply as Monopoly.[30][31] Charles Muhlenberg and his wife, Wilma, taught the game to Wilma's brothers, Louis and Ferdinand \\"Fred\\" Thun, in the early 1920s.[28]\\r\\nSimultaneous to these events, Magie moved back to Illinois, and married Andrew Phillips.[32] She moved to the Washington, D.C. area with her husband by 1923, and re-patented a revised version of The Landlord's Game in 1924 (under her married name, Elizabeth Magie Phillips). This version, unlike her first patent drawing, included named streets (though the versions published in 1910 based on her first patent also had named streets). Magie sought to regain control over the plethora of hand-made games.[33] For her 1924 edition, a couple of streets on the board were named after Chicago streets and locations, notably \\"The Loop\\" and \\"Lake Shore Drive.\\"[34] This revision also included a special \\"monopoly\\" rule and card that allowed higher rents to be charged when all three railroads and utilities were owned, and included \\"chips\\" to indicate improvements on properties.[35][36] Magie again approached Parker Brothers about her game, and George Parker again declined, calling the game \\"too political\\".[32][37] Parker is, however, credited with urging Magie to take out her 1924 patent.[32]\\r\\nAfter the Thuns learned the game, they began teaching its rules to their fraternity brothers at Williams College around 1926.[28] Daniel W. Layman, in turn, learned the game from the Thun brothers (who later tried to sell copies of the game commercially, but were advised by an attorney that the game could not be patented, as they were not its inventors).[28][38] Layman later returned to his hometown of Indianapolis, Indiana, and began playing the game with friends there, ultimately producing hand-made versions of the board based on streets of that city.[30] Layman then commercially produced and sold the game, starting in 1932, with a friend in Indianapolis, who owned a company called Electronic Laboratories.[39] This game was sold under the name The Fascinating Game of Finance (later shortened to Finance).[40] Layman soon sold his rights to the game, which was then licensed, produced and marketed by Knapp Electric.[41] The published board featured four railroads (one per side), Chance and Community Chest cards and spaces, and properties grouped by symbol, rather than color.[42][43][44] Also in 1932, one edition of The Landlord's Game was published by the Adgame Company with a new set of rules called Prosperity, also by Magie.[45]\\r\\nIt was in Indianapolis that Ruth Hoskins learned the game, and took it back to Atlantic City.[46] After she arrived, Hoskins made a new board with Atlantic City street names and railroads, and taught it to a group of local Quakers.[47] It has been argued that their greatest contribution to the game was to reinstate the original Lizzie Magie rule of \\"buying properties at their listed price\\" rather than auctioning them, as the Quakers did not believe in auctions.[48][49] Another source states that the Quakers simply \\"didn't like the noise of the auctioneering.\\"[28] Among the group taught the game by Hoskins were Eugene Raiford and his wife, who took a copy of the game with Atlantic City street names to Philadelphia.[50] Due to the Raifords' unfamiliarity with streets and properties in Philadelphia,[50] the Atlantic City-themed version was the one taught to Charles Todd, who in turn taught Esther Darrow, wife of Charles Darrow.[51] After learning the game, Darrow then began to distribute the game himself as Monopoly and never spoke to the Todds again.[28] Darrow initially made the sets of the Monopoly game by hand with the help of his first son, William Darrow, and his wife. Their new sets retained Charles Todd's misspelling of \\"Marvin Gardens\\" and the renaming of the Shore Fast Line the Short Line.[51] Charles Darrow drew the designs with a drafting pen on round pieces of oilcloth,[52] and then his son and his wife helped fill in the spaces with colors and make the title deed cards and the Chance cards and Community Chest cards. After the demand for the game increased, Darrow contacted a printing company, Patterson and White, which printed the designs of the property spaces on square carton boards. Darrow's game board designs included elements later made famous in the version eventually produced by Parker Brothers, including black locomotives on the railroad spaces, the car on \\"Free Parking\\", the red arrow for \\"Go\\", the faucet on \\"Water Works\\", the light bulb on \\"Electric Company\\", and the question marks on the \\"Chance\\" spaces, though many of the actual icons were created by a hired graphic artist.[53][54][55] While Darrow received a copyright on his game in 1933, its specimens have disappeared from the files of the United States Copyright Office, though proof of its registration remains.[56]\\r\\nDarrow first took the game to Milton Bradley and attempted to sell it as his personal invention. They rejected it in a letter dated May 31, 1934.[58] After Darrow sent the game to Parker Brothers later in 1934, they rejected the game as \\"too complicated, too technical, [and it] took too long to play.\\"[59] Darrow received a rejection letter from the firm dated October 19, 1934.[58] During this time, the \\"52 design errors\\" story was invented as a reason why Parker rejected Monopoly, but this has more recently been proven to be part of the Parker-invented \\"creation myth\\" surrounding the game.[9][60][61]\\r\\nIn early 1935, however, the company heard about the game's excellent sales during the Christmas season of 1934 in Philadelphia and at F.A.O. Schwarz in New York City. Robert Barton, President of Parker Brothers, contacted Darrow and scheduled a new meeting in New York City.[62] On March 18, Parker Brothers bought Darrow's game, helped him take out a patent on it, and purchased his remaining inventory.[61][63] By April, 1935, the company had learned that Darrow was not the sole inventor of the game, but sought out an affidavit by Darrow to repeat his statements to the contrary, and thus bolster their claim to the game.[28][64] Parker Brothers subsequently decided to buy out Magie's 1924 patent and the copyrights of other commercial variants of the game to claim that it had legitimate undisputed rights to the game.\\r\\nRobert Barton, president of Parker Brothers, bought the rights to Finance from Knapp Electric later in 1935.[65][66] Finance would be redeveloped, updated, and continued to be sold by Parker Brothers into the 1970s.[67] Other board games based on a similar principle, such as a game called Inflation, designed by Rudy Copeland and published by the Thomas Sales Co., in Fort Worth, Texas, also came to the attention of Parker Brothers management in the 1930s, after they began sales of Monopoly.[68][69] Copeland continued sales of the latter game after Parker Brothers attempted a patent lawsuit against him. Parker Brothers held the Magie and Darrow patents, but settled with Copeland rather than going to trial, since Copeland was prepared to have witnesses testify that they had played Monopoly before Darrow's \\"invention\\" of the game.[70] The court settlement allowed Copeland to license Parker Brothers' patents.[71] Other agreements were reached on Big Business by Transogram, and Easy Money by Milton Bradley, based on Daniel Layman's Finance.[72] Another clone, called Fortune, was sold by Parker Brothers, and became combined with Finance in some editions.[73]\\r\\nMonopoly was first marketed on a broad scale by Parker Brothers in 1935. A Standard Edition, with a small black box and separate board, and a larger Deluxe Edition, with a box large enough to hold the board, were sold in the first year of Parker Brothers' ownership. These were based on the two editions sold by Darrow.[74] Parker Brothers sets were the first to include die-cast metal tokens for playing pieces, initially using a battleship, a cannon, a clothes iron, a shoe, a top hat, and a thimble.[75] George Parker himself rewrote many of the game's rules, insisting that \\"short game\\" and \\"time limit\\" rules be included.[76] On the original Parker Brothers board (reprinted in 2002 by Winning Moves Games), there were no icons for the Community Chest spaces (the blue chest overflowing with gold coins came later) and no gold ring on the Luxury Tax space. Nor were there property values printed on spaces on the board. The Income Tax was slightly higher (being $300 or 10%, instead of the later $200 or 10%). Some of the designs known today were implemented at the behest of George Parker.[76] The Chance cards and Community Chest cards were illustrated (though some prior editions consisted solely of text), but were without \\"Rich Uncle Pennybags\\", who was introduced in 1936.[75]\\r\\nLate in 1935, after learning of The Landlord's Game and Finance, Robert Barton held a second meeting with Charles Darrow in Boston. Darrow admitted that he had copied the game from a friend's set, and he and Barton reached a revised royalty agreement, granting Parker Brothers worldwide rights and releasing Darrow from legal costs that would be incurred in defending the origin of the game.[77]\\r\\nIn December 1935, Parker Brothers sent a copy of the game to Victor Watson, Sr. of Waddington Games. Watson and his son Norman tried the game over a weekend, and liked it so much that Waddington took the (then extraordinary) step of making a transatlantic \\"trunk call\\" to Parker Brothers, the first such call made or received by either company.[78] This impressed Parker Brothers sufficiently that Waddington was granted licensing rights for Europe and the then-British Commonwealth, excluding Canada.[79] Waddingtons version, their first board game, with locations from London substituted for the original Atlantic City ones, was first produced in 1936.[80]\\r\\nThe game was very successful in the United Kingdom and France, but the 1936 German edition, published by Schmidt Spiele disappeared from the market within three years. This edition, featuring locations from Berlin, was denounced, allegedly by Joseph Goebbels to the Hitler Youth due to the game's \\"Jewish-speculative character.\\"[81] It is also alleged that the real reason behind the Nazi denouncement was due to the high-ranking members (i.e. Goebbels, again) who lived on those sections of the game board given the highest property values, and not wanting to be associated with a game.[82][83] The game last appeared in a pre-World War II Schmidt Spiele catalog in 1938.[84] A new German edition, with \\"generic\\" street and train station names (i.e., not chosen from a single German city) would not appear until 1953.[81][85] The 1936 German edition, with the original cards and Berlin locations, was reprinted in 1982 by Parker Brothers and again in 2003 (in a wooden box), and 2011 (in a red metal tin) by Hasbro.[86][87]\\r\\nWaddington licensed other editions from 1936 to 1938, and the game was exported from the UK and resold or reprinted in Switzerland, Belgium, Australia, Chile, The Netherlands, and Sweden. In Italy, under the fascists, the game was changed dramatically so that it would have an Italian name, locations in Milan, and major changes in the rules. This was for compliance under Italian law of the period. Italian publishers Editrice Giochi produced the game in Italy until 2009, having held a unique licensing agreement from Parker Brothers and their own copyright dating back to 1935/1936.[4] As of 2009, Hasbro has taken over the publishing of the game in Italy, but have also, for now, kept the Milan-based properties.[88]\\r\\nIn Austria, versions of the game first appeared as Business and Spekulation (Speculation), and eventually evolved to become Das Kaufm?nnische Talent (DKT) (The Businessman's Talent). Versions of DKT have been sold in Austria since 1940. The game first appeared as Monopoly in Austria in about 1981.[89] The Waddingtons edition was imported into The Netherlands starting in 1937, and a fully translated edition first appeared in 1941.[90]\\r\\nWaddingtons later produced special games during World War II which secretly contained files, a compass, a map printed on silk, and real currency hidden amongst the Monopoly money, to enable prisoners of war to escape from German camps.[91][92] However, this story has come under recent scrutiny and is being disputed.[93]\\r\\nCollector Albert C. Veldhuis features a map on his \\"Monopoly Lexicon\\" website showing which versions of the game were remade and distributed in other countries, with the Atlantic City, London, and Paris versions being the most influential.[94] After World War II, homemade games would sometimes appear behind the Iron Curtain, despite the fact that the game was effectively banned.[95] Monopoly is cited as the board game played most often and most duplicated via hand made copies in the former German Democratic Republic.[96] One official version of the game was printed for the Soviet Union by Parker Brothers in 1988.[97] After the Cold War ended, official editions have been published throughout eastern Europe by Parker, Tonka and Hasbro. Hungary was the first, in 1992,[98] followed by the Czech Republic and Poland in 1993,[99][100] Croatia in 1994,[101] Slovenia in 1996,[102] Romania and a new edition for Russia in 1997,[97][103] and Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania and Slovakia, all in 2001.[104][105][106][107]\\r\\nIn 1936, Parker Brothers published four further editions along with the original two: the Popular Edition, Fine Edition, Gold Edition, and Deluxe Edition, with prices ranging from US$2 to US$25 in 1930s money.[108] After Parker Brothers began to release its first editions of the game, Elizabeth Magie Phillips was profiled in the Washington D.C. Evening Star newspaper, which discussed her two editions of The Landlord's Game.[109] In December 1936, wary of the Mah-Jongg and Ping-Pong fads that had left unsold inventory stuck in Parker Brothers' warehouse, George Parker ordered a stop to Monopoly production as sales leveled off. However, during the Christmas season, sales picked up again, and continued a resurgence.[110] In early 1937, as Parker Brothers was preparing to release the board game Bulls and Bears with Darrow's photograph on the box lid (though he had no involvement with the game), a Time magazine article about the game made it seem as if Darrow himself was the sole inventor of both Bulls and Bears and Monopoly:\\r\\nAt the start of World War II, both Parker Brothers and Waddington stockpiled materials they could use for further game production. During the war, Monopoly was produced with wooden tokens in the U.S., and the game's cellophane cover was eliminated.[111] In the UK, metal tokens were also eliminated, and a special spinner was introduced to take the place of dice. The game remained in print for a time even in the Netherlands, as the printer there was able to maintain a supply of paper.[112] Elizabeth Magie's second patent on The Landlord's Game expired in September, 1941, and it is believed that after the expiration, she was no longer promoted as an inventor of Monopoly.[113] The game itself remained popular during the war, particularly in camps, and soldiers playing the game became part of the product's advertising in 1944.[114]\\r\\nAfter the war, sales went from 800,000 a year to over one million. The French and German editions re-entered production, and new editions for Spain, Greece, Finland and Israel were first produced.[115] By the late 1950s, Parker Brothers printed only game sets with board, pieces and materials housed in a single white box.[116] Several copies of this edition were exhibited at the American National Exhibition in Moscow in 1959. All of them were stolen from the exhibit.[117] In the early 1960s, \\"Monopoly happenings\\" began to occur, mostly marathon game sessions, which were recognized by a Monopoly Marathon Records Documentation Committee in New York City.[118] In addition to marathon sessions, games were played on large indoor and outdoor boards, within backyard pits, on the ceiling in a University of Michigan dormitory room, and underwater.[119] In 1965, a 30th anniversary set was produced in a special plastic case.[120]\\r\\nParker Brothers was acquired by General Mills in February 1968.[121] The first Monopoly edition in Braille is published in 1973.[122] Also in 1973, as the Atlantic City Commissioner of Public Works considered name changes for Baltic and Mediterranean Avenues, fans of the board game, with support from the president of Parker Brothers, successfully lobbied for the city to keep the names.[123] After Parker Brothers was taken over by General Mills, the Monopoly license to Waddingtons was renegotiated (as was the Clue/Cluedo license to Parker Brothers/General Mills by Waddingtons).[124] By 1974, Parker Brothers had sold 80 million sets of the game.[125] In 1975, another anniversary edition was produced, but this edition came in a cardboard box looking much like a standard edition.[120] Parker Brothers was under management by General Mills as the first six Monopoly Tournaments were held. See \\"The Monopoly Tournaments\\" below.\\r\\nKenner was combined with Parker Brothers and spun off as Kenner Parker Toys in 1985. Regular and Deluxe 50th Anniversary editions of Monopoly were released that same year.[126] The spinoff game Advance to Boardwalk was first published in 1985. Kenner Parker was acquired by Tonka in 1987. The 1987/1988 Monopoly Tournaments were held under Kenner Parker Tonka management.\\r\\nIn the United Kingdom, Monopoly publisher Waddingtons produced its first non-London edition in 1989, creating a Limited Edition based on Leeds as a charity fundraiser.[127]\\r\\nIn 1990, Merv Griffin Enterprises turned Monopoly into a prime time game show, airing after Super Jeopardy! on Saturday nights on ABC. The program was hosted by Mike Reilly and announced by Charlie O'Donnell.\\r\\nMonopoly Junior was first published in 1990. Kenner Parker Tonka was acquired by Hasbro in 1991. An all-Europe edition was published by Parker Brothers in 1991 for the nations of the then European Communities, using the Ecu (European Currency Unit).[128] After acquisition by Hasbro, publication of Monopoly in the U.S. ceased at the Parker Brothers plant in Salem, Massachusetts in November 1991.[126]\\r\\nIn 1994, the license to the company that would become USAopoly was issued, and they produced a San Diego, California edition as their first board. In 1995, a license for new game variations and reprints of Monopoly was granted to Winning Moves Games. See the Localizations, licenses, and spin-offs section below for details on further releases by both companies.\\r\\nIn 1995, a 60th Anniversary edition was released in a gold box.[129] In late 1998, Hasbro announced a campaign to add an all-new token to U.S. standard edition sets of Monopoly. Voters were allowed to select from a biplane, a piggy bank, and a sack of money  with votes being tallied through a special website, via a toll-free phone number, and at FAO Schwarz stores.\\r\\nIn March 1999, Hasbro announced that the winner was the sack of money (with 51 percent of the vote, compared to 29 percent for the biplane and 20 percent for the piggy bank). Thus, the sack of money became the first new token added to the game since the early 1950s.[130] In 1999, Hasbro renamed the Rich Uncle Pennybags mascot \\"Mr. Monopoly\\", and released Star Wars: Episode I, Pokmon and Millennium editions of Monopoly.[131][132][133] A second European edition is released in 1999, this time using the Euro as currency, but incorrectly listing Geneva as the capital of Switzerland.[128]\\r\\nA 65th Anniversary Edition was released in a variation of the white box in 2000.[134] In 2001, the European Edition is reissued, correcting the mistake of the 1999 printing, and correctly listing Bern as the capital of Switzerland.[128] In 2005, a 70th Anniversary Edition was released in a silver-metallic tin with a plastic slip case.[135] Also starting in 2005, various \\"Here & Now\\" editions were released in multiple countries. The first release of this edition was for the UK market, and its success led to the selection of properties for a U.S. edition by online vote. The most popular properties were released on the U.S. \\"Here & Now\\" edition board in 2006. This, in turn, led to a worldwide \\"Here & Now\\" edition (released in 2008), along with other national editions (including a second UK \\"Here and Now\\" edition) with properties selected by online vote.[136][137][138] The main principle of the \\"Here & Now\\" editions was \\"What if Monopoly had been invented today?\\"[139]\\r\\nThe first changes to the gameplay of the Monopoly game itself occurred with the publication of both the Monopoly Here & Now Electronic Banking Edition by Hasbro UK and Monopoly: The Mega Edition by Winning Moves Games in 2006. The Electronic Banking Edition uses VISA-branded debit cards and a debit card reader for monetary transactions, instead of paper bills.[140] This edition is available in the UK, Germany, France, Australia and Ireland. A version was released in the U.S. in 2007, albeit without the co-branding by Visa. An electronic counter had been featured in the Stock Exchange editions released in Europe in the early 2000s (decade), and is also a feature of the Monopoly City board game released in 2009.\\r\\nThe Mega Edition has been expanded to include fifty-two spaces (with more street names taken from Atlantic City), skyscrapers (to be played after hotels), train depots, the 1000 denomination of play money, as well as \\"bus tickets\\" and a speed die.[141] Shortly after the release of Mega Monopoly in 2006, Hasbro adopted the same blue version of the speed die into a special \\"Speed Die Edition\\" of the game. By 2008, the die, now red, became a permanent addition to the game, though its use remains optional there.[142] In 2009's \\"Championship Edition\\", use of the speed die is mandatory, as it also became mandatory in most of 2009's Monopoly tournaments.\\r\\nIn addition to permanently adding the speed die in 2008, Hasbro also instituted further changes to the United States standard edition of the board, including making Mediterranean and Baltic Avenues a brown color group, making the Income Tax space a flat $200 (removing the 10% option), changing the colors on the GO space from red to black, increasing the Luxury Tax to $100 (from $75), and changing certain of the Community Chest and Chance cards.[12] The changes in these four areas made the U.S. standard edition more uniform with the UK and modern European editions. In 2009, Winning Moves Games introduced \\"The Classic Edition\\", with a pre-2008 game board and cards, re-inclusion of the \\"sack of money\\" playing piece, and a plain MONOPOLY logo in the center of the board, with neither the 1985 or 2008 version of \\"Mr. Monopoly\\" present.[143] Also in 2009, Monopoly \\"theme packs\\" entered the retail market, including the Dog Lovers and Sports Fans editions, which include customized money, replacements for houses and hotels, and custom tokens, but no board.\\r\\nIn early 2010, Hasbro began selling the Free Parking and Get out of Jail add-on games, which can be played alone or when a player lands on the respective Monopoly board spaces. If played during a Monopoly game, success at either game gets the winning player a \\"free taxi ride to any space on the board\\" or \\"out of jail free\\", respectively.[144][145] A new, customizable edition called \\"U-Build\\" is also released.[146] Later in 2010, for the 75th anniversary of the game's publication, Hasbro released Monopoly Revolution, giving the game a graphic redesign, as well as returning it to a round shape, which had not been seen since some of Darrow's 1930s custom-made sets.[147] The game includes \\"bank cards\\" and keeps track of players' assets electronically, as was introduced in the \\"Electronic Banking Edition\\" earlier in the decade.[148] The game also features clear plastic playing pieces for movers, and electronic sound effects, triggered by certain events (for instance, a \\"jail door slam\\" sound effect when a player goes to jail). Monopoly Live was announced at the New York Toy Fair in February, 2011.[149] The Monopoly Millionaire version of the game was released in 2012.[150]\\r\\nIn early 2013, a board game version of the Monopoly Hotels online game was released.[151] From January 8 to February 5, 2013, through the Monopoly page on Facebook in a campaign called \\"Save Your Token,\\" Hasbro took votes from the public to make another permanent change in the lineup of game tokens. The token with the least number of \\"Save Your Token\\" votes will be retired, and replaced with one of five other tokens, depending on which of the new candidates gets the most votes. The potential tokens were a robot, a helicopter, a cat, a guitar or a diamond ring.[152][153] Neither the biplane nor the piggy bank from the 1998 vote are being considered this time. Early on February 6, it was announced that the iron would be retired for having received the least votes, and the cat would be replacing it, having received the most votes.[154] Starting in February 2013, the U.S. discount chain Target began selling a \\"Golden Token\\" set with the eight classic tokens and all five candidates.[155] Special editions with the thirteen golden tokens have also been released in the UK and France.[156][157] The first Monopoly game to have the new token lineup was released in June 2013.[158] In 2015, the game celebrated its 80th anniversary with eight tokens from each decade in a special edition.\\r\\nThe first Monopoly tournaments were suggested by Victor Watson of Waddington after the World Chess Championship 1972. Such championships are also held for players of the board game Scrabble. The first European Championship was held in Reykjavk, Iceland, the same site as the 1972 World Chess Championship. Accounts differ as to the eventual winner: Philip Orbanes and Victor Watson[159] name John Mair, representing Ireland and the eventual World Monopoly Champion of 1975, as also having won the European Championship.[160] Gyles Brandreth, himself a later European Monopoly Champion, names Pierre Milet, representing France, as the European Champion.[161] One of the reasons there may be differing accounts of the eventual winner is attributable to a minor controversy with the final game. According to Parker Brothers' Randolph \\"Ranny\\" P. Barton,[162] an error was made by one of the participants and a protest was filed by an opponent. The judges (Barton, Watson, and a representative from Miro, the French publishers of Monopoly) weighed the options of starting the final game over and delaying the chartered plane that would take them home from Iceland vs allowing the game to stand with the error but allowing them to make their flight. In the end, the judges upheld the result of the game with the error uncorrected.\\r\\nVictor Watson and Ranny Barton began holding tournaments in the UK and US, respectively. World Champions were declared in the United States in 1973 and 1974 (and are still considered official World Champions by Hasbro). While the 1973 tournament, the first, matched three United States regional champions against the UK champion and thus could be argued as the first international tournament, true multinational international tournaments were first held in 1975.[163] Both authors (Orbanes and Brandreth) agree that John Mair was the first true World Champion, as decided in tournament play held in Washington, D.C. days after the conclusion of the European Championship (which Mair had also won), in November 1975.[164]\\r\\nBy 1982, tournaments in the United States featured a competition between tournament winners in all 50 states, competing to become the United States Champion. National tournaments were held in the US and UK the year before World Championships through 2003ÿ2004 but during the same year as of 2009 (see table, below). The determination of the US champion was changed for the 2003 tournament: winners of an Internet-based quiz challenge were selected to compete, rather than one state champion for each of the 50 states.[165] The tournaments are now typically held every six years. In the past, the US edition Monopoly board was used at the World championship level, while national variants are used at the national level.[166] Since true international play began in 1975, no World champion has come from the US, still considered the board game's \\"birthplace.\\" However, Dana Terman, two-time US Champion, placed second at the 1980 World Championship, Richard Marinaccio, the 2009 US Champion, placed third at the 2009 World Championship, and Brian Valentine, the 2015 US Representative, placed third at the 2015 World Championship.\\r\\nNicol Falcone of Italy defeated players from 27 countries plus the defending champion in the 2015 World Championship held at The Venetian resort in Macau.[167][168]\\r\\nThe original hand made editions of the Monopoly game had been localized for the cities or areas in which it was played, and Parker Brothers has continued this practice. Their version of Monopoly has been produced for international markets, with the place names being localized for cities including London and Paris and for countries including the Netherlands and Germany, among others. By 1982, Parker Brothers stated that the game \\"has been translated into over 15 languages....\\"[182] In 2009, Hasbro reported that Monopoly is officially published in 27 languages, and has been licensed by them in 81 countries.[183] As of January 2013, Hasbro states that the game is now available in 43 languages and 111 countries.[184]\\r\\nThe game has also inspired official spin-offs, such as the board game Advance to Boardwalk from 1985. There have been six card games: Water Works from 1972, Free Parking from 1988, Express Monopoly from 1993, Monopoly: The Card Game from 1999, Monopoly Deal from 2008 and Monopoly Millionaire Deal from 2012. Finally, there have been two dice games: Don't Go to Jail from 1991 and an update, Monopoly Express, (2006ÿ2007). A second product line of games and licenses exists in Monopoly Junior, first published in 1990. In the late 1980s, official editions of Monopoly appeared for the Sega Master System and the Commodore 64 and Commodore 128.[185] A television game show, produced by King World Productions, was attempted in the summer of 1990, but lasted for only 12 episodes. In 1991ÿ1992, official versions appeared for the Apple Macintosh and Nintendo's NES, SNES, and Game Boy.[186] In 1995, as Hasbro (which had taken over Kenner Parker Tonka in 1991) was preparing to launch Hasbro Interactive as a new brand, they chose Monopoly and Trivial Pursuit to be their first two CD-ROM games.[187] The Monopoly CD-ROM game also allowed for play over the Internet.[188] CD-ROM versions of the officially licensed Star Wars and FIFA World Cup '98 editions also were released.[189] Later CD-ROM exclusive spin-offs, Monopoly Casino and Monopoly Tycoon, were also produced under license.\\r\\nVarious manufacturers of the game have created dozens of officially licensed versions, in which the names of the properties and other elements of the game are replaced by others according to the game's theme. The first such license was awarded in 1994, to the company that became USAopoly, starting with a San Diego edition of Monopoly and later including themes such as national parks, Star Trek, Star Wars, Nintendo, Disney characters, Pokmon, Peanuts, various particular cities (such as Las Vegas and New York City), states, colleges and universities, the World Cup, NASCAR, individual professional sports teams, and many others.[190] USAopoly also sells special corporate editions of Monopoly.[191] Official corporate editions have been produced for Best Buy, the Boy Scouts of America, FedEx, and UPS, among others.[192] In 1995, a second license was awarded to Winning Moves Games in Massachusetts.[193] Winning Moves has produced a new board game and card games based on Monopoly in the United States. Winning Moves also produces official localized editions of the game in the UK, France, Germany and Australia.[194][195][196][197] The Doctor Who 50th Anniversary Edition Monopoly is a special case, having been originally produced by Winning Moves in the UK, and resold by USAopoly within the US.[198] A third license was awarded in 2000 by Hasbro to Winning Solutions, Inc., which produces specialty deluxe editions mostly for sale by specialized retailers.[199] Other licensed localized editions of the game are being published in Nigeria and The Netherlands, among other locations.[200][201]\\r\\nWhen creating some of the modern licensed editions, such as the Looney Tunes and The Powerpuff Girls editions of Monopoly, Hasbro included special variant rules to be played in the theme of the licensed property. Infogrames, which has published a CD-ROM edition of Monopoly, also includes the selection of \\"house rules\\" as a possible variant of play. Electronic Arts, which publishes current electronic versions of the game, such as for the Nintendo Wii, also includes the selection of certain house rules.\\r\\nUnofficial versions of the game, which share some of the same playing features, but also incorporate changes so as not to infringe on copyrights, have been created by firms such as Late for the Sky Production Company and Help on Board. These are done for smaller cities, sometimes as charity fundraisers, and some have been created for college and university campuses. Others have non-geographical themes such as Wine-opoly and Chocolate-opoly. There is also a version called Make Your Own -OPOLY, which allows you to customize all the game equipment and rules to your liking.[202]\\r\\nBefore the creation of Hasbro Interactive, and after its later sale to Infogrames, official computer and video game versions have been made available on many platforms. In addition to the versions listed above, they have been produced for Amiga, BBC Micro, Game Boy Advance, Game Boy Color, GameCube, PC, Nintendo 64, PlayStation, PlayStation 2, Sega Genesis, Xbox, and mobile phones. A version for Windows CE was planned in 1999.[203] A handheld electronic game was first released in 1998 that allowed for one human player against up to three player-selected or randomly chosen AI \\"personalities\\" out of five.[204] A Nintendo DS release (along with Battleship, Boggle, and Yahtzee) has been published (by Atari), as well as a stand-alone edition for the same console (by EA). In 2001, Stern Pinball, Inc. released a pinball machine version of Monopoly, designed by Pat Lawlor.[205]\\r\\nThe official Parker Brothers rules and board remained largely unchanged from 1936 to 2008. Ralph Anspach argued against this during an on-air conversation with The Monopoly Book author Maxine Brady in 1975, calling it an end to \\"steady progress\\" and an impediment to progress.[206] Several authors who have written about the board game have noted many of the \\"house rules\\" that have become common among players, although they do not appear in Parker Brothers' rules sheets. Gyles Brandreth included a section titled \\"Monopoly Variations,\\" Tim Moore notes several such rules used in his household in his Foreword, Phil Orbanes included his own section of variations, and Maxine Brady noted a few in her preface.[207][208][209][210] Authors Noel Gunther and Richard Hutton published Beyond Boardwalk and Park Place in 1986, as a guide, per the cover, \\"to making Monopoly fun again\\", by introducing new variations of rules and strategies.[211] R. Wayne Schmittberger, a former editor of Games magazine, acknowledged the work of Gunther and Hutton in his own 1992 guide New Rules for Classic Games (which includes several pages of Monopoly variations and suggestions that vary from the standard rules of the game).[212]\\r\\nStarting in 1974, Parker Brothers and its then corporate parent, General Mills, attempted to suppress publication of a game called Anti-Monopoly, designed by San Francisco State University economics professor Ralph Anspach and first published the previous year.[18] Anspach began to research the game's history, and argued that the copyrights and trademarks held by Parker Brothers should be nullified, as the game came out of the public domain. Among other things, Anspach discovered the empty 1933 Charles B. Darrow file at the United States Copyright Office, testimony from the Inflation game case that was settled out of court, and letters from Knapp Electric challenging Parker Brothers over Monopoly. As the case went to trial in November 1976, Anspach produced testimony by many involved with the early development of the game, including Catherine and Willard Allphin, Dorothea Raiford and Charles Todd. Willard Allphin attempted to sell a version of the game to Milton Bradley in 1931, and published an article about the game's early history in the UK in 1975.[213] Raiford had helped Ruth Hoskins produce the early Atlantic City games.[214] Even Daniel Layman was interviewed, and Darrow's widow was deposed.[215][216] The presiding judge, Spencer Williams, originally ruled for Parker Brothers/General Mills in 1977, allowing the Monopoly trademark to stand, and allowing the companies to destroy copies of Anspach's Anti-Monopoly.[10][217] Anspach appealed.\\r\\nIn December 1979, the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled in favor of Professor Anspach, with an opinion that agreed with the facts about the game's history and differed from Parker Brothers' \\"official\\" account.[218] The court also upheld a \\"purchasing motivation\\" test (described in the decision as a \\"Genericness Doctrine\\"), a \\"test by which the trademark was valid only if consumers, when they asked for a Monopoly game, meant that they wanted Parker Brothers' version....\\"[218][219] This had the effect of potentially nullifying the Monopoly trademark, and the court returned the case to Judge Williams.[218] Williams heard the case again in 1980, and in 1981 he again held for Parker Brothers.[220] Anspach appealed again, and in August 1982 the appeals court again reversed.[221][222] The case was then appealed by General Mills/Parker Brothers to the United States Supreme Court, which decided not to hear the case in February 1983, and denied a petition for rehearing in April.[223] This allowed the appeals court's decision to stand and further allowed Anspach to resume publication of his game.[224][225]\\r\\nWith the trademark nullified, the name \\"Monopoly\\" entered the public domain, where the naming of games was concerned, and a profusion of non-Parker-Brothers variants were published. Parker Brothers and other firms lobbied the United States Congress and obtained a revision of the trademark laws.[219][226][227] The case was finally settled in 1985, with Monopoly remaining a valid trademark of Parker Brothers, and Anspach assigning the Anti-Monopoly trademark to the company but retaining the ability to use it under license.[10][228] Anspach received compensation for court costs and the destroyed copies of his game, as well as unspecified damages. He was allowed to resume publication with a legal disclaimer.[229] Anspach later self-published a book about his research and legal fights with General Mills, Kenner Parker Toys, and Hasbro.\\r\\nParker Brothers/Hasbro now claims trademark rights to the name and its variants, and has asserted it against others such as the publishers of Ghettopoly.[230][231] Professor Anspach assigned the Anti-Monopoly trademark back to Parker Brothers, and Hasbro now owns it.[10] Anspach's game remains in print. The previous publishers were a company called Talicor,[232] but the game is currently distributed and sold by University Games worldwide.[233][234][235][236]\\r\\nVarious patents have existed on the game of Monopoly and its predecessors, such as The Landlord's Game, but all have now expired. The specific graphics of the game board, cards, and pieces are protected by copyright law and trademark law, as is the specific wording of the game's rules.\\r\\nParker Brothers created a few accessories and licensed a few products shortly after it began publishing the game in 1935. These included a money pad and the first stock exchange add-on in 1936, a birthday card, and a song by Charles Tobias (lyrics) and John Jacob Loeb (music).[237][238] At the conclusion of the Anti-Monopoly case, Kenner Parker Toys began to seek trademarks on the design elements of Monopoly. It was at this time that the game's main logo was redesigned to feature \\"Rich Uncle Pennybags\\" (now \\"Mr. Monopoly\\") reaching out from the second \\"O\\" in the word Monopoly.[239] To commemorate the game's 50th anniversary in 1985, the company commissioned artist Lou Brooks to redesign and illustrate the main logo as a red street sign-like banner, as well as the character Rich Uncle Pennybags reaching out of the \\"O.\\" Brooks was also hired at the time to develop and illustrate the game's special \\"Commemorative Edition\\" embossed tin box packaging. The art was also carried over onto the more traditional cardboard game box which was revised for the anniversary.[240][241]\\r\\nAll items stamped with the red MONOPOLY logo also feature the word \\"Brand\\" in small print. In the mid-1980s, after the success of the first \\"collector's tin anniversary edition\\" (for the 50th anniversary), an edition of the game was produced by the Franklin Mint, the first edition to be published outside Parker Brothers. At about the same time, McDonald's started its first Monopoly game promotions, considered the company's most successful, which continue to the present.[242] The twentieth such promotion was sponsored in 2012.[243]\\r\\nIn recent years, the Monopoly brand has been licensed onto a line of slot machines built by WMS Gaming (first introduced in 1998, six models had been made by 2000, and over 20 by 2005).[244][245][246] The slots were named \\"Most Innovative Gaming Product in 1999 and voted \\"most popular\\" in 2001.[247][248] The brand has also been licensed onto instant-win lottery tickets, and lines of 1:64 scale model cars produced by Johnny Lightning, which also included collectible game tokens.[249][250] Other licenses have been issued for clothing and accessories, including a line of bathroom accessories.[251] Licensee Winning Moves Games also had a Monopoly Calculator that could be used as a standard calculator, or used to aid in transactions during a game.[252]","input":"What did the original game of monopoly portray?"},{"output":"D.E Protzmann and others on October 23, 1956,","context":"A digital clock is a type of clock that displays the time digitally (i.e. in numerals or other symbols), as opposed to an analog clock, where the time is indicated by the positions of rotating hands.\\r\\nDigital clocks are often associated with electronic drives, but the \\"digital\\" description refers only to the display, not to the drive mechanism. (Both analog and digital clocks can be driven either mechanically or electronically, but \\"clockwork\\" mechanisms with digital displays are rare.) The biggest digital clock is the Lichtzelt Pegel (\\"Light Time Level\\") on the television tower Rheinturm Dsseldorf, Germany.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe first digital pocket watch was the invention of Austrian engineer Josef Pallweber who created his \\"jump-hour\\" mechanism in 1883. Instead of a conventional dial, the jump-hour featured two windows in an enamel dial, through which the hours and minutes are visible on rotating discs. The second hand remained conventional. By 1885 Pallweber mechanism was already on the market in pocket watches by Cortbert and IWC; arguably contributing to the subsequent rise and commercial success of IWC. The principles of Pallweber jump-hour movement had appeared in wristwatches by the 1920s (Cortbert) and are still used today (Chronoswiss Digiteur). While the original inventor didn't have a watch brand at the time, his name has since been resurrected by a newly established watch manufacturer.[1]\\r\\nPlato clocks used a similar idea but a different layout. These spring-wound pieces consisted of a glass cylinder with a column inside, affixed to which were small digital cards with numbers printed on them, which flipped as time passed. The Plato clocks were introduced at the St. Louis World Fair in 1904, produced by Ansonia Clock Company. Eugene Fitch of New York patented the clock design in 1903.[2] 13 years earlier Josef Pallweber had patented the same invention using digital cards (different from his 1885 patent using moving disks) in Germany (DRP No. 54093).[3] The German factory Aktiengesellschaft fr Uhrenfabrikation Lenzkirch made such digital clocks in 1893 and 1894.[4]\\r\\nThe earliest patent for a digital alarm clock was registered by D.E Protzmann and others on October 23, 1956, in the United States. Protzmann and his associates also patented another digital clock in 1970, which was said to use a minimal amount of moving parts. Two side-plates held digital numerals between them, while an electric motor and cam gear outside controlled movement.[2]\\r\\nIn 1970, the first digital wristwatch with an LED display was mass-produced. Called the Pulsar, and produced by the Hamilton Watch Company, this watch was hinted at two years prior when the same company created a prototype digital watch for Kubrick's 2001: A Space Odyssey.[5] Throughout the 1970s, despite the initial hefty cost of digital watches, the popularity of said devices steadily rose.\\r\\nOver the years, many different types of digital alarm clocks have been developed.\\r\\nIn Soviet Russia, the 7-segment digital clocks were known as Elektronika 7.\\r\\nDigital clocks typically use the 50 or 60 hertz oscillation of AC power or a 32,768 hertz crystal oscillator as in a quartz clock to keep time. Most digital clocks display the hour of the day in 24-hour format; in the United States and a few other countries, a more commonly used hour sequence option is 12-hour format[citation needed] (with some indication of AM or PM). Some timepieces, such as many digital watches, can be switched between 12-hour and 24-hour modes. Emulations of analog-style faces often use an LCD screen, and these are also sometimes described as \\"digital\\".\\r\\nTo represent the time, most digital clocks use a seven-segment LED, VFD, or LCD for each of four digits. They generally also include other elements to indicate whether the time is AM or PM, whether or not an alarm is set, and so on.\\r\\nIf people find difficulty in setting the time in some designs of digital clocks in electronic devices where the clock is not a critical function, they may not be set at all, displaying the default after powered on, 00:00 or 12:00.[6][7]\\r\\nDigital clocks that run on mains electricity and have no battery must be reset every time the power has an accident or if they are moved. Even if power is cut off for a second, most clocks will still have to be reset. This is a particular problem with alarm clocks that have no \\"battery\\" backup, because even a very brief power outage during the night usually results in the clock failing to trigger the alarm in the morning.\\r\\nTo reduce the problem, many devices designed to operate on household electricity incorporate a battery backup to maintain the time during power outages and during times of disconnection from the power supply. More recently, some devices incorporate a method for automatically setting the time, such as using a broadcast radio time signal from an atomic clock, getting the time from an existing satellite television or computer connection, or by being set at the factory and then maintaining the time from then on with a quartz movement powered by an internal rechargeable battery. Commercial digital clocks are typically more reliable than consumer clocks. Multi-decade backup batteries can be used to maintain time during power loss.","input":"When was the first digital alarm clock invented?"},{"output":"between 1937 and 1949","context":"The Lord of the Rings is an epic high fantasy novel written by English author and scholar J. R. R. Tolkien. The story began as a sequel to Tolkien's 1937 fantasy novel The Hobbit, but eventually developed into a much larger work. Written in stages between 1937 and 1949, The Lord of the Rings is one of the best-selling novels ever written, with over 150 million copies sold.[1]\\r\\nThe title of the novel refers to the story's main antagonist, the Dark Lord Sauron,[note 1] who had in an earlier age created the One Ring to rule the other Rings of Power as the ultimate weapon in his campaign to conquer and rule all of Middle-earth. From quiet beginnings in the Shire, a hobbit land not unlike the English countryside, the story ranges across Middle-earth, following the course of the War of the Ring through the eyes of its characters, not only the hobbits Frodo Baggins, Samwise \\"Sam\\" Gamgee, Meriadoc \\"Merry\\" Brandybuck and Peregrin \\"Pippin\\" Took, but also the hobbits' chief allies and travelling companions: the Men, Aragorn son of Arathorn, a Ranger of the North, and Boromir, a Captain of Gondor; Gimli son of Gl܇in, a Dwarf warrior; Legolas Greenleaf, an Elven prince; and Gandalf, a wizard.\\r\\nThe work was initially intended by Tolkien to be one volume of a two-volume set, the other to be The Silmarillion, but this idea was dismissed by his publisher.[3][4] For economic reasons, The Lord of the Rings was published in three volumes over the course of a year from 29 July 1954 to 20 October 1955.[3][5] The three volumes were titled The Fellowship of the Ring, The Two Towers and The Return of the King. Structurally, the novel is divided internally into six books, two per volume, with several appendices of background material included at the end. Some editions combine the entire work into a single volume. The Lord of the Rings has since been reprinted numerous times and translated into 38 languages.\\r\\nTolkien's work has been the subject of extensive analysis of its themes and origins. Although a major work in itself, the story was only the last movement of a larger epic Tolkien had worked on since 1917,[6] in a process he described as mythopoeia.[note 2] Influences on this earlier work, and on the story of The Lord of the Rings, include philology, mythology, religion and the author's distaste for the effects of industrialization, as well as earlier fantasy works and Tolkien's experiences in World War I.[8] The Lord of the Rings in its turn is considered to have had a great effect on modern fantasy; the impact of Tolkien's works is such that the use of the words \\"Tolkienian\\" and \\"Tolkienesque\\" have been recorded in the Oxford English Dictionary.[9]\\r\\nThe enduring popularity of The Lord of the Rings has led to numerous references in popular culture, the founding of many societies by fans of Tolkien's works,[10] and the publication of many books about Tolkien and his works. The Lord of the Rings has inspired, and continues to inspire, artwork, music, films and television, video games, board games, and subsequent literature. Award-winning adaptations of The Lord of the Rings have been made for radio, theatre, and film.[11] In 2003, it was named Britain's best-loved novel of all time in the BBC's The Big Read.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThousands of years before the events of the novel, the Dark Lord Sauron had forged the One Ring to rule the other Rings of Power and corrupt those who wore them: the leaders of Men, Elves and Dwarves. Sauron was defeated by an alliance of Elves and Men led by Gil-galad and Elendil, respectively. In the final battle, Isildur, son of Elendil, cut the One Ring from Sauron's finger, causing Sauron to lose his physical form. Isildur claimed the Ring as an heirloom for his line, but when he was later ambushed and killed by the Orcs, the Ring was lost in the River Anduin.\\r\\nOver two thousand years later, the Ring was found by one of the river-folk called Dagol. His friend[12] Smagol fell under the Ring's influence and strangled Dagol to acquire it. Smagol was banished and hid under the Misty Mountains. The Ring gave him long life and changed him over hundreds of years into a twisted, corrupted creature called Gollum. Gollum lost the Ring, his \\"precious\\", and as told in The Hobbit, Bilbo Baggins found it. Meanwhile, Sauron assumed a new form and took back his old realm of Mordor. When Gollum set out in search of the Ring, he was captured and tortured by Sauron. Sauron learned from Gollum that \\"Baggins\\" of the Shire had taken the Ring. Gollum was set loose. Sauron, who needed the Ring to regain his full power, sent forth his powerful servants, the Nazg?l, to seize it.\\r\\nThe story begins in the Shire, where the hobbit Frodo Baggins inherits the Ring from Bilbo Baggins, his cousin[note 3] and guardian. Neither hobbit is aware of the Ring's nature, but Gandalf the Grey, a wizard and an old friend of Bilbo, suspects it to be Sauron's Ring. Seventeen years later, after Gandalf confirms his guess, he tells Frodo the history of the Ring and counsels him to take it away from the Shire. Frodo sets out, accompanied by his gardener, servant and friend, Samwise (\\"Sam\\") Gamgee, and two cousins, Meriadoc \\"Merry\\" Brandybuck and Peregrin \\"Pippin\\" Took. They are nearly caught by the Black Riders, but shake off their pursuers by cutting through the Old Forest. There they are aided by Tom Bombadil, a strange and merry fellow who lives with his wife Goldberry in the forest.\\r\\nThe hobbits reach the town of Bree, where they encounter a Ranger named Strider, whom Gandalf had mentioned in a letter. Strider persuades the hobbits to take him on as their guide and protector. Together, they leave Bree after another close escape from the Black Riders. On the hill of Weathertop, they are again attacked by the Black Riders, who wound Frodo with a cursed blade. Strider fights them off and leads the hobbits towards the Elven refuge of Rivendell. Frodo falls deathly ill from the wound. The Black Riders nearly capture him at the Ford of Bruinen, but flood waters summoned by Elrond, master of Rivendell, rise up and overwhelm them.\\r\\nFrodo recovers in Rivendell under Elrond's care. The Council of Elrond discusses the history of Sauron and the Ring. Strider is revealed to be Aragorn, Isildur's heir. Gandalf reports that Sauron has corrupted Saruman, chief of the wizards. The Council decides that the Ring must be destroyed, but that can only be done by sending it to the Fire of Mount Doom in Mordor, where it was forged. Frodo takes this task upon himself. Elrond, with the advice of Gandalf, chooses companions for him. The Company of the Ring are nine in number: Frodo, Sam, Merry, Pippin, Aragorn, Gandalf, Gimli the Dwarf, Legolas the Elf, and the Man Boromir, son of Denethor, the Ruling Steward of the land of Gondor.\\r\\nAfter a failed attempt to cross the Misty Mountains through the Redhorn Pass, the Company are forced to take a perilous path through the Mines of Moria. They are attacked by the Watcher in the Water before the doors of Moria. Inside Moria, they learn of the fate of Balin and his colony of Dwarves. After surviving an attack, they are pursued by Orcs and by an ancient demon called a Balrog. Gandalf faces the Balrog, and both of them fall into the abyss. The others escape and find refuge in the Elven forest of Lothl܇rien, where they are counselled by its rulers, Galadriel and Celeborn.\\r\\nWith boats and gifts from Galadriel, the Company travel down the River Anduin to the hill of Amon Hen. There, Boromir tries to take the Ring from Frodo, but Frodo puts it on and disappears. Frodo chooses to go alone to Mordor, but Sam guesses what he intends and goes with him.\\r\\nOrcs sent by Saruman and Sauron kill Boromir and capture Merry and Pippin. Aragorn, Gimli and Legolas debate which pair of hobbits to follow. They decide to pursue the Orcs taking Merry and Pippin to Saruman. In the kingdom of Rohan, the Orcs are slain by a company of Rohirrim. Merry and Pippin escape into Fangorn Forest, where they are befriended by Treebeard, the oldest of the tree-like Ents. Aragorn, Gimli and Legolas track the hobbits to Fangorn. There they unexpectedly meet Gandalf. Gandalf explains that he slew the Balrog; darkness took him, but he was sent back to Middle-earth to complete his mission. He is clothed in white and is now Gandalf the White, for he has taken Saruman's place as the chief of the wizards. Gandalf assures his friends that Merry and Pippin are safe. Together they ride to Edoras, capital of Rohan. Gandalf frees Thoden, King of Rohan, from the influence of Saruman's spy Grma Wormtongue. Thoden musters his fighting strength and rides with his men to the ancient fortress of Helm's Deep, while Gandalf departs to seek help from Treebeard.\\r\\nMeanwhile, the Ents, roused by Merry and Pippin from their peaceful ways, attack Isengard, Saruman's stronghold, and trap the wizard in the tower of Orthanc. Gandalf convinces Treebeard to send an army of Huorns to Thoden's aid. Gandalf brings an army of Rohirrim to Helm's Deep, and they defeat the Orcs, who flee into the \\"forest\\" of Huorns, never to be seen again. Gandalf offers Saruman a chance to turn away from evil. When Saruman refuses to listen, Gandalf strips him of his rank and most of his powers. After Saruman crawls back to his prison, Wormtongue drops a sphere to try and kill Gandalf. Pippin picks it up; it is revealed to be a palantr, a seeing-stone that Saruman used to speak with Sauron and through which Saruman was ensnared. Pippin is seen by Sauron. Gandalf rides for Minas Tirith, chief city of Gondor, taking Pippin with him.\\r\\nFrodo and Sam capture Gollum, who has followed them from Moria. They force him to guide them to Mordor. They find that the Black Gate of Mordor is too well guarded, so instead they travel to a secret way Gollum knows. On the way, they encounter Faramir, who, unlike his brother Boromir, resists the temptation to seize the Ring. Gollum ÿ who is torn between his loyalty to Frodo and his desire for the Ring ÿ betrays Frodo by leading him to the great spider Shelob in the tunnels of Cirith Ungol. Frodo falls to Shelob's sting. But with the help of Galadriel's gifts, Sam fights off the spider. Believing Frodo to be dead, Sam takes the Ring to continue the quest alone. Orcs find Frodo; Sam overhears them and learns that Frodo is still alive.\\r\\nSauron sends a great army against Gondor. Gandalf arrives at Minas Tirith to warn Denethor of the attack, while Thoden musters the Rohirrim to ride to Gondor's aid. Minas Tirith is besieged. Denethor is deceived by Sauron and falls into despair. He burns himself alive on a pyre, nearly taking his son Faramir with him. Aragorn, accompanied by Legolas, Gimli and the Rangers of the North, takes the Paths of the Dead to recruit the Dead Men of Dunharrow, who are bound by a curse which denies them rest until they fulfil their ancient forsworn oath to fight for the King of Gondor. Following Aragorn, the Army of the Dead strikes terror into the Corsairs of Umbar invading southern Gondor. Aragorn defeats the Corsairs and uses their ships to transport the men of southern Gondor up the Anduin, reaching Minas Tirith just in time to turn the tide of battle. owyn, Thoden's niece, slays the Lord of the Nazg?l with help from Merry. Together, Gondor and Rohan defeat Sauron's army in the Battle of the Pelennor Fields, though at great cost. Thoden is slain, and owyn and Merry are injured.\\r\\nMeanwhile, Sam rescues Frodo from the tower of Cirith Ungol. They set out across Mordor. Aragorn leads an army of men from Gondor and Rohan to march on the Black Gate to distract Sauron from his true danger. His army is vastly outnumbered by the great might of Sauron. Frodo and Sam reach the edge of the Cracks of Doom, but Frodo cannot resist the Ring any longer. He claims it for himself and puts it on his finger. Gollum suddenly reappears. He struggles with Frodo and bites off Frodo's finger with the Ring still on it. Celebrating wildly, Gollum loses his footing and falls into the Fire, taking the Ring with him. When the Ring is destroyed, Sauron loses his power forever. All he created collapses, the Nazg?l perish, and his armies are thrown into such disarray that Aragorn's forces emerge victorious.\\r\\nAragorn is crowned Elessar, King of Arnor and Gondor, and weds Arwen, daughter of Elrond. The four hobbits make their way back to the Shire, only to find out that it has been taken over by men led by Sharkey. The hobbits raise a rebellion and liberate the Shire, though 19 hobbits are killed and 30 wounded. Sharkey turns out to be Saruman. Frodo stops the hobbits from killing the wizard after Saruman attempts to stab Frodo, but Grma turns on Saruman and kills him in front of Bag End, Frodo's home. He is slain in turn by hobbit archers, and the War of the Ring comes to its true end on Frodo's very doorstep.\\r\\nMerry and Pippin are celebrated as heroes. Sam marries Rosie Cotton and uses his gifts from Galadriel to help heal the Shire. But Frodo is still wounded in body and spirit, having borne the Ring for so long. A few years later, in the company of Bilbo and Gandalf, Frodo sails from the Grey Havens west over the Sea to the Undying Lands to find peace.\\r\\nIn the appendices, Sam gives his daughter Elanor the Red Book of Westmarch, which contains the story of Bilbo's adventures and the War of the Ring as witnessed by the hobbits. Sam is then said to have crossed west over the Sea himself, the last of the Ring-bearers.\\r\\nSome characters in The Lord of the Rings are unequivocal protagonists, and others are absolute antagonists. However despite criticism that the book's characters \\"are all either black or white\\", some of the 'good' characters have darker sides that feature in the story, and likewise some of the villains have \\"good impulses\\".[13] Therefore the categorization of characters as either 'protagonists' or 'antagonists' below indicates their general role in the story.\\r\\nThe Lord of the Rings started as a sequel to J. R. R. Tolkien's work The Hobbit, published in 1937.[15] The popularity of The Hobbit had led George Allen & Unwin, the publishers, to request a sequel. Tolkien warned them that he wrote quite slowly, and responded with several stories he had already developed. Having rejected his contemporary drafts for The Silmarillion, putting on hold Roverandom, and accepting Farmer Giles of Ham, Allen & Unwin thought more stories about hobbits would be popular.[16] So at the age of 45, Tolkien began writing the story that would become The Lord of the Rings. The story would not be finished until 12 years later, in 1949, and would not be fully published until 1955, when Tolkien was 63 years old.\\r\\nPersuaded by his publishers, he started \\"a new Hobbit\\" in December 1937.[15] After several false starts, the story of the One Ring emerged. The idea for the first chapter (\\"A Long-Expected Party\\") arrived fully formed, although the reasons behind Bilbo's disappearance, the significance of the Ring, and the title The Lord of the Rings did not arrive until the spring of 1938.[15] Originally, he planned to write a story in which Bilbo had used up all his treasure and was looking for another adventure to gain more; however, he remembered the Ring and its powers and thought that would be a better focus for the new work.[15] As the story progressed, he also brought in elements from The Silmarillion mythology.[17]\\r\\nWriting was slow, because Tolkien had a full-time academic position, and needed to earn further money as a university examiner.[18] Tolkien abandoned The Lord of the Rings during most of 1943 and only restarted it in April 1944,[15] as a serial for his son Christopher Tolkien, who was sent chapters as they were written while he was serving in South Africa with the Royal Air Force. Tolkien made another concerted effort in 1946, and showed the manuscript to his publishers in 1947.[15] The story was effectively finished the next year, but Tolkien did not complete the revision of earlier parts of the work until 1949.[15] The original manuscripts, which total 9,250 pages, now reside in the J. R. R. Tolkien Collection at Marquette University.[19]\\r\\nThe influence of the Welsh language, which Tolkien had learned, is summarized in his essay English and Welsh: \\"If I may once more refer to my work. The Lord of the Rings, in evidence: the names of persons and places in this story were mainly composed on patterns deliberately modelled on those of Welsh (closely similar but not identical). This element in the tale has given perhaps more pleasure to more readers than anything else in it.\\"[21]\\r\\nThe Lord of the Rings developed as a personal exploration by Tolkien of his interests in philology, religion (particularly Roman Catholicism[22]), fairy tales, Norse and general Germanic mythology,[23][24] and also Celtic,[25][better?source?needed] Slavic,[26][27][28] Persian,[29] Greek,[30] and Finnish mythology.[31] Tolkien acknowledged, and external critics have verified, the influences of George MacDonald and William Morris[32] and the Anglo-Saxon poem Beowulf.[33] The question of a direct influence of Wagner's The Nibelung's Ring on Tolkien's work is debated by critics.\\r\\nTolkien included neither any explicit religion nor cult in his work. Rather the themes, moral philosophy, and cosmology of The Lord of the Rings reflect his Catholic worldview. In one of his letters Tolkien states, \\"The Lord of the Rings is of course a fundamentally religious and Catholic work; unconsciously so at first, but consciously in the revision. That is why I have not put in, or have cut out, practically all references to anything like 'religion', to cults or practices, in the imaginary world. For the religious element is absorbed into the story and the symbolism.\\"[22]\\r\\nSome locations and characters were inspired by Tolkien's childhood in Birmingham, where he first lived near Sarehole Mill, and later near Edgbaston Reservoir.[34] There are also hints of the Black Country, which is within easy reach of north west Edgbaston. This shows in such names as \\"Underhill\\", and the description of Saruman's industrialization of Isengard and The Shire. It has also been suggested that The Shire and its surroundings were based on the countryside around Stonyhurst College in Lancashire where Tolkien frequently stayed during the 1940s.[35] The work was influenced by the effects of his military service during World War I, to the point that Frodo has been \\"diagnosed\\" as suffering from Posttraumatic Stress Disorder, or \\"shell-shock\\", which was first diagnosed under that name at the Battle of the Somme, at which Tolkien served.[36]\\r\\nA dispute with his publisher, George Allen & Unwin, led to the book being offered to Collins in 1950. Tolkien intended The Silmarillion (itself largely unrevised at this point) to be published along with The Lord of the Rings, but A&U were unwilling to do this. After Milton Waldman, his contact at Collins, expressed the belief that The Lord of the Rings itself \\"urgently wanted cutting\\", Tolkien eventually demanded that they publish the book in 1952.[37] Collins did not; and so Tolkien wrote to Allen and Unwin, saying, \\"I would gladly consider the publication of any part of the stuff\\", fearing his work would never see the light of day.[15]\\r\\nFor publication, the book was divided into three volumes to minimize any potential financial loss due to the high cost of type-setting and modest anticipated sales: The Fellowship of the Ring (Books I and II), The Two Towers (Books III and IV), and The Return of the King (Books V and VI plus six appendices).[38] Delays in producing appendices, maps and especially an index led to the volumes being published later than originally hoped?ÿ on 29 July 1954, on 11 November 1954 and on 20 October 1955 respectively in the United Kingdom. In the United States, Houghton Mifflin published The Fellowship of the Ring on 21 October 1954, The Two Towers on 21 April 1955, and The Return of the King on 5 January 1956.[39] The Return of the King was especially delayed due to Tolkien revising the ending and preparing appendices (some of which had to be left out because of space constraints). Tolkien did not like the title The Return of the King, believing it gave away too much of the storyline, but deferred to his publisher's preference. He suggested the title The Two Towers in a deliberately ambiguous attempt to link the unconnected books III and IV, and as such the eponymous towers could be either Orthanc and Barad-d?r, or Minas Tirith and Barad-d?r, or Orthanc and Cirith Ungol.\\r\\nTolkien was initially opposed to titles being given to each two-book volume, preferring instead the use of book titles: e.g. The Lord of the Rings: Vol. 1, The Ring Sets Out and The Ring Goes South; Vol. 2, The Treason of Isengard and The Ring Goes East; Vol. 3, The War of the Ring and The End of the Third Age. However these individual book titles were later scrapped, and after pressure from his publishers, Tolkien initially suggested the titles: Vol. 1, The Shadow Grows; Vol. 2, The Ring in the Shadow; Vol. 3, The War of the Ring or The Return of the King.[40][41]\\r\\nThe books were published under a profit-sharing arrangement, whereby Tolkien would not receive an advance or royalties until the books had broken even, after which he would take a large share of the profits.[42] It has ultimately become one of the best-selling novels ever written, with over 150 million copies sold.[1]\\r\\nThe book was published in the UK by Allen & Unwin until 1990 when the publisher and its assets were acquired by HarperCollins.[43][44]\\r\\nIn the early 1960s Donald A. Wollheim, science fiction editor of the paperback publisher Ace Books, claimed that The Lord of the Rings was not protected in the United States under American copyright law because Houghton Mifflin, the US hardcover publisher, had neglected to copyright the work in the United States.[45][46] Then, in 1965, Ace Books proceeded to publish an edition, unauthorized by Tolkien and without paying royalties to him. Tolkien took issue with this and quickly notified his fans of this objection.[47] Grass-roots pressure from these fans became so great that Ace Books withdrew their edition and made a nominal payment to Tolkien.[48][49] Authorized editions followed from Ballantine Books and Houghton Mifflin to tremendous commercial success. Tolkien undertook various textual revisions to produce a version of the book that would be published with his consent and establish an unquestioned US copyright. This text became the Second Edition of The Lord of the Rings, published in 1965.[48] The first Ballantine paperback edition was printed in October that year, and sold a quarter of a million copies within ten months. On September 4, 1966, the novel debuted on New York Times' Paperback Bestsellers list as number three, and was number one by December 4, a position it held for eight weeks.[50] Houghton Mifflin editions after 1994 consolidate variant revisions by Tolkien, and corrections supervised by Christopher Tolkien, which resulted, after some initial glitches, in a computer-based unified text.[51]\\r\\nIn 2004, for the 50th Anniversary Edition, Wayne G. Hammond and Christina Scull, under supervision from Christopher Tolkien, studied and revised the text to eliminate as many errors and inconsistencies as possible, some of which had been introduced by well-meaning compositors of the first printing in 1954, and never been corrected.[52] The 2005 edition of the book contained further corrections noticed by the editors and submitted by readers. Further corrections were added to the 60th Anniversary Edition in 2014.[53]\\r\\nSeveral editions, notably the 50th Anniversary Edition, combine all three books into one volume, with the result that pagination varies widely over the various editions.\\r\\nFrom 1988 to 1992 Christopher Tolkien published the surviving drafts of The Lord of The Rings, chronicling and illuminating with commentary the stages of the text's development, in volumes 6ÿ9 of his History of Middle-earth series. The four volumes carry the titles The Return of the Shadow, The Treason of Isengard, The War of the Ring, and Sauron Defeated.\\r\\nThe novel has been translated, with various degrees of success, into at least 56 languages.[54] Tolkien, an expert in philology, examined many of these translations, and made comments on each that reflect both the translation process and his work. As he was unhappy with some choices made by early translators, such as the Swedish translation by ?ke Ohlmarks,[55] Tolkien wrote a \\"Guide to the Names in The Lord of the Rings\\" (1967). Because The Lord of the Rings purports to be a translation of the fictitious Red Book of Westmarch, with the English language representing the Westron of the \\"original\\", Tolkien suggested that translators attempt to capture the interplay between English and the invented nomenclature of the English work, and gave several examples along with general guidance.\\r\\nWhile early reviews for The Lord of the Rings were mixed, reviews in various media have been, on the whole, highly positive and acknowledge Tolkien's literary achievement as a significant one. The initial review in the Sunday Telegraph described it as \\"among the greatest works of imaginative fiction of the twentieth century\\".[56] The Sunday Times echoed this sentiment, stating that \\"the English-speaking world is divided into those who have read The Lord of the Rings and The Hobbit and those who are going to read them\\".[56] The New York Herald Tribune also seemed to have an idea of how popular the books would become, writing in its review that they were \\"destined to outlast our time\\".[57] W. H. Auden, an admirer of Tolkien's writings, regarded The Lord of the Rings as a \\"masterpiece\\", further stating that in some cases it outdid the achievement of John Milton's Paradise Lost.[58]\\r\\nNew York Times reviewer Judith Shulevitz criticized the \\"pedantry\\" of Tolkien's literary style, saying that he \\"formulated a high-minded belief in the importance of his mission as a literary preservationist, which turns out to be death to literature itself\\".[59] Critic Richard Jenkyns, writing in The New Republic, criticized the work for a lack of psychological depth. Both the characters and the work itself are, according to Jenkyns, \\"anemic, and lacking in fibre\\".[60] Even within Tolkien's literary group, The Inklings, reviews were mixed. Hugo Dyson complained loudly at its readings.[61][62] However, another Inkling, C. S. Lewis, had very different feelings, writing, \\"here are beauties which pierce like swords or burn like cold iron. Here is a book which will break your heart.\\" Despite these reviews and its lack of paperback printing until the 1960s, The Lord of the Rings initially sold well in hardback.[6]\\r\\nIn 1957, The Lord of the Rings was awarded the International Fantasy Award. Despite its numerous detractors, the publication of the Ace Books and Ballantine paperbacks helped The Lord of the Rings become immensely popular in the United States in the 1960s. The book has remained so ever since, ranking as one of the most popular works of fiction of the twentieth century, judged by both sales and reader surveys.[63] In the 2003 \\"Big Read\\" survey conducted in Britain by the BBC, The Lord of the Rings was found to be the \\"Nation's best-loved book\\". In similar 2004 polls both Germany[64] and Australia[65] also found The Lord of the Rings to be their favourite book. In a 1999 poll of Amazon.com customers, The Lord of the Rings was judged to be their favourite \\"book of the millennium\\".[66] The Lord of the Rings was awarded the Prometheus Hall of Fame Award in 2009.\\r\\nAlthough The Lord of the Rings was published in the 1950s, Tolkien insisted that the One Ring was not an allegory for the atomic bomb,[67] nor were his works a strict allegory of any kind, but were open to interpretation as the reader saw fit.[68][69]\\r\\nA few critics have found what they consider to be racial elements in the story, generally based upon their views of how Tolkien's imagery depicts good and evil, characters' race (e.g. Elf, Dwarf, Hobbit, Southron, N~men܇rean, Orc); and that the character's race is seen as determining their behaviour.[70][71][72] Counter-arguments note that race-focused critiques often omit relevant textual evidence to the contrary,[73][74][75] cite imagery from adaptations rather than the work itself;[76] ignore the absence of evidence of racist attitudes or events in the author's personal life,[73][76][77] and claim that the perception of racism is itself a marginal view.[77]\\r\\nThe opinions that pit races against one another are likely to reflect Tolkien's critique on war rather than a racist perspective. In The Two Towers, the character Samwise sees a fallen foe and considers for a moment the humanity of this fallen Southron who, just moments before, is shown to be a man of color.[78] Director Peter Jackson considers Sam this scene in the director's commentary of the scene and argues that Tolkien isn't projecting any negative sentiments towards the individual soldier because of his race, but the evil that's driving them from their authority,[79] These sentiments, Jackson argues, were derived from Tolkien's experience in the Great War and found their way into his writings to show the evils of war itself, not of other races.\\r\\nCritics have also seen social class rather than race as being the determining factor in the portrayal of good and evil.[73] Commentators such as science fiction author David Brin have interpreted the work to hold unquestioning devotion to a traditional elitist social structure.[80] In his essay \\"Epic Pooh\\", science fiction and fantasy author Michael Moorcock critiques the world-view displayed by the book as deeply conservative, in both the \\"paternalism\\" of the narrative voice and the power-structures in the narrative.[81] Tom Shippey cites the origin of this portrayal of evil as a reflection of the prejudices of European middle-classes during the inter-war years towards the industrial working class.[82]\\r\\nOther observers have cited Christian, specifically Catholic, themes in The Lord of the Rings.[83]\\r\\nThe book has been read as fitting the model of Joseph Campbell's \\"monomyth\\".[84]\\r\\nThe Lord of the Rings has been adapted for film, radio and stage.\\r\\nThe book has been adapted for radio four times. In 1955 and 1956, the BBC broadcast The Lord of the Rings, a 13-part radio adaptation of the story. In the 1960s radio station WBAI produced a short radio adaptation. A 1979 dramatization of The Lord of the Rings was broadcast in the United States and subsequently issued on tape and CD. In 1981, the BBC broadcast The Lord of the Rings, a new dramatization in 26 half-hour instalments. This dramatization of The Lord of the Rings has subsequently been made available on both tape and CD both by the BBC and other publishers. For this purpose it is generally edited into 13 one-hour episodes.\\r\\nFollowing J. R. R. Tolkien's sale of the film rights for The Lord of the Rings to United Artists in 1969, rock band The Beatles considered a corresponding film project and approached Stanley Kubrick as a potential director; however, Kubrick turned down the offer, explaining to John Lennon that he thought the novel could not be adapted into a film due to its immensity.[85][86] The eventual director of the film adaptation Peter Jackson further explained that a major hindrance to the project's progression was Tolkien's opposition to the involvement of the Beatles.[87]\\r\\nTwo film adaptations of the book have been made. The first was J. R. R. Tolkien's The Lord of the Rings (1978), by animator Ralph Bakshi, the first part of what was originally intended to be a two-part adaptation of the story; it covers The Fellowship of the Ring and part of The Two Towers. A three-issue comic book version of the movie was also published in Europe (but not printed in English), with illustrations by Luis Bermejo. When Bakshi's investors shied away of financing the second film that would complete the story, the remainder of the story was covered in an animated television special by Rankin-Bass. Stylistically, the two segments are very different. The second and more commercially successful adaptation was Peter Jackson's live action The Lord of the Rings film trilogy, produced by New Line Cinema and released in three instalments as The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring (2001), The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers (2002), and The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King (2003). All three parts won multiple Academy Awards, including consecutive Best Picture nominations. The final instalment of this trilogy was the second film to break the one-billion-dollar barrier and won a total of 11 Oscars (something only two other films in history, Ben-Hur and Titanic, have accomplished), including Best Picture, Best Director and Best Adapted Screenplay.\\r\\nThe Hunt for Gollum, a fan film based on elements of the appendices to The Lord of the Rings, was released on the internet in May 2009 and has been covered in major media.[88] Born of Hope, written by Paula DiSante, directed by Kate Madison, and released in December 2009, is a fan film based upon the appendices of The Lord of the Rings.[89]\\r\\nOn 13 November 2017, it was announced that Amazon had acquired the global television rights to The Lord of the Rings, committing to a multi-season television series. The series will not be a direct adaptation of the books, but will instead introduce new stories that are set before The Fellowship of the Ring.[90] Amazon said the deal included potential for spin-off series as well.[91] The press release referred to \\"previously unexplored stories based on J.R.R. Tolkien's original writings\\". Amazon will be the producer in conjunction with the Tolkien Estate and the Tolkien Trust, HarperCollins and New Line Cinema.[92] According to a 2018 report, it will be the most expensive TV show ever produced.[93]\\r\\nIn 1990, Recorded Books published an audio version of The Lord of the Rings,[94] with British actor Rob Inglis?ÿ who had previously starred in his own one-man stage productions of The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings?ÿ reading. A large-scale musical theatre adaptation, The Lord of the Rings was first staged in Toronto, Ontario, Canada in 2006 and opened in London in May 2007.\\r\\nThe enormous popularity of Tolkien's work expanded the demand for fantasy fiction. Largely thanks to The Lord of the Rings, the genre flowered throughout the 1960s, and enjoys popularity to the present day. The opus has spawned many imitators, such as The Sword of Shannara, which Lin Carter called \\"the single most cold-blooded, complete rip-off of another book that I have ever read\\".[95] Dungeons & Dragons, which popularized the role-playing game (RPG) genre in the 1970s, features many races found in The Lord of the Rings, most notably halflings (another term for hobbits), elves (who are distinct from dark elves, following Tolkien's example), dwarves, half-elves, orcs, and dragons. However, Gary Gygax, lead designer of the game, maintained that he was influenced very little by The Lord of the Rings, stating that he included these elements as a marketing move to draw on the popularity the work enjoyed at the time he was developing the game.[96]\\r\\nBecause D&D has gone on to influence many popular role-playing video games, the influence of The Lord of the Rings extends to many of them as well, with titles such as Dragon Quest,[97][98] the Ultima series, EverQuest, the Warcraft series, and the Elder Scrolls series of games[99] as well as video games set in Middle-earth itself.\\r\\nResearch also suggests that some consumers of fantasy games derive their motivation from trying to create an epic fantasy narrative which is influenced by The Lord of the Rings.[100]\\r\\nIn 1965, songwriter Donald Swann, who was best known for his collaboration with Michael Flanders as Flanders & Swann, set six poems from The Lord of the Rings and one from The Adventures of Tom Bombadil (\\"Errantry\\") to music. When Swann met with Tolkien to play the songs for his approval, Tolkien suggested for \\"Namri?\\" (Galadriel's lament) a setting reminiscent of plain chant, which Swann accepted.[101] The songs were published in 1967 as The Road Goes Ever On: A Song Cycle,[102] and a recording of the songs performed by singer William Elvin with Swann on piano was issued that same year by Caedmon Records as Poems and Songs of Middle Earth.[103]\\r\\nRock bands of the 1970s were musically and lyrically inspired by the fantasy embracing counter-culture of the time; British 70s rock band Led Zeppelin recorded several songs that contain explicit references to The Lord of the Rings, such as mentioning Gollum in \\"Ramble On\\", the Misty Mountains in \\"Misty Mountain Hop\\", and Ringwraiths in \\"The Battle of Evermore\\". In 1970, the Swedish musician Bo Hansson released an instrumental concept album based on the book titled Sagan om ringen (translated as \\"The Saga of the Ring\\", which was the title of the Swedish translation of The Lord of the Rings at the time).[104] The album was subsequently released internationally as Music Inspired by Lord of the Rings in 1972.[104] The songs \\"Rivendell\\" and \\"The Necromancer\\" by the progressive rock band Rush were inspired by Tolkien. Styx also paid homage to Tolkien on their album Pieces of Eight with the song \\"Lords of the Ring\\", while Black Sabbath's song, \\"The Wizard\\", which appeared on their debut album, was influenced by Tolkien's hero, Gandalf. The heavy metal bands Cirith Ungol and Amon Amarth took their names from landmarks in Mordor. Progressive rock group Camel paid homage to the text in their lengthy composition \\"Nimrodel/The Procession/The White Rider\\", and progressive rock band Barclay James Harvest was inspired by the character Galadriel to write a song by that name, and used \\"Bombadil\\", the name of another character, as a pseudonym under which their 1972 single \\"Breathless\\"/\\"When the City Sleeps\\" was released; there are other references scattered through the BJH oeuvre.\\r\\nLater, from the 1980s to the present day, many heavy metal acts have been influenced by Tolkien. Blind Guardian has written many songs relating to Middle-earth, including the full concept album Nightfall in Middle Earth. Almost the entire discography of Battlelore are Tolkien-themed. Summoning's music is based upon Tolkien and holds the distinction of the being the only artist to have crafted a song entirely in the Black Speech of Mordor. Gorgoroth and Amon Amarth take their names from an area of Mordor, and Burzum take their name from the Black Speech of Mordor. The Finnish metal band Nightwish and the Norwegian metal band Tristania have also incorporated many Tolkien references into their music. American heavy metal band Megadeth released two songs titled \\"This Day We Fight!\\" and \\"How the Story Ends\\", which were both inspired by The Lord of the Rings.[105] German folk metal band Eichenschild is named for Thorin Oakenshield, a character in The Hobbit, and naturally has a number of Tolkien-themed songs. They are not to be confused with the '70s folk rock band Thorin Eichenschild.\\r\\nIn 1988, Dutch composer and trombonist Johan de Meij completed his Symphony No. 1 \\"The Lord of the Rings\\", which encompassed 5 movements, titled \\"Gandalf\\", \\"Lothl܇rien\\", \\"Gollum\\", \\"Journey in the Dark\\", and \\"Hobbits\\". In 1989 the symphony was awarded the Sudler Composition Award, awarded biennially for best wind band composition. The Danish Tolkien Ensemble have released a number of albums that feature the complete poems and songs of The Lord of the Rings set to music, with some featuring recitation by Christopher Lee.\\r\\nEnya wrote an instrumental piece called \\"Lothl܇rien\\" in 1991, and composed two songs for the film The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring\\"May It Be\\" (sung in English and Quenya) and \\"Anron\\" (sung in Sindarin).\\r\\nThe Lord of the Rings has had a profound and wide-ranging impact on popular culture, beginning with its publication in the 1950s, but especially throughout the 1960s and 1970s, during which time young people embraced it as a countercultural saga.[106] \\"Frodo Lives!\\" and \\"Gandalf for President\\" were two phrases popular amongst United States Tolkien fans during this time.[107]\\r\\nParodies like the Harvard Lampoon's Bored of the Rings, the VeggieTales episode \\"Lord of the Beans\\", the South Park episode \\"The Return of the Fellowship of the Ring to the Two Towers\\", the Futurama film Bender's Game, The Adventures of Jimmy Neutron: Boy Genius episode \\"Lights! Camera! Danger!\\", The Big Bang Theory episode \\"The Precious Fragmentation\\", and the American Dad! episode \\"The Return of the Bling\\" are testimony to the work's continual presence in popular culture.\\r\\nIn 1969, Tolkien sold the merchandising rights to The Lord of The Rings (and The Hobbit) to United Artists under an agreement stipulating a lump sum payment of S10,000[108] plus a 7.5% royalty after costs,[109] payable to Allen & Unwin and the author.[110] In 1976, three years after the author's death, United Artists sold the rights to Saul Zaentz Company, who now trade as Tolkien Enterprises. Since then all \\"authorized\\" merchandise has been signed-off by Tolkien Enterprises, although the intellectual property rights of the specific likenesses of characters and other imagery from various adaptations is generally held by the adaptors.[111] Outside any commercial exploitation from adaptations, from the late 1960s onwards there has been an increasing variety of original licensed merchandise, from posters and calendars created by illustrators such as Pauline Baynes and the Brothers Hildebrandt, to figurines and miniatures to computer, video, tabletop and role-playing games. Recent examples include the Spiel des Jahres award winning (for best use of literature in a game) board game The Lord of the Rings by Reiner Knizia and the Golden Joystick award-winning massively multiplayer online role-playing game, The Lord of the Rings Online: Shadows of Angmar by Turbine, Inc..\\r\\nThe Lord of the Rings has been mentioned in numerous songs including The Ballad of Bilbo Baggins by Leonard Nimoy, Led Zeppelin's Misty Mountain Hop, Over the Hills and Far Away, Ramble On, and The Battle of Evermore, Genesis' song \\"Stagnation\\" (from Trespass, 1970) was about Gollum, and Argent included the song \\"Lothlorien\\" on the 1971 album Ring of Hands.\\r\\nSteve Peregrin Took (born Stephen Ross Porter) of British rock band T.

It was first introduced under the Kraft Dinner name in both Canada and U.S. in 1937.[2] The product also developed into several other formulations, including Kraft's Easy Mac Cups, renamed Macaroni & Cheese Dinner Cups, a single-serving product designed specifically for microwave ovens.\\r\\nThe product's innovation was to combine the nonperishable dried macaroni noodles with a processed cheese powder, so that the dish could be prepared by cooking the pasta and adding the cheese powder, butter, and milk. The resulting macaroni and cheese glowed a uniquely unnatural orange color, but by 2016 all artificial food coloring was removed.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe prerequisite to a packaged macaroni and cheese product was the invention of \\"processed\\" cheeses, where emulsifying salts help stabilize the product, giving it a longer life. James Lewis Kraft, originally of Fort Erie, Ontario, but living in Chicago, did not invent processed cheese, but he won a patent for one processing method in 1916 and began to build his cheese business.[3]\\r\\nDuring the Great Depression, a St. Louis, Missouri salesman had the idea to sell macaroni pasta and cheese together as a package, so he began attaching grated cheese to boxes of pasta with a rubber band.[3] In 1937, Kraft introduced the product in the U.S. and Canada.[2] The timing of the product's launch had much to do with its success: during World War II, rationing of milk and dairy products, an increased reliance on meatless entrees, and more women working outside the home, created a nearly captive market for the product, which was considered a hearty meal for families. Its shelf life of ten months was attractive at a time when many Canadian homes did not have refrigerators.[3] Also, consumers could receive, for one food ration stamp, two boxes. The original box was primarily yellow. They sold 50 million boxes during the war.[4]\\r\\nThe boxes primary color is changed to blue in 1954. A version with spiral-shaped noodles debuted in 1975 while the Velveeta Shells & Cheese is introduced in 1984. [4]\\r\\nIn 2006, cheddar and white cheddar version switch to organic macaroni. While Easy Mac Cups are introduced the same year. The following year the noddles switch to 50 percent whole grain. [4]\\r\\nMacaroni & Cheese Crackers debut also in 2007. The crackers were discontinued in 2008 as it did not meet company targets. A sub-line, Homestyle Deluxe, was added in 2010 in three flavors, cheddar, four-cheese sauce and Old World Italian.[4]\\r\\n\\r\\nNew product lines using different flavors and pasta shapes have been introduced over the decades and the shelf life has at various times been increased.[citation needed] Kraft Dinner is seen as an inexpensive, easy-to-make comfort food, with marketing that highlights its value and convenience.[5][6]\\r\\nThe product now comes in several compositions:\\r\\nKraft Dinner Smart (also known as KD Smart) is a sub-brand of the Kraft Dinner brand. It represents a line of Kraft macaroni and cheese products that contain no artificial flavours, colours or preservatives and have added ingredients like cauliflower, oats or flax seed blended into the noodles. It comes in four varieties:[8]\\r\\nKraft Dinner Smart originally launched in Canada in March 2010 with two vegetable varieties. In June 2011, the line-up was re-launched with new packaging graphics and two new varieties (Flax Omega-3 and High Fibre).\\r\\nThe product is made with real Kraft cheddar and is manufactured in Mount Royal, Quebec.\\r\\nThe product was originally marketed as Kraft Dinner with the slogan \\"a meal for four in nine minutes for an everyday price of 19 cents.\\"[9] It was re-branded to Kraft Macaroni & Cheese in the United States and other countries. In several markets it goes by different names; in the United Kingdom it is also marketed as Cheesey Pasta.\\r\\nThe product is heavily promoted toward children in the United States on television. When advertising to younger children, the television advertisement encourages the children to ask for \\"The Blue Box.\\" In 2010 Kraft launched a $50 million multi-media marketing campaign with a nostalgia theme aimed at adults to promote all varieties of Kraft dinner.[10] In Canada, Kraft has advertising programs intended to make the meal appealing to newly arrived immigrant groups.[3]\\r\\nThere are regular promotional tie-in versions of the Kraft Dinner, aimed at kids. Packages have come with pasta in the shapes of various characters popular with children, such as Looney Tunes, Super Mario Bros., PB&J Otter, Pokmon, Spider-Man, Rugrats, The Fairly OddParents, The Flintstones, Peanuts, Scooby-Doo, Madagascar, How to Train Your Dragon, Toy Story, Phineas and Ferb, Cars, Monsters University, Finding Dory, SpongeBob SquarePants, Despicable Me, Trolls, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, and Star Wars.[5] Kraft Foods has also released many products under the product banner. These include other versions of macaroni and cheese with different shaped pasta and different flavours, but it has also included completely different dishes, such as spaghetti in several different flavours.\\r\\nIn promotion of the introduction of its \\"Cheddar Explosion\\" variety of Kraft Dinner, Kraft sponsored the demolition of Texas Stadium April 11, 2010. The New York-based public relations firm Hunter Public Relations, which has represented Kraft since 1991,[11] acted on behalf of Kraft. In its last act of 2009 the Irving, Texas, city council made Kraft Macaroni and Cheese the official sponsor of the demolition. Kraft paid $75,000 to local charities and donated $75,000 in Kraft products. A national essay contest directed at children who \\"have made a difference in their community\\" was held with the winner allowed to push the button initiating the controlled demolition.[12] The winning essayist was 11-year-old Casey Rogers of Terrell, Texas, founder of a charity serving the homeless.[13]\\r\\nKraft Dinner has been called the de facto national dish of Canada.[3] Packaged in Quebec with Canadian wheat and milk, and other ingredients from Canada and the US,[14] Canadians purchase 1.7 million of the 7 million boxes sold globally each week[15] and eat an average of 3.2 boxes of Kraft Dinner each year, 55% more than Americans. The meal is the most popular grocery item in the country,[3][16] where \\"Kraft Dinner\\" has iconic status and has become a generic trademark of sorts for macaroni and cheese.[17] It is often simply referred to by the initials K.D. As Kraft Dinner has a different name in Canada from the United States and other markets, the Canadian marketing and advertising platform is a made-in-Canada effort as US advertising cannot be easily adapted.[18]\\r\\nPundit Rex Murphy wrote that \\"Kraft Dinner revolves in that all-but-unobtainable orbit of the Tim Hortons doughnut and the A&W Teen Burger. It is one of that great trinity of quick digestibles that have been enrolled as genuine Canadian cultural icons.\\"[19] Douglas Coupland wrote that \\"cheese plays a weirdly large dietary role in the lives of Canadians, who have a more intimate and intense relationship with Kraft food products than the citizens of any other country. This is not a shameless product plug -- for some reason, Canadians and Kraft products have bonded the way Australians have bonded with Marmite [sic, recte:Vegemite], or the English with Heinz baked beans. In particular, Kraft Macaroni and Cheese, known simply as Kraft Dinner, is the biggie, probably because it so precisely laser-targets the favoured Canadian food groups: fat, sugar, starch and salt\\".[20] Immigrants often mention Kraft Dinner when surveys ask for examples of Canadian food.[3] As a measure of the product's Canadian popularity, its Facebook page, KD Battle Zone, attracted 270,000 fans, despite there being no prizes for the contest.[18]\\r\\nFormer Prime Minister Paul Martin regularly referred to it as his favourite food, though also confessed that he was unable to prepare it.[21] During the same election former Prime Minister Stephen Harper stated that \\"I'll never be able to give my kids a billion-dollar company, but Laureen and I are saving for their education. And I have actually cooked them Kraft Dinner  I like to add wieners.\\"[22] Most of his countrymen ignore the instructions and believe that they have a unique way of preparing the food, like adding wieners or cheese.[18] Additional ingredients are not necessary; simply adjusting the cooking time and the amount of milk or butter/margarine can produce a dish ranging from soft noodles in a creamy sauce to firm noodles in a thin, milky sauce.\\r\\nIn the September 2012 issue of The Walrus magazine, the cover story \\"Manufacturing Taste\\" by Sasha Chapman details the history of the Canadian cheese industry and Kraft's impact on it. She notably draws attention to Canada being unique in favouring a manufactured food product (made by a foreign company) as its national dish at the expense of local cheeses. Chapman's article is structured around this question, from the first page:\\r\\nBut what does it mean if a national dish is manufactured, formulated by scientists in a laboratory in Glenview, Illinois, and sold back to us by the second-largest food company in the world?[3]\\r\\nEnriched Macaroni product (wheat flour, niacin, ferrous sulfate [iron], thiamin mononitrate [vitamin B1], riboflavin [vitamin B2], folic acid)(In Canada: Pasta (from wheat).

The form of the pledge we use today was largely devised by Francis Bellamy in 1892 and formally adopted by Congress as the pledge in 1942.[6] The official name of The Pledge of Allegiance was adopted in 1945. The last change in language came on Flag Day 1954 when the words \\"under God\\" were added.[7]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCongressional sessions open with the recital of the Pledge, as do many government meetings at local levels, and meetings held by many private organizations. All states except Hawaii, Iowa, Vermont and Wyoming require a regularly-scheduled recitation of the pledge in the public schools, although the Supreme Court has ruled in West Virginia State Board of Education v. Barnette that students cannot be compelled to recite the Pledge, nor can they be punished for not doing so.[8] In a number of states state flag pledges of allegiance are required to be recited after this.[9]\\r\\nThe United States Flag Code says:\\r\\nThe Pledge of Allegiance to the Flag\\"I pledge allegiance to the Flag of the United States of America, and to the Republic for which it stands, one Nation under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.\\"[10]should be rendered by standing at attention facing the flag with the right hand over the heart. When not in uniform men should remove any non-religious headdress with their right hand and hold it at the left shoulder, the hand being over the heart. Persons in uniform should remain silent, face the flag, and render the military salute. Members of the Armed Forces not in uniform and veterans may render the military salute in the manner provided for persons in uniform.[2]\\r\\nThe Pledge of Allegiance, as it exists in its current form, was composed in August 1892 by Francis Bellamy (1855ÿ1931), who was a Baptist minister, a Christian socialist,[11][12] and the cousin of socialist utopian novelist Edward Bellamy (1850ÿ1898). There did exist a previous version created by Rear Admiral George Balch, a veteran of the Civil War, who later become auditor of the New York Board of Education. Balch's pledge, which existed contemporaneously with the Bellamy version until the 1923 National Flag Conference, read:\\r\\nWe give our heads and hearts to God and our country; one country, one language, one flag![3]\\r\\nBalch was a proponent of teaching children, especially those of immigrants, loyalty to the United States, even going so far as to write a book on the subject and work with both the government and private organizations to distribute flags to every classroom and school.[3][13] Balch's pledge, which predates Bellamy's by 5 years [which year?] and was embraced by many schools, by the Daughters of the American Revolution until the 1910s, and by the Grand Army of the Republic until the 1923 National Flag Conference, is often overlooked when discussing the history of the Pledge.[14] Bellamy, however, did not approve of the pledge as Balch had written it, referring to the text as \\"too juvenile and lacking in dignity.\\"[15] The Bellamy \\"Pledge of Allegiance\\" was first published in the September 8 issue of the popular children's magazine The Youth's Companion as part of the National Public-School Celebration of Columbus Day, a celebration of the 400th anniversary of Christopher Columbus's arrival in the Americas. The event was conceived and promoted by James B. Upham, a marketer for the magazine, as a campaign to instill the idea of American nationalism in students and to sell flags to public schools.[16] According to author Margarette S. Miller, this campaign was in line both with Upham's patriotic vision as well as with his commercial interest. According to Miller, Upham \\"would often say to his wife: 'Mary, if I can instill into the minds of our American youth a love for their country and the principles on which it was founded, and create in them an ambition to carry on with the ideals which the early founders wrote into The Constitution, I shall not have lived in vain.'\\"[17]\\r\\nBellamy's original Pledge read:\\r\\nI pledge allegiance to my Flag and the Republic for which it stands, one nation, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.[1][18]\\r\\nThe Pledge was supposed to be quick and to the point. Bellamy designed it to be recited in 15 seconds. As a socialist, he had initially also considered using the words equality and fraternity[16] but decided against it, knowing that the state superintendents of education on his committee were against equality for women and African Americans.[19]\\r\\nFrancis Bellamy and Upham had lined up the National Education Association to support the Youth's Companion as a sponsor of the Columbus Day observance and the use in that observance of the American flag. By June 29, 1892, Bellamy and Upham had arranged for Congress and President Benjamin Harrison to announce a proclamation making the public school flag ceremony the center of the Columbus Day celebrations. This arrangement was formalized when Harrison issued Presidential Proclamation 335. Subsequently, the Pledge was first used in public schools on October 12, 1892, during Columbus Day observances organized to coincide with the opening of the World's Columbian Exposition (the Chicago World's Fair), Illinois.[20]\\r\\nIn his recollection of the creation of the Pledge Francis Bellamy said, \\"At the beginning of the nineties patriotism and national feeling was (sic) at a low ebb. The patriotic ardor of the Civil War was an old story?... The time was ripe for a reawakening of simple Americanism and the leaders in the new movement rightly felt that patriotic education should begin in the public schools.\\"[15] James Upham \\"felt that a flag should be on every schoolhouse,\\"[15] so his publication \\"fostered a plan of selling flags to schools through the children themselves at cost, which was so successful that 25,000 schools acquired flags in the first year (1892-93).[15]\\r\\nAs the World's Columbian Exposition was set to celebrate the 400th anniversary the arrival of Christopher Columbus in the Americas, Upham sought to link the publication's flag drive to the event, \\"so that every school in the land?... would have a flag raising, under the most impressive conditions.\\"[15] Bellamy was placed in charge of this operation and was soon lobbying \\"not only the superintendents of education in all the States, but [he] also worked with governors, Congressmen, and even the President of the United States.\\"[15] The publication's efforts paid off when Benjamin Harrison declared Wednesday October 12, 1892, to be Columbus Day for which The Youth's Companion made \\"an official program for universal use in all the schools.\\"[15] Bellamy recalled that the event \\"had to be more than a list of exercises. The ritual must be prepared with simplicity and dignity.\\"[15]\\r\\nEdna Dean Proctor wrote an ode for the event, and \\"There was also an oration suitable for declamation.\\"[15] Bellamy held that \\"Of course, the nub of the program was to be the raising of the flag, with a salute to the flag recited by the pupils in unison.\\"[15] He found \\"There was not a satisfactory enough form for this salute. The Balch salute, which ran, \\"I give my heart and my hand to my country, one country, one language, one flag,\\" seemed to him too juvenile and lacking in dignity.\\"[15] After working on the idea with Upham, Bellamy concluded, \\"It was my thought that a vow of loyalty or allegiance to the flag should be the dominant idea. I especially stressed the word 'allegiance'. ...?Beginning with the new word allegiance, I first decided that 'pledge' was a better school word than 'vow' or 'swear'; and that the first person singular should be used, and that 'my' flag was preferable to 'the.'\\"[15] Bellamy considered the words \\"country, nation, or Republic,\\" choosing the last as \\"it distinguished the form of government chosen by the founding fathers and established by the Revolution. The true reason for allegiance to the flag is the Republic for which it stands.\\"[15] Bellamy then reflected on the sayings of Revolutionary and Civil War figures, and concluded \\"all that pictured struggle reduced itself to three words, one Nation indivisible.\\"[15]\\r\\nBellamy considered the slogan of the French Revolution, Libert, galit, fraternit (\\"liberty, equality, fraternity\\"), but held that \\"fraternity was too remote of realization, and  [that] equality was a dubious word.\\"[15] Concluding \\"Liberty and justice were surely basic, were undebatable, and were all that any one Nation could handle. If they were exercised for all. they involved the spirit of equality and fraternity.\\"[15]\\r\\nAfter being reviewed by Upham and other members of The Youth's Companion, the Pledge was approved and put in the official Columbus Day program. Bellamy noted that, \\"In later years the words 'to my flag' were changed to 'to the flag of the United States of America' because of the large number of foreign children in the schools.\\"[15] Bellamy disliked the change, as \\"it did injure the rhythmic balance of the original composition.\\"[15]\\r\\nIn 1906, The Daughters of the American Revolution's magazine, The American Monthly, listed the \\"formula of allegiance\\" as being the Balch Pledge of Allegiance, which reads:[14]\\r\\nI pledge allegiance to my flag, and the republic for which it stands. I pledge my head and my heart to God and my country. One country, one language and one flag.\\r\\nIn subsequent publications of the Daughters of the American Revolution, such as in 1915's \\"Proceedings of the Twenty-Fourth Continental Congress of the Daughters of the American Revolution\\" and 1916's annual \\"National Report,\\" the Balch Pledge, listed as official in 1906, is now categorized as \\"Old Pledge\\" with Bellamy's version under the heading \\"New Pledge.\\"[21][22] However, the \\"Old Pledge\\" continued to be used by other organizations until the National Flag Conference established uniform flag procedures in 1923.\\r\\nIn 1923, the National Flag Conference called for the words \\"my Flag\\" to be changed to \\"the Flag of the United States,\\" so that new immigrants would not confuse loyalties between their birth countries and the US. The words \\"of America\\" were added a year later. Congress officially recognized the Pledge for the first time, in the following form, on June 22, 1942:[23]\\r\\nI pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America, and to the Republic for which it stands, one Nation indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.\\r\\nLouis Albert Bowman, an attorney from Illinois, was the first to suggest the addition of \\"under God\\" to the pledge. The National Society of the Daughters of the American Revolution gave him an Award of Merit as the originator of this idea.[24][25] He spent his adult life in the Chicago area and was chaplain of the Illinois Society of the Sons of the American Revolution. At a meeting on February 12, 1948,[24] he led the society in reciting the pledge with the two words \\"under God\\" added. He said that the words came from Lincoln's Gettysburg Address. Although not all manuscript versions of the Gettysburg Address contain the words \\"under God\\", all the reporters' transcripts of the speech as delivered do, as perhaps Lincoln may have deviated from his prepared text and inserted the phrase when he said \\"that the nation shall, under God, have a new birth of freedom.\\" Bowman repeated his revised version of the Pledge at other meetings.[24]\\r\\nIn 1951, the Knights of Columbus, the world's largest Catholic fraternal service organization, also began including the words \\"under God\\" in the Pledge of Allegiance.[26] In New York City, on April 30, 1951, the board of directors of the Knights of Columbus adopted a resolution to amend the text of their Pledge of Allegiance at the opening of each of the meetings of the 800 Fourth Degree Assemblies of the Knights of Columbus by addition of the words \\"under God\\" after the words \\"one nation.\\" Over the next two years, the idea spread throughout Knights of Columbus organizations nationwide. On August 21, 1952, the Supreme Council of the Knights of Columbus at its annual meeting adopted a resolution urging that the change be made universal, and copies of this resolution were sent to the President, the Vice President (as Presiding Officer of the Senate), and the Speaker of the House of Representatives. The National Fraternal Congress meeting in Boston on September 24, 1952, adopted a similar resolution upon the recommendation of its president, Supreme Knight Luke E. Hart. Several State Fraternal Congresses acted likewise almost immediately thereafter. This campaign led to several official attempts to prompt Congress to adopt the Knights of Columbus policy for the entire nation. These attempts were eventually a success.[27]\\r\\nAt the suggestion of a correspondent, Representative Louis C. Rabaut (D-Mich.), of Michigan sponsored a resolution to add the words \\"under God\\" to the Pledge in 1953.[28]\\r\\nBefore February 1954, no endeavor to get the pledge officially amended had succeeded. The final successful push came from George MacPherson Docherty. Some American presidents honored Lincoln's birthday by attending services at the church Lincoln attended, New York Avenue Presbyterian Church by sitting in Lincoln's pew on the Sunday nearest February 12. On February 7, 1954, with President Eisenhower sitting in Lincoln's pew, the church's pastor, George MacPherson Docherty, delivered a sermon based on the Gettysburg Address entitled \\"A New Birth of Freedom.\\" He argued that the nation's might lay not in arms but rather in its spirit and higher purpose. He noted that the Pledge's sentiments could be those of any nation: \\"There was something missing in the pledge, and that which was missing was the characteristic and definitive factor in the American way of life.\\" He cited Lincoln's words \\"under God\\" as defining words that set the US apart from other nations.[citation needed]\\r\\nPresident Eisenhower had been baptized a Presbyterian very recently, just a year before. He responded enthusiastically to Docherty in a conversation following the service. Eisenhower acted on his suggestion the next day and on February 8, 1954, Rep. Charles Oakman (R-Mich.), introduced a bill to that effect. Congress passed the necessary legislation and Eisenhower signed the bill into law on Flag Day, June 14, 1954.[29] Eisenhower said:\\r\\nFrom this day forward, the millions of our school children will daily proclaim in every city and town, every village and rural school house, the dedication of our nation and our people to the Almighty.... In this way we are reaffirming the transcendence of religious faith in America's heritage and future; in this way we shall constantly strengthen those spiritual weapons which forever will be our country's most powerful resource, in peace or in war.[30]\\r\\nThe phrase \\"under God\\" was incorporated into the Pledge of Allegiance on June 14, 1954, by a Joint Resolution of Congress amending ?4 of the Flag Code enacted in 1942.[29]\\r\\nOn October 6, 1954, the National Executive Committee of the American Legion adopted a resolution, first approved by the Illinois American Legion Convention in August 1954, which formally recognized the Knights of Columbus for having initiated and brought forward the amendment to the Pledge of Allegiance.[27]\\r\\nEven though the movement behind inserting \\"under God\\" into the pledge might have been initiated by a private religious fraternity and even though references to God appear in previous versions of the pledge, author Kevin M. Kruse asserts that this movement was an effort by corporate America to instill in the minds of the people that capitalism and free enterprise were heavenly blessed. Kruse acknowledges the insertion of the phrase was influenced by the push-back against atheistic communism during the Cold War, but argues the longer arc of history shows the conflation of Christianity and capitalism as a challenge to the New Deal played the larger role.[31]\\r\\nSwearing of the Pledge is accompanied by a salute. An early version of the salute, adopted in 1887, known as the Balch Salute, which accompanied the Balch pledge, instructed students to stand with their right hand outstretched toward the flag, the fingers of which are then brought to the forehead, followed by being placed flat over the heart, and finally falling to the side.[3]\\r\\nIn 1892, Francis Bellamy created what was known as the Bellamy salute. It started with the hand outstretched toward the flag, palm down, and ended with the palm up. Because of the similarity between the Bellamy salute and the Nazi salute, which was adopted in Germany later, the US Congress stipulated that the hand-over-the-heart gesture as the salute to be rendered by civilians during the Pledge of Allegiance and the national anthem in the US would be the salute to replace the Bellamy salute. Removal of the Bellamy salute occurred on December 22, 1942, when Congress amended the Flag Code language first passed into law on June 22, 1942.[32] Attached to bills passed in Congress in 2008 and then in 2009 (Section 301(b)(1)of title 36, United States Code), language was included which authorized all active duty military personnel and all veterans in civilian clothes to render a proper hand salute during the raising and lowering of the flag, when the colors are presented, and during the National Anthem.[33]\\r\\nA musical setting for \\"The Pledge of Allegiance to the Flag\\" was created by Irving Caesar, at the suggestion of Congressman Louis C. Rabaut whose House Resolution 243 to add the phrase \\"under God\\" was signed into law on Flag Day, June 14, 1954.[34]\\r\\nThe composer, Irving Caesar, wrote and published over 700 songs in his lifetime. Dedicated to social issues, he donated all rights of the musical setting to the U.S. government, so that anyone can perform the piece without owing royalties.[35][36]\\r\\nIt was sung for the first time on the floor of the House of Representatives on Flag Day, June 14, 1955 by the official Air Force choral group the \\"Singing Sergeants\\". A July 29, 1955 House and Senate resolution authorized the U.S. Government Printing Office to print and distribute the song sheet together with a history of the pledge.[37]\\r\\nOther musical versions of the Pledge have since been copyrighted, including by Beck (2003), Lovrekovich (2002 and 2001), Roton (1991), Fijol (1986), and Girardet (1983).[38]\\r\\nIn 1940, the Supreme Court, in Minersville School District v. Gobitis, ruled that students in public schools, including the respondents in that caseJehovah's Witnesses who considered the flag salute to be idolatrycould be compelled to swear the Pledge. In 1943, in West Virginia State Board of Education v. Barnette, the Supreme Court reversed its decision. Justice Robert H. Jackson, writing for the 6 to 3 majority, went beyond simply ruling in the precise matter presented by the case to say that public school students are not required to say the Pledge on narrow grounds, and asserted that such ideological dogmata are antithetical to the principles of the country, concluding with:\\r\\nIf there is any fixed star in our constitutional constellation, it is that no official, high or petty, can prescribe what shall be orthodox in politics, nationalism, religion, or other matters of opinion or force citizens to confess by word or act their faith therein. If there are any circumstances which permit an exception, they do not now occur to us.[39]\\r\\nIn a later case, the 11th Circuit Court of Appeals held that students are also not required to stand for the Pledge.[40]\\r\\nRequiring or promoting of the Pledge on the part of the government has continued to draw criticism and legal challenges on several grounds.\\r\\nOne objection is that a democratic republic built on freedom of dissent should not require its citizens to pledge allegiance to it, and that the First Amendment to the United States Constitution protects the right to refrain from speaking or standing, which itself is also a form of speech in the context of the ritual of pledging allegiance.[41][40] Another objection is that the people who are most likely to recite the Pledge every day, small children in schools, cannot really give their consent or even completely understand the Pledge they are making.[42] Another criticism is that a government requiring or promoting the phrase \\"under God\\" violates protections against the establishment of religion guaranteed in the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment.[43]\\r\\nIn 2004, linguist Geoffrey Nunberg said the original supporters of the addition thought that they were simply quoting Lincoln's Gettysburg Address, but to Lincoln and his contemporaries, \\"under God\\" meant \\"God willing\\", so they would have found its use in the Pledge of Allegiance grammatically incorrect and semantically odd.[44][45]\\r\\nProminent legal challenges were brought in the 1930s and 1940s by Jehovah's Witnesses, a denomination whose beliefs preclude swearing loyalty to any power other than God, and who objected to policies in public schools requiring students to swear an oath to the flag.[46] They said requiring the pledge violated their freedom of religion guaranteed by the Free Exercise Clause of the First Amendment. The first case was in 1935, when two children, Lillian and William Gobitas, ages ten and twelve, were expelled from the Minersville, Pennsylvania, public schools that year for failing to salute the flag and recite the Pledge of Allegiance.[47][48]\\r\\nIn a 2002 case brought by atheist Michael Newdow, whose daughter was being taught the Pledge in school, the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals ruled the phrase \\"under God\\" an unconstitutional endorsement of monotheism when the Pledge was promoted in public school. In 2004, the Supreme Court heard Elk Grove Unified School District v. Newdow, an appeal of the ruling, and rejected Newdow's claim on the grounds that he was not the custodial parent, and therefore lacked standing, thus avoiding ruling on the merits of whether the phrase was constitutional in a school-sponsored recitation. On January 3, 2005, a new suit was filed in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of California on behalf of three unnamed families. On September 14, 2005, District Court Judge Lawrence Karlton ruled in their favor. Citing the precedent of the 2002 ruling by the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals, Judge Karlton issued an Order stating that, upon proper motion, he would enjoin the school district defendants from continuing their practices of leading children in pledging allegiance to \\"one Nation under God.\\"[49]\\r\\nA 2005 Bill, H.R. 2389, to prohibit the Supreme Court's and most federal courts from considering any legal challenges to the government's requiring or promoting of the Pledge of Allegiance, died in the Senate after having passed in the House. This action is viewed[by whom?] in general as court stripping by Congress of the constitutional power of the Judiciary. Even if a similar bill is enacted, its practical effect may not be clear:[opinion] proponents of the bill have said that it is a valid exercise of Congress's power to regulate the jurisdiction of the federal courts under Article III, Section 2 of the Constitution, but opponents say Congress does not have the authority to prevent the Supreme Court from hearing claims based on the Bill of Rights, since this can only be done through Constitutional Amendment. Judges and legal analysts have said that if Congress can remove from the judicial branch the ability to determine if legislation is constitutional, the US separation of powers would be disturbed, or rendered non-functional.[50]\\r\\nMark J. Pelavin, former Associate Director of the Religious Action Center of Reform Judaism, said of court stripping in regard to the Pledge of Allegiance that:[51][52]\\r\\nToday's House adoption of the so-called \\"Pledge Protection Act\\" is a shameful effort to strip our federal courts of their ability to uphold the rights of all Americans. By removing the jurisdiction of federal courts, including the Supreme Court, from cases involving the Pledge, this legislation sets a dangerous precedent: threatening religious liberty, compromising the vital system of checks and balances upon which our government was founded, and granting Congress the authority to strip the courts' jurisdiction on any issue it wishes. Today, the issue was the Pledge of Allegiance, but tomorrow it could be reproductive rights, civil rights, or any other fundamental concern.\\r\\nIn 2006, in the Florida case Frazier v. Alexandre, a federal district court in Florida ruled that a 1942 state law requiring students to stand and recite the Pledge of Allegiance violates the First and Fourteenth Amendments of the U.S. Constitution.[53] As a result of that decision, a Florida school district was ordered to pay $32,500 to a student who chose not to say the pledge and was ridiculed and called \\"unpatriotic\\" by a teacher.[54]\\r\\nIn 2009, a Montgomery County, Maryland, teacher berated and had school police remove a 13-year-old girl who refused to say the Pledge of Allegiance in the classroom. The student's mother, assisted by the American Civil Liberties Union of Maryland, sought and received an apology from the teacher, as state law and the school's student handbook both prohibit students from being forced to recite the Pledge.[55]\\r\\nOn March 11, 2010, the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals upheld the words \\"under God\\" in the Pledge of Allegiance in the case of Newdow v. Rio Linda Union School District.[56][57] In a 2ÿ1 decision, the appellate court ruled that the words were of a \\"ceremonial and patriotic nature\\" and did not constitute an establishment of religion.[56] Judge Stephen Reinhardt dissented, writing that \\"the state-directed, teacher-led daily recitation in public schools of the amended 'under God' version of the Pledge of Allegiance... violates the Establishment Clause of the Constitution.\\"[58]\\r\\nOn November 12, 2010, in a unanimous decision, the United States Court of Appeals for the First Circuit in Boston affirmed a ruling by a New Hampshire lower federal court which found that the pledge's reference to God does not violate non-pledging students' rights if student participation in the pledge is voluntary.[59][60] A United States Supreme Court appeal of this decision was denied on June 13, 2011.[61][62]\\r\\nIn September 2013, a case was brought before the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court, arguing that the pledge violates the Equal Rights Amendment of the Constitution of Massachusetts.[63] In May 2014, Massachusetts' highest court ruled that the pledge does not discriminate against atheists, saying that the words \\"under God\\" represent a patriotic, not a religious, exercise.[64]\\r\\nIn February 2015 New Jersey Superior Court Judge David F. Bauman dismissed a lawsuit, ruling that \\" the Pledge of Allegiance does not violate the rights of those who don't believe in God and does not have to be removed from the patriotic message.\\"[65] The case against the Matawan-Aberdeen Regional School District had been brought by a student of the district and the American Humanist Association that argued that the phrase \\"under God\\" in the pledge created a climate of discrimination because it promoted religion, making non-believers \\"second-class citizens.\\" In a twenty-one page decision, Bauman wrote, \\"Under [the association members'] reasoning, the very constitution under which [the members] seek redress for perceived atheistic marginalization could itself be deemed unconstitutional, an absurd proposition which [association members] do not and cannot advance here.\\"[65] Bauman said the student could skip the pledge, but upheld a New Jersey law that says pupils must recite the pledge unless they have \\"conscientious scruples\\" that do not allow it.[66][67] He noted, \\"As a matter of historical tradition, the words 'under God' can no more be expunged from the national consciousness than the words 'In God We Trust' from every coin in the land, than the words 'so help me God' from every presidential oath since 1789, or than the prayer that has opened every congressional session of legislative business since 1787.","input":"When was the american pledge of allegiance written?"},{"output":"six-year","context":"Term limits in the United States apply to many offices at both the federal and state level, and date back to the American Revolution.\\r\\n\\r\\nTerm limits, also referred to as rotation in office, restrict the number of terms of office an officeholder may hold.\\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nTerm limits date back to the American Revolution, and prior to that to the democracies and republics of antiquity. The council of 500 in ancient Athens rotated its entire membership annually, as did the ephorate in ancient Sparta. The ancient Roman Republic featured a system of elected magistratestribunes of the plebs, aediles, quaestors, praetors, and consuls who served a single term of one year, with re-election to the same magistracy forbidden for ten years (see cursus honorum).[1] According to historian Garrett Fagan, office holding in the Roman Republic was based on \\"limited tenure of office\\" which ensured that \\"authority circulated frequently\\", helping to prevent corruption.[1] An additional benefit of the cursus honorum or Run of Offices was to bring the \\"most experienced\\" politicians to the upper echelons of power-holding in the ancient republic.[1] Many of the founders of the United States were educated in the classics, and quite familiar with rotation in office during antiquity. The debates of that day reveal a desire to study and profit from the object lessons offered by ancient democracy.\\r\\n\\r\\nPrior to independence, several colonies had already experimented with term limits. The Fundamental Orders of Connecticut of 1639, for example, prohibited the colonial governor from serving consecutive terms, setting terms at one year's length, and holding \\"that no person be chosen Governor above once in two years.\\"[2] Shortly after independence, the Pennsylvania Constitution of 1776 set maximum service in the Pennsylvania General Assembly at \\"four years in seven\\".[3] Benjamin Franklin's influence is seen not only in that he chaired the constitutional convention which drafted the Pennsylvania constitution, but also because it included, virtually unchanged, Franklin's earlier proposals on executive rotation. Pennsylvania's plural executive was composed of twelve citizens elected for the term of three years, followed by a mandatory vacation of four years.[4]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Articles of Confederation, adopted in 1781, established term limits for the delegates to the Continental Congress, mandating in Article V that \\"no person shall be capable of being a delegate for more than three years in any term of six years.\\"[5]\\r\\n\\r\\nOn October 2, 1789, the Continental Congress appointed a committee of thirteen to examine forms of government for the impending union of the states. Among the proposals was that from the State of Virginia, written by Thomas Jefferson, urging a limitation of tenure, \\"to prevent every danger which might arise to American freedom by continuing too long in office the members of the Continental Congress\\".[6] The committee made recommendations, which as regards congressional term limits were incorporated unchanged into the Articles of Confederation (1781ÿ89). The fifth Article stated that \\"no person shall be capable of being a delegate [to the continental congress] for more than three years in any term of six years\\".[7]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn contrast to the Articles of Confederation, the federal constitution convention at Philadelphia omitted mandatory term limits from the second national frame of government, i.e. the U.S. Constitution of 1789 to the present.  At the convention,[8] some delegates spoke passionately against term limits such as Rufus King, who said \\"that he who has proved himself to be most fit for an Office, ought not to be excluded by the constitution from holding it.\\"  The Electoral College, it was believed by some delegates at the convention, could have a role to play in limiting unfit officers from continuing.\\r\\n\\r\\nGeorge Washington set the informal precedent for a two-term limit for the Presidencya tradition that prevailed until Franklin Roosevelt's presidency, after which the 22nd Amendment to the U.S. Constitution was ratified in 1951 formally establishing in law the two-term limit.\\r\\n\\r\\nHowever, when the states ratified the Constitution (1787ÿ88), several leading statesmen regarded the lack of mandatory limits to tenure as a dangerous defect, especially, they thought, as regards the presidency and the Senate. Richard Henry Lee viewed the absence of legal limits to tenure, together with certain other features of the Constitution, as \\"most highly and dangerously oligarchic\\".[9] Both Jefferson[10] and George Mason[11] advised limits on reelection to the Senate and to the Presidency, because said Mason, \\"nothing is so essential to the preservation of a Republican government as a periodic rotation\\". The historian Mercy Otis Warren, warned that \\"there is no provision for a rotation, nor anything to prevent the perpetuity of office in the same hands for life; which by a little well-timed bribery, will probably be done\\".[12]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe fact that \\"perpetuity in office\\" was not approached until the 20th century is due in part to the influence of rotation in office as a popular 19th-century concept. \\"Ideas are, in truth, forces\\", and rotation in office enjoyed such normative support, especially at the local level, that it altered political reality.[13] For a detailed study of the 19th-century concepts of rotation, consult Political Science Quarterly, vol. 94, \\"House Turnover and the Principle of Rotation\\", by Robert Struble, Jr. See also his Treatise on Twelve Lights,[14] chapter six, \\"Rotation in History\\". Consult also, James Young's The Washington Community, 1800ÿ1828.\\r\\n\\r\\nAccording to Young, the tendency to look with mistrust upon political power was so ingrained into American culture that even the officeholders themselves perceived their occupations in a disparaging light.[15] James Fenimore Cooper described the common view that \\"contact with the affairs of state is one of the most corrupting of the influences to which men are exposed\\".[16] An article in the Richmond Enquirer (1822) noted that the \\"long cherished\\" principle of rotation in office had been impressed on the republican mind \\"by a kind of intuitive impulse, unassailable to argument or authority\\".[17]\\r\\n\\r\\nBeginning about the 1830s, Jacksonian democracy introduced a less idealistic twist to the practice of limiting terms. Rotation in office came to mean taking turns in the distribution of political prizes.[18] Rotation of nominations to the U.S. House of Representativesthe prizesbecame a key element of payoffs to the party faithful. The leading lights in the local party machinery came to regard a nomination for the House as \\"salary\\" for political services rendered. A new code of political ethics evolved, based on the proposition that \\"turnabout is fair play\\".[19] In short, rotation of nominations was intertwined with the spoils system.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn district nominating conventions local leaders could negotiate and enforce agreements to pass the nominations around among themselves. Abraham Lincoln was elected to the United States House of Representatives in 1846 under such a bargain, and he returned home to Springfield after a single congressional term because, he wrote, \\"to enter myself as a competitor of another, or to authorize anyone so to enter me, is what my word and honor forbid\\".[20]\\r\\n\\r\\nDuring the Civil War, the Confederate States Constitution limited its president to a single six-year term.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe practice of nomination rotation for the House of Representatives began to decline after the Civil War. It took a generation or so before the direct primary system, civil service reforms, and the ethic of professionalism worked to eliminate rotation in office as a common political practice. By the turn of the 20th century the era of incumbency was coming into full swing.\\r\\n\\r\\nA total of 8 presidents served two full terms and declined a third and three presidents served one full term and refused a second. After World War II, however, an officeholder class had developed to the point that congressional tenure rivaled that of the U.S. Supreme Court, where tenure is for life.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\"Homesteading,\\" or securing a lifelong career in Congress, was made possible by reelection rates that approached 100% by the end of the 20th century. The concept of homesteading brought about a popular movement known as the \\"term-limits movement\\". The elections of 1990ÿ94 saw the adoption of term limits for state legislatures in almost every state where citizens had the power of the initiative. In addition, 23 states limited service in their delegation to Congress. As they pertain to Congress, these laws are no longer enforceable, however, as in 1995, the U.S. Supreme Court overturned congressional term limits in U.S. Term Limits, Inc. v. Thornton, ruling that state governments cannot limit the terms of members of the national government.[21]\\r\\n\\r\\nWhere rotation in the legislative branch has withstood court challenges, term limits continue to garner popular support. As of 2002, the advocacy group \\"U.S. Term Limits\\" found that in the 17 states where state legislators served in rotation, public support for term limits ranged from 60 to 78 percent.[22]\\r\\n\\r\\nAs of 2013, term limits at the federal level are restricted to the executive branch and some agencies. Judicial appointments at the federal level are made for life, and are not subject to election or to term limits. The U.S. Congress remains (since the Thornton decision of 1995) without electoral limits.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe first U.S. president, George Washington, started the tradition of informal presidential term limits by refusing to run for a third term (originally he claimed he did not want to run in the first place, much less for a second term). The short-lived Confederate States of America adopted a six-year term for their president and vice-president and barred the president from seeking re-election. That innovation was endorsed by many American politicians after the  American Civil War, most notably by Rutherford B. Hayes in his inaugural address.\\r\\n\\r\\nFranklin D. Roosevelt (president, 1933ÿ1945) was the first and only U.S. president to break Washington's tradition successfully. He died in office a few months after starting his fourth term. This gave rise to a successful move in Congress to formalize the traditional two-term limit by amending the U.S. Constitution. As ratified in 1951, the Twenty-Second Amendment provides that \\"no person shall be elected to the office of President more than twice\\".\\r\\n\\r\\nReformers during the early 1990s used the initiative and referendum to put congressional term limits on the ballot in 24 states. Voters in eight of these states approved the congressional term limits by an average electoral margin of two to one.[26] It was an open question whether states had the constitutional authority to enact these limits. In May 1995, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled 5ÿ4 in U.S. Term Limits, Inc. v. Thornton, 514 U.S. 779 (1995), that states cannot impose term limits upon their federal Representatives or Senators.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the 1994 elections, part of the Republican platform included legislation for term limits in Congress. After winning the majority, a Republican congressman brought a constitutional amendment to the House floor that proposed limiting members of the Senate to two six-year terms and members of the House to six two-year terms.[27] However, this rate of rotation was so slow (the life-tenured Supreme Court averages in the vicinity of twelve years) that the congressional version of term-limits garnered little support among the populist backers of term limits, including U.S. Term Limits, the largest private organization pushing for congressional term limits.[28][citation needed] The bill got only a bare majority (227ÿ204), falling short of the two-thirds majority (290) needed for constitutional amendments.[29] Three other term limit amendment bills failed to get more than 200 votes.[30]\\r\\n\\r\\nDefeated in Congress and overridden by the Supreme Court, the federal term limit uprising was brought to a halt. The term limits intended simultaneously to reform state legislatures (as distinguished from the federal congressional delegations) remain in force, however, in fifteen states.[31][32]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 2007 Larry J. Sabato revived the debate over term limits by arguing in A More Perfect Constitution that the success and popularity of term limits at the state level suggests that they should be adopted at the federal level as well. He specifically put forth the idea of congressional term limits and suggested a national constitutional convention be used to accomplish the amendment, since the Congress would be unlikely to propose and adopt any amendment that limits its own power.\\r\\n\\r\\nSome state legislators have also expressed their opinions on term limits. It is confirmed that in the following five statesand there may be othersstate lawmakers approved resolutions asking Congress to propose a federal constitutional amendment to limit the number of terms which members of Congress may serve:\\r\\n\\r\\nLegal scholars have discussed whether or not to impose term limits on the Supreme Court of the United States. Currently, Supreme Court Justices are appointed for life \\"during good behavior\\". A sentiment has developed, among certain scholars, that the Supreme Court may not be accountable in a way that is most in line with the spirit of checks and balances.[33] Equally, scholars have argued that life tenure has taken on a new meaning in a modern context.[34] Changes in medical care have markedly raised life expectancy and therefore has allowed Justices to serve for longer than ever before.[33][34] Steven G. Calebresi and James Lindgren, professors of law at Northwestern University, argued that, because vacancies in the court are occurring with less frequency and justices served on average, between 1971 and 2006, for 26.1 years, the \\"efficacy of the democratic check that the appointment process provides on the Court's membership\\" is reduced.[33] There have been several similar proposals to implement term limits for the nation's highest court, including Professor of Law at Duke University, Paul Carrington's 2005 \\"The Supreme Court Renewal Act of 2005\\".[35]\\r\\n\\r\\nMany of the proposals center around a term limit for Justices that would be 18 years (Larry Sabato, Professor of Political Science at University of Virginia, suggested between 15 and 18 years).[33][34][35][36] The proposed staggered term limits of 18 years would, according to Calebresi, Lindgren (2006), and Carrington (2005), allow for a new appointment to the Court every two years, which in effect would allow every president at least two appointments.[34][35] Professor Carrington has argued that such a measure would not require a constitutional amendment as the \\"Constitution doesnt even mention life tenure; it merely requires that justices serve during good behaviour \\".[34] The idea was not without support among Judges, as John Roberts supported term limits before he was appointed to the Supreme Court as Chief Justice. Calebresi, Lingren, and Carrington have also proposed that when justices have served out their proposed 18-year term they should be able to sit on other Federal Courts until retirement, death, or removal.[33][34]\\r\\n\\r\\nFairleigh Dickinson University's PublicMind Poll measured American voters attitudes towards various proposed Supreme Court reforms, including implementing term limits. The 2010 poll found that a majority of Americans were largely unaware of a proposal to impose a term limit of 18 years, as 82% reported they had heard little or nothing at all.[37] Notwithstanding a lack of awareness, 52% of Americans approved of limiting terms to 18 years, while 35% disapproved.[37] When asked how old is too old for a Supreme Court judge to serve if he or she seems healthy, 48% said \\"no limit as long as he or she is healthy\\", while 31% agreed that anyone over the age of 70 is too old.[37]\\r\\n\\r\\nSome state lawmakers have officially expressed to Congress a desire for a federal constitutional amendment to limit terms of Supreme Court justices as well as of judges of federal courts below the Supreme Court level. While there might be others, below are three known examples:\\r\\n\\r\\nTerm limits for state officials have existed since colonial times. The Pennsylvania Charter of Liberties of 1682, and the colonial frame of government of the same year, both authored by William Penn, provided for triennial rotation of the provincial councilthe upper house of the colonial legislature.[38] The Delaware Constitution of 1776 limited the governor to a single three-year term; currently, the governor of Delaware can serve two four-year terms.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt present, 36 states have term limits of various types for their governors. To circumvent the term limit in Alabama incumbent governor George Wallace pushed through the nomination of his wife Lurleen, in the 1966 Democratic primary, which was, in those days, the real contest in Alabama. It was generally understood that Mrs. Wallace would only be a titular governor while her husband continued to hold the real power. She won the election, but only served 16 months before dying in 1968.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs indicated above, in fifteen state legislatures the members serve in rotation, i.e., under term limits enacted during the reforms of the early 1990s. In another six states, however, state legislatures have either overturned their own limits or state supreme courts have ruled such limits unconstitutional. In 2002 the Idaho Legislature became the first legislature of its kind to repeal its own term limits, enacted by a public vote in 1994, ostensibly because it applied to local officials along with the legislature.\\r\\n\\r\\nGovernors of 36 states and four territories are subject to various term limits, while the governors of 14 states, Puerto Rico, and the Mayor of Washington, D.C., may serve an unlimited number of terms. Each state's gubernatorial term limits are prescribed by its state constitution, with the exception of Wyoming, whose limits are found in its statutes. Territorial term limits are prescribed by its constitution in the Northern Mariana Islands, the Organic Acts in Guam and the U.S. Virgin Islands, and by statute in American Samoa.\\r\\n\\r\\nUnique in its restriction, Virginia prohibits its governors from succeeding themselves for a second term, although former governors are reeligible after four years out of office.[39] Many other states formerly had this prohibition, but all had eliminated it by 2000.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe governors of the following states and territories are limited to two consecutive terms, but are reeligible after four years out of office: Alabama,[40] Alaska,[41] Arizona,[42] Colorado,[43] Florida,[44] Georgia,[45] Hawaii,[46] Kansas,[47] Kentucky,[48] Louisiana,[49] Maine,[50] Maryland,[51] Nebraska,[52] New Jersey,[53] New Mexico,[54] North Carolina,[55] Ohio,[56] Pennsylvania,[57] Rhode Island,[58] South Carolina,[59] South Dakota,[60] Tennessee,[61] West Virginia,[62] American Samoa,[63] Guam,[64] and the U.S. Virgin Islands.[65] Equivalently, the Governors of Indiana[66] and Oregon[67] are limited to serving 8 out of any 12 years. Conversely, the Governors of Montana[68] and Wyoming[69] are restricted to two terms, limited to serving 8 out of any 16 years. Finally, the governors of the following states and territory are absolutely limited (for life) to two terms: Arkansas,[70] California,[71] Delaware,[72] Michigan,[73] Mississippi,[74] Missouri,[75] Nevada,[76] the Northern Mariana Islands,[77] and Oklahoma.[78] The current Governor of California (Jerry Brown) is, however, serving a fourth (non-consecutive) term because his first two terms were before limits were passed in California, and the limits did not apply to individuals' prior terms.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe governors of New Hampshire and Vermont may serve unlimited two-year terms. The governors (or equivalent) in the following states, district, and territory may serve unlimited four-year terms: Connecticut, Idaho, Illinois, Iowa, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New York, North Dakota, Texas, Utah, Washington, Wisconsin, District of Columbia, and Puerto Rico. The Governor of Utah was previously limited to serving three terms, but all term limit laws have since been repealed by the legislature.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe following 15 legislatures have term limits:\\r\\n\\r\\nThe following six legislatures have had their term limits nullified:\\r\\n\\r\\nSome local governments have term limits. In Philadelphia, the mayor cannot be elected three consecutive times, but there is no limit on how long any individual can serve as mayor. Frank Rizzo was elected mayor in 1971 and 1975; he attempted to repeal the term limit, but failed and could not run in 1979. He ran unsuccessfully for the Democratic nomination for mayor in 1983 but he lost to Wilson Goode. In 1986, he switched to the Republican Party, and ran as a Republican in the mayoral elections of 1987 and 1991.\\r\\n\\r\\nLimits vary from city to city even within the same state. For example, Houston, Texas, has a limit of 2 four-year terms (prior to November 3, 2015, 3 two-year terms dating back to 1991), while San Antonio, Texas, has a limit of 4 two-year terms. Both Houston and San Antonio's term limits are absolute; elected officeholders are ineligible to run for the same position where seeking higher office is common.\\r\\n\\r\\nA two-term limit was imposed on New York City Council members and citywide elected officials (except for district attorneys) in New York City after a 1993 referendum (see the Charter of the City of New York, ?1138). On November 3, 2008, however, when Michael Bloomberg was in his second term of mayor, the City Council approved the extension of the two-term limit to a three-term limit; one year later, he was elected to a third term. The two-term limit was reinstated after a referendum in 2010.[80][81]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn Los Angeles the mayor serves up to two four-year terms since 1993, while the City Council serve up to three four-year terms.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn Cincinnati, Ohio, the term limit for mayor is two successive four-year terms. Council members are limited to two successive four-year terms. There is no limit to total terms that may be served, just a limit on successive terms.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn New Orleans, City Council members are limited to two four-year terms. However, a council member representing one of the five council districts may run for one of the two at-large seats on the council once they reach the two-term limit, and vice versa. There is no limit on the number of terms a council member may serve in a lifetime. Since 1954, the mayor of New Orleans has been limited to two consecutive four-year elected terms, but he or she may be elected again after sitting out one four-year term. When the new city plan of government was adopted, the mayor at the time, DeLesseps Story Morrison, was exempt from term limits due to a grandfather clause.  \\r\\n\\r\\nUnder the original Metropolitan Charter adopted in 1962, the mayor of Nashville was limited to three consecutive four-year terms, which was subsequently reduced to two consecutive four-year terms in 1991.  Councilors were likewise limited to two consecutive four-year terms, but subsequent court rulings have determined the offices of district councilor and at-large councilor to be separate offices even though all councilors serve together in one unicameral body, which has meant that at large councilors have continued in office as district members, and (more frequently) district councilors have been elected to subsequent terms as at large councilors.","input":"How long is the term for state senator?"},{"output":"Screed","context":"Screed has three meanings in building construction: 1) a flat board (screed board, floating screed) or a purpose-made aluminium tool used to smooth and true materials like concrete, stucco and plaster after it has been placed on a surface or to assist in flattening;[1] 2) a strip of plaster or wood applied to a surface to act as a guide for a screed tool (screed rail, screed strip, screed batten); 3) the material itself which has been flattened with a screed (screed coat).[2] In the UK, screed has also come to describe a thin, top layer of material (traditionally sand and cement), poured in site on top of the structural concrete or insulation, on top of which other finishing materials can be applied, or it can be left bare to achieve a raw effect.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the US, screeding is the process a person called a concrete finisher performs by cutting off excess wet concrete to bring the top surface of a slab to the proper grade and smoothness. A power concrete screed has a gasoline motor attached which helps smooth and vibrate concrete as it is flattened. After the concrete is flattened it is smoothed with a concrete float or power trowel. A concrete floor is sometimes called a solid ground floor.\\r\\nA plasterer also may use a screed to level a wall or ceiling surface in plasterwork.\\r\\nThis sense of screed has been extended to asphalt paving where a free floating screed is part of a machine which spreads the pavement.\\r\\nA weep screed or sill screed is a screed rail which has drainage holes to allow moisture which penetrated an exterior plaster or stucco coating to drain through the screed.[3]\\r\\nFlowing screeds are made from inert fillers such as sand, with a binder system based on calcium sulphate. Consequently they can look very similar to a sand/cement screed[4] Flow screeds are often preferred to traditional cement based screeds as they are faster to install and provide a similar finish. Flow screed is most often used in combination with underfloor heating installation as the reduced thickness provides for more effective and efficient heat transfer.[5] One of the main advantages of liquid flow screed is that, it offers few additional benefits compared to sand and cement. It is anything but difficult to pour, with fluid properties that consider an expedient application and quicker drying time. There aren't any bigger advantages of this product than when combined with underfloor heatingsystem, a lesser thickness of liquid flooring screed, when compared with conventional screeds, minimises heat storage leading to a floor that reacts quickly to user requirement hence raising the efficacy of your underfloor heating method.\\r\\nA development in the UK is the delivery, mixing, and pumping of screed from a single vehicle. Where previously screed jobs required a separate pump to administer the screed, these new machines can now administer the screed directly from the mixing pan to the floor at a range of up to 60 meters. For example, the material called granolithic.","input":"What is the top layer of concrete called?"},{"output":"Gethin Jenkins","context":"The Wales national rugby union team (Welsh: T?m rygbi'r undeb cenedlaethol Cymru) competes annually in the Six Nations Championship with England, France, Ireland, Italy and Scotland. Wales have won the Six Nations and its predecessors 26 times outright. Wales' most recent championship win came in 2013.\\r\\nThe governing body, the Welsh Rugby Union (WRU), was established in 1881, the same year that Wales played their first international against England. Wales' performances in the Home Nations Championship (now the Six Nations) continued to improve, experiencing their first 'golden age' between 1900 and 1911. They first played New Zealand, known as the All Blacks, in 1905, when they defeated them 3ÿ0 in a famous match at Cardiff Arms Park. Welsh rugby struggled between the two World Wars, but experienced a second 'golden age' between 1969 and 1980 when they won eight Five Nations Championships.\\r\\nWales played in the inaugural Rugby World Cup in 1987 where they achieved their best ever result of third. Following the sport allowing professionalism in 1995, Wales hosted the 1999 World Cup and, in 2005, won their first Six Nations Grand Slam. That was the first Grand Slam won by a team playing most of the matches away from home. Wales won two more Grand Slams in 2008 and in 2012, and in 2011 came fourth in the Rugby World Cup.\\r\\nTheir home ground is the Millennium Stadium, currently known for sponsorship reasons as the Principality Stadium, completed in 1999 to replace the National Stadium at Cardiff Arms Park. Eight former Welsh players have been inducted into the World Rugby Hall of Fame; ten were inducted into the International Rugby Hall of Fame prior to its 2014 merger into the World Rugby Hall.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nRugby union took root in Wales in 1850, when Reverend Rowland Williams became Vice-Principal at St David's College, Lampeter, where he introduced the sport.[1] Wales played their first international on 19 February 1881; organised by Newport's Richard Mullock, Wales played against England, losing by seven goals, one drop goal and six tries to nil (8ÿ0).[2][3] On 12 March 1881, the Welsh Rugby Union was formed at The Castle Hotel, Neath.[2] Two years later, the Home Nation Championship?ÿ now the Six Nations Championship?ÿ was first played and Wales did not register a win.[4][5][6] However, rugby in Wales developed and, by the 1890s, the Welsh had developed the four three-quarters formation. This formation ÿ with seven backs and eight forwards, instead of six backs and nine forwards ÿ revolutionised the sport and was eventually adopted almost universally at international and club level.[7]\\r\\nWith the \\"four three-quarter\\" formation Wales became Home International Champions for the first time in 1893; in the process winning the Triple Crown.[7] Wales next won the Championship in 1900, heralding the first \\"golden age\\" of Welsh rugby which was to last until 1911.[8] They won two more Triple Crowns in 1902 and 1905,[9] and were runners up in 1901, 1903 and 1904.[6]\\r\\nWhen Wales faced New Zealand's All Blacks at Cardiff Arms Park in late 1905 they had not lost at home since 1899.[10] This New Zealand team ?ÿ now referred to as the Original All Blacks?ÿ was the first of the southern hemisphere national teams to visit the British Isles,[11] and were undefeated on their tour up until that point; their victories included prior defeats of England, Ireland and Scotland.[12][a] Before the match, the All Blacks performed a haka (a Mori posture dance); the 47,000-strong crowd responded with the Welsh national anthem?ÿ Hen Wlad Fy Nhadau (\\"Land of Our Fathers\\")?ÿ the first time a national anthem had been sung before a sporting fixture.[13] Wales' wing Teddy Morgan scored a try to give Wales a 3ÿ0 lead, but later in the match All Black Bob Deans claimed to have scored a try, only to be dragged behind the try-line before the referee arrived. The referee ruled a scrum to Wales and the score did not change; Wales winning 3ÿ0.[14] The loss was the All Blacks' only loss on their 35-match tour.[15]\\r\\nIn 1906, Wales again won the Home Championship,[9][b] and later that year played the South African national side, the Springboks for the first time. Wales were favourites to win the match,[16] but instead South Africa dominated in the forwards and eventually won 11ÿ0.[17][18] Two years later, on 12 December 1908, Wales played the touring Australians, the Wallabies, who they defeated 9ÿ6.[19]\\r\\nIn 1909, Wales won the Home Championship and then, in 1910 ÿ with the inclusion of France ÿ the first Five Nations. In 1911, Wales took the first Five Nations Grand Slam by winning all their matches in the Five Nations;[9][c] France were heavily defeated by Wales at St Helens in 1910 (49ÿ14) and Ivor Morgan scored two tries in the match. It would be nearly forty years before they achieved a Grand Slam again.[9] England's defeat of Wales at Cardiff in 1913 was Wales' first home loss to one of the Home Nations since 1899, and their first home loss to England since 1895.[20] The Great War came in 1914 and rugby was suspended for the duration.\\r\\nThe post-First World War years marked a decline in Welsh rugby. An industrial recession struck the principality, and hurt South Wales in particular. Welsh international results in the 1920s mirrored the performance of the economy: of their 42 matches they won only 17, with three drawn.[21] Half-a-million people emigrated from Wales to find work elsewhere during the depression;[22] this included many Welsh rugby union internationals who moved to the professional code of rugby league.[23] Between 1923 and 1928, Wales managed only seven victories ÿ five of them against France. However, even France managed to defeat Wales that decade; achieving their first victory over Wales in 1928.[24] Welsh selection policy reflected the upheavals of the mid-1920s. In 1924, 35 different players were selected for Wales' four matches, with a different captain for each; and only Edward Watkins in the backs and Charlie Pugh in the forwards, playing in all four matches.[21]\\r\\nA resurgence of both economy and rugby union followed in the 1930s and, in 1931, Wales won their first championship for nine years. That year, for the first time since the First World War, Wales retained the same side for two consecutive Tests when they faced England and Scotland.[25] Then, in 1933, captained by Watcyn Thomas, Wales defeated England at Twickenham.[26] In 1935, Wales beat the touring All Blacks by 13ÿ12, with Haydn Tanner making his first appearance. Although the Five Nations Championship was suspended during the Second World War[d] Wales did play a Red Cross charity match against England at Cardiff in 1940, which Wales lost 18ÿ9.[28]\\r\\nFollowing the Second World War, Wales played a New Zealand Army team (the Kiwis) in 1946, which Wales lost 11ÿ3.[29] The Five Nations (suspended during the war) resumed in 1947 when Wales shared the title with England. Although Wales suffered their first home defeat to France in 1948,[30] they won their first Five Nations Grand Slam since 1911 in 1950.[9] The next year, they lost to the touring South Africans 6ÿ3 despite dominating in the line-outs.[31] They achieved another Grand Slam in 1952,[9] followed by a 13ÿ8 win over the All Blacks in 1953.[32] In 1954, St Helens in Swansea (a Welsh international venue since 1882) hosted its last international and Cardiff Arms Park officially became the home of the Welsh team.[33] In 1956, Wales again won the Five Nations, but they did not regain the title until 1964 and did not win it outright until 1965.[9]\\r\\nWales conducted their first overseas tour in 1964, playing several games and one Test in South Africa.[34] They lost the Test against South Africa in Durban 24ÿ3, their biggest defeat in 40 years.[35] At the WRU annual general meeting that year, the outgoing WRU President D. Ewart Davies declared that \\"it was evident from the experience of the South African Tour that a much more positive attitude to the game was required in Wales?... Players must be prepared to learn, and indeed re-learn, to the absolute point of mastery, the basic principles of Rugby Union football\\".[36] This started the coaching revolution. The WRU Coaching Committee ÿ set up in the late 1950s ÿ was given the task of improving the quality of coaching and, in January 1967, Ray Williams was appointed Coaching Organiser.[37] The first national coach, David Nash, was appointed in 1967 to coach Wales for the season, but resigned when the WRU refused to allow him to accompany Wales on their 1968 tour of Argentina.[38] Eventually, the WRU reversed their decision, appointing Clive Rowlands to tour as coach. Of the six matches, Wales won three, drew two and lost one.[39]\\r\\nWales enjoyed a second \\"golden age\\" in the 1970s,[40][41][42] with world-class players such as Gareth Edwards,[42] J. P. R. Williams, Gerald Davies,[42] Barry John,[40] and Mervyn Davies,[43] in their side. Wales dominated Northern Hemisphere rugby between 1969 and 1979, and attained an incredible winning record, losing only seven times during that period.[40] Wales toured New Zealand for the first time in 1969, but were defeated in both Tests. As well as losing the first Test 19ÿ0, and the second 33ÿ12,[44] they also conceded 24 points to the All Blacks' fullback Fergie McCormick in the second Test; a record at the time.[45]\\r\\nIn 1970, Wales shared the Five Nations with France, and recorded a 6ÿ6 draw against South Africa in Cardiff.[46] The following year Wales recorded their first Five Nations Grand Slam since 1952. Using only 16 players in four games,[47] the 1971 side achieved their most notable win of the tournament in their victory over Scotland;[48] after a last minute try by Gerald Davies that reduced Scotland's lead to 18ÿ17, flanker John Taylor kicked a conversion from the sideline described as \\"the greatest conversion since St Paul\\" to give Wales a 19ÿ18 win.[49] Wales contributed more players than any other team to the British and Irish Lions that toured New Zealand that year. Those Lions became the only to win a series over the All Blacks.[50]\\r\\nIn the 1972 Five Nations Championship, Wales and Scotland refused to travel to Ireland at the height of the Troubles after receiving threats, purportedly from the Irish Republican Army.[51] The Championship remained unresolved with Wales and Ireland unbeaten. Although the Five Nations was a five way tie in 1973, the Welsh did defeat Australia 24ÿ0 in Cardiff.[52]\\r\\nWales next won the Five Nations outright in 1975, and in 1976, Wales won their second Grand slam of the decade. Just like the first in 1971, they only used 16 players over their four matches.[53] They repeated the feat in 1978 and, in the process, became the first team to win three consecutive Triple Crowns.[54] Following their final Five Nations match of 1978, both Phil Bennett and Gareth Edwards retired from rugby.[42]\\r\\nWales hosted the All Blacks at Cardiff Arms Park in November 1978, losing 13ÿ12 after a late penalty goal by the replacement All Black fullback, Brian McKechnie.[55] The penalty was controversial because All Black lock Andy Haden had dived out of a line-out in an attempt to earn a penalty. Haden later admitted that he and Frank Oliver had pre-agreed this tactic should the All Blacks find themselves in difficulties.[56][57] Referee Roger Quittenton was roasted by the press for failing to notice the dive, but he later stated he had the penalty was in for Welsh lock Geoff Wheel for jumping off the shoulder of Frank Oliver.[58] Quittenton later said, \\"Haden's perception is that his dive secured the penalty. That is a load of rubbish\\".[57] The All Blacks went on to secure their first Home Nations Grand Slam.[59][e] Wales then went on to win the 1979 Five Nations with a Triple Crown.[9]\\r\\nIn 1980, the WRU's centenary year,[60] Wales lost to the All Blacks in Cardiff by 23ÿ3 after the All Blacks scored four tries to nil.[61] Wales won two matches in each Five Nations of 1980 and 1981,[62] and in 1983 were nearly upset by Japan; winning 29ÿ24 at Cardiff.[63] In 1984, Australia defeated Wales 28ÿ9 at Cardiff Arms Park and in the process scored a push-over try. Australia went on to win their first Home Nations Grand Slam.[19]\\r\\nWales achieved only one win in 1987's Five Nations before contesting the inaugural Rugby World Cup.[62] Wales defeated Ireland in their crucial pool fixture,[64] before defeating England in the quarter-finals.[65] They then faced hosts the All Blacks who won 49ÿ6, but beat Australia in the third place play-off game to claim third.[66] The next year Wales won the Triple Crown for the first time since 1979, but heavy defeats on tour to New Zealand later that year saw the end of a number of Welsh players' careers, as several converted to rugby league.[60]\\r\\nWelsh rugby reached a nadir when Wales suffered their first Five Nations championship whitewash; they had upset England in 1989 to avoid losing all their Championship matches that season,[67] but in 1990 Wales were defeated in all four Five Nations' matches for the first time.[68] The 1991 World Cup saw further frustration when Wales were upset by Manu Samoa in their opening match.[69] A second group-stage loss, by 38ÿ3 to Australia, eliminated Wales from the tournament.[70]\\r\\nAfter winning two Five Nations games in 1992, and one in 1993,[71] Wales won the Championship in 1994 on points difference.[9] But without defeating one of Australia, New Zealand, or South Africa, during the inter-World Cup period, Wales was not considered a major tournament contender.[70][72] At the 1995 World Cup, after comprehensively beating Japan, Wales lost to New Zealand; this meant that they needed to defeat Ireland to qualify for the quarter-finals. Wales lost 24ÿ23 and so failed to progress beyond the pool stage for the second time,[73] and later that year Kevin Bowring replaced Alex Evans to become Wales' first full-time coach.[74]\\r\\nRecord defeats, 51ÿ0 to France, and 96ÿ13 to South Africa, prompted the WRU to appoint New Zealander Graham Henry as coach in 1998.[75][76] Henry had early success as coach, leading Wales to a ten-match winning streak; this included Wales' first victory over South Africa, by 29ÿ19.[75] Henry was consequently nicknamed \\"the great redeemer\\" by the Welsh media and fans.[76][77] Hosting the 1999 World Cup, Wales qualified for the quarter-finals for the first time since 1987, but lost 9ÿ24 to eventual champions Australia.[78] A lack of success in the Five and Six Nations (Italy joined the tournament in 2000), and especially a number of heavy losses to Ireland, led to Henry's resignation in February 2002; his assistant Steve Hansen took over.[75][76]\\r\\nDuring Hansen's tenure, the WRU implemented a significant change in the structure of the game domestically. Regional teams were introduced as a tier above the traditional club-based structures in 2003, and the five (then four) regional sides became the top level of domestic professional rugby in the principality.[f][79][80] At the 2003 World Cup, Wales scored four tries in their 53ÿ37 loss to New Zealand,[81] and also lost to the eventual tournament winners, England, in their quarter-final, despite outscoring them by three tries to one.[82]\\r\\nCoached by Mike Ruddock, Wales won their first Grand Slam since 1978 and their first Six Nations Grand Slam in 2005. A late long range penalty from Gavin Henson gave them a victory over England at Cardiff for the first time in 12 years,[83] and after victories over Italy, France, Scotland, they faced Ireland in front of a capacity crowd at the Millennium Stadium where Wales' 32ÿ20 victory gave them their first Championship since 1994.[84] Later that year they suffered a record home loss, 41ÿ3 to New Zealand.[85]\\r\\nMike Ruddock resigned as the head coach of Wales midway through the 2006 Six Nations,[86] where Wales finished fifth, and Gareth Jenkins was eventually appointed as his replacement.[87] Jenkins led Wales through the 2007 World Cup, where they failed to advance beyond the pool stage following a loss to Fiji.[88] Jenkins subsequently lost his job,[89][90] and Warren Gatland, a New Zealander, was appointed as his successor.[91]\\r\\nWales faced England at Twickenham for Gatland's inaugural match as coach and their first match of the 2008 Six Nations. They had not defeated England there since 1988, and went on to win 26ÿ19. They eventually won all their Championship matches, conceding only two tries in the process, to claim another Grand Slam.[92] Later that year Wales defeated Australia 21ÿ18 in Cardiff, but then started a six-year, twenty-three-game win-less streak against the southern hemisphere nations of Australia, New Zealand and South Africa.[93]\\r\\nAt the 2011 World Cup, Wales reached the tournament semi-finals for the first time since 1987 where they lost 9ÿ8 to France after a red card for captain Sam Warburton.[94] The two teams met again in March 2012, where Wales needed a win to claim their third Six Nations Grand Slam in eight years, which they did with a 16ÿ9 victory.[95] This was followed immediately by an eight-match losing streak, which was eventually broken during the 2013 Six Nations,[96] where Wales retained the Championship for the first time since 1979 wins.[97] Wales reached the quarter-finals of the 2015 World Cup at the expense of hosts England, then lost 23ÿ19 to South Africa.[98]\\r\\nWales play in red jerseys, white shorts and red socks. For the 2015ÿ16 season, the design of the Jersey incorporated gold for the first time. The jerseys are embroidered with the Prince of Wales's feathers, which were chosen in the 19th century by the WRU over another Welsh symbol, the leek, to demonstrate the nation's loyalty to Britain.[99] In 1991, to enable the device to be trademarked, the original generic motif was replaced with a more stylised version. The original motto beneath the feathers was Ich dien (German for \\"I serve\\") but was replaced with \\"WRU\\" in the new version.[100]\\r\\nWales change strip?ÿ also known as the alternative strip?ÿ is black jerseys, shorts and socks.[101] although there have been various different coloured strips in the past Former change strips worn by Wales have included a green, navy, white or grey jersey.[102] Wales previously wore black jerseys as part of celebrations for the WRU's 125th anniversary in 2005. The jersey was worn against Fiji and then Australia that year; the Australia match was the first time Wales had not played in their red jersey against one of their traditional rivals.[102] Since the 2008 end-of-year Tests, the strip is made by Under Armour. They replaced Reebok who supplied the Wales strip between late 1996 and the 2008 mid-year-Tests.[103] The shirt sponsor is Cardiff based Insurance firm, Admiral.[104][g]\\r\\nRugby union and Wales' national team hold an important place in Welsh culture and society. Sport historian John Bale has stated that \\"rugby is characteristically Welsh\\", and David Andrew said that \\"To the popular consciousness, rugby is as Welsh as coal mining, male voice choirs, How Green Was My Valley, Dylan Thomas, and Tom Jones\\".[112] Welsh rugby's first 'golden age' (1900ÿ1911) coincided with the country's zenith during the 20th century,[113] and rugby was important in building Wales' modern identity.[114] There is a long tradition of Welsh supporters singing before and during matches. The choral tradition developed in Wales during the nineteenth-century alongside the rise of nonconformity, and has extended to singing at rugby matches.[115] Commonly sung songs include the hymn Bread of Heaven,[115] Tom Jones' Delilah,[116] and Max Boyce's Hymns and Arias.[117]\\r\\nWales' first home international was played at St Helen's ground, Swansea in 1882.[118] In the 1880s and 1890s, home Welsh internationals were played at Cardiff, Swansea, Newport and Llanelli.[119] Swansea continued to be used as an international venue until 1954, when Cardiff Arms Park became Wales' primary home venue.[120][121] Cardiff Arms Park first had a stand erected in 1881, and continued to expand its seating that decade.[122] Crowds continued to grow and in 1902 in Wales' match against Scotland a world record 40,000 spectators paid to see the match.[123] In 1911, the owners of the Arms Park, the Marquess of Bute's family,[124] confirmed Wales' tenure and the 1920s and 1930s, Wales gradually gained increasing control.[125] A new stand was built at the park in the 1933ÿ34 season, which increased the grounds capacity to 56,000.[126]\\r\\nBy 1958, the WRU had concluded that a new national ground was needed due to flooding that often plagued Arms Park.[127] After debate and disputes between the WRU and various other parties, including Cardiff RFC, in the 1960s, it was decided that a new national stadium would be built with a new ground for the Cardiff club backing onto it.[128] The National Stadium, as it was known, was officially opened in 1970.[129]\\r\\nCurrently, Wales play all their home matches at the 74,500 capacity Millennium Stadium, Cardiff, which is also Wales' national stadium.[130] The Millennium Stadium was first conceived in 1994, when a group redevelopment committee was set up. It was decided to replace the National Stadium at Cardiff Arms Park after a review found it was out of date; new legislation also required stadia to be all seated.[131] Construction began in September 1997, and was completed by June 1999, in time for the Rugby World Cup. The construction cost the WRU S126?million, which was funded by private investment, S46?million of public funds from the National Lottery, the sale of debentures to supporters (which offered guaranteed tickets in exchange for an interest-free loan), and loans.[132] While the new ground was being built, Wales used the old Wembley Stadium for their home matches[133]?ÿ a deal reciprocated during construction of the new Wembley, when FA Cup finals were held at the Millennium Stadium.[134]\\r\\nWales compete annually in the Six Nations Championship, which is played against five other European nations: England, France, Ireland, Italy, and Scotland. The Six Nations started as the Home Nations Championship in 1883, as a contest between the four component nations of the United Kingdom. Wales first won it in 1893, when they achieved a Triple Crown.[4][7] Wales have won the tournament outright 26 times, and shared eleven other victories.[135] Their longest wait between championships was 11 years (1994ÿ2005). Wales first won a Grand Slam in 1908?ÿ although France did not officially join the Five Nations until 1910?ÿ and their first Six Nations Grand Slam in 2005.[4][136] Their latest Grand Slam was won against France on 17 March 2012, and they claimed their most recent Triple Crown on 25 February 2012 against England.\\r\\nWales have contested every Rugby World Cup since the inaugural tournament in 1987.\\r\\nThe 1987 tournament was Wales' most successful; they won all three pool matches and their quarter-final, before losing to the All Blacks in the semi-finals. They then faced Australia in the third place play-off match, which they won 22ÿ21.[66]\\r\\nIn the next two tournaments in 1991 and 1995, Wales failed to progress beyond the pool stage, winning just one match in each tournament.[70][73] They also became the first co host nation to not make it out of the pool stage in 1991.\\r\\nBoth the 1999 and 2003 tournaments were more successful, with Wales qualifying for the quarter-finals both times. Wales hosted the event in 1999 and topped their pool only to lose to eventual winners Australia in the quarter-finals.[78][137]\\r\\nIn 2003, they finished second in their pool behind the All Blacks,[81] and faced England in their quarter-final. They lost to England, the eventual champions, 28ÿ17. Wales conceded 17 penalties, and their lack of discipline proved costly.[82]\\r\\nIn the 2007 World Cup, Wales again failed to progress from the pool stage. After a loss to Australia, and two wins against Japan and Canada, they faced Fiji for a place in the quarter-finals.[88] The game started poorly for Wales who were behind 25ÿ3 at half-time. They fought back to lead by three points with six minutes remaining, but Fiji then scored a try to win 38ÿ34 and eliminated Wales from the tournament.[89]\\r\\nAt the 2011 World Cup, Wales reached the semi-finals for the first time since 1987. Playing the semi-finals against France, Wales lost 9ÿ8, in a game overshadowed by the 18th-minute sending off of Wales' captain Sam Warburton for a dangerous tackle against Vincent Clerc.[94]\\r\\nAt the 2015 World Cup Wales were in the same pool as Australia, England, Fiji and Uruguay. They finished second in the pool behind Australia and ahead of hosts England. South Africa defeated Wales in the quarter final.\\r\\nWhen the World Rugby Rankings were introduced in October 2003, Wales were ranked 8th.[h] They rose to 7th in June 2004, before falling back to 8th in November that year. Following a Grand Slam win in the 2005 Six Nations, they rose to a ranking position of 5th. They fell to 9th by June 2006, and, after rising back to 8th by September, fell to 10th after the 2007 World Cup. A second Six Nations' Grand Slam in 2008 propelled them to 6th in the rankings, but following losses to South Africa in the mid-year and end-of-year internationals Wales slipped to 7th. Wales climbed to 4th after a win over Scotland in their first match of the 2009 Six Nations. They slumped to 9th in 2010 but rose back to 4th after their fourth place in the 2011 World Cup.[139] Since then ÿ notwithstanding a nine-game slump in 2012ÿ13 where they fell to 9th ÿ Wales have ranked consistently in the top six teams. They reached their highest ranking of 2nd during the 2015 Rugby World Cup[140], and are currently ranked 3rd as of 18th June 2018. Wales have won 369 of their 712 Test matches for a 51.83% winning record.[141][142] Their biggest Test defeat was 96ÿ13 loss to South Africa in 1998, and their largest victory a 98ÿ0 defeat of Japan in 2004. Their record for most tries in a match is 16, scored against Portugal in 1994?ÿ they also scored 102 points in this match, more than in any other Test. Wales' record for consecutive Test wins is eleven, and for consecutive losses is ten.[142]\\r\\nBelow is table summary of Wales Test matches up until 16th June 2018.[141][142]\\r\\nOn 8 May, head coach Warren Gatland named a 31-man squad for the 2018 Summer Internationals.\\r\\nOn 16 May, Luke Charteris, Tomas Francis and Josh Adams were forced to pull out of the squad due to selection protocols, while Josh Navidi withdrew due to injury.

The party recommended that Welsh clubs accept the principle of coaching. David Nash was appointed as the national team's first coach in 1967, but for the 1968 tour of Argentina, the WRU initially planned not to have a coach tour with the team. Following pressure from the Welsh clubs at the WRU's annual general meeting, the decision was reversed and Clive Rowlands was appointed as coach for the tour.[37] The appointing of a coach for the team coincided with Wales' success in the Five Nations during the 1970s.[176]","input":"Who is the most capped welsh rugby player?"},{"output":"Bassenthwaite Lake","context":"This list contains the lakes, tarns and reservoirs in the Lake District National Park in Cumbria, England.\\r\\nNote that only one body of water, Bassenthwaite Lake, is traditionally named a lake.

It is based on the book of the same name and was broadcast on NBC on November 14ÿ15, 1976.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter suffering a small breakdown in front of her students, Sybil Dorsett is given a neurological examination by Dr. Cornelia Wilbur, a psychiatrist. She admits to having blackouts and fears they are getting worse. Dr. Wilbur theorizes that the incidents are a kind of hysteria, all related to a deeper problem. She asks Sybil to return at a later date for more counseling.\\r\\nLater that evening, Dr. Wilbur receives a late night call from someone who identifies herself as Vickie and says Sybil is about to jump out a hotel window. Dr. Wilbur rescues Sybil, who denies knowing Vickie. Suddenly, Sybil becomes hysterical and begins speaking like a little girl. This little girl introduces herself as Peggy, and Wilbur realizes that Sybil is suffering from dissociative identity disorder.\\r\\nVickie introduces herself to Wilbur at the next session. Vickie, who knows everything about the other personalities, tells Wilbur about some of them, including Marcia, who is suicidal and wants to kill Sybil, and Vanessa, who plays the piano although Sybil has not played in years and swears she forgot how to play piano.\\r\\nOver the weeks, each of the personalities introduce themselves to Wilbur. At the same time, the personality Vanessa falls in love with a charming neighbor named Richard.\\r\\nWilbur finally explains to Sybil about the other personalities. As proof, Wilbur plays the session's tape to allow Sybil to hear their voices, but when a voice that sounds like Sybil's mother Hattie speaks, an infant personality named Ruthie emerges. Wilbur is unable to communicate with the pre-verbal child and must wait until Sybil returns.\\r\\nLife becomes more chaotic for Sybil as the other personalities grow stronger. The personalities make Dr. Wilbur a Christmas card, but Sybil made everything purple, a color that frightens Peggy. Dr. Wilbur hypnotizes Vickie and asks about the purple. Vickie relates a memory of a time Sybil's mother locked young Sybil in the wheat bin in the barn. Thinking she was smothering, Sybil used her purple crayon to scratch on the inside of the bin so someone would know she had been there.\\r\\nVanessa invites Richard and his son Matthew to have Christmas dinner, after which Richard spends the night in Sybil's apartment. Sybil has a nightmare and awakens as Marcia, who tries to throw herself off the roof. Richard rescues her and calls Wilbur. Soon afterwards, Richard moves away, crushing both Sybil and Vanessa. Once again confronted with her diagnosis, Sybil attempts to convince Wilbur that she has in fact been faking all of the other personalities the entire time and denies that multiple personalities exist within her.\\r\\nWilbur goes in search of Sybil's father, who mentions that Sybil's mother Hattie was diagnosed with paranoid schizophrenia, but denies that she ever abused Sybil. Wilbur also seeks out Sybil's paediatrician. The doctor gives Wilbur a frightening account of extensive scarring he found while treating Sybil for a bladder problem. Finally, Wilbur visits the old Dorsett house, where she discovers the green kitchen Sybil's selves have described many times. She also finds the purple crayon scratches inside the wheat bin. She takes them back to New York City to prove all the memories really happened.\\r\\nDr. Wilbur takes Sybil for a drive, during which Peggy reveals the horrific physical and sexual abuse she suffered at her mother's hands. After Peggy exhausts herself, Sybil emerges, remembering everything that Peggy has just said. Finally, she is able to express her rage against her mother.\\r\\nDr. Wilbur hypnotizes Sybil to introduce her to the other personalities. Sybil, who has always been frightened of Peggy, meets her at last and is surprised that she is only a little girl. Sybil embraces a weeping Peggy. A voiceover from Dr. Wilbur explains that after this incident, Sybil recovered her memories and went on to live a full and happy life.\\r\\nSally Field stars in the title role, with Joanne Woodward playing the part of Sybil's psychiatrist, Cornelia B. Wilbur. Woodward herself had starred in The Three Faces of Eve, in which she portrayed a woman with three personalities, winning the Academy Award for Best Actress for the role.[1] Based on the book Sybil by Flora Rheta Schreiber, the movie dramatizes the life of a shy young graduate student, Sybil Dorsett (in real life, Shirley Ardell Mason), suffering from dissociative identity disorder as a result of the psychological trauma she suffered as a child. With the help of her psychiatrist, Sybil gradually recalls the severe child abuse that led to the development of 16 different personalities.[1] Field's portrayal of Sybil won much critical acclaim, as well as an Emmy Award.\\r\\nThe film, originally 198 minutes long, was initially shown over the course of two nights on NBC in 1976. Due to high public interest, the VHS version of Sybil was released in the 1980s, with one version running 122 minutes and another, extended version running 132 minutes. Several key scenes, including Sybil's final climactic \\"introduction\\" to her other personalities, are missing in both versions.

Cyprinids from the Indian subcontinent, for example, catla (Catla catla) and mrigal (Cirrhinus cirrhosus) are not included in this classification, and are known collectively as \\"Indian carp\\".\\r\\nTen Asian carp have been substantially introduced outside of their native ranges:\\r\\nAll the above, except largescale silver carp, have been cultivated in aquaculture in China for over 1,000 years. Largescale silver carp, a more southern species, is native to Vietnam and is cultivated there. Grass, silver, bighead, and black carp are known as the \\"Four Domesticated Fish\\" in China and are the most important freshwater fish species for food and traditional Chinese medicine. Bighead and silver carp are the most important fish, worldwide, in terms of total aquaculture production.[1] Common carp, Amur carp and crucian carp are also common foodfishes in China and elsewhere. Goldfish, though, are cultivated mainly as pet fish. Common carp are native to both Eastern Europe and Western Asia,[2] so they are sometimes called a \\"Eurasian\\" carp.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nA long tradition of Asian carp exists in Chinese culture and literature. A popular lyric circulating as early as 2000 years ago in the late Han period includes an anecdote which relates how a man far away from home sent back to his wife a pair of carp (Chinese: ?Y; pinyin: Liyu), in which, when the wife opened the fish to cook, she found a silk strip that carried a love note of just two lines: Eat well to keep fit (first line) and Missing you and forget me not (second line).\\r\\nAt the Yellow River at Henan (Chinese: Tq; pinyin: Hnn; WadeÿGiles: Ho-nan) is a waterfall called the Dragon Gate. It is said that if certain carp called yulong can climb the cataract, they will transform into dragons. Every year in the third month of spring, they swim up from the sea and gather in vast numbers in the pool at the foot of the falls. It used to be said that only 71 could make the climb in any year. When the first succeeded, then the rains would begin to fall. This Dragon Gate was said to have been created after the flood by the god-emperor Yu, who split a mountain blocking the path of the Yellow River. It was so famous that throughout China was a common saying, \\"a student facing his examinations is like a carp attempting to leap the Dragon Gate.\\"\\r\\nHenan is not the only place where this happens. Many other waterfalls in China also have the name Dragon Gate and much the same is said about them. Other famous Dragon Gates are on the Wei River where it passes through the Lung Sheu Mountains and at Tsin in Shanxi Province. The fish's jumping feature is set in such a proverbial idiom as \\"Liyu (Carp) jumps over the Dragon Gate (Chinese: ?d??),\\" an idiom that conveys a vivid image symbolizing a sudden uplifting in one's social status, as when one ascends into the upper society or has found favor with the royal or a noble family, perhaps through marriage, but in particular through success in the imperial examination. It is therefore an idiom often used to encourage students or children to achieve success through hard work and perseverance. This symbolic image, as well as the image of carp itself, has been one of the most popular themes in Chinese paintings, especially those of popular styles. The fish is usually colored in gold or pink, shimmering with an unmistakably auspicious tone. Yuquan (ޔ?? in Chinese), one of the well-known scenic spots in Hangzhou, has a large fish pond alive with hundreds of carp of various colors. A three-character inscription, Yu-Le-Guo (Ϛֱ), meaning \\"fishs paradise\\", is set above one end of the pond in the calligraphy of a famous gentry-scholar of the late Ming Dynasty named Dong Qichang (Chinese: ݶ). Many tourists feed the fish with bread crumbs.\\r\\nAmong the various kinds of carp, the silver carp is least expensive in China. The grass carp is still a main delicacy in Hangzhou cuisine. Restaurants along the West Lake of the city keep the fish in cages submerged in the lake water right in front of the restaurant; on an order from a customer, they dash a live fish on the pavement to kill it before cooking. The fish is normally served with a vinegar-based sweet-and-sour sauce (Chinese: lRY).\\r\\nSilver carp have become notorious for being easily frightened by boats and personal watercraft, which cause them to leap high into the air. The fish can jump up to 2.5ÿ3.0 m (8ÿ10 ft) into the air, and numerous boaters have been severely injured by collisions with the fish.[3] According to the EPA, \\"reported injuries include cuts from fins, black eyes, broken bones, back injuries, and concussions.\\".[4] Silver carp can grow to 45?kg (100?lb) in mass.[5] This behavior has sometimes also been attributed to the very similar bighead carp, but this is uncommon. Bighead carp do not normally jump when frightened.[1] Catching jumping carp in nets has become part of the Redneck Fishing Tournament, in Bath, Illinois.[6] Other parties, such as the Peoria Carp Hunters, have taken advantage of the jumping ability as a mechanism of hunting the carp, in some cases to purge the invasive species.[7]\\r\\nAsian carp have been a popular food fish in Asia for thousands of years. Some recipes are specifically for carp such as Tngc Ly~?(zh) (sweet-and-sour carp) and Koikoku?(ja) (thick miso soup with carp). However, many people in North America associate Asian carp with common carp, a bottom-feeding, highly bony species which was introduced from Eurasia in the 1800s and is not widely regarded as food.[8]\\r\\nThe pearly white fleshcomplicated by a series of bonesis said to taste like cod or described as tasting like a cross between scallops and crabmeat. They are low in mercury because they do not eat other fish. To make the fish more appealing to American consumers, the fish have been renamed silverfin or Kentucky tuna.[9] Volunteer efforts to increase the popularity further include making and selling carp-based dishes and using the entrails to make fertilizer.[10]\\r\\nSome have thought to collect the carp eggs for caviar, since one bighead carp was found with over 2 million eggs. Two million eggs from one fish could fill two jars of caviar, which would be quite valuable. This is only true, however, in the case of a fish from which people would eat eggs. As of now, no market for carp eggs exists in America,[11] though there is a movement that is trying to increase the popularity of carp eggs in Europe.[12]\\r\\nIn April 2015, a company called BareItAll Petfoods, based in Chicago, created the first commercially available pet food featuring Asian carp as a means to reduce the populations in the waterways of the Midwest.\\r\\nAsian carp are an invasive species. Some species of Asian carp cause harm when they are introduced to new environments. The black carp feeds on native mussels and snails, some of which can be already endangered. Grass carp can alter the food webs of a new environment by altering the communities of plants, invertebrates, and fish. Silver carp feed on the plankton necessary for larval fish and native mussels.[13]\\r\\nBecause of their prominence, and because they were imported to the United States much later than other carp native to Asia, the term \\"Asian carp\\" is often used with the intended meaning of only grass, black, silver, and bighead carp. In the US, Asian carp are considered to be invasive species. Of the Asian carp introduced to the United States, only two (crucian and black carp) are not known to be firmly established. Crucian carp is probably extirpated.[14] Since 2003, however, several adult, fertile black carp have been captured from the Atchafalaya and other rivers connected to the Mississippi River.[15] Dr. Leo Nico, in the book Black carp: Biological Synopsis and Risk Assessment of an Introduced Fish, reports that black carp are probably established in the United States. In South Florida, the local water management district actually stocks the canals with sterilized grass carp to control the hydrilla plant, which tends to block the locks and drainage valves used to control water flow from the Everglades.\\r\\nThe common carp was brought to the U.S. in 1831, and has been widespread for a long time. In the late 19th century, it was distributed widely throughout the United States by the United States Fish Commission as a foodfish.[16] However, common carp are not now normally prized as a foodfish in the United States. They are often known to uproot vegetation and muddy water through their habit of rooting in the mud for food. They are thought often to have detrimental effects on native species.[16] However, in Europe, common carp are prized as a sportfish, and angling for common carp is enjoying increased popularity in the United States.\\r\\nIn the 1970s, fish farmers in mostly Southern states began importing Asian carp from China to help clean their commercial ponds.[17][18] The rise in the populations of bighead and silver carp has been dramatic where they are established in the Mississippi River basin.[19] Although many sources cite the record floods of the 1990s as the means by which Asian carp escaped aquaculture ponds into the Mississippi River,[20] this is apocryphal. At least one known escape of bighead carp from aquaculture ponds occurred in 1995, but bighead and silver carp were established in the Mississippi River basin prior to 1990.[21][22] Grass carp have been reproducing in the Mississippi River since the 1970s.[23]\\r\\nBighead, silver, and grass carp are known to be well-established in the Mississippi River basin (including tributaries), where they at times reach extremely high numbers, especially in the case of the bighead and silver carp. Bighead, silver, and grass carp have been captured in that watershed from Louisiana to South Dakota, Minnesota, and Ohio. Grass carp are also established in at least one other watershed, in Texas, and may be established elsewhere.\\r\\nThe Asian carp have recently been found in Lake Calumet in Illinois. Grass carp have been captured in every Great Lake except Lake Superior, but so far, no evidence indicates a reproducing population, although a juvenile grass carp was caught in a river leading to Lake Scugog. No silver carp or black carp have yet been found in any Great Lake. Common carp are abundant throughout the Great Lakes. Current records of where Asian carp have been captured may be found at the United States Geological Survey's Nonindigenous Aquatic Species website.[24]\\r\\nThese fish are thought to be highly detrimental to the environment in parts of the United States.[25] Because of these concerns, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service convened stakeholders to develop a national plan for the management and control of invasive Asian carp (referring to bighead, silver, black, and grass carp).[26] The plan was accepted by the National Aquatic Nuisance Species Task Force in the fall of 2007.\\r\\nIn July, 2007, the U.S. Department of the Interior declared all silver carp and largescale silver carp to be injurious species under the Lacey Act.[4] In July 2012, Congress included the \\"Stop Invasive Species Act\\" as an amendment to a transportation bill it approved. The act requires the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers to speed up implementation of strategies to protect the Great Lakes from Asian carp.[27]\\r\\nBighead and silver carp feed by filtering plankton from the water. The extremely high abundance of bighead and silver carp has caused great concern because of the potential for competition with native species for food and living space. Because of their filter-feeding habits, they are difficult to capture by normal angling methods.\\r\\nIn Canada, the federal Department of Fisheries and Oceans has evaluated the risk of Asian carp invading Canadian waters, particularly the Great Lakes, either by introduction from the Mississippi or through the market in live carp.[28] A few bighead and grass carp have been captured in Canada's portions of the Great Lakes, but no Asian carp (other than common carp, an originally Eurasian species) is known to be established in Canada at this time. Concerns exist that the silver carp may spread into Cypress Hills in Alberta and Saskatchewan through Battle Creek (Milk River), the Frenchman River, and other rivers flowing south out of the hills into the Milk River. In Mexico, grass carp have been established for many years in at least two river systems, where they are considered invasive, but no other Asian carp are known to have been introduced.\\r\\nThe United States Environmental Protection Agency is also concerned about the possibility of Asian carp migrating to the Great Lakes.[29] In 2002, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers completed an electric fish barrier in the Chicago Sanitary and Ship Canal, the only navigable aquatic link between the Great Lakes and the Mississippi River drainage basins. The initial fish barrier was used as a demonstration project to study the design's effectiveness. Following positive results, construction began on a second, permanent barrier in 2004.[30] In addition to the canal, the corps has identified 18 sites in five additional states, from Minnesota to New York, that could allow for movement of Mississippi basin carp into the Great Lakes.[31]\\r\\nU.S. Representative Dave Camp from Michigan's 4th district and Senator Debbie Stabenow of Michigan introduced the Close All Routes and Prevent Asian Carp Today (CARPACT), which directs the Army Corps of Engineers to take action to prevent Asian carp from entering the Great Lakes, which is estimated to cost more than $30 million in 2010. The act will make sure the locks and sluice gates at the OBrien Lock and Dam and the Chicago Controlling Works are closed and remain closed until a better strategy is developed. The act will also enhance existing barriers and monitoring systems by giving authority to the Army Corps of Engineers to obtain real estate necessary for the construction and maintenance of the barrier. The corps also has the authority to eliminate and prevent the spread of the carp using fish toxicants, commercial fishing and netting, and harvesting.[32] A new report issued in 2012 by the Great Lakes Commission concludes that physical separation of the Great Lakes and the Mississippi River watersheds is the best long-term solution to prevent Asian carp and other invasive species from migrating between the waterbodies.[33]\\r\\nIn November, 2009, carp genetic material was detected beyond the two electric barriers, leaving only a single lock/dam on the Calumet River between the detected presence and Lake Michigan. \\"This is absolutely an emergency\\", Joel Brammeier, acting president of the Alliance for the Great Lakes, was quoted as saying, referring to the ecological threat, and also mentioning the threat to recreational boaters. \\"Mr. Brammeier and some others called for the immediate closing of the lock ... though others doubted it was feasible to stop shipping traffic [there].\\" \\"All options are on the table\\", said Jacqueline Y. Ashmon, a spokeswoman for the Corps of Engineers. \\"We dont have any specifics.\\"[34]\\r\\nIn the first week of December, 2009, the Army Corps made plans to shut down one of the electric barriers for maintenance, and the Illinois Department of Natural Resources responded by dumping 2,200 gallons of the toxin rotenone into the canal. Rotenone, the report said, is deadly for fish, but not harmful to humans, animals, or most other aquatic life. While \\"scores\\" of fish were killed, only one carp was found, near Lockport Lock and Dam and nearly six miles below the electronic barriers.[35] The fish kill cost $3 million and produced 90 tons of dead fish, reported one commentator, who also noted a parallel with an intentional fish kill in Chicago, in Lincoln Park's South Pond, by the IDNR in November, 2008.[36]\\r\\nOther efforts to reduce the number of Asian carp have included encouraging the public to eat more carp and fisheries shipping the fish to other markets, such as Israel, and have included the participation of then Secretary of State Hillary Clinton.[37]\\r\\nOn June 22, 2010, a 19-pound Asian carp was found near the shore of Lake Michigan, in Lake Calumet, about six miles downstream from Lake Michigan, by a commercial fisherman hired by the state of Illinois to do routine fish sampling in the area.[38] The fish confirms DNA evidence that Asian carp have indeed breached the electric fish barrier on the Chicago Sanitary and Ship Canal.\\r\\nStopping these invasive carp from spreading into Lake Erie is another concern to many involved, as Lake Erie provides the ideal habitat for the carp to survive. This could lead to the fish choking out the other native fish that exist there. Ohio has a multimillion-dollar sport fishing and boating industry. Allowing these fish to choke out native species would cause a huge hit to this industry. This is especially true since catching these carp with traditional fishing methods is so difficult, which makes it harder for the industry to shift the sport fishing from one fish to another.[39]\\r\\nOn August 24, 2010, a carp reportedly knocked a kayaker out of competition in a Missouri River race at Lexington in western Missouri.[40]\\r\\nOn September 8, 2010, the Council on Environmental Quality announced the appointment of John Goss as the Asian Carp Director. Goss' role is primarily to serve as the principal advisor to the CEQ's chair, Nancy Sutley on Asian carp issues, and oversee federal, state, and local coordination on Asian carp control efforts. Goss was previously executive director of the Indiana Wildlife Federation (a state affiliate of the National Wildlife Federation), director of the Indiana Department of Natural Resources, and vice-chairman of the Great Lakes Commission.[41]\\r\\nThe Stop Asian Carp Act of 2011 was introduced to require the Secretary of the Army to study the feasibility of the hydrological separation, such as electric barriers, of the Great Lakes and Mississippi River basins.[42] The act provided 30 days for the Secretary of the Army to begin a study on the best means of implementing a hydrological separation of the Great Lakes to prevent the introduction of Asian carp. The study requirements included researching techniques that prevented the spread of carp from flooding, wastewater and storm water infrastructure, waterway safety operations, and barge and recreational traffic.\\r\\nIn 2012, the U.S. Senate and House introduced new bills aimed at combating the spread of Asian carp into the Great Lakes by expediting some items of the Stop Asian Carp Act of 2011.[43] The legislation provides direction to the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers to complete their study within 18 months on how to separate the Great Lakes from the Mississippi watersheds. The USGS collaborated with the University of Minnesota to prepare an extensive report on the use of environmental deoxyribonucleic acid (eDNA) to detect a species in a waterway. This report was put together after extensive field research resulting from positive findings of the eDNA of Asian carp in Minnesota waterways in 2011. Rivers being researched are the Mississippi and St. Croix Rivers. However, new research was unable to redetect the presence of Asian carp, although several have been caught in Minnesota over the past two years.[44] Possibilities of why Asian carp were not detected include a change in the method of sampling or a disappearance of the carp from Minnesota waterways.\\r\\nThe Upper Mississippi CARP Act was presented to Congress as recently as 2013. Presented by Congressmen Ellison of Minnesota, the Upper Mississippi CARP Act would empower the Secretary of the Army to enact strategies previously determined to prevent further spread of Asian carp and begin eliminating the species. Included in this legislation is the requirement for the Army Corp of Engineers to shut down the Upper St. Anthony Falls lock if Asian carp are detected in the portion of the Mississippi River near the Twin Cities. U.S. Senator Amy Klobuchar (DFL) told the Pierce County Herald, Asian carp not only pose a serious threat to Minnesotas environment, and they also threaten the recreation and fishing industries that play a key role in the states economy. We must do everything we can to stop the further spread of this invasive species into our lakes and rivers, and this legislation will help the state take action to protect Minnesotas waterways.[45]\\r\\nIn May 2013, a test for silver carp eDNA in the waters of Sturgeon Bay in Lake Michigan near Green Bay, Wisconsin was positive. The carp are active in May. The result was published in October and scientists will retest in May, 2014.[46]\\r\\nIn July 2015, two grass carp were found within days of each other in contained ponds near Toronto's Lake Ontario waterfront. This could mean a variety of things, but has yet to prove that widespread reproduction is taking place in Lake Ontario,[47] although both fish were male and fertile. The United States and Canadian authorities have been working together to determine where the fish originated and how to stop a potential invasion into the Great Lakes,[48] however in early September three more grass carp were found near the Toronto Islands.[49]\\r\\nAs of 2016, efforts were being made to reintroduce alligator gar between Tennessee and Illinois as part of an effort to control Asian carp.[50]\\r\\nOn December 21, 2009, Michigan Attorney General Mike Cox filed a lawsuit with the U.S. Supreme Court seeking the immediate closure of the Chicago Sanitary and Ship Canal to keep the Asian carp out of Lake Michigan. Neighboring Great Lakes states and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, which constructed the canal, are co-defendants in the lawsuit.[51]\\r\\nIn response to the Michigan lawsuit, on January 5, 2010, Illinois Attorney General Lisa Madigan filed a counter-suit with the Supreme Court, requesting it to reject Michigan's claims. The Illinois Chamber of Commerce and American Waterways Operators both sided with Illinois in the lawsuit, filing affidavits (amicus briefs) and arguing that closing the Chicago Sanitary and Ship Canal would upset the movement of millions of tons of vital shipments of iron ore, coal, grain, and other cargo, totaling more than $1.5 billion a year, and contribute to the loss of hundreds, perhaps thousands of jobs. In response, Michigan noted the value of the sport fishing and recreation industry, already heavily affected in other states with large carp populations, would drop by more than $3.0 billion and result in the loss of at least 4,000 jobs. President Obama and his administration supported Illinois's efforts to keep the canal open; with the support of USGS and USFWS, reports have consistently denied the Asian carp poses a threat.[52]\\r\\nOn January 19, 2010, the Supreme Court rejected the Michigan injunction request, but took no action on Michigan's separate request to reopen older cases regarding Chicago water withdrawal from Lake Michigan.[53] The litigation proceeds in lower courts.[54]\\r\\nOn January 1, 2010, the Ontario government also filed a lawsuit (alongside the American states) in an American court to stop the dumping of Asian carp into the Great Lakes, a potentially damaging act to the fishing industry (of Canada).[55]","input":"What causes asian carp to jump out of the water?"},{"output":"undergraduate academic degree","context":"An associate degree (or associate's degree) is an undergraduate academic degree awarded by colleges and universities upon completion of a course of study intended to usually last two years or more. It is considered to be a greater level of education than a high school diploma or GED. The first associate degrees were awarded in the U.K. (where they are[when?] no longer awarded) in 1873 before spreading to the U.S. in 1898. They have since been introduced in a small number of other countries.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 2004, Australia added \\"associate degree\\" to the Australian Qualifications Framework.[1] This title was given to courses more academically focused than advanced diploma courses, and typically designed to articulate to bachelor's degree courses.[2]\\r\\nAssociate degrees in Arts and Science are offered as provincial qualifications in British Columbia. They are similar to the U.S. associate degree, consisting of a two-year course and allowing articulation onto the third year of bachelor's degree courses.[3][4]\\r\\nOther provinces of Canada do not offer associate degrees as such, but do offer sub-bachelor's higher education qualifications, e.g. the one year certificate, two year diploma and three year advanced diploma in Ontario.[5] In Quebec, the Dipl?me d'tudes collgiales (diploma of college studies), taught at post-secondary collges d'enseignement gnral et professionnel (colleges of general and professional education; cgeps) can be a two-year pre-university qualification that is a pre-requisite for entry onto (three year) bachelor's degree courses, or a three-year technical programme preparing students for employment.[6]\\r\\nQualifications on the short cycle of the Bologna Process/level 6 on the European Qualifications Framework sit between secondary education and bachelor's degree level and are thus approximately equivalent to an associate degree. Such qualifications include the Foundation degree (FdA, FdSc, FdEng), Certificate of Higher Education (CertHE) and Diploma of Higher Education (DipHE) in the United Kingdom,[7] the Higher Certificate in the Republic of Ireland,[8] and the French Dipl?me Universitaire de Technologie (DUT) and Brevet de Technicien Suprieur (BTS).[9]\\r\\nIn the Netherlands, there were four pilots between 2005 and 2011 to assess the added value of the associate degree.[10] In 2007 the associate degree was added to the Dutch system of higher education within the Higher Professional Education (HBO) stream taught at universities of applied sciences (hogeschool). Associate degree courses form part of HBO bachelor's degree courses, and advising requirements are the same for the two year associate degree and the related four year bachelor's degree. Those gaining the associate degree may proceed to an HBO bachelor's degree in only two years, but it does not articulate to bachelor's degrees in the research oriented (WO) stream.[11]\\r\\nThe title of Associate in Physical Science (Associate in Science from 1879) was used by the University of Durham College of Physical Sciences (now Newcastle University) from the 1870s.[12] It required (in 1884) passes in three of mathematics, physics, chemistry and geology, and allowed students to go on to take the examination for the Bachelor of Science.[13] As a university-level qualification lying below the bachelor's degree, this is considered to be the world's first associate degree in the modern sense, having been first awarded in 1873, 25 years prior to the introduction of associate degrees into the U.S. by the University of Chicago.[14] Durham also introduced an Associate in Theology in 1901. Both of these have since been discontinued, although the date of their withdrawal is unknown.[15] There were thirteen different types of associate degrees offered in British universities in 1927.[16]\\r\\nThe title of Associate in Arts, introduced by the University of Oxford in 1857 and sometimes referred to as the degree of Associate in Arts, predates the Durham degree. However, it was an examination for \\"those who are not members of the university\\" and who were under the age of 18; as such it was at the level of a high school qualification rather than a modern associate degree. Examinations were held in English, languages, mathematics, science, drawing and music, with the title being conferred on those who students who passed any two (as long as the two were not drawing and music).[17]\\r\\nBritish equivalents to associate degrees vary depending on the national system which issued them. Based on assessment by the UK NARIC, American and Canadian associate degrees are considered equivalent to one year higher education courses such as the Higher National Certificate at level 4 of the British Framework for Higher Education Qualifications. Australian associate degrees, however, are considered equivalent to two year higher education courses such as the Higher National Diploma at level 5 on the framework.[18]\\r\\nA two year education on BA-level is called H?gskolekandidat, translated \\"university college graduate\\".[19] Only a few professions require 120 ECTS, e.g. piano tuner, driving instructor.\\r\\nIn Hong Kong, associate degrees were first introduced into the territory in 2000 with the aim of increasing the number of students with post-secondary qualifications.[20] As originally introduced, the qualification took two or three years, but this was reformed in 2012 to a two-year course. The associate degree is designed as a general academic education qualification, compared to the more vocational Higher Diploma, and allows articulation onto the third year of a four-year (US-style) bachelor's degree or the second year of a three-year (British-style) bachelor's degree.[21] A survey in 2016 showed that most students believe associate degrees will help them to get onto bachelor's degree courses, but not (by themselves) in gaining a career; however only 30% of associate degree graduates gained places for further study, leading to accusations that the degree is \\"a waste of time and money\\" and calls for the government to address this by making more bachelor's degree places available.[22] This has been criticized, with others saying that education had benefits beyond income, which is only a short-term measure.[23]\\r\\nIn the United States, associate degrees are usually earned in two years or more and can be attained at community colleges, technical colleges, vocational schools, and some colleges, as well as at some universities. A student who completes a two-year program can earn an Associate of Arts/Associate in Arts (A.A.)[24] or an Associate of Science/Associate in Science (A.S.) degree.[24] A.A. degrees are usually earned in the Liberal Arts and Sciences such as humanities and social science fields; A.S. degrees are awarded to those studying in applied scientific and technical fields and professional fields of study. Generally, one year of study is focused on College level General Education and the second year is focused on the area of discipline.\\r\\nStudents who complete a two-year technical or vocational program can earn an Associate of Applied Science/Associate in Applied Science[24] This type of program is designed for persons seeking direct employment upon completion.\\r\\nTransfer admissions in the United States allows courses taken and credits earned on an A.A., A.S., or A.A.S. course to sometimes be counted toward a bachelor's degree via articulation agreements or recognition of prior learning, depending on the courses taken, applicable state laws/regulations, and the transfer requirements of the university.[25]\\r\\nThe Student Transfer Achievement Reform Act was signed into legislation on September 29, 2010 which is a legislation that grants any California Community College student who has earned the Associates in Arts degree for Transfer (AA-T) or the Associate in Science degree for Transfer (AS-T) will be granted priority admission to the CSU (California State University) into a similar baccalaureate (BA) degree program with a guarantee of junior standing.

Because the medal is presented \\"in the name of Congress\\", it is often referred to informally as the \\"Congressional Medal of Honor\\".  However, the official name of the current award is \\"Medal of Honor.\\"[1][6] Within United States Code the medal is referred to as the \\"Medal of Honor\\",[7] and less frequently as \\"Congressional Medal of Honor\\".[8] U.S. awards, including the Medal of Honor, do not have post-nominal titles, and while there is no official abbreviation, the most common abbreviations are \\"MOH\\" and \\"MH\\".[9]\\r\\n\\r\\nThere are three versions of the medal, one for the Army, one for the Navy, and one for the Air Force.[10] Personnel of the Marine Corps and Coast Guard receive the Navy version. The Medal of Honor was introduced for the Navy in 1861, soon followed by an Army version in 1862.[11] The Medal of Honor is the oldest continuously issued combat decoration of the United States armed forces.[12]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe President normally presents the Medal of Honor at a formal ceremony in Washington, D.C., that is intended to represent the gratitude of the U.S. people, with posthumous presentations made to the primary next of kin.[13][14][15] According to the Medal of Honor Historical Society of the United States, there have been 3522 Medals of Honor awarded to the nation's soldiers, sailors, airmen, Marines, and Coast Guardsmen since the decoration's creation, with just less than half of them awarded for actions during the four years of the American Civil War.[4]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1990, Congress designated March 25 annually as \\"National Medal of Honor Day\\".[16] Due to its prestige and status, the Medal of Honor is afforded special protection under U.S. law against any unauthorized adornment, sale, or manufacture, which includes any associated ribbon or badge.[17]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe modern day Medal of Honor had a number of precursors. The first medal for military service in the United States was issued in 1780, after its creation in the same year by the Continental Congress. Known as the Fidelity Medallion, it was a small medal worn on a chain around the neck, similar to a religious medal, that was awarded only to three militiamen from New York state. They received it for the capture of John Andr, a British officer and spy connected directly to General Benedict Arnold during the American Revolutionary War. The capture saved the fort of West Point from the British Army.[18]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe first formal system for rewarding acts of individual gallantry by American soldiers was established by George Washington when he issued a field order on August 7, 1782, for a Badge of Military Merit to recognize those members of the Continental Army who performed \\"any singular meritorious action\\". This decoration is America's first combat decoration and was preceded only by the Fidelity Medallion, the Congressional medal for Henry Lee awarded in September 1779 in recognition of his attack on the British at Paulus Hook, the Congressional medal for General Horatio Gates awarded in November 1777 in recognition of his victory over the British at Saratoga, and the Congressional medal for George Washington awarded in March 1776.[1][19][20] Although the Badge of Military Merit fell into disuse after the American Revolutionary War, the concept of a military award for individual gallantry by members of the U.S. Armed Forces had been established.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter the outbreak of the MexicanÿAmerican War (1846ÿ1848) a Certificate of Merit (Meritorious Service Citation Certificate) was established by Act of Congress on March 3, 1847 \\"to any private soldier who had distinguished himself by gallantry performed in the presence of the enemy\\". 539 Certificates were approved for this period. The certificate was discontinued and reintroduced in 1876 effective from June 22, 1874 to February 10, 1892 when it was awarded for extraordinary gallantry by private soldiers in the presence of the enemy. From February 11, 1892 through July 9, 1918 (Certificate of Merit disestablished) it could be awarded to members of the Army for distinguished service in combat or noncombat; from January 11, 1905 through July 9, 1918 the certificate was granted medal status as the Certificate of Merit Medal[21] (first awarded to a soldier who was awarded the Certificate of Merit for combat action on August 13, 1898). This medal was later replaced by the Army Distinguished Service Medal which was established on January 2, 1918 (the Navy Distinguished Service Medal was established in 1919). Those Army members who held the Distinguished Service Medal in place of the Certificate of Merit could apply for the Army Distinguished Service Cross (established 1918) effective March 5, 1934.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt the beginning of the Civil War (1861ÿ1865) the Certificate of Merit, which was awarded for the Mexican-American War, was not revived and would not be revived until 1876. In the fall of 1861, a proposal for a battlefield decoration for valor was submitted to Winfield Scott, the general-in-chief of the army, by Lt. Colonel Edward D. Townsend, an assistant adjutant at the War Department and Scott's chief of staff. Scott, however, was strictly against medals being awarded, which was the European tradition. After Scott retired in October 1861, the Secretary of the Navy, Gideon Welles, adopted the idea of a decoration to recognize and honor distinguished naval service. [22] On 9 December 1861, U.S. Senator (Iowa) James W. Grimes, Chairman on the Committee on Naval Affairs,[23] proposed Public Resolution Number 82[24] (Bill 82: 37th Congress, Second Session, 12 Stat. 329) \\"to promote the efficiency of the Navy\\" which included a provision for a Navy Medal of Honor [25] which was signed into law by President Abraham Lincoln on December 21, 1861, \\"to be bestowed upon such petty officers, seamen, landsmen, and marines as shall most distinguish themselves by their gallantry and other seamen-like qualities during the present war.\\"[26] Secretary Welles directed the Philadelphia Mint to design the new military decoration.[27][28][29] On May 15, 1862, the United States Navy Department ordered 175 medals ($1.85 each) with the words \\"Personal Valor\\" on the back from the U.S. Mint in Philadelphia.[30]\\r\\n\\r\\nSenator Henry Wilson, the chairman of the Senate Committee on Military Affairs, introduced a resolution on February 15, 1862 for an Army Medal of Honor. The resolution (37th Congress, Second Session, 12 Stat. 623) was approved by Congress and signed into law on July 12, 1862 (\\"Medals of Honor\\" were established for enlisted men of the Army). This measure provided for awarding a medal of honor \\"to such non-commissioned officers and privates as shall most distinguish themselves by their gallantry in action and other soldier-like qualities during the present insurrection.\\" During the war, Townsend would have some medals delivered to some recipients with a letter requesting acknowledgement of the \\"Medal of Honor\\". The letter written and signed by Townsend on behalf of the Secretary of War, stated that the resolution was \\"to provide for the presentation of medals of honor to the enlisted men of the army and volunteer forces who have distinguished or may distinguish themselves in battle during the present rebellion.\\"[31][32] By mid-November the War Department contracted with Philadelphia silversmith William Wilson and Son, who had been responsible for the Navy design, to prepare 2,000 Army medals ($2.00 each) to be cast at the mint.[33] The Army version had \\"The Congress to\\" written on the back of the medal. Both versions were made of copper and coated with bronze, which \\"gave them a reddish tint\\".[34][35]\\r\\n\\r\\n1863: Congress made the Medal of Honor a permanent decoration. On March 3, Medals of Honor were authorized for officers of the Army[36][37] (37th Congress, Third Session, 12 Stat. 751). The Secretary of War first presented the Medal of Honor to six Union Army volunteers on March 25, 1863 in his office.[38]\\r\\n\\r\\n1890: On April 23, the Medal of Honor Legion is established in Washington, D.C.[39][40][41]\\r\\n\\r\\n1896: The ribbon of the Army version of the Medal of Honor was redesigned with all stripes being vertical.[42]\\r\\n\\r\\n1904: The planchet of the Army version of the Medal of Honor was redesigned by General George Lewis Gillespie.[42] The purpose of the redesign was to help distinguish the Medal of Honor from other medals,[43] particularly the membership insignia issued by the Grand Army of the Republic.[44]\\r\\n\\r\\n1915: On March 3, Navy, Marine Corps, and Coast Guard officers became eligible for the Medal of Honor.[40][45][46]\\r\\n\\r\\n1917: Based on the report of the Medal of Honor Review Board, established by Congress in 1916, 911 recipients were stricken off the Medal of Honor roll because the medal had been awarded inappropriately. Among them were Buffalo Bill and Mary Edwards Walker. Some medals were restored in 1977[47].\\r\\n\\r\\n1963: A separate Coast Guard medal was authorized in 1963, but not yet designed or awarded.[48]\\r\\n\\r\\n1965: A separate design for a version of the medal for the U.S. Air Force was created in 1956, authorized in 1960, and officially adopted on April 14, 1965. Previously, members of the U.S. Air Force received the Army version of the medal.[49]\\r\\n\\r\\nThere are three versions of the Medal of Honor, one for each of the military departments of the Department of Defense: Army, Navy, and Air Force. Members of the Marine Corps and Coast Guard are eligible to receive the Navy version. Each is constructed differently and the components are made from gilding metals and red brass alloys with some gold plating, enamel, and bronze pieces. The United States Congress considered a bill in 2004 which would require the Medal of Honor to be made with 90% gold, the same composition as the lesser-known Congressional Gold Medal, but the measure was dropped.[50]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Army version is described by the Institute of Heraldry as \\"a gold five pointed star, each point tipped with trefoils, 1?1?2 inches [3.8?cm] wide, surrounded by a green laurel wreath and suspended from a gold bar inscribed VALOR, surmounted by an eagle. In the center of the star, Minerva's head surrounded by the words UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. On each ray of the star is a green oak leaf. On the reverse is a bar engraved THE CONGRESS TO with a space for engraving the name of the recipient.\\"[51] The pendant and suspension bar are made of gilding metal, with the eye, jump rings, and suspension ring made of red brass.[52] The finish on the pendant and suspension bar is hard enameled, gold plated, and rose gold plated, with polished highlights.[52]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Navy version is described as \\"a five-pointed bronze star, tipped with trefoils containing a crown of laurel and oak. In the center is Minerva, personifying the United States, standing with left hand resting on fasces and right hand holding a shield blazoned with the shield from the coat of arms of the United States. She repulses Discord, represented by snakes. The medal is suspended from the flukes of an anchor.\\"[51] It is made of solid red brass, oxidized and buffed.[53]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Air Force version is described as \\"within a wreath of green laurel, a gold five-pointed star, one point down, tipped with trefoils and each point containing a crown of laurel and oak on a green background. Centered on the star, an annulet of 34 stars is a representation of the head of the Statue of Liberty. The star is suspended from a bar inscribed with the word VALOR above an adaptation of the thunderbolt from the Air Force Coat of Arms.\\"[51]  The pendant is made of gilding metal.[54] The connecting bar, hinge, and pin are made of bronze.[54] The finish on the pendant and suspension bar is hard enameled, gold plated, and rose gold plated, with buffed relief.[54]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Medal of Honor has evolved in appearance over time. The upside-down star design of the Navy version's pendant adopted in early 1862 has not changed since its inception. The Army 1862 version followed and was identical to the Navy version except an eagle perched atop cannons was used instead of an anchor to connect the pendant to the suspension ribbon. In 1896, the Army version changed the ribbon's design and colors due to misuse and imitation by nonmilitary organizations.[51]  In 1904, the Army \\"Gillespie\\" version introduced a smaller redesigned star and the ribbon was changed to the light blue pattern with white stars seen today.[51] In 1913, the Navy version adopted the same ribbon pattern.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter World War I, the Navy decided to separate the Medal of Honor into two versions, one for combat and one for non-combat. The original upside-down star was designated as the non-combat version and a new pattern of the medal pendant, in cross form, was designed by the Tiffany Company in 1919. It was to be presented to a sailor or marine who \\"in action involving actual conflict with the enemy, distinguish[es] himself conspicuously by gallantry and intrepidity at the risk of his life above and beyond the call of duty\\"[55] Despite the \\"actual conflict\\" guidelinesthe Tiffany Cross was awarded to Navy CDR (later RADM) Richard E. Byrd and Floyd Bennett for arctic exploration. The Tiffany Cross itself was not popular. In 1942, the Navy returned to using only the original 1862 inverted 5-point star design, and ceased issuing the award for non-combat action.[56]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1944, the suspension ribbons for both the Army and Navy version were replaced with the now familiar neck ribbon.[51]  When the Air Force version was designed in 1956, it incorporated similar elements and design from the Army version. It used a larger star with the Statue of Liberty image in place of Minerva on the medal and changed the connecting device from an eagle to an heraldic thunderbolt flanked with wings as found on the service seal.[57][58]\\r\\n\\r\\n1862ÿ95 Army version\\r\\n\\r\\n1896ÿ1903 Army version\\r\\n\\r\\n1904ÿ44 Army version\\r\\n\\r\\nPost 1944 Army version\\r\\n\\r\\n1862ÿ1912 Navy version\\r\\n\\r\\n1913ÿ42 Navy version\\r\\n\\r\\n1919ÿ42 Navy \\"Tiffany Cross\\" version\\r\\n\\r\\nPost 1942 Navy version\\r\\n\\r\\nSince 1944, the Medal of Honor has been attached to a light blue[59] colored moir silk neck ribbon that is 1?3?16?in (30?mm) in width and 21?3?4?in (550?mm) in length.[1][60] The center of the ribbon displays thirteen white stars in the form of three chevron. Both the top and middle chevrons are made up of 5 stars, with the bottom chevron made of 3 stars. The Medal of Honor is one of only two United States military awards suspended from a neck ribbon.[61] The other is the Commander's Degree of the Legion of Merit, and is usually awarded to individuals serving foreign governments.[62][63]\\r\\n\\r\\nOn May 2, 1896, Congress authorized a \\"ribbon to be worn with the medal and [a] rosette or knot to be worn in lieu of the medal.\\"[29][51][64] The service ribbon is light blue with five white stars in the form of an \\"M\\".[51]  It is placed first in the top position in the order of precedence and is worn for situations other than full-dress military uniform.[51]  The lapel button is a 1?2-inch (13?mm), six-sided light blue bowknot rosette with thirteen white stars and may be worn on appropriate civilian clothing on the left lapel.[51]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 2011, Department of Defense instructions in regard to the Medal of Honor were amended to read \\"for each succeeding act that would otherwise justify award of the Medal of Honor, the individual receiving the subsequent award is authorized to wear an additional Medal of Honor ribbon and/or a 'V' device on the Medal of Honor suspension ribbon\\" (the \\"V\\" device is a 1?4-inch-high (6.4?mm) bronze miniature letter \\"V\\" with serifs that denotes valor). The Medal of Honor was the only decoration authorized the use of the \\"V\\" device (none were ever issued) to designate subsequent awards in such fashion. Nineteen individuals, all now deceased, were double Medal of Honor recipients.[65] In July 2014, DoD instructions were changed to read, \\"A separate MOH is presented to an individual for each succeeding act that justified award.\\"[66] As of 2014, no attachments are authorized for the Medal of Honor.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn October 23, 2002, Pub.L. 107ÿ248 was enacted, modifying 36 U.S.C.??903, authorizing a Medal of Honor flag to be presented to each person whom a Medal of Honor is awarded. In the case of a posthumous award, the flag will be presented to whomever the Medal of Honor is presented to, which in most cases will be the primary next of kin of the deceased awardee.[67][68]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe flag was based on a concept by retired U.S. Army Special Forces First Sergeant Bill Kendall of Jefferson, Iowa,[69] who in 2001, designed a flag to honor Medal of Honor recipient Captain Darrell Lindsey, a B-26 pilot from Jefferson who was killed in action during World War II. Kendall's design of a light blue field emblazoned with 13 white five-pointed stars was nearly identical to that of Sarah LeClerc's of the Institute of Heraldry. LeClerc's gold fringed flag, ultimately accepted as the official flag, does not include the words \\"Medal of Honor\\" as written on Kendall's flag. The color of the field and the 13 white stars, arranged in the form of a three-bar chevron, consisting of two chevrons of five stars and one chevron of three stars,[1] emulate the suspension ribbon of the Medal of Honor. The flag has no set proportions.[70]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe first Medal of Honor flag recipient was U.S. Army Sergeant First Class Paul R. Smith, who was presented the flag posthumously. President George W. Bush presented the Medal of Honor and flag to the family of Smith during the award ceremony for him  in the White House on April 4, 2005.[71]\\r\\n\\r\\nA special Medal of Honor Flag presentation ceremony was held for over 60 living Medal of Honor recipients on board the USS?Constitution in September 2006.[72]\\r\\n\\r\\nThere are two distinct protocols for awarding the Medal of Honor. The first and most common is nomination and approval through the chain of command of the service member. The second method is nomination by a member of the U.S. Congress, generally at the request of a constituent. In both cases, if the proposal is outside the time limits for the recommendation, approval to waive the time limit requires a special Act of Congress. The Medal of Honor is presented by the President on behalf of, and in the name of, the Congress.[73] Since 1980, nearly all Medal of Honor recipientsor in the case of posthumous awards, the next of kinhave been personally decorated by the Commander-in-Chief.[74][75][76] Since 1941, more than half of the Medals of Honor have been awarded posthumously.[77]\\r\\n\\r\\nCongress drew the three permutations of combat from President Kennedy's executive order of April 25, 1962, which previously added the same criteria to the Purple Heart. On August 24, Kennedy added similar criteria for the Bronze Star Medal.[95][96] The amendment was necessary because Cold War armed conflicts did not qualify for consideration under previous statutes such as the 1918 Army Medal of Honor Statute that required valor \\"in action involving actual conflict with an enemy\\", since the United States has not formally declared war since World War II as a result of the provisions of the United Nations Charter.[97] According to congressional testimony by the Army's Deputy Chief of Staff for Personnel, the services were seeking authority to award the Medal of Honor and other valor awards retroactive to July 1, 1958, in areas such as Berlin, Lebanon, Quemoy and Matsu Islands, Taiwan Straits, Congo, Laos, Vietnam, and Cuba.[95]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe four specific authorizing statutes amended July 25, 1963:[93]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe President may award, and present in the name of Congress, a medal of honor of appropriate design, with ribbons and appurtenances, to a person who while a member of the (Army) (naval service) (Air Force) (Coast Guard), distinguished himself conspicuously by gallantry and intrepidity at the risk of his life above and beyond the call of duty.[98]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Medal of Honor confers special privileges on its recipients. By law, recipients have several benefits:[99][100]\\r\\n\\r\\nA number of veteran support organizations and private companies devote themselves to exposing those who falsely claim to have received the Medal of Honor.[127]\\r\\n\\r\\nMedal of Honor recipients may apply in writing to the headquarters of the service branch of the medal awarded for a replacement or display Medal of Honor, ribbon, and appurtenance (Medal of Honor flag) without charge. Primary next of kin may also do the same and have any questions answered in regard to the Medal of Honor that was awarded.[132]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe 1917 Medal of Honor Board deleted 911 awards, but only 910 names from the Army Medal of Honor Roll, including awards to Dr. Mary Edwards Walker, William F. \\"Buffalo Bill\\" Cody and the first of two awards issued February 10, 1887, to George W. Midil, who retained his award issued October 25, 1893. None of the 910 \\"deleted\\" recipients were ordered to return their medals, although on the question of whether the recipients could continue to wear their medals, the Judge Advocate General advised the Medal of Honor Board the Army was not obligated to police the matter. Walker continued to wear her medal until her death. Although some sources claim that President Jimmy Carter formally restored her medal posthumously in 1977,[137]  this action was actually taken unilaterally by the Army's Board for Correction of Military Records, which probably was unlawful because the Board lacks the authority to directly contradict federal statutes, and has no authority to award Medals of Honor on its own.[138]  The Army Board for Correction of Military Records also restored the Medals of Honor of Buffalo Bill and four other civilian scouts in 1989, although the Board still apparently lacked this authority.[139]\\r\\n\\r\\nWhile the governing statute for the Army Medal of Honor (10 U.S.C.??6241), beginning in 1918, explicitly stated that a recipient must be \\"an officer or enlisted man of the Army\\", \\"distinguish himself conspicuously by gallantry and intrepidity at the risk of his life above and beyond the call of duty\\", and perform an act of valor \\"in action involving actual conflict with an enemy\\",[81] exceptions have been made:\\r\\n\\r\\n[151]citation required for service totals.\\r\\n\\r\\nNineteen men have been awarded the Medal of Honor twice.[152] The first two-time Medal of Honor recipient was Thomas Custer (brother of George Armstrong Custer) for two separate actions that took place several days apart during the American Civil War.[153]\\r\\n\\r\\nFive \\"double recipients\\" were awarded both the Army and Navy Medal of Honor for the same action; all five of these occurrences took place during World War I.[154] Since February 1919, no single individual can be awarded more than one Medal of Honor for the same action, although a member of one branch of the armed forces can receive the Medal of Honor from another branch if the actions for which it was awarded occurred under the authority of the second branch.[155]\\r\\n\\r\\nTo date, the maximum number of Medals of Honor earned by any service member has been two.[48] The last living individual to be awarded two Medals of Honor was John J. Kelly 3 Oct 1918; the last individual to receive two Medals of Honor for two different actions was Smedley Butler, in 1914 and 1915.\\r\\n\\r\\nArthur MacArthur, Jr. and Douglas MacArthur are the first father and son to be awarded the Medal of Honor. The only other such pairing is Theodore Roosevelt (awarded in 2001) and Theodore Roosevelt, Jr.\\r\\n\\r\\nFive pairs of brothers have received the Medal of Honor:\\r\\n\\r\\nAnother notable pair of related recipients are Admiral Frank Friday Fletcher (rear admiral at the time of award) and his nephew, Admiral Frank Jack Fletcher (lieutenant at the time of award), both awarded for actions during the United States occupation of Veracruz.\\r\\n\\r\\nSince 1979, 86 late Medal of Honor awards have been presented for actions from the Civil War to the Vietnam War. In addition, five recipients whose names were not included on the Army Medal of Honor Roll in 1917 had their awards restored.[157]\\r\\n\\r\\nA 1993 study commissioned by the U.S. Army investigated \\"racial disparity\\" in the awarding of medals.[158] At the time, no Medals of Honor had been awarded to American soldiers of African descent who served in World War II. After an exhaustive review, the study recommended that ten Distinguished Service Cross recipients be awarded the Medal of Honor. On January 13, 1997, President Bill Clinton presented the Medal of Honor to seven of these World War II veterans, six of them posthumously and one to former Second Lieutenant Vernon Baker.[159]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1998, a similar study of Asian Americans resulted in President Bill Clinton presenting 22 Medals of Honor in 2000.[160] Twenty of these medals went to American soldiers of Japanese descent of the 442nd Regimental Combat Team (442nd RCT) who served in the European Theater of Operations during World War II.[160][161] One of these Medal of Honor recipients was Senator Daniel Inouye, a former U.S. Army officer in the 442nd RCT.[159]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 2005, President George W. Bush presented the Medal of Honor to Tibor Rubin, a Hungarian-born American Jew who was a Holocaust survivor of World War II and enlisted U.S. infantryman and prisoner of war in the Korean War, whom many believed to have been overlooked because of his religion.[162]\\r\\n\\r\\nOn April 11, 2013, President Obama presented the Medal of Honor posthumously to Army chaplain Captain Emil Kapaun for his actions as a prisoner of war during the Korean War.[163] This follows other awards to Army Sergeant Leslie H. Sabo, Jr. for conspicuous gallantry in action on May 10, 1970, near Se San, Cambodia, during the Vietnam War[164] and to Army Private First Class Henry Svehla and Army Private First Class Anthony T. Kaho?ohanohano for their heroic actions during the Korean War.[165]\\r\\n\\r\\nAs a result of a Congressionally mandated review to ensure brave acts were not overlooked due to prejudice or discrimination, on March 18, 2014 President Obama upgraded Distinguished Service Crosses to Medals of Honor for 24 Hispanic, Jewish, and African American individualsthe \\"Valor 24\\"for their actions in World War II, the Korean War and the Vietnam War.[166]  Three were still living at the time of the ceremony.[166]\\r\\n\\r\\nDuring the Civil War, Secretary of War Edwin M. Stanton promised a Medal of Honor to every man in the 27th Maine Volunteer Infantry Regiment who extended his enlistment beyond the agreed-upon date. The Battle of Gettysburg was imminent, and 311 men of the regiment volunteered to serve until the battle was resolved. The remaining men returned to Maine, but with the Union victory at Gettysburg the 311 volunteers soon followed. The volunteers arrived back in Maine in time to be discharged with the men who had earlier returned. Since there seemed to be no official list of the 311 volunteers, the War Department exacerbated the situation by forwarding 864 medals to the commanding officer of the regiment. The commanding officer only issued the medals to the volunteers who stayed behind and retained the others on the grounds that, if he returned the remainder to the War Department, the War Department would try to reissue the medals.[167]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1916, a board of five Army generals on the retired list convened under act of law to review every Army Medal of Honor awarded. The board was to report on any Medals of Honor awarded or issued for any cause other than distinguished service. The commission, led by Nelson A. Miles, identified 911 awards for causes other than distinguished service. This included the 864 medals awarded to members of the 27th Maine regiment; 29 servicemen who served as Abraham Lincoln's funeral guard; six civilians, including Mary Edwards Walker and Buffalo Bill Cody; and 12 others.[168][169] Walker's medal was restored by President Jimmy Carter in 1977.[136] Cody and four other civilian scouts who rendered distinguished service in action, and who were therefore considered by the board to have fully earned their medals, had theirs restored in 1989.[170] The report was endorsed by the Judge Advocate General, who also advised that the War Department should not seek the return of the revoked medals from the recipients identified by the board. In the case of recipients who continued to wear the medal, the War Department was advised to take no action to enforce the statute.[171]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe following decorations, in one degree or another, bear similar names to the Medal of Honor, but are entirely separate awards with different criteria for issuance:\\r\\n\\r\\nFootnotes\\r\\n\\r\\nCitations\\r\\n\\r\\nWorks cited","input":"When was the medal of honor first established?"},{"output":"Lili Elbe","context":"Sex reassignment surgery for male-to-female involves reshaping the male genitals into a form with the appearance of, and, as far as possible, the function of female genitalia. Prior to any surgeries, patients usually undergo hormone replacement therapy (HRT), and, depending on the age at which HRT begins, facial hair removal. There are associated surgeries patients may elect to, including facial feminization surgery, breast augmentation, and various other procedures.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nLili Elbe was the first known recipient of male-to-female sex reassignment surgery, in Germany in 1930. She was the subject of five surgeries: one of penectomy and orchiectomy, one intended to transplant ovaries, two to remove the ovaries after transplant rejection, and vaginoplasty. However, she died three months after her fifth operation.\\r\\nChristine J?rgensen was likely the most famous recipient of sex reassignment surgery, having her surgery done in Denmark in late 1952 and being outed right afterwards. She was a strong advocate for the rights of transgender people.\\r\\nAnother famous person to undergo male-to-female sex reassignment surgery was Rene Richards. She transitioned and had surgery in the mid-1970s, and successfully fought to have transgender people recognized in their new sex.\\r\\nThe first male-to-female surgeries in the United States took place in 1966 at the Johns Hopkins University Medical Center.[1] The first physician to perform sex reassignment surgery in the United States was the late Elmer Belt, who did so until the late 1960s.[citation needed]\\r\\nWhen changing anatomical sex from male to female, the testicles are removed, and the skin of foreskin and penis is usually inverted, as a flap preserving blood and nerve supplies (a technique pioneered by Sir Harold Gillies in 1951), to form a fully sensitive vagina (vaginoplasty). A clitoris fully supplied with nerve endings (innervated) can be formed from part of the glans of the penis. If the patient has been circumcised (removal of the foreskin), or if the surgeon's technique uses more skin in the formation of the labia minora, the pubic hair follicles are removed from some of the scrotal tissue, which is then incorporated by the surgeon within the vagina. Other scrotal tissue forms the labia majora.\\r\\nIn extreme cases of shortage of skin, or when a vaginoplasty has failed, a vaginal lining can be created from skin grafts from the thighs or hips, or a section of colon may be grafted in (colovaginoplasty).\\r\\nSurgeon's requirements, procedures, and recommendations vary enormously in the days before and after, and the months following, these procedures.\\r\\nPlastic surgery, since it involves skin, is never an exact procedure, and cosmetic refining to the outer vulva is sometimes required. Some surgeons prefer to do most of the crafting of the outer vulva as a second surgery, when other tissues, blood and nerve supplies have recovered from the first surgery. This relatively minor surgery, which is usually performed only under local anaesthetic, is called labiaplasty.\\r\\nThe aesthetic, sensational, and functional results of vaginoplasty vary greatly. Surgeons vary considerably in their techniques and skills, patients' skin varies in elasticity and healing ability (which is affected by age, nutrition, physical activity and smoking), any previous surgery in the area can impact results, and surgery can be complicated by problems such as infections, blood loss, or nerve damage.\\r\\nSupporters of colovaginoplasty state that this method is better than use of skin grafts for the reason that colon is already mucosal, whereas skin is not. Lubrication is needed when having sex and occasional douching is advised so that bacteria do not start to grow and give off odors.\\r\\nBecause the human body treats the new vagina as a wound, any current technique of vaginoplasty requires some long-term maintenance of volume (vaginal dilation)[citation needed], by the patient, using medical graduated dilators, dildos, or suitable substitutes, to keep the vagina open. Sexual intercourse is not an adequate method of performing dilation[citation needed].\\r\\nRegular application of estrogen into the vagina[citation needed] , for which there are several standard products, may help, but this must be calculated into total estrogen dose. Some surgeons have techniques to ensure continued depth, but extended periods without dilation will still often result in reduced diameter (vaginal stenosis) to some degree, which would require stretching again, either gradually, or, in extreme cases, under anaesthetic.\\r\\nWith current procedures, trans women do not have ovaries or uteri. This means that they are unable to bear children or menstruate until a uterus transplant is performed, and that they will need to remain on hormone therapy after their surgery to maintain female hormonal status.\\r\\nOccasionally these basic procedures are complemented further with feminizing cosmetic surgeries or procedures that modify bone or cartilage structures, typically in the jaw, brow, forehead, nose and cheek areas. These are known as facial feminization surgery or FFS.\\r\\nBreast augmentation is the enlargement of the breasts. Some trans women choose to undergo this procedure if hormone therapy does not yield satisfactory results. Usually, typical growth for trans women is one to two cup sizes below closely related females such as the mother or sisters. Estrogen is responsible for fat distribution to the breasts, hips and buttocks, while progesterone is responsible for developing the actual milk glands. Progesterone also rounds out the breast to an adult Tanner stage-5 shape and matures and darkens the areola.[citation needed]\\r\\nSome MTF individuals may elect to have voice surgery, altering the range or pitch of the person's vocal cords. However, this procedure carries the risk of impairing a trans woman's voice forever, as happened to transsexual economist and author Deirdre McCloskey. Because estrogens by themselves are not able to alter a person's voice range or pitch, some people proceed to seek treatment. Other options are available to people wishing to speak in a less masculine tone. Voice feminization lessons are available to train trans women to practice feminization of their speech.\\r\\nTracheal shave is also sometimes used to reduce the cartilage in the area of the throat to conform to more feminine dimensions, to greatly reduce the appearance of an Adam's apple.\\r\\nBecause anatomically masculine hips and buttocks are generally smaller than those that are anatomically feminine, some MTF individuals will choose to undergo buttock augmentation. If, however, efficient hormone therapy is conducted before the patient is past puberty, the pelvis will broaden slightly, and even if the patient is past their teen years, a layer of subcutaneous fat will be distributed over the body rounding contours. Trans women usually end up with a waist to hip ratio of around 0.8, and if estrogen is administered at a young enough age \\"before the bone plates close\\",[citation needed] some trans women may achieve a waist to hip ratio of 0.7 or lower.[citation needed] The pubescent pelvis will broaden under estrogen therapy even if the skeleton is anatomically masculine.","input":"When was the first gender reassignment surgery performed?"},{"output":"1936 Summer Olympics","context":"The 1936 Summer Olympics torch relay was the first of its kind, following on from the reintroduction of the Olympic Flame at the 1928 Games. It pioneered the modern convention of moving the flame via a relay system from Greece to the Olympic venue. Leni Riefenstahl filmed the relay for the award-winning but controversial 1938 film Olympia.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Olympic Flame was introduced to the modern Games in 1928 when it burnt atop a pillar above the stadium in Amsterdam. Four years later the same was repeated in Los Angeles. At both of these events the flame was lit on site at the stadium.[1]\\r\\nCarl Diem devised the idea of the torch relay for the 1936 Summer Olympics in Berlin that was organized by the Nazi Party under the guidance of Joseph Goebbels. The process was ratified by the International Olympic Committee[1] and has been repeated at all the Games that have followed.[2]\\r\\nDiem and the organizing team realized that there would need to be very detailed plans in order to successfully complete the relay to a standard that would satisfy both themselves and the ruling Third Reich. At the time they were unsure about exactly how they could use the sun's rays to start the fire as well as how to create a torch that would remain alight whatever the conditions. Research was therefore required into the specialist technologies that would be needed. The route itself would need development and the path down from Olympia was deemed too difficult to access. The organising committees therefore agreed that new roads would be built to ensure that the relay got off to the best possible start.[3]\\r\\nAdolf Hitler saw the link with the ancient Games as the perfect way to illustrate his belief that classical Greece was an Aryan forerunner of the modern German Reich.[4][5]\\r\\n\\"The sportive, knightly battle awakens the best human characteristics. It doesn't separate, but unites the combatants in understanding and respect. It also helps to connect the countries in the spirit of peace. That's why the Olympic Flame should never die.\\"\\r\\nThe event was designed to demonstrate the growing influence and power of the Third Reich. It was internationally viewed as a great success,[4] sufficient for it to be replicated in all Games thereafter.[2][7]\\r\\nLeni Riefenstahl, a film-maker admired by Hitler,[2] filmed the relay for the 1938 release Olympia. While the film is often seen as a prime example of Nazi propaganda,[6] it has also been hailed as one of the greatest films of all time[8] and won many awards upon its release.[9]\\r\\nSculptor Walter Lemcke designed the 27?cm wood and metal torches. German manufacturer Krupp produced 3,840 copies for the runners, over 500 more than would be needed.[10] It was designed with two fuses to help it cope with different weather conditions and could stay alight for ten minutes, longer than each section of the route.[1]\\r\\nOn 20 July 1936[1] the Olympic Flame was lit in Greece by a concave mirror made by German company Zeiss.[4] The Nazi Party wanted to demonstrate their organisational prowess and enhance their influence on various countries along the route of the relay. The torch travelled through south-eastern and central European countries to demonstrate and enhance their influence.[4] The National Olympic Committees (NOCs) of the countries along the route all agreed to support the relay which would pass through Greece, Bulgaria, Yugoslavia, Hungary, Austria, and Czechoslovakia and then Germany.[1] These countries would fall under Nazi domination as the second World War began just over three years later.[2] In Austria, a country that would be annexed into the Third Reich less than two years after the relay, the torch was met by major public demonstrations.[4]\\r\\nIn all the torch was transported over 3,187 kilometres by 3,331 runners in twelve days and eleven nights from Greece to Berlin. Much of the route was split into kilometre-long sections and it was anticipated that each runner would traverse that distance in five minutes, though some leeway was given to allow for difficult terrain and sparsely populated areas.[1] The names of most of the torch bearers, all of whom were male,[2] were not recorded.[11]\\r\\nFor the pass of the Olympic Flame at Delphi, a milestone with the Olympic symbol in the faces was made for a torchbearers' ceremony in the stadium at Delphi, site of the famous oracle, where the Pythian Games were also held for orders of Carl Diem where a torchbearer should carry the flame along with an escort of three others from there to Berlin. This stone is wrongly indicated like the source of the Olympic symbol of the five interlaced rings.\\r\\n[12]\\r\\nJuly 20:\\r\\nJuly 21:\\r\\nJuly 22:\\r\\nJuly 23:\\r\\nJuly 24:\\r\\nJuly 25:\\r\\nJuly 25 (Bulgaria):\\r\\nJuly 26 (Yugoslavia):\\r\\nJuly 27 (Yugoslavia):\\r\\nJuly 28 (Yugoslavia):\\r\\nJuly 28 (Hungary):\\r\\nJuly 29 (Hungary):\\r\\nJuly 29 (Austria):\\r\\nJuly 30 (Austria):\\r\\nJuly 30 (Czechoslovakia):\\r\\nJuly 30 (Czechoslovakia):\\r\\nJuly 31 (day 1): Pirna\\r\\nJuly 31 (day 1): Dresden\\r\\nJuly 31 (day 1): Meissen\\r\\nJuly 31 (day 1): Gro?enhain\\r\\nJuly 31 (day 1): Elsterwerda\\r\\nJuly 31 (day 1): Liebenwerda\\r\\nJuly 31 (day 1): Herzberg\\r\\nJuly 31 (day 1): Jterbog\\r\\nJuly 31 (day 1): Luckenwalde\\r\\nJuly 31 (day 1): Trebbin\\r\\nAugust 1 (day 2): Berlin\\r\\nAugust 1 (day 2): Lustgarten\\r\\nAugust 1 (day 2): Olympic Stadium\\r\\nTwo urns in the centre of Berlin, within two long rows of large swastika flags, were lit by 400m-runner Siegfried Eifrig on 1 August 1936.[4][11] The urns burnt for the duration of the Games and served as the starting point for the final relay runner. Fritz Schilgen, a three time 1500m champion, was suggested by former German athletics president Karl Ritter von Halt as the final runner.

She had to teach herself how to butcher steak, and despite being just five-foot-two and 110-pounds, would saw up 30-pound short loins by hand until she could afford an electric band saw. She staffed her restaurant with single mothers, saying that they were hard workers and reliable. For many years, Chris Steak House was the only upscale restaurant in New Orleans with an all-female wait staff.[13]\\r\\n\\r\\nFrom the beginning, her restaurant attracted local politicians as well as athletes, businessmen and reporters. Political reporter Rosemary James noted that she \\"would not have missed a Friday before a major election at Ruth's Chris Steak House. That was the place to be if you wanted to get some scoops.\\"[14] Local celebrities like Fats Domino were regulars.[15]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn early 1976, shortly after Fertel signed a new ten-year lease on the restaurant, a fire destroyed the building. Fertel had recently acquired a second property nearby to rent out as party space. Within seven days, she had relocated the restaurant to its new location a few blocks away at 711 North Broad Street and re-opened it, expanding to 160 seats in the process.[13] The sales agreement with Matulich prevented her from using the original name at any other address, so she named the new restaurant Ruth's Chris Steak House in order to keep some continuity with the previous location.[16] She admitted later to Fortune Magazine that \\"I've always hated the name, but we've always managed to work around it.\\"[17]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe first franchised restaurant was opened in 1977 by a loyal customer, Thomas J. \\"T. J.\\" Moran (c. 1931ÿ2015), in Baton Rouge, who went on to open several more franchised Ruth's Chris locations, TJ Ribs, and Ruffinos restaurants[18] through his company T.J. Moran Associates. Fertel noted, \\"All our franchisees were people who had eaten at one time or another in one of our restaurants. We never looked for franchisees. They came to us.\\"[13] The chain expanded rapidly over the next two decades, with 66 locations in the U.S. and overseas by mid-1998,[19][20] and achieving over $200 million in annual revenues.[21] This success earned Fertel a number of accolades as an entrepreneur, and the epithet The First Lady of American Restaurants or The Empress of Steak.[15]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1999, Fertel, then 72, developed lung cancer. She sold a 79.3 percent interest in the chain in August 1999 to investment company Madison Dearborn Partners of Chicago, remaining as a shareholder until her death in 2002.[21]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn that period, the chain expanded to 86 restaurants, including 10 overseas locations. Revenues fell to $167.8 million in 2003, before rising again to $192.2 million in 2004.\\r\\n[22]\\r\\n\\r\\nOn August 9, 2005, under President & CEO Craig Miller, Ruth's Chris Steak House became a public company following a successful IPO valuing the company at $235 million and an increase of 15 percent in first-day trading.[23]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn late August 2005 Hurricane Katrina devastated Greater New Orleans (see: Effect of Hurricane Katrina on New Orleans), and  the chain moved its corporate headquarters to Heathrow, Florida. Like most businesses in the city, two of the chain's locations in the New Orleans area were forced to close because of the storm.[24] The Metairie location has since reopened.[25] Members of the Fertel family, particularly Ruth's son Randy, were bitterly opposed to the move. Amid much criticism by local officials and media, and on the heels of the announcement by Morton's that it would reopen its own New Orleans branch,[26] the corporate offices announced that, due to extensive damage, the old flagship location on Broad Street would be permanently closed and donated to charity.[27] Tulane University was the recipient of the gift, remodeling and reopening the site in 2012 as the Ruth U. Fertel/Tulane Community Health Center.[28] In May 2008, Ruth's Chris reopened in New Orleans and is centrally located downtown in Harrah's Hotel at 525 Fulton Street.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 2011, the corporate headquarters was relocated to its current location in Winter Park, Florida.[29][30]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn February 2008, the company purchased the Mitchell's Fish Restaurant and Columbus Fish Market brands from Cameron Mitchell Restaurants for $92 million.[31] As the recession began to bite, the acquisition was not initially successful. The stock price fell from $22 in 2006 to under $5 and company debts rose to $185 million. CFO Tom Pennison resigned, and CEO Craig Miller was ousted by the board to be replaced by Mike O'Donnell.[32][33] O'Donnell restructured and rebranded the company, creating Ruth's Hospitality Group (RHGI) as the parent entity in May 2008, allowing each of the individual restaurant brands to have their own identity within the group. The current President and COO is Kevin Toomy, formerly owner and president of the award-winning Goldcoast Seafood Grill in South Florida.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn February 2013, RHGI reported that fourth quarter sales at Ruth's Chris restaurants were up by 7.0 percent on the previous year, representing the 11th consecutive quarterly increase in sales.[34]\\r\\n\\r\\nRuth's Chris continues to add new restaurants, most recently in Harrah's casino in Las Vegas in January 2013, after the previous Las Vegas location on Flamingo closed in 2009.[35][36] The company has announced plans for 2013 that include an expansion into China,[37] a new restaurant in Denver, Colorado, and four or five new franchised locations.[34] In 2015, it was announced that the restaurant was expanding into Albuquerque, New Mexico.[38] In 2016, Ruth's Chris opened its newest restaurant in Odenton, Maryland.\\r\\n\\r\\nMost restaurants are open for dinner only, although some locations also offer lunch. The dress code is usually a range from business/dressy to business casual. Most locations have private dining facilities and offer business communications via satellite. The company also offers outside catering and a wedding service through the Ruth's Weddings brand.[39][40]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe restaurant's signature is serving USDA prime steaks that are seared at 1800 Fahrenheit[41] (approximately 980?C) and served on ceramic plates heated to 500 Fahrenheit (260?C). Half an ounce (1 Tbsp) of butter is added just before the plates leave the kitchen in order to create the signature 'sizzle'. Fertel firmly believed that the success of her steaks was due as much to the sound and smell of the 'sizzle' as well as the taste. \\"You hear that sizzle, and you think, 'I wonder if that's my steak'\\", she commented in an interview shortly before her death.[42]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn addition to steaks, the restaurant also serves entrees of chicken, lamb, fish, shrimp and lobster.[43]\\r\\n\\r\\nPortions generally are large enough to serve two or more diners. Family style side dishes include au gratin potatoes, topped with a bechamel sauce and Cheddar cheese. Some recipes, such as the BBQ shrimp, New Orleans style creamed spinach or the sweet potato casserole, are traditional 19th century Louisiana recipes that originate with Ruth Fertel's family, particularly her great-uncle Martin, a Louisiana Delta farmer from a French-Alsatian family.[44] Some of these recipes have been made publicly available by the family and by the company.[45]\\r\\n\\r\\nAlso available are dessert selections, with the restaurant's signature creme brulee being a staple item throughout the chain.[43]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 2009,[46] Ruth's Chris introduced their \\"Ruth's Classics\\" menu of prix fixe meals where guests choose a three-course meal; starter, entree and side, and dessert. This menu is updated seasonally every three months.[47]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe wine list includes over 200 wines, primarily from leading Californian vineyards such as Mondavi, Beringer and Stag's Leap. Twenty-five or more wines are available by the glass, depending on location.[48]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe seasonal \\"vintage-inspired\\" cocktail selection, introduced in 2011 by Beverage Director Helen Mackey, includes both classic and contemporary \\"hand-crafted\\" cocktails.[49]","input":"Who is the owner of ruth's chris steakhouse?"},{"output":"Spain national team.","context":"Fernando Jos Torres Sanz (Spanish pronunciation:?[fer?nando ?tores]; born 20 March 1984) is a Spanish professional footballer who plays as a striker for La Liga club Atltico Madrid and the Spain national team.\\r\\nTorres started his career with Atltico Madrid, progressing through their youth system to the first-team squad. He made his first-team debut in 2001 and finished his time at the club with 75 goals in 174 La Liga appearances. Prior to his La Liga debut, Torres played two seasons in the Segunda Divisi܇n for Atltico, making 40 appearances and scoring seven goals.\\r\\nTorres joined Premier League club Liverpool in 2007, after signing for a club record transfer fee. He marked his first season at Anfield by being Liverpool's first player since Robbie Fowler in the 1995ÿ96 season to score more than 20 league goals in a season. The most prolific goalscoring spell of his career, he became the fastest player in Liverpool history to score 50 league goals. He was named in the FIFA World XI in 2008 and 2009. Torres left the club in January 2011 to join Chelsea for a British record transfer fee of S50?million, which made him the most expensive Spanish player in history. In his first full season at Chelsea, Torres won the FA Cup and the UEFA Champions League, despite receiving criticism for a comparatively low goal-scoring record. The following season, he scored in the final of the 2012ÿ13 UEFA Europa League, helping Chelsea to win the competition for the first time.\\r\\nTorres is a Spanish international and made his debut against Portugal in 2003. He has been capped over 100 times and is his country's third-highest goalscorer of all-time. With Spain, he has participated in six major tournaments: UEFA Euro 2004, the 2006 FIFA World Cup, Euro 2008, the 2010 World Cup, Euro 2012, and the 2014 World Cup. Spain won the three tournaments from 2008 to 2012, with Torres scoring in the finals of both Euro 2008 and Euro 2012.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nBorn in Fuenlabrada, Community of Madrid,[3] Torres became interested in football as a child and joined his first team, Parque 84, at age five.[4] His father, Jos Torres, worked during Torres' childhood, and his mother, Flori Sanz, travelled daily with him to training sessions.[5] His grandfather was not a passionate football fan, but took pride in being an Atltico Madrid supporter, and Torres inherited his love for the club.[4]\\r\\nTorres began playing football as a goalkeeper, the position his brother played in.[6] At age seven, however, he started playing regularly as a striker in an indoor league for the neighbourhood club, Mario's Holland,[4] using the characters from the anime Captain Tsubasa as inspiration.[7] Three years later, aged 10, he progressed to an 11-side team, Rayo 13.[8] He scored 55 goals in a season and was one of three Rayo 13 players to earn a trial with Atltico.[8] He impressed the scouts and joined the club's youth system at age 11 in 1995.[8]\\r\\nAfter progressing through the ranks, Torres won his first important youth title in 1998.[8] Atltico sent an under-15 team to compete in the Nike Cup, in Spain and Europe, to play against youth teams from other clubs; Atltico won the tournament.[8][9] He was later voted the best player in Europe for the age group.[9] In 1999, at the age of 15, Torres signed his first professional contract with Atltico.[8] He spent his first year playing in the youth team and participated in the Honor Division when he was 16.[10] The 2000ÿ01 season had started poorly, as Torres suffered from a cracked shinbone which kept him out of play until December.[10] Torres trained with the first team to get prepared for pre-season, but eventually made his debut on 27 May 2001, at the Vicente Calder܇n Stadium, against Legans.[10] One week later, he scored his first goal for the club, against Albacete, and the season finished with Atltico narrowly missing out on promotion to La Liga.[10]\\r\\nAtltico were promoted to La Liga at the end of the 2001ÿ02 season, although Torres did not perform well in the season, as he netted only 6 times in 36 appearances in the Segunda Divisi܇n.[11] Torres' first season in La Liga, 2002ÿ03, was better, however, as he scored 13 goals in 29 appearances, with Atltico finishing in 11th place.[10][11] In July 2003, soon after his takeover of the club, Chelsea owner Roman Abramovich had a S28?million bid for Torres rejected by Atltico's board of directors.[12] In the 2003ÿ04 season, his second in La Liga, Torres made further strides, scoring 19 league goals in 35 appearances,[11] meaning he finished as the joint third-highest scorer in the league.[13] At age 19, Torres was named Atltico's captain.[9] Atltico narrowly missed out on qualification for the UEFA Cup, but by finishing in seventh place in the 2003ÿ04 season, they qualified for the 2004 UEFA Intertoto Cup, giving Torres a first taste of a competition at the European level.[14] He scored two goals in the two fourth round matches against OFK Beograd, with one coming in each leg.[14] Atltico reached the final, but lost 3ÿ1 on a penalty shoot-out to Villarreal following a 2ÿ2 draw on aggregate.[14] FA Premier League champions Chelsea were believed to be interested in signing Torres during the summer of 2005, but Atltico club president Enrique Cerezo said that they had \\"no chance\\" of signing him.[15] Cerezo later said in January 2006 that the club was willing to listen to offers for Torres, and Torres claimed Newcastle United of the FA Premier League had made a bid to sign him in March.[16][17]\\r\\nTorres stated after the 2006 FIFA World Cup that he had turned down an offer to join Chelsea at the end of the 2005ÿ06 season.[18] He scored 14 league goals in the 2006ÿ07 season.[11] The English media reported that he was the main transfer target of FA Premier League club Liverpool,[19] but Cerezo stated, \\"We've received no offer from Liverpool or any other club or player.\\"[20] Days later, however, new reports suggested Atltico had agreed a deal with Liverpool for Torres; the fee was rumoured to be S25?million with Luis Garca moving to Atltico in a separate transfer deal.[21] On 30 June, Atltico announced a deal to sign Diego Forln from Villarreal, in what was seen as a move to replace Torres before his departure became official.[22] On 2 July, it was reported that Torres had cut short a vacation to fly back to Madrid to finalise the move to Liverpool.[23] The following day, Torres passed a medical at Liverpool's Melwood training ground.[24] He held a press conference in Madrid on 4 July to bid farewell to the Atltico fans, before completing his move to Liverpool on a six-year contract.[24] The transfer fee was the highest in Liverpool's history.[22] In March 2008, manager Rafael Bentez stated in an interview with The Times that Torres was acquired for around S20?million, although this figure takes into account Garca's move to Atltico.[25]\\r\\nTorres made his competitive debut for Liverpool against Aston Villa in a 2ÿ1 win on 11 August 2007.[26] He made his first appearance in the UEFA Champions League four days past his first performance in a 1ÿ0 victory over Toulouse, after coming on as a 79th minute substitute.[27] His first Premier League goal came on his Anfield debut on 19 August 2007, in the 16th minute in a 1ÿ1 draw against Chelsea.[28] His first hat-trick came in a 4ÿ2 victory over Reading in the League Cup on 25 September 2007, with all of his goals coming in the second half.[29] His first goals in the Champions League came on his third appearance in the competition as Liverpool beat Porto 4ÿ1 on 28 November 2007, as he scored twice.[30]\\r\\nTorres was named the Premier League Player of the Month for February 2008,[31] during which he scored four goals in four appearances, including a hat-trick against Middlesbrough on 23 February 2008.[32] This hat-trick and another in a 4ÿ0 victory over West Ham United on 5 March 2008 meant he became the first Liverpool player since Jack Balmer in November 1946 to score a hat-trick in successive home matches.[33] Later in March, after he scored a 47th-minute header against Reading at Anfield, he became the first Liverpool player since Robbie Fowler in the 1995ÿ96 season to score 20 league goals in a season.[34] In April, he scored another Champions League goal, this time against Arsenal in the quarter-final second leg, as Liverpool advanced to the semi-final.[35] This goal took him onto 29 goals for the 2007ÿ08 season in all competitions,[32] eclipsing Michael Owen's personal record for goals in a season.[36] On 11 April 2008, it was announced Torres had made a six-man shortlist for the PFA Players' Player of the Year award,[37] which was eventually won by Cristiano Ronaldo of Manchester United.[38] The Spanish international was also nominated for the PFA Young Player of the Year Award, which was won by Cesc Fbregas of Arsenal and was named in the PFA Team of the Year.[38] In May, he finished second to Ronaldo for the FWA Footballer of the Year award.[39]\\r\\nOn 4 May 2008, Torres scored a 57th-minute winner against Manchester City, which equalled the consecutive Anfield league goal record of eight games set by Roger Hunt.[32][40] After scoring his 24th league goal in the final game of the season, a 2ÿ0 win against Tottenham Hotspur, he set a new record for the most prolific foreign goal scorer in a debut season in England, eclipsing Ruud van Nistelrooy's 23 goals.[32][41] He ended the season in joint second place with Emmanuel Adebayor in the race for the Premier League golden boot.[42] Torres was subject to media speculation that Chelsea were willing to pay S50?million to sign him, but Torres responded by saying it would be \\"many years\\" before he left Liverpool.[43][44] Liverpool co-owner Tom Hicks also negated the idea of a transfer, saying he would not allow Torres to leave the club at any price.[45]\\r\\nTorres made a scoring start to the 2008ÿ09 Premier League season with a 25-yard shot into the bottom right-hand corner away at Sunderland, which was the only goal in a 1ÿ0 win on 16 August 2008.[46] He suffered a hamstring tear in a 0ÿ0 draw against Aston Villa, which would keep him out for two to three weeks.[47] Torres made his return in a 2ÿ1 victory against Marseille in the Champions League and went on to score two goals in the Merseyside derby against Everton on 27 September 2008 to give Liverpool a 2ÿ0 win.[48][49] He followed this up with another two goals the following weekend against Manchester City in a 3ÿ2 win away at the City of Manchester Stadium as Liverpool came back from a two-goal deficit.[50] The first of these was the thousandth Liverpool goal to be scored in the Premier League.[51] Torres picked up a hamstring injury during a 2010 FIFA World Cup qualifier, meaning he was likely to miss three games for Liverpool.[52] On 22 October 2008, Liverpool played Torres' former club Atltico in the Champions League at the Vicente Calder܇n Stadium, but his injury meant he missed out on the game.[53] Atltico president Enrique Cerezo had given him a VIP invitation to watch the game, but he declined this to continue his rehabilitation from injury in Merseyside.[54] He was named in the FIFPro World XI team for the 2007ÿ08 season on 27 October 2008.[55]\\r\\nTorres made his return for Liverpool on 8 November 2008 after coming on as a 72nd-minute substitute in a 3ÿ0 victory against West Bromwich Albion.[56] He said he would be interested in returning to former club Atltico eventually, saying, \\"I don't know if I will retire there, but I would like to go back and finish some things that are left to do.\\"[57] He was ruled out of action for two to three weeks following Liverpool's 1ÿ0 victory over Marseille in the Champions League in November, where he picked up a hamstring strain,[58] which was later extended to at least four weeks by specialists.[59] He was named on the shortlist for the FIFA World Player of the Year award in December,[60] and eventually came in third place behind Ronaldo and Lionel Messi.[61] Torres returned to action on 3 January 2009 as a substitute with a goal in the 2ÿ0 win over Preston North End, his first in the FA Cup.[62] He scored two late goals for Liverpool to secure a 2ÿ0 victory over Chelsea on 1 February 2009.[63] Despite having spent a year and a half at the club, Torres was chosen as number 50 in The Times's list of \\"The 50 greatest Liverpool players\\", reinforcing the impact he had made at Liverpool in such a short period of time.[64]\\r\\nTorres faced his old rivals Real Madrid on 10 March 2009 in the Champions League last 16 and due to an ankle injury, he had a painkilling injection before the game to enable him to play.[65] He scored the first goal of the game, which ended as a 4ÿ0 victory, meaning Liverpool progressed to the quarter-finals 5ÿ0 on aggregate.[66] Four days later, he lined up against Manchester United at Old Trafford and he scored the equaliser in a game that finished as a 4ÿ1 victory.[67] He was named in the PFA Team of the Year for the second season running in April 2009.[68] Torres scored his 50th goal for Liverpool on 24 May 2009 against Tottenham on the final day of the 2008ÿ09 season, his 84th appearance.[69]\\r\\nFollowing the end of the season, Torres agreed a new contract with Liverpool,[70] which he signed on 14 August.[71] By signing, Torres had the option of a one-year extension after the contract's expiration in 2013.[72] Torres scored two goals in a 3ÿ2 win over West Ham United on 19 September 2009, a result that took Liverpool to third in the Premier League.[73] One week later, he scored his first hat-trick of the 2009ÿ10 Premier League season in a 6ÿ1 victory over Hull City at Anfield.[74] He was named Premier League Player of the Month for September, after scoring five goals during the month and becoming the Premier League's top goalscorer.[75] On 25 October 2009, he scored the first goal in a 2ÿ0 victory for Liverpool over Manchester United,[76] after which Rafael Bentez praised Torres' performance, saying, \\"We were waiting for that final pass. When it came we knew he would score.\\"[77] Torres was named in the FIFPro World XI for the second successive season in December 2009.[78] His stoppage-time winning goal against Aston Villa on 29 December 2009 made him the fastest Liverpool player ever to score 50 league goals.[79] He was substituted on 65 minutes in a 1ÿ1 draw with Birmingham City on 4 April 2010, which Bentez justified by saying Torres was \\"exhausted\\".[80] Torres made his last appearance of the season scoring twice in a 4ÿ1 victory over Benfica in the Europa League on 8 April 2010,[81] and it was announced on 18 April that he would miss the rest of the season to undergo knee surgery.[82] This meant that Torres finished the season with 22 goals in 32 games in all competitions, finishing as Liverpool's top scorer for the second time.[81]\\r\\nFollowing Roy Hodgson's appointment as Liverpool manager, Hodgson stated that Torres would not be sold by the club, saying, \\"He is not for sale and we don't welcome any offers for him. We want to keep him.\\"[83] Hodgson dismissed reports Torres was set to leave Liverpool by saying, \\"He has told us that he is looking forward to Monday, to getting back to work and looking forward to playing for Liverpool next season.

I did them at Atltico, I did them at Liverpool, but I am not doing them at Chelsea,\\" but he vowed to \\"try his heart out\\" to regain his best form.[119] He scored twice against Rubin Kazan in the 3ÿ1 win in the first leg of the Europa League quarter-final on 4 April 2013, before scoring again in the second leg 3ÿ2 defeat, with Chelsea progressing to the semi-final 5ÿ4 on aggregate.[111] Torres scored the opening goal in Chelsea's 2ÿ1 triumph over Benfica in the 2013 UEFA Europa League Final on 15 May 2013.[111] During the final match of the season, a 2ÿ1 home win over Everton, he scored his first league goal of 2013, and finished the season with 22 goals in 64 matches.[111][120]\\r\\nTorres was selected to start by Chelsea's new manager Jos Mourinho against Hull City on the opening day of the 2013ÿ14 season, where he won a fifth-minute penalty kick.[121] He scored his first goal of the season in the 2013 UEFA Super Cup against Bayern Munich.[122] On 28 September 2013, he was sent off after receiving two yellow cards in Chelsea's 1ÿ1 Premier League draw with Tottenham Hotspur at White Hart Lane.[123]\\r\\nTorres made his 100th start for Chelsea against Schalke 04 in a Champions League match on 22 October 2013 and marked the occasion by scoring two goals in a 3ÿ0 win.[124][125] His first Premier League goal of the season came on 27 October as he scored the winning goal in the 90th minute over title challengers Manchester City, while also providing the assist for Andr Schrrle's opener.[126]\\r\\nTorres joined Italian Serie A club Milan on a two-year loan on 31 August 2014.[127] On his arrival, he expressed a desire to emulate some of the club's greatest strikers, stating he wanted, \\"My shirt to rank alongside [Marco] van Basten, [George] Weah and [Filippo] Inzaghi.\\"[128] He debuted on 20 September 2014, replacing Andrea Poli for the last 14 minutes of a 1ÿ0 home defeat against Juventus[129] and scored his first Milan goal with a looping header in their 2ÿ2 draw with Empoli two days later.[130]\\r\\nOn 27 December 2014, it was announced that Torres' move to Milan would be made permanent on 5 January 2015,[131] but two days later, he agreed to rejoin La Liga club Atltico Madrid on loan until the end of the 2015ÿ16 season.[132] The loan was agreed after Alessio Cerci went the opposite way from Atltico to Milan on the same day, 5 January.[133] Torres' unveiling at the Vicente Calder܇n Stadium on 4 January 2015 drew a crowd of 45,000 persons.[134] He played the first match of his second spell on 7 January 2015, starting in the first leg of a Copa del Rey last 16 tie against Real Madrid.

This is my first title and I hope it's the first of many. Victory in a Euro, it is almost as big as a World Cup. We are used to watching finals on television, but today we were here and we won. My job is to score goals. I want to win more titles and be the most important player in Europe and the world.\\"[159] He was later named as a striker along with his striking partner David Villa in the Team of the Tournament.[160]\\r\\nTorres made his 60th appearance for Spain in a 2010 World Cup qualification victory over Turkey on 28 March 2009, becoming the youngest player to reach this milestone.[161]\\r\\nTorres was named in Spain's team for the 2009 FIFA Confederations Cup in June.[162] He scored his second hat-trick for Spain after 17 minutes into a Confederations Cup match against New Zealand on 14 June,[163] thus recording the fastest hat-trick by a player for Spain.[164] He played for Spain as they were defeated 2ÿ0 by the United States in the semi-final,[165] as well as the third-place play-off, which Spain won 3ÿ2 against South Africa after extra time.[166]\\r\\nHaving undergone knee surgery on 18 April 2010, and missing the end of the Premier League season, Torres' rehabilitation and fitness was closely monitored by Spain manager Vicente del Bosque.[82] Although still out injured, Torres was selected for Spain's 2010 FIFA World Cup squad in May.[167] On 8 June, Torres made his first appearance on the field in exactly two months, coming on as a substitute on 66 minutes against Poland in a pre-World Cup friendly.[168]\\r\\nTorres came on as a substitute on 61 minutes in Spain's opening World Cup match on 16 June, a 1ÿ0 defeat to Switzerland.[169] He started the next two matches against Honduras and Chile and although his performances in the group stage were described as below-par, he received backing from Del Bosque.[170] Torres came on as a substitute on 105 minutes in the final as Spain won the World Cup for the first time following a 1ÿ0 victory over the Netherlands on 11 July 2010.[171]\\r\\nTorres was selected in Del Bosque's Euro 2012 squad.[172] In his first start of the tournament, he netted two goals as Spain defeated the Republic of Ireland 4ÿ0 to eliminate them from the tournament.[173] In the tournament final, Torres came on as a substitute against Italy, scoring one goal and assisting another, as Spain won a second consecutive European Championship with a 4ÿ0 victory.[174] This secured him the Golden Boot for the tournament with three goals and one assist, having played fewer minutes than Mario G܇mez, who also had three goals and one assist.[175]\\r\\nTorres won his 100th cap against Saudi Arabia on 7 September 2012, making him the sixth-highest capped player for Spain, and started the game as captain in goalkeeper Iker Casillas' absence.[176] He became the first person in history to score four goals in one game in a FIFA Confederations Cup match during a 10ÿ0 win over Tahiti on 20 June 2013 in the 2013 Confederations Cup.[177] Torres also became the first player to score two hat-tricks in the Confederations Cup,[178] and with five goals and one assist won the tournament's Golden Shoe, ahead of Fred having played fewer minutes.[179]\\r\\nIn his first international for 11 months, Torres scored a penalty in a World Cup warm-up match against Bolivia on 30 May 2014.[180] The day after, he was named in Spain's final squad for the tournament, ahead of lvaro Negredo and Fernando Llorente.[181] After substitute appearances in the team's opening two matches, Torres was named in the starting line-up for the third group match with the team's elimination already confirmed.[182][183][184] He scored Spain's second goal in a 3ÿ0 defeat of Australia in Curitiba.[184]\\r\\nTorres has been described as having \\"an eye for the spectacular and is capable of world-class skill\\" and being a \\"technically proficient, highly successful striker\\".[185] He has the ability to find himself in goalscoring positions, using his pace and vision to get in behind defenders.[186] A hard-working striker, he is also known for his willingness to chase down and put pressure on opposing defenders, and is capable of playing off of his teammates and creating chances for other strikers, in addition to scoring goals himself; this has also seen him be deployed in a deeper role as a second striker on occasion.[148][187][188][189][190] Being strong in the air, and an accurate finisher with his head as well as both feet, in his prime, his prolific goalscoring earned him a reputation as one of the top strikers in the world.[191][192] However, several injuries led to a loss of form, pace, confidence and a decreased goalscoring rate in more recent seasons.[193][194][195]\\r\\nCF Fuenlabrada that play in Segunda Divisi܇n B name their ground after Fernando.[196]\\r\\nTorres' parents are Jos Torres and Flori Sanz.

The post was established when India was declared as a republic with the adoption of the Indian constitution.[3] Apart from these fourteen, three acting presidents have also been in office for short periods of time. Varahagiri Venkata Giri became the acting president in 1969 following the death of Zakir Husain, who died in office. Giri was elected President a few months later. He remains the only person to have held office both as a president and acting president as well as the only person to be elected as an independent candidate.[4] They may remain in office for a tenure of five years, as stated by article 56, part V, of the constitution of India. In the case where a president's term of office is terminated early or during the absence of the president, the vice president assumes office.

Six of these were active party members of the Indian National Congress. The Janata Party has had one member, Neelam Sanjiva Reddy, who later became president. Two presidents, Zakir Husain and Fakhruddin Ali Ahmed, have died in office. Their vice-presidents served as acting presidents until a new president was elected. Following Zakir Husain's death, two acting presidents held office until the new president, V. V. Giri, was elected.

It has been preinstalled on all Macs since 2002. Within the market of desktop, laptop and home computers, and by web usage, it is the second most widely used desktop OS after Microsoft Windows.[8][9]\\r\\nLaunched in 2001 as Mac OS X, the series is the latest in the family of Macintosh operating systems. Mac OS X succeeded \\"classic\\" Mac OS, which was introduced in 1984, and the final release of which was Mac OS 9 in 1999. An initial, early version of the system, Mac OS X Server 1.0, was released in 1999. The first desktop version, Mac OS X 10.0, followed in March 2001. Releases were code named after big cats from the original release up until OS X 10.8 Mountain Lion. Beginning in 2013 with OS X 10.9 Mavericks, releases have been named after landmarks in California.[10] Apple changed the original name \\"Mac OS X\\" to \\"OS X\\" in 2012 and then to \\"macOS\\" in 2016, adopting the nomenclature that it uses for their other operating systems, iOS, watchOS, and tvOS. The latest version of macOS is macOS High Sierra, which was publicly released in September 2017.\\r\\nmacOS is based on technologies developed at NeXT between 1985 and 1997, when Apple acquired the company. The \\"X\\" in Mac OS X and OS X is the Roman numeral for the number 10 and is pronounced as such. The X was a prominent part of the operating system's brand identity, and was used to showcase its Unix compatibility; UNIX 03 certification was achieved for the Intel version of Mac OS X 10.5 Leopard[11] and all releases from Mac OS X 10.6 Snow Leopard up to the current version also have UNIX 03 certification.[12][13][14][15][16][17][18] macOS shares its Unix-based core, named Darwin, and many of its frameworks with iOS,[19] tvOS and watchOS. A heavily modified version of Mac OS X 10.4 Tiger was used for the first-generation Apple TV.[20]\\r\\nApple also used to have a separate line of releases of Mac OS X designed for servers. Beginning with Mac OS X 10.7 Lion, the server functions were made available as a separate package on the Mac App Store.\\r\\nReleases of Mac OS X from 1999 to 2005 can run only on the PowerPC-based Macs from the time period. After Apple announced that they were switching to Intel CPUs from 2006 onwards, a separate version of Mac OS X 10.4 Tiger was made and distributed exclusively with early Intel-based Macs; it included an emulator known as Rosetta, which allowed users to run most PowerPC applications on Intel-based Macs. Mac OS X 10.5 Leopard was released as a Universal binary, meaning the installer disc supported both Intel and PowerPC processors. In 2009, Apple released Mac OS X 10.6 Snow Leopard, which ran exclusively on Intel-based Macs. In 2011, Apple released Mac OS X 10.7 Lion, which no longer supported 32-bit Intel processors and also did not include Rosetta. All versions of the system released since then run exclusively on 64-bit Intel CPUs and do not support PowerPC applications.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe heritage of what would become macOS had originated at NeXT, a company founded by Steve Jobs following his departure from Apple in 1985. There, the Unix-like NeXTSTEP operating system was developed, and then launched in 1989. The kernel of NeXTSTEP is based upon the Mach kernel, which was originally developed at Carnegie Mellon University, with additional kernel layers and low-level user space code derived from parts of BSD. Its graphical user interface was built on top of an object-oriented GUI toolkit using the Objective-C programming language.\\r\\nThroughout the early 1990s, Apple had tried to create a \\"next-generation\\" OS to succeed its classic Mac OS through the Taligent, Copland and Gershwin projects, but all of them were eventually abandoned.[21] This led Apple to purchase NeXT in 1996, allowing NeXTSTEP, then called OPENSTEP, to serve as the basis for Apple's next generation operating system.[22] This purchase also led to Steve Jobs returning to Apple as an interim, and then the permanent CEO, shepherding the transformation of the programmer-friendly OPENSTEP into a system that would be adopted by Apple's primary market of home users and creative professionals. The project was first code named \\"Rhapsody\\" and then officially named Mac OS X.[23][24]\\r\\nMac OS X was originally presented as the tenth major version of Apple's operating system for Macintosh computers; current versions of macOS retain the major version number \\"10\\". Previous Macintosh operating systems (versions of the classic Mac OS) were named using Arabic numerals, e.g. Mac OS 8 and Mac OS 9. The letter \\"X\\" in Mac OS X's name refers to the number 10, a Roman numeral. It is therefore correctly pronounced \\"ten\\" /?t?n/ in this context.[25][26] However, it is also commonly pronounced like the letter \\"X\\" /??ks/.[27]\\r\\nThe first version of Mac OS X, Mac OS X Server 1.0, was a transitional product, featuring an interface resembling the classic Mac OS, though it was not compatible with software designed for the older system. Consumer releases of Mac OS X included more backward compatibility. Mac OS applications could be rewritten to run natively via the Carbon API; many could also be run directly through the Classic Environment with a reduction in performance.\\r\\nThe consumer version of Mac OS X was launched in 2001 with Mac OS X 10.0. Reviews were variable, with extensive praise for its sophisticated, glossy Aqua interface but criticizing it for sluggish performance.[28] With Apple's popularity at a low, the makers of several classic Mac applications such as FrameMaker and PageMaker declined to develop new versions of their software for Mac OS X.[29] Ars Technica columnist John Siracusa, who reviewed every major OS X release up to 10.10, described the early releases in retrospect as 'dog-slow, feature poor' and Aqua as 'unbearably slow and a huge resource hog'.[28][30][31]\\r\\nApple rapidly developed several new releases of Mac OS X.[32] Siracusa's review of version 10.3, Panther, noted \\"It's strange to have gone from years of uncertainty and vaporware to a steady annual supply of major new operating system releases.\\"[33] Version 10.4, Tiger, reportedly shocked executives at Microsoft by offering a number of features, such as fast file searching and improved graphics processing, that Microsoft had spent several years struggling to add to Windows with acceptable performance.[34]\\r\\nAs the operating system evolved, it moved away from the classic Mac OS, with applications being added and removed.[35] Considering music to be a key market, Apple developed the iPod music player and music software for the Mac, including iTunes and GarageBand.[36] Targeting the consumer and media markets, Apple emphasized its new \\"digital lifestyle\\" applications such as the iLife suite, integrated home entertainment through the Front Row media center and the Safari web browser. With increasing popularity of the internet, Apple offered additional online services, including the .Mac, MobileMe and most recently iCloud products. It later began selling third-party applications through the Mac App Store.\\r\\nNewer versions of Mac OS X also included modifications to the general interface, moving away from the striped gloss and transparency of the initial versions. Some applications began to use a brushed metal appearance, or non-pinstriped titlebar appearance in version 10.4.[37] In Leopard, Apple announced a unification of the interface, with a standardized gray-gradient window style.[38][39]\\r\\nIn 2006, the first Intel Macs released used a specialized version of Mac OS X 10.4 Tiger.[40] In 2007, Mac OS X 10.5 Leopard was the first to run on both PowerPC and Intel Macs with the use of universal binaries.[41] Mac OS X 10.6 Snow Leopard was the first version of OS X to drop support for PowerPC Macs.[42]\\r\\nA key development for the system was the announcement and release of the iPhone from 2007 onwards. While Apple's previous iPod media players used a minimal operating system, the iPhone used an operating system based on Mac OS X, which would later be called \\"iPhone OS\\" and then iOS. The simultaneous release of two operating systems based on the same frameworks placed tension on Apple, which cited the iPhone as forcing it to delay Mac OS X 10.5 Leopard.[43] However, after Apple opened the iPhone to third-party developers its commercial success drew attention to Mac OS X, with many iPhone software developers showing interest in Mac development.[44]\\r\\nIn two succeeding versions, Lion and Mountain Lion, Apple moved some applications to a highly skeuomorphic style of design inspired by contemporary versions of iOS, at the same time simplifying some elements by making controls such as scroll bars fade out when not in use.[30] This direction was, like brushed metal interfaces, unpopular with some users, although it continued a trend of greater animation and variety in the interface previously seen in design aspects such as the Time Machine backup utility, which presented past file versions against a swirling nebula, and the glossy translucent dock of Leopard and Snow Leopard.[45] In addition, with Mac OS X 10.7 Lion, Apple ceased to release separate server versions of Mac OS X, selling server tools as a separate downloadable application through the Mac App Store. A review described the trend in the server products as becoming \\"cheaper and simpler... shifting its focus from large businesses to small ones.\\"[46]\\r\\nIn 2012, with the release of OS X 10.8 Mountain Lion, the name of the system was shortened from Mac OS X to OS X. That year, Apple removed the head of OS X development, Scott Forstall, and design was changed towards a more minimal direction.[47] Apple's new user interface design, using deep color saturation, text-only buttons and a minimal, 'flat' interface, was debuted with iOS 7 in 2013. With OS X engineers reportedly working on iOS 7, the version released in 2013, OS X 10.9 Mavericks, was something of a transitional release, with some of the skeuomorphic design removed, while most of the general interface of Mavericks remained unchanged.[48] The next version, OS X 10.10 Yosemite, adopted a design similar to iOS 7 but with greater complexity suitable for an interface controlled with a mouse.[49]\\r\\nFrom 2012 onwards, the system has shifted to an annual release schedule similar to that of iOS. It also steadily cut the cost of updates from Snow Leopard onwards, before removing upgrade fees altogether from 2013 onwards.[50] Some journalists and third-party software developers have suggested that this decision, while allowing more rapid feature release, meant less opportunity to focus on stability, with no version of OS X recommendable for users requiring stability and performance above new features.[51] Apple's 2015 update, OS X 10.11 El Capitan, was announced to focus specifically on stability and performance improvements.[52]\\r\\nIn 2016, with the release of macOS 10.12 Sierra, the name was changed from OS X to macOS to streamline it with the branding of Apple's other primary operating systems: iOS, watchOS, and tvOS.[53]\\r\\nmacOS 10.12 Sierra's main features are the introduction of Siri to macOS, Optimized Storage, improvements to included applications, and greater integration with Apple's iPhone and Apple Watch. The Apple File System (APFS) was announced at the Apple Worldwide Developers Conference in 2016 as a replacement for HFS+, a highly criticized file system.[54]\\r\\nAt the 2017 Worldwide Developers Conference Apple previewed macOS 10.13 High Sierra. It uses APFS, rather than HFS+, on solid state drives.\\r\\nAt macOS's core is a POSIX compliant operating system built on top of the XNU kernel, with standard Unix facilities available from the command line interface. Apple has released this family of software as a free and open source operating system named Darwin. On top of Darwin, Apple layered a number of components, including the Aqua interface and the Finder, to complete the GUI-based operating system which is macOS.[55]\\r\\nWith its original introduction as Mac OS X, the system brought a number of new capabilities to provide a more stable and reliable platform than its predecessor, the classic Mac OS. For example, pre-emptive multitasking and memory protection improved the system's ability to run multiple applications simultaneously without them interrupting or corrupting each other.[56] Many aspects of macOS's architecture are derived from OPENSTEP, which was designed to be portable, to ease the transition from one platform to another. For example, NeXTSTEP was ported from the original 68k-based NeXT workstations to x86 and other architectures before NeXT was purchased by Apple,[57] and OPENSTEP was later ported to the PowerPC architecture as part of the Rhapsody project.\\r\\nPrior to macOS High Sierra, and on drives other than solid state drives (SSDs), the default file system is HFS+, which it inherited from the classic Mac OS. Operating system designer Linus Torvalds has criticized HFS+, saying it is \\"probably the worst file system ever\\", whose design is \\"actively corrupting user data\\". He criticized the case insensitivity of file names, a design made worse when Apple extended the file system to support Unicode.[58][59] Initially, HFS+ was designed for classic Mac OS, which runs on big-endian 68K and PowerPC systems. When Apple switched Macintosh to little-endian Intel processors, it continued to use big-endian byte order on HFS+ file systems. As a result, macOS on current Macs must do byte swap when it reads file system data.[60][61] These concerns are being addressed with the new Apple File System, which is used for file systems on SSDs in macOS High Sierra.\\r\\nThe Darwin subsystem in macOS is in charge of managing the file system, which includes the Unix permissions layer. In 2003 and 2005, two Macworld editors expressed criticism of the permission scheme; Ted Landau called misconfigured permissions \\"the most common frustration\\" in macOS, while Rob Griffiths suggested that some users may even have to reset permissions every day, a process which can take up to 15 minutes.[62] More recently, another Macworld editor, Dan Frakes, called the procedure of repairing permissions vastly overused.[63] He argues that macOS typically handles permissions properly without user interference, and resetting permissions should just be tried when problems emerge.[64]\\r\\nThe architecture of macOS incorporates a layered design:[65] the layered frameworks aid rapid development of applications by providing existing code for common tasks.[66] Apple provides its own software development tools, most prominently an integrated development environment called Xcode. Xcode provides interfaces to compilers that support several programming languages including C, C++, Objective-C, and Swift. For the AppleÿIntel transition, it was modified so that developers could build their applications as a universal binary, which provides compatibility with both the Intel-based and PowerPC-based Macintosh lines.[67] First and third-party applications can be controlled programatically using the AppleScript framework,[68] retained from the classic Mac OS,[69] or using the newer Automator application that offers pre-written tasks that do not require programming knowledge.[70]\\r\\nApple offered two main APIs to develop software natively for macOS: Cocoa and Carbon. Cocoa was a descendant of APIs inherited from OPENSTEP with no ancestry from the classic Mac OS, while Carbon was an adaptation of classic Mac OS APIs, allowing Mac software to be minimally rewritten in order to run natively on Mac OS X.\\r\\nThe Cocoa API was created as the result of a 1993 collaboration between NeXT Computer and Sun Microsystems. This heritage is highly visible for Cocoa developers, since the \\"NS\\" prefix is ubiquitous in the framework, standing variously for NeXTSTEP or NeXT/Sun. The official OPENSTEP API, published in September 1994, was the first to split the API between Foundation and ApplicationKit and the first to use the \\"NS\\" prefix.[57] Traditionally, Cocoa programs have been mostly written in Objective-C, with Java as an alternative. However, on July 11, 2005, Apple announced that \\"features added to Cocoa in Mac OS X versions later than 10.4 will not be added to the Cocoa-Java programming interface.\\"[80] macOS also used to support the Java Platform as a \\"preferred software package\\"in practice this means that applications written in Java fit as neatly into the operating system as possible while still being cross-platform compatible, and that graphical user interfaces written in Swing look almost exactly like native Cocoa interfaces. Since 2014, Apple has promoted its new programming language Swift as the preferred language for software development on Apple platforms.\\r\\nApple's original plan with macOS was to require all developers to rewrite their software into the Cocoa APIs. This caused much outcry among existing Mac developers, who threatened to abandon the platform rather than invest in a costly rewrite, and the idea was shelved.[24][81] To permit a smooth transition from Mac OS 9 to Mac OS X, the Carbon Application Programming Interface (API) was created.[24] Applications written with Carbon were initially able to run natively on both classic Mac OS and Mac OS X, although this ability was later dropped as Mac OS X developed. Carbon was not included in the first product sold as Mac OS X: the little-used original release of Mac OS X Server 1.0, which also did not include the Aqua interface.[82] Apple limited further development of Carbon from the release of Leopard onwards, announcing Carbon applications would not receive the ability to run at 64-bit.[81] As of 2015, a small number of older Mac OS X apps with heritage dating back to the classic Mac OS still used Carbon, including Microsoft Office. Early versions of macOS could also run some classic Mac OS applications through the Classic Environment with performance limitations; this feature was removed from 10.5 onwards and all Macs using Intel processors.\\r\\nBecause macOS is POSIX compliant, many software packages written for the other Unix-like systems such as Linux can be recompiled to run on it, including much scientific and technical software.[83] Third-party projects such as Homebrew, Fink, MacPorts and pkgsrc provide pre-compiled or pre-formatted packages. Apple and others have provided versions of the X Window System graphical interface which can allow these applications to run with an approximation of the macOS look-and-feel.[84][85][86] The current Apple-endorsed method is the open-source XQuartz project; earlier versions could use the X11 application provided by Apple, or before that the XDarwin project.[87]\\r\\nApplications can be distributed to Macs and installed by the user from any source and by any method such as downloading (with or without code signing, available via an Apple developer account) or through the Mac App Store, a marketplace of software maintained by Apple by way of a process requiring the company's approval. Apps installed through the Mac App Store run within a sandbox, restricting their ability to exchange information with other applications or modify the core operating system and its features. This has been cited as an advantage, by allowing users to install apps with confidence that they should not be able to damage their system, but also as a disadvantage, by blocking the Mac App Store's use by professional applications that require elevated privileges.[88][89] Applications without any code signature cannot be run by default except from a computer's administrator account.[90][91]\\r\\nApple produces macOS applications, some of which are included and some sold separately. This includes iWork, Final Cut Pro, Logic Pro, iLife, and the database application FileMaker. Numerous other developers also offer software for macOS.\\r\\nTools such as XPostFacto and patches applied to the installation media have been developed by third parties to enable installation of newer versions of macOS on systems not officially supported by Apple. This includes a number of pre-G3 Power Macintosh systems that can be made to run up to and including Mac OS X 10.2 Jaguar, all G3-based Macs which can run up to and including Tiger, and sub-867?MHz G4 Macs can run Leopard by removing the restriction from the installation DVD or entering a command in the Mac's Open Firmware interface to tell the Leopard Installer that it has a clock rate of 867?MHz or greater. Except for features requiring specific hardware (e.g. graphics acceleration or DVD writing), the operating system offers the same functionality on all supported hardware.\\r\\nAs most Mac hardware components, or components similar to those, since the Intel transition are available for purchase,[95] some technology-capable groups have developed software to install macOS on non-Apple computers. These are referred to as Hackintoshes, a portmanteau of the words \\"hack\\" and \\"Macintosh\\". This violates Apple's EULA (and is therefore unsupported by Apple technical support, warranties etc.), but communities that cater to personal users, who do not install for resale and profit, have generally been ignored by Apple.[96][97][98] These self-made computers allow more flexibility and customization of hardware, but at a cost of leaving the user more responsible for their own machine, such as on matter of data integrity or security.[99] Psystar, a business that attempted to profit from selling macOS on non-Apple certified hardware, was sued by Apple in 2008.[100]\\r\\nIn April 2002, eWeek announced a rumor that Apple had a version of Mac OS X code-named Marklar, which ran on Intel x86 processors. The idea behind Marklar was to keep Mac OS X running on an alternative platform should Apple become dissatisfied with the progress of the PowerPC platform.[101] These rumors subsided until late in May 2005, when various media outlets, such as The Wall Street Journal[102] and CNET,[103] announced that Apple would unveil Marklar in the coming months.[104][105][106]\\r\\nOn June 6, 2005, Steve Jobs announced in his keynote address at the annual Apple Worldwide Developers Conference that Apple would be making the transition from PowerPC to Intel processors over the following two years, and that Mac OS X would support both platforms during the transition. Jobs also confirmed rumors that Apple had versions of Mac OS X running on Intel processors for most of its developmental life. Intel-based Macs would run a new recompiled version of OS X along with Rosetta, a binary translation layer which enables software compiled for PowerPC Mac OS X to run on Intel Mac OS X machines.[107] The system was included with Mac OS X versions up to version 10.6.8.[108] Apple dropped support for Classic mode on the new Intel Macs. Third party emulation software such as Mini vMac, Basilisk II and SheepShaver provided support for some early versions of Mac OS. A new version of Xcode and the underlying command-line compilers supported building universal binaries that would run on either architecture.[109]\\r\\nPowerPC-only software is supported with Apple's official emulation software, Rosetta, though applications eventually had to be rewritten to run properly on the newer versions released for Intel processors. Apple initially encouraged developers to produce universal binaries with support for both PowerPC and Intel.[110] There is a performance penalty when PowerPC binaries run on Intel Macs through Rosetta. Moreover, some PowerPC software, such as kernel extensions and System Preferences plugins, are not supported on Intel Macs at all. Some PowerPC applications would not run on macOS at all. Plugins for Safari need to be compiled for the same platform as Safari, so when Safari is running on Intel, it requires plug-ins that have been compiled as Intel-only or universal binaries, so PowerPC-only plug-ins will not work.[111] While Intel Macs are able to run PowerPC, Intel, and universal binaries; PowerPC Macs support only universal and PowerPC builds.\\r\\nSupport for the PowerPC platform was dropped following the transition. In 2009, Apple announced at its Worldwide Developers Conference that Mac OS X 10.6 Snow Leopard would drop support for PowerPC processors and be Intel-only.[112] Rosetta continued to be offered as an optional download or installation choice in Snow Leopard before it was discontinued with Mac OS X 10.7 Lion.[113][113] In addition, new versions of Mac OS X first- and third-party software increasingly required Intel processors, including new versions of iLife, iWork, Aperture and Logic Pro.\\r\\nOne of the major differences between the classic Mac OS and the current macOS was the addition of Aqua, a graphical user interface with water-like elements, in the first major release of Mac OS X. Every window element, text, graphic, or widget is drawn on-screen using spatial anti-aliasing technology.[114] ColorSync, a technology introduced many years before, was improved and built into the core drawing engine, to provide color matching for printing and multimedia professionals.[115] Also, drop shadows were added around windows and isolated text elements to provide a sense of depth. New interface elements were integrated, including sheets (dialog boxes attached to specific windows) and drawers, which would slide out and provide options.\\r\\nThe use of soft edges, translucent colors, and pinstripes, similar to the hardware design of the first iMacs, brought more texture and color to the user interface when compared to what Mac OS 9 and Mac OS X Server 1.0's \\"Platinum\\" appearance had offered. According to John Siracusa, an editor of Ars Technica, the introduction of Aqua and its departure from the then conventional look \\"hit like a ton of bricks.\\"[116] Bruce Tognazzini (who founded the original Apple Human Interface Group) said that the Aqua interface in Mac OS X 10.0 represented a step backwards in usability compared with the original Mac OS interface.[117][118] Third-party developers started producing skins for customizable applications and other operating systems which mimicked the Aqua appearance. To some extent, Apple has used the successful transition to this new design as leverage, at various times threatening legal action against people who make or distribute software with an interface the company says is derived from its copyrighted design.[119]\\r\\nApple has continued to change aspects of the macOS appearance and design, particularly with tweaks to the appearance of windows and the menu bar. Since 2012, Apple has sold many of its Mac models with high-resolution Retina displays, and macOS and its APIs have extensive support for resolution-independent development on supporting high-resolution displays. Reviewers have described Apple's support for the technology as superior to that on Windows.[120][121][122]\\r\\nThe human interface guidelines published by Apple for macOS are followed by many applications, giving them consistent user interface and keyboard shortcuts.[123] In addition, new services for applications are included, which include spelling and grammar checkers, special characters palette, color picker, font chooser and dictionary; these global features are present in every Cocoa application, adding consistency. The graphics system OpenGL composites windows onto the screen to allow hardware-accelerated drawing. This technology, introduced in version 10.2, is called Quartz Extreme, a component of Quartz. Quartz's internal imaging model correlates well with the Portable Document Format (PDF) imaging model, making it easy to output PDF to multiple devices.[115] As a side result, PDF viewing and creating PDF documents from any application are built-in features.[124] Reflecting its popularity with design users, macOS also has system support for a variety of professional video and image formats and includes an extensive pre-installed font library, featuring many prominent brand-name designs.[125]\\r\\nThe Finder is a file browser allowing quick access to all areas of the computer, which has been modified throughout subsequent releases of macOS.[126][127] Quick Look is part of the Finder since version 10.5. It allows for dynamic previews of files, including videos and multi-page documents without opening any other applications. Spotlight, a file searching technology which has been integrated into the Finder since version 10.4, allows rapid real-time searches of data files; mail messages; photos; and other information based on item properties (metadata) and/or content.[128][129] macOS makes use of a Dock, which holds file and folder shortcuts as well as minimized windows.\\r\\nApple added \\"Expos\\" in version 10.3 (called Mission Control since version 10.7), a feature which includes three functions to help accessibility between windows and desktop. Its functions are to instantly display all open windows as thumbnails for easy navigation to different tasks, display all open windows as thumbnails from the current application, and hide all windows to access the desktop.[130] Also, FileVault was introduced, which is an optional encryption of the user's files with the 128-bit Advanced Encryption Standard (AES-128).[131]\\r\\nFeatures introduced in version 10.4 include Automator, an application designed to create an automatic workflow for different tasks;[132] Dashboard, a full-screen group of small applications called desktop widgets that can be called up and dismissed in one keystroke;[133] and Front Row, a media viewer interface accessed by the Apple Remote.[134] Moreover, the Sync Services were included, which is a system that allows applications to access a centralized extensible database for various elements of user data, including calendar and contact items. The operating system then managed conflicting edits and data consistency.[135]\\r\\nAll system icons are scalable up to 512G512 pixels as of version 10.5 to accommodate various places where they appear in larger size, including for example the Cover Flow view, a three-dimensional graphical user interface included with iTunes, the Finder, and other Apple products for visually skimming through files and digital media libraries via cover artwork. That version also introduced Spaces, a virtual desktop implementation which enables the user to have more than one desktop and display them in an Expos-like interface;[136] an automatic backup technology called Time Machine, which provides the ability to view and restore previous versions of files and application data;[137] and Screen Sharing was built in for the first time.[138]\\r\\nIn more recent releases, Apple has developed support for emoji characters by including the proprietary Apple Color Emoji font.[139][140] Apple has also connected macOS with social networks such as Twitter and Facebook through the addition of share buttons for content such as pictures and text.[141] Apple has brought several applications and features that originally debuted in iOS, its mobile operating system, to macOS in recent releases, notably the intelligent personal assistant Siri, which was introduced in version 10.12 of macOS.[142][143]\\r\\nThere are 34 system languages available in macOS for the user at the moment of installation; the system language is used throughout the entire operating system environment.[6] Input methods for typing in dozens of scripts can be chosen independently of the system language.[144] Recent updates have added increasing support for Chinese characters and interconnections with popular social networks in China.[145][146][147][148]\\r\\n\\r\\nmacOS can be updated using the Mac App Store application[149] or the softwareupdate command line utility. Until OS X 10.8 Mountain Lion, a separate Software Update application performed this functionality. In Mountain Lion and later, this was merged into the Mac App Store application, although the underlying update mechanism remains unchanged and is fundamentally different than the download mechanism used when purchasing an App Store application.\\r\\nWith the exception of Mac OS X Server 1.0 and the original public beta, OS X versions were named after big cats until OS X 10.9 Mavericks, when Apple switched to using California locations. Prior to its release, Mac OS X 10.0 was code named \\"Cheetah\\" internally at Apple, and Mac OS X 10.1 was code named internally as \\"Puma\\". After the immense buzz surrounding Mac OS X 10.2, codenamed \\"Jaguar\\", Apple's product marketing began openly using the code names to promote the operating system. Mac OS X 10.3 was marketed as \\"Panther\\", Mac OS X 10.4 as \\"Tiger\\", Mac OS X 10.5 as \\"Leopard\\", Mac OS X 10.6 as \\"Snow Leopard\\", Mac OS X 10.7 as \\"Lion\\", OS X 10.8 as \\"Mountain Lion\\", and OS X 10.9 as \\"Mavericks\\".\\r\\n\\"Panther\\", \\"Tiger\\" and \\"Leopard\\" are registered as trademarks of Apple,[168][169][170] but \\"Cheetah\\", \\"Puma\\" and \\"Jaguar\\" have never been registered. Apple has also registered \\"Lynx\\" and \\"Cougar\\" as trademarks, though these were allowed to lapse.[171][172] Computer retailer Tiger Direct sued Apple for its use of the name \\"Tiger\\". On May 16, 2005 a US federal court in the Southern District of Florida ruled that Apple's use did not infringe on Tiger Direct's trademark.[173]\\r\\nOn September 13, 2000, Apple released a $29.95[174] \\"preview\\" version of Mac OS X internally codenamed Kodiak in order to gain feedback from users.\\r\\nThe \\"PB\\" as it was known marked the first public availability of the Aqua interface and Apple made many changes to the UI based on customer feedback. Mac OS X Public Beta expired and ceased to function in Spring 2001.[175]\\r\\nOn March 24, 2001, Apple released Mac OS X 10.0 (internally codenamed Cheetah).[176] The initial version was slow,[177] incomplete,[178] and had very few applications available at the time of its launch, mostly from independent developers.[179] While many critics suggested that the operating system was not ready for mainstream adoption, they recognized the importance of its initial launch as a base on which to improve.[178] Simply releasing Mac OS X was received by the Macintosh community as a great accomplishment,[178] for attempts to completely overhaul the Mac OS had been underway since 1996, and delayed by countless setbacks. Following some bug fixes, kernel panics became much less frequent.[citation needed]\\r\\nLater that year on September 25, 2001, Mac OS X 10.1 (internally codenamed Puma) was released. It featured increased performance and provided missing features, such as DVD playback. Apple released 10.1 as a free upgrade CD for 10.0 users, in addition to the US$129 boxed version for people running Mac OS 9. It was discovered that the upgrade CDs were full install CDs that could be used with Mac OS 9 systems by removing a specific file; Apple later re-released the CDs in an actual stripped-down format that did not facilitate installation on such systems.[180] On January 7, 2002, Apple announced that Mac OS X was to be the default operating system for all Macintosh products by the end of that month.[181]\\r\\nOn August 23, 2002,[182] Apple followed up with Mac OS X 10.2 Jaguar, the first release to use its code name as part of the branding.[183] It brought great raw performance improvements, a sleeker look, and many powerful user-interface enhancements (over 150, according to Apple[184] ), including Quartz Extreme for compositing graphics directly on an ATI Radeon or Nvidia GeForce2 MX AGP-based video card with at least 16?MB of VRAM, a system-wide repository for contact information in the new Address Book, and an instant messaging client named iChat.[185] The Happy Mac which had appeared during the Mac OS startup sequence for almost 18 years was replaced with a large grey Apple logo with the introduction of Mac OS X v10.2.[186]\\r\\nMac OS X v10.3 Panther was released on October 24, 2003. In addition to providing much improved performance, it also incorporated the most extensive update yet to the user interface. Panther included as many or more new features as Jaguar had the year before, including an updated Finder, incorporating a brushed-metal interface, Fast user switching, Expos (Window manager), FileVault, Safari, iChat AV (which added videoconferencing features to iChat), improved Portable Document Format (PDF) rendering and much greater Microsoft Windows interoperability.[187] Support for some early G3 computers such as \\"beige\\" Power Macs and \\"WallStreet\\" PowerBooks was discontinued.[188]\\r\\nMac OS X 10.4 Tiger was released on April 29, 2005. Apple stated that Tiger contained more than 200 new features.[189] As with Panther, certain older machines were no longer supported; Tiger requires a Mac with 256?MB and a built-in FireWire port.[94] Among the new features, Tiger introduced Spotlight, Dashboard, Smart Folders, updated Mail program with Smart Mailboxes, QuickTime 7, Safari 2, Automator, VoiceOver, Core Image and Core Video. The initial release of the Apple TV used a modified version of Tiger with a different graphical interface and fewer applications and services. On January 10, 2006, Apple released the first Intel-based Macs along with the 10.4.4 update to Tiger. This operating system functioned identically on the PowerPC-based Macs and the new Intel-based machines, with the exception of the Intel release dropping support for the Classic environment.[190]\\r\\nMac OS X 10.5 Leopard was released on October 26, 2007. It was called by Apple \\"the largest update of Mac OS X\\". It brought more than 300 new features.[191] Leopard supports both PowerPC- and Intel x86-based Macintosh computers; support for the G3 processor was dropped and the G4 processor required a minimum clock rate of 867?MHz, and at least 512?MB of RAM to be installed. The single DVD works for all supported Macs (including 64-bit machines). New features include a new look, an updated Finder, Time Machine, Spaces, Boot Camp pre-installed,[192] full support for 64-bit applications (including graphical applications), new features in Mail and iChat, and a number of new security features. Leopard is an Open Brand UNIX 03 registered product on the Intel platform. It was also the first BSD-based OS to receive UNIX 03 certification.[11][193] Leopard dropped support for the Classic Environment and all Classic applications.[194] It was the final version of Mac OS X to support the PowerPC architecture.[195]\\r\\nMac OS X 10.6 Snow Leopard was released on August 28, 2009. Rather than delivering big changes to the appearance and end user functionality like the previous releases of Mac OS X, Snow Leopard focused on \\"under the hood\\" changes, increasing the performance, efficiency, and stability of the operating system. For most users, the most noticeable changes were: the disk space that the operating system frees up after a clean install compared to Mac OS X 10.5 Leopard, a more responsive Finder rewritten in Cocoa, faster Time Machine backups, more reliable and user friendly disk ejects, a more powerful version of the Preview application, as well as a faster Safari web browser. Snow Leopard only supported machines with Intel CPUs, required at least 1?GB of RAM, and dropped default support for applications built for the PowerPC architecture (Rosetta could be installed as an additional component to retain support for PowerPC-only applications).[196]\\r\\nSnow Leopard also featured new 64-bit technology capable of supporting greater amounts of RAM, improved support for multi-core processors through Grand Central Dispatch, and advanced GPU performance with OpenCL.[197]\\r\\nAn update introduced support for the Mac App Store, Apple's digital distribution platform for macOS applications.[198]\\r\\nMac OS X 10.7 Lion was released on July 20, 2011. It brought developments made in Apple's iOS, such as an easily navigable display of installed applications called Launchpad and a greater use of multi-touch gestures, to the Mac. This release removed Rosetta, making it incompatible with PowerPC applications.[113]\\r\\nChanges made to the GUI include auto-hiding scrollbars that only appear when they are being used, and Mission Control which unifies Expos, Spaces, Dashboard, and full-screen applications within a single interface.[199] Apple also made changes to applications: they resume in the same state as they were before they were closed, similar to iOS. Documents auto-save by default.[200]\\r\\nOS X 10.8 Mountain Lion was released on July 25, 2012.[162] Following the release of Lion the previous year, it was the first of the annual rather than two-yearly updates to OS X (and later macOS), which also closely alined with the annual iOS operating system updates. It incorporates some features seen in iOS 5, which include Game Center, support for iMessage in the new Messages messaging application, and Reminders as a to-do list app separate from iCal (which is renamed as Calendar, like the iOS app). It also includes support for storing iWork documents in iCloud.[201] Notification Center, which makes its debut in Mountain Lion, is a desktop version similar to the one in iOS 5.0 and higher. Application pop-ups are now concentrated on the corner of the screen, and the Center itself is pulled from the right side of the screen.

It was a free upgrade to all users running Snow Leopard or later with a 64-bit Intel processor.[204] Its changes include the addition of the previously iOS-only Maps and iBooks applications, improvements to the Notification Center, enhancements to several applications, and many under-the-hood improvements.[205]\\r\\nOS X 10.10 Yosemite was released on October 16, 2014. It features a redesigned user interface similar to that of iOS 7, intended to feature a more minimal, text-based 'flat' design, with use of translucency effects and intensely saturated colors.[206] Apple's showcase new feature in Yosemite is Handoff, which enables users with iPhones running iOS 8.1 or later to answer phone calls, receive and send SMS messages, and complete unfinished iPhone emails on their Mac. As of OS X 10.10.3, Photos replaced iPhoto and Aperture.[207]\\r\\nOS X 10.11 El Capitan was released on September 30, 2015. Similar to Mac OS X 10.6 Snow Leopard, Apple described this release as containing \\"refinements to the Mac experience\\" and \\"improvements to system performance\\" rather than new features. Refinements include public transport built into the Maps application, GUI improvements to the Notes application, adopting San Francisco as the system font for clearer legibility, and the introduction of System Integrity Protection. The Metal API, first introduced in iOS 8, was also included in this operating system for \\"all Macs since 2012\\".[208]\\r\\nmacOS 10.12 Sierra was released to the public on September 20, 2016. New features include the addition of Siri, Optimized Storage, and updates to Photos, Messages, and iTunes.[209][210]\\r\\nThe fall release of macOS 10.13 High Sierra was announced on June 5, 2017 at Apple's WWDC event.[211] On September 12, 2017 at Apple's iPhone event, they announced its release to be September 25, 2017.[212] Like OS X El Capitan and OS X Mountain Lion, High Sierra is a refinement-based update having very few new features.[213] High Sierra uses the new Apple File System and includes enhancements to Safari, Photos, and Mail, among other changes.[211]\\r\\nAs of July 2016, macOS is the second-most-active general-purpose desktop client operating system in use on the World Wide Web following Microsoft Windows, with a 4.90% usage share according to statistics compiled by the Wikimedia Foundation. It is the most successful Unix-like desktop operating system on the web, estimated at approximately 5 times the usage of Linux (which has 1.01%). Usage share generally continues to shift away from the desktop and toward mobile operating systems such as iOS and Android.[214]\\r\\nIn its earlier years, Mac OS X enjoyed a near-absence of the types of malware and spyware that have affected Microsoft Windows users.[215][216][217] macOS has a smaller usage share compared to Windows,[218] but it also has traditionally more secure Unix roots. Worms, as well as potential vulnerabilities, were noted in 2006, which led some industry analysts and anti-virus companies to issue warnings that Apple's Mac OS X is not immune to malware.[219] Increasing market share coincided with additional reports of a variety of attacks.[220] In early 2011, Mac OS X experienced a large increase in malware attacks,[221] and malware such as Mac Defender, MacProtector, and MacGuard were seen as an increasing problem for Mac users. At first, the malware installer required the user to enter the administrative password, but later versions were able to install without user input.[222] Initially, Apple support staff were instructed not to assist in the removal of the malware or admit the existence of the malware issue, but as the malware spread, a support document was issued. Apple announced an OS X update to fix the problem. An estimated 100,000 users were affected.[223][224] Apple releases security updates for macOS regularly.[225]\\r\\nAs a devices company, most large-scale Apple promotion for macOS has been part of the sale of Macs, with promotion of macOS updates generally focused on existing users, promotion at Apple Store and other retail partners, or through events for developers. In larger scale advertising campaigns, Apple specifically promoted macOS as better for handling media and other home-user applications, and comparing Mac OS X (especially versions Tiger and Leopard) with the heavy criticism Microsoft received for the long-awaited Windows Vista operating system.[226][227]","input":"What is the most recent os for mac?"},{"output":"Oak Lawn","context":"Dwyane Tyrone Wade Jr. (/dwe?n/ dwain;[1] born January 17, 1982) is an American professional basketball player for the Chicago Bulls of the National Basketball Association (NBA). After a successful college career at Marquette, Wade was drafted fifth overall in the 2003 NBA draft by the Miami Heat. He was named to the All-Rookie team and the All-Star team the following twelve seasons. In his third season, Wade led the Heat to their first NBA championship in franchise history and was named the 2006 NBA Finals MVP. At the 2008 Summer Olympics, Wade led the United States men's basketball team, commonly known as the \\"Redeem Team\\", in scoring, and helped them capture gold medal honors in Beijing, China. In the 2008ÿ09 season, Wade led the league in scoring and earned his first NBA scoring title. With LeBron James and Chris Bosh, Wade guided Miami to four consecutive NBA Finals from 2011 to 2014, winning back-to-back championships in 2012 and 2013. In 2016, Wade departed the Heat in free agency to play for the Chicago Bulls.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nDwyane Wade was born on the South Side of Chicago, Illinois, to JoLinda and Dwyane Wade Sr, whose name's unusual spelling was decided by his own mother.[2] In 1977, JoLinda, at the age of 18, already had two children. Wade has described his upbringing in Chicago as being very difficult. Wade stated that \\"[his] mom was on drugs and [his] family was in the gang environment, so it was a rough childhood.\\" At a very young age, Wade already witnessed police raids and found dead bodies several times in a nearby garbage can. When he was only 4 months old, his parents separated ÿ and would later divorce. Jolinda was given custody of the two children, and she moved to her mother's house with them. The family struggled financially, and it was around that time when Jolinda started dealing drugs. His mom was addicted to several substances including cigarettes, alcohol, heroin, and cocaine. JoLinda would get high with friends at her home, even in the presence of her children. In an interview with ESPN, Wade said \\"I've seen the needles laying around the house. I've seen my mother shoot up before. I've seen a lot of things my mother didn't even know I'd seen as a kid.\\" At the age of 6, he recalls police ÿ with guns drawn ÿ raiding his home as they searched for his mother. When Wade turned 8 years old, his older sister, Tragil, tricked him ÿ by telling him they were going to the movies ÿ into living with his father, a former Army sergeant, and stepmother in a nearby neighborhood. Wade would still occasionally visit his mom. A year later, his father moved the family to Robbins, Illinois.[3] After moving to Robbins, Wade didn't see his mother for two years. During this time, JoLinda was able to access a free supply of drugs by volunteering to be a tester ÿ i.e., someone who tests street drugs for impurities before the dealers try to sell them. JoLinda was hospitalized and nearly died after she mistakenly injected herself with LSD. In 1994, JoLinda was arrested for possession of crack cocaine with intent to sell and locked up in Cook County Jail. Wade, at the age of 10, reunited with his mom by talking with her at Cook County Jail through a glass panel over a telephone. JoLinda served 23 months in prison for her crimes, but while serving her second sentence in 1997, she failed to report to prison while on work release.[4]\\r\\nWade turned to sports, especially basketball and football, to avoid the temptations of participating in drug and gang-related activities. Wade's mom and dad would often take him to the park to play basketball. He cites one of his older sisters, Tragil, as the individual most responsible for his childhood upbringing and for steering him in the proper direction.[5] As a child growing up in the Chicago area, Wade idolized Chicago Bulls star Michael Jordan,[6][7] and has said he patterns his game after him.\\r\\nWade attended Harold L. Richards High School in Oak Lawn. Wade quickly found success as a wide receiver on the football team, but he needed to work extremely hard to earn playing time on the varsity basketball team during his junior year.[5] While he did not acquire much playing time during his second year, his stepbrother, Demetris McDaniel, was the star of the team.[8] Wade grew four inches in the summer before his junior year and saw an increase in playing time, averaging 20.7 points and 7.6 rebounds per game.[9] The following year, Wade averaged 27.0 points and 11.0 rebounds per game while leading his team to a 24ÿ5 record.[9] It advanced to the title game of the Class AA Eisenhower Sectional.[9] During this season he set school records for points (676) and steals (106) in a season.[9] Wade has stated that his high school coach, Jack Fitzgerald, was one of the most positive influences in his life during this time. Wade was recruited by only three college basketball teams (Marquette University, Illinois State, and DePaul University) due to academic problems.[3]\\r\\nDuring most of Wade's time at Marquette, his mother was either eluding the law or serving time in jail for selling crack cocaine. On October 14, 2001, JoLinda declared that she would change her life and get clean while attending a service at a Chicago church. Wade, then a sophomore at Marquette, went home for Christmas to be with his mom, who he believed was clean and sober for the first time in his life. However, JoLinda admitted to him that she was actually going back to prison. Wade told ESPN, \\"I was hurt because I felt like I was just getting my mom back, and now she had to leave again.\\" On January 2, 2002, his mother went back to prison to serve her 14-month sentence. She says she has been clean since 2003.\\r\\nWade chose to play college basketball for Tom Crean at Marquette University in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. During Wade's freshman year at Marquette, he was ineligible to play with the men's team as he had fallen short of academic standards set by the NCAA's Proposition 48. Wade sought tutoring to improve his writing skills in order to regain eligibility.[10][11]\\r\\nWade earned eligibility to play for the 2001ÿ2002 season, and he led the Golden Eagles in scoring with 17.8 ppg, led the conference in steals at 2.47 per game, and averaged 6.6 rebounds and 3.4 assists per game.[12] Marquette finished with a 26ÿ7 record,[9] the school's best record since the 1993ÿ94 season.[9]\\r\\nIn 2002ÿ03, Wade led Marquette in scoring again with 21.5 ppg,[12] and Marquette won the school's first and only Conference USA championship with a 27ÿ6 record. That season Wade led the Golden Eagles to the Final Four, the school's first appearance in the Final Four since winning the 1977 national championship. After the season, he was named to the All-America First Team by the Associated Press; Wade is the first Marquette basketball player since 1978 to do so.[9]\\r\\nWade's performance during the Midwest Regional Final of the 2003 NCAA Tournament was highly publicized by the national press. Against heavily favored, top-ranked and top-seeded Kentucky Wildcats, Wade recorded a triple-double with 29 points, 11 rebounds, and 11 assists.[13] His triple-double was the fourth in NCAA Tournament history.[14] Wade's exceptional play helped lead Marquette over the Wildcats 83ÿ69 and into the Final Four; Wade was named MVP of the Midwest Regional. Marquette finished the season ranked No.6 in the AP poll, the school's highest ranking since the 1976ÿ77 season. Wade's strong tournament play resulted in increased visibility in the national media and, consequently, a high draft projection.[15] As a result, he elected to forgo his senior year at Marquette and enter the 2003 NBA draft. On February 3, 2007, almost four years after Wade played in his final collegiate game, Marquette retired his jersey at halftime of a game against Providence. Although Marquette requires student-athletes to graduate prior to receiving jersey retirement honors, the University made a special exception for Wade based on his accomplishments since leaving Marquette.[16]\\r\\nOn March 5, 2003, JoLinda Wade was released from prison. Three days later she saw Dwyane play basketball for the first time in five years. She watched Marquette beat Cincinnati, 70-61, at the Bradley Center to win the Conference USA regular-season championship. Dwyane had 26 points, 10 rebounds, and five assists.\\r\\nSelected 5th overall in the 2003 NBA draft by the Miami Heat, Wade quickly emerged as a productive player on a youthful Miami Heat team and averaged 16.2 points on 46.5% shooting with averages of 4.0 rebounds and 4.5 assists per game. Wade is one of only four Marquette University players to be drafted in the first round; his is the highest draft selection in school history.[12][13] After a 5ÿ15 start,[18] the Heat would gradually improve and finish 42ÿ40 to qualify for the NBA playoffs.[19] He further distinguished himself with outstanding performances in the playoffs,[13] particularly against the Indiana Pacers in the Eastern Conference Semi-finals. In the end, however, Wade's successful rookie season was somewhat overshadowed by the success of fellow rookies Carmelo Anthony and LeBron James. Wade did earn unanimous selection to the 2004 NBA All-Rookie Team,[13] and also finished third in rookie of the year voting (behind James and Anthony).[13] He was ranked in the top five among rookies in several major statistical categories, including second in field goal percentage, second in steals, third in scoring, fourth in assists, and fourth in minutes played.[13] In the playoffs Wade hit a game-winning shot in Game 1 of the Heat's first round series against the New Orleans Hornets. The Heat won the series 4ÿ3 and advanced to the second round to face the top-seeded and best record team in the NBA, the Indiana Pacers, in a very entertaining series that almost pushed the 61-win Pacers to the edge, though Miami would eventually lose the series in six games. He became the fourth rookie since the shot clock era began to lead his team in scoring and assist average in the postseason.[13]\\r\\nBefore the 2004ÿ05 season, Shaquille O'Neal was traded from the Los Angeles Lakers to the Heat. The following season, Miami improved by 17 games, from a 42ÿ40 record in the 2003ÿ04 season to an Eastern Conference-best 59ÿ23 record in the 2004ÿ05 season.[19] The league's coaches selected Wade to be a reserve in the 2005 All-Star Game. He scored 14 points in 24 minutes of play.\\r\\nIn the first round of the 2005 NBA Playoffs, Wade averaged 26.3 points, 8.8 assists, and 6.0 rebounds while maintaining a 50% field-goal percentage[13] as the Heat swept the New Jersey Nets.[20] Wade continued his high level of play in the second round by averaging 31 points, 7 rebounds, and 8 assists per game[13] as the Heat swept the Washington Wizards.[20] The Heat's playoff run was stopped by the Detroit Pistons, the previous season's champions, in 7 games in the Eastern Conference Finals. Wade scored 42 and 36 points in Games 2 and 3 respectively despite playing with sinusitis, the flu, and a knee strain. He also suffered a strained rib muscle in Game 5 of the Conference Finals that prevented him from playing in the series' sixth game[21] and limited him in the seventh. The Heat lost the series in the seventh game despite leading three games to two after the fifth game and holding a lead with three minutes remaining in Game 7.[20]\\r\\nBy the 2005ÿ06 season Wade had developed into one of the most prominent players in the NBA and was elected to his second All-Star Game, this time a starter. In the 2006 All-Star Game, Wade made the game-winning put-back off of the Philadelphia 76ers' Allen Iverson's missed shot, to lead the East to a 122ÿ120 victory over the West. He scored 20 points on 9/11 field goals in 30 minutes of play.[22] He finished the 2005ÿ06 regular season averaging 27.2 points, 6.7 assists, 5.7 rebounds, and 1.95 steals per game.[12]\\r\\nAgainst the Chicago Bulls in the first round of the 2006 NBA Playoffs, Wade shook off a few injuries that scared Heat fans, including a severely bruised hip in Game 5.[23] Returning late in the half, Wade resurrected his team by scoring 15 of his 28 points while suffering from intense pain, leading the Heat to the much-needed 3ÿ2 series lead. After this, Wade successfully led his team to the 2006 NBA Finals, despite suffering from flu-like symptoms in game 6 of the Eastern Conference Finals against the Detroit Pistons.[24] He put up a double-double with 14 points and 10 assists in that game, including an 8-point flurry to close out the third quarter that put the game out of reach.[24]\\r\\nIn his first trip to the NBA Finals, in which Miami faced off against the Dallas Mavericks, Wade had some especially memorable moments. His performance in games three, four, and five, in which he scored 42, 36, and 43 points,[25][26] respectively, helped bring the Heat back from a 0ÿ2 deficit to lead the series 3-2. In Game 3 Wade tied his career playoff high with 42 points and grabbed a career-high 13 rebounds.[27] Fifteen of his 42 points came in the fourth quarter, in which the Heat erased a 13-point deficit over the final 6:29 with a 22ÿ7 run which included a go-ahead jumper by NBA veteran Gary Payton that sealed the win.[28] The Heat went on to win Game 6 behind Wade's 36 points, taking the series 4ÿ2, and Wade was presented with the Finals MVP trophy.[29] He became the fifth youngest player in NBA history to capture NBA Finals MVP honors and recorded the third highest scoring average by a player in his first NBA Finals with 34.7 points per game.[13][30] His 33.8 PER in the NBA finals was ranked by ESPN's John Hollinger as the greatest Finals performance since the NBA-ABA merger.[31]\\r\\nIn the 2006ÿ07 season, Wade missed a total of 31 games due to injury. He was elected to his third straight All-Star Game and received All-NBA honors. He became the first guard to earn All-NBA honors after missing at least 31 games in a season since Pete Maravich of the Utah Jazz earned Second Team honors during the 1977ÿ78 season.[13] Despite Wade's play, the Heat struggled early in the season with injuries and were 20ÿ25 on February 1, 2007.[32] But with Shaquille O'Neal healthy and Pat Riley returning to the bench after undergoing hip and knee surgeries respectively,[33] the Heat seemed poised to surge into the second half of the season.[34] However, during a game against the Houston Rockets on February 21, 2007, while attempting to steal the ball from Shane Battier, Wade dislocated his left shoulder and was assisted off the court in a wheelchair.[35] After the injury, he was left with the decision to either rehabilitate the shoulder or undergo season-ending surgery.[36] Wade later announced that he would put off the surgery and rehabilitate his shoulder with the intention of rejoining the team in time for the playoffs.[37] After missing 23 games to recover from the injury, Wade returned to the active roster in a game against the Charlotte Bobcats. Sporting a black sleeve to help protect his dislocated left shoulder, Wade played 27?minutes and recorded 12 points and 8 assists, in an 111ÿ103 overtime loss.[38] For the season, Wade averaged 27.4 points, 7.5 assists, 4.7 rebounds, and 2.1 steals per game shooting 50% from the field, and finished the season as the NBA's leader in PER (Player efficiency rating).[39]\\r\\nIn the playoffs, Wade averaged 23.5 points, 6.3 assists, and 4.8 rebounds per game, as the Heat were swept in the first round by the Chicago Bulls.[40] Following the playoffs, Wade underwent a pair of successful surgeries to repair his dislocated left shoulder and left knee. The knee ailment, commonly called \\"jumper's knee\\", prevented Wade from joining USA Basketball in the Olympic Qualifying Tournament over the summer.[41]\\r\\nAfter missing the Tournament of Americas Olympic Qualifiers over the summer, Miami's eight pre-season games and first seven regular season games to recover from off-season left knee and left shoulder surgeries, Wade made his first appearance of the 2007ÿ08 season on November 14, 2007.[42] Battling pain in his left knee throughout the season,[43] Wade was elected to his fourth consecutive All-Star Game appearance.[44] However, with the Heat holding the worst record in the NBA and Wade still experiencing problems in his left knee, Heat coach Pat Riley announced Wade would miss the final 21 games of the season to undergo OssaTron treatment on his left knee.[45] Wade averaged 24.6 points, 6.9 assists, 4.2 rebounds, and 1.7 steals per game for the season.[39]\\r\\nAfter undergoing months of rehabilitation on his left knee and helping the U.S. Olympic team win a gold medal at the 2008 Olympics, in which he led the team in scoring, Wade returned to the starting lineup at the start of the 2008ÿ09 season.[46][47] Early in the season, Wade became the second player in NBA history to tally at least 40 points, 10 assists and five blocked shots in a game since Alvan Adams did so in the 1976ÿ77 season.[48] With a healthy Wade leading the league in scoring and the Heat making a push for a playoff position, Wade was elected to his fifth consecutive All-Star game appearance.[49]\\r\\nFollowing the All-Star game, Wade recorded 50 points on 56.6% shooting and added 5 rebounds and 5 assists in a blow-out loss against the Orlando Magic.[50] Wade became the fourth player in NBA history to score at least 50 points while his team lost by at least 20 in a game.[50] The following game, Wade recorded a career-high 16 assists and added 31 points and 7 rebounds in a 103ÿ91 win against the Detroit Pistons.[51] Wade became the second player to record 15 or more assists after scoring at least 50 points since Wilt Chamberlain did so in 1968.[52] Two games later, Wade tied a franchise record with 24 points in the fourth quarter, as he led the Heat back from a 15-point deficit in the final nine minutes of the quarter to secure a 120ÿ115 win over the New York Knicks.[53] For the game, Wade recorded 46 points on 55% field goal shooting, 10 assists, 8 rebounds, 4 steals and 3 blocks.[53] Wade followed the performance with a second consecutive 40-point game against the Cleveland Cavaliers.[54] Playing against his Eastern Conference rival and good friend, LeBron James, Wade registered 41 points on 53% shooting, 9 assists, 7 steals, 7 rebounds and one block as the Heat lost 107ÿ100.[54] The following game, in former teammate Shaquille O'Neal's return to Miami since being traded, Wade tied a career-high with 16 assists and added 35 points on 62% shooting, 6 rebounds, a steal and a block, as the Heat defeated the Phoenix Suns 135ÿ129.[55] Wade became the only player in Heat history to have multiple games with at least 30 points and 15 assists.[55] Less than a week later, Wade tied his franchise record with his 78th consecutive game of scoring in double figures in a double overtime thriller against the Chicago Bulls, in which he scored the game-winning three-point basket to secure a 130ÿ127 win.[56] Wade finished with 48 points on 71.4% shooting, 12 assists, 6 rebounds, 4 steals and 3 blocks in 50 minutes.[56] According to the Elias Sports Bureau, Wade joined Wilt Chamberlain as the only other player in NBA history to score that many points and have that many assists in a game, while having as high of a field goal percentage.[57] Two games later, Wade surpassed Alonzo Mourning and became the Heat's all-time leading scorer in a triple overtime classic against the Utah Jazz.[58] Wade finished with 50 points, 10 rebounds, 9 assists, 4 steals, and 2 blocks in a 140ÿ129 win.[58]\\r\\nDuring the season, Wade became the first player in NBA history to accumulate at least 2,000 points, 500 assists, 100 steals, and 100 blocks in a season and is the first player of 6?ft. 5 in. or shorter to register at least 100 blocks in a season.[59][60] Wade also became just the fifth player in NBA history to reach 2,000 points, 500 assists, and 150 steals in a season.[61] After a 97ÿ92 win against the Charlotte Bobcats, Wade helped the Heat clinch a playoff berth and become only the second team in NBA History to reach the postseason after winning 15 or fewer games the year before.[62] In a 122ÿ105 win against the New York Knicks, Wade recorded a career-high 55 points on 63% field goal shooting and added 9 rebounds and 4 assists.[63] Wade recorded 50 points through three quarters and was pulled out of the game while he was one point shy of eclipsing the franchise record of 56 points set by Glen Rice.[63] For the season, Wade averaged a league-high 30.2 points per game, earning his first NBA Scoring Title, and added 7.5 assists, 5.0 rebounds, 2.2 steals, and 1.3 blocks per game.[39] Wade finished the season with higher point, assist, steal and block averages than LeBron James and Kobe Bryant, who both finished ahead of Wade in the MVP race.\\r\\nOn November 1, in just his third game of the 2009ÿ10 season Wade recorded his 10,000th career point in a 95ÿ87 win against the Chicago Bulls.[64] On November 12 against the Cleveland Cavaliers, Wade made a spectacular dunk over Anderson Varej?o, considered by many to be one of the greatest of the season until then. LeBron James himself described the dunk as \\"great, probably top 10 all-time\\".[65] Two days later against the New Jersey Nets, with the Heat down by two in the final seconds, Wade hit a clutch three-point shot, giving the Heat the win by one point, 81ÿ80.[66] On January 6, Wade scored a season-high 44 points in an overtime loss against the Boston Celtics, the most points scored by a player in a losing effort in the season until that point.[67] On January 21, Wade was selected to play for the East in the 2010 NBA All-Star Game, which was his sixth overall All-Star appearance.[68] Wade was named the game's MVP after recording 28 points, 11 assists, 5 steals and 6 rebounds.[69]\\r\\nIn just his second game back from the All-Star Game on February 17, Wade strained his calf in the first quarter. He left the game with 8 points in 8 minutes of play, ending his personal and also Heat's franchise record streak of 148 consecutive games with at least 10 points.[70] On April 2, Wade was named Eastern Conference Player of the Month and Player of the Week twice for his play in the month of March, leading the Heat to a 12ÿ3, the team's best record since March 2006. It was his first Player of the Month award of the season and 5th of his career. He averaged 26.9 and 7.5 assists per game, which both ranked third in the Eastern Conference, and 2.3 steals per game, which ranked first. Wade recorded six 30 points games and had six double-doubles in the month, including a season-high 14 assists in an overtime win against the Los Angeles Lakers on March 4.[71]\\r\\nFor the season, Wade averaged 26.6 points on 47.6% field goal shooting, 6.5 assists, 4.8 rebounds, 1.8 steals and 1.1 blocks per game, while leading his team to a 47ÿ35 record, clinching the fifth seed in the NBA Playoffs.[39] In the first round, with the Heat facing a sweep against the Boston Celtics, Wade recorded a career playoff-high and also franchise record 46 points, outscoring the entire Celtics team in the 4th quarter with 19 points versus 15 by Boston.[72] It was also Wade's sixth career playoff game with at least 40 points scored.[39] Despite averaging 33.2 points on 56.4% shooting, 6.8 assists, 5.6 rebounds, 1.6 steals and 1.6 blocks, Wade and the Heat would lose to Boston in five games.[73]\\r\\nDuring the off-season, Miami-Dade County commissioners voted unanimously to rename the county \\"Miami-Wade County\\" for one week from July 1ÿ7, 2010 in Wade's honor and to try and convince Wade to stay in Miami and sign with the Heat.[74] On July 7, it was announced that Wade would be re-signing with the Miami Heat, along with former Toronto Raptor Chris Bosh.[75] The following day, LeBron James announced he would be joining the Heat to play with Wade and Bosh, causing a stir in the media and among fans.[76] The deals were officially announced on July 10; Bosh and James arrived via sign-and-trade deals.[77] The Heat finished with a 58-24 record in the first year of the Big 3 Era and earned the second seed in the Eastern Conference. For the season, Wade averaged 25.5 points, 6.4 rebounds, 4.6 assists, and 1.5 steals per game, shooting 50% from the field. After defeating the Philadelphia 76ers, Boston Celtics, and Chicago Bulls, the Heat reached the Finals but lost to the Dallas Mavericks in six games. Wade averaged 26.5 points, 7 rebounds and 5.2 assists per game for the NBA Finals and 24.5 points, 7.1 rebounds and 4.4 for the entire playoffs.[78] Prior to the beginning of the 2011ÿ12 NBA season, Bosh in 2012 opined Wade should take the last second shot instead of Bosh or James to win or lose a game based on Wade's past success.[79]\\r\\nOn February 26, 2012, at the All-Star Game Wade recorded what was only the third triple-double in the history of the contest, posting 24 points, 10 rebounds, and 10 assists, joining Michael Jordan and LeBron James as the only players ever to record the prestigious stat (at the 1997 and 2011 games respectively). On March 10, 2012, Wade made the game-winning shot against the Indiana Pacers, giving the Heat a 93ÿ91 overtime win. Wade finished the season averaging 22.1 points, 4.8 assists, 4.6 rebounds, and 1.7 steals per game. In the playoffs, the Heat defeated the New York Knicks in 5 games in the first round, then defeated the Indiana Pacers in 6 games in the second round. Wade heated up in Game 6 of the second round, recording 41 points and 10 rebounds.[80] The Celtics took the Heat to seven games in the Eastern Conference Finals, but the Heat prevailed and advanced to the NBA Finals. They lost to the Oklahoma City Thunder in Game 1 of the finals but won the next four games, and Wade secured his second NBA title. Wade averaged 22.6 points per game in the series. The Heat became the first team in NBA history to win a championship after trailing in three different playoff series.\\r\\nBefore the start of the 2012ÿ13 NBA season, Wade underwent surgery due to a left knee injury. He missed the 2012 Summer Olympics.[81][82] While Wade missed the Heat's first pre-season game against the Atlanta Hawks, he returned in time for the Heat's second pre-season game against the Los Angeles Clippers, which was held at the MasterCard Center in Beijing, China. Miami won the game 94ÿ80.[83][84] On December 26, 2012, during an away game against the Charlotte Bobcats, Wade kicked guard Ramon Sessions in the groin. The following day, Wade was suspended by the NBA for one game.[85] Wade finished the 2012ÿ2013 season with averages of 21.2 points, 5 rebounds and 5.1 assists per game.\\r\\nIn the playoffs, injuries limited Wade to a career-low scoring average of 15.9 points per game, but he upped his average to 19.6 points a game during the NBA Finals against the San Antonio Spurs. After the teams split the first two games in Miami, the Spurs blew out the Heat in game 3 to take a 2-1 series lead. In game 4, Wade scored 32 points on 56 percent shooting to go with 6 steals as the Heat defeated the Spurs 109-93. The Spurs would bounce back in game 5 despite Wade's 25 points and 10 assists. Wade scored 14 points in Miami's overtime win in game 6, followed by 23 points and 10 rebounds in game 7 as the Heat clinched their second straight championship and Wade's third title.[86][87]\\r\\nIn the 2013ÿ14 season, Wade played in 54 games due to injury and the team's decision to rest him during back-to-back games. Wade averaged 19 points per game and posted a career-high 54 percent field goal percentage, and had notable games in victories against elite teams such as a 32-point outing against the Pacers on November 7 and 29 points against the Los Angeles Clippers on December 18. In the playoffs, the team increased Wade's minutes per game, noted by a 28-point performance in the closing game of Miami's second-round victory over the Brooklyn Nets and a 23-point outing in a crucial game 2 road victory against Indiana in the Eastern Finals. The Heat would go on to win the series in six games, advancing to their fourth straight NBA Finals. Wade averaged 19.1 points a game during the playoffs on 52 percent shooting, his best percentage in a playoff run since 2010. The Heat would once again face the San Antonio Spurs in the 2014 NBA Finals. However, they would lose in five games.\\r\\nOn June 28, 2014, Wade and teammates James and Bosh all opted out of their contracts in order to cut costs with the intention of all re-signing.[88] James announced on his website on July 11 that he was returning to Cleveland after four successful seasons with Wade in Miami. Four days later, Wade re-signed with the Heat[89] and was later joined by a returning Bosh, Udonis Haslem, Chris Andersen and Mario Chalmers as well as former rivals Danny Granger and Luol Deng.\\r\\nAfter playing in the Heat's first eight games of the 2014ÿ15 season, Wade missed seven consecutive games due to a hamstring injury. He returned to action on November 30 against the New York Knicks to score a then season-high 27 points in an 88-79 win.[90] On December 17, despite Wade's season-high 42 points, the Heat were defeated 105-87 by the Utah Jazz.[91] He was named an All-Star for the 11th time, however, on February 11, he pulled out of the game due to another hamstring injury and was replaced by Kyle Korver.[92] The Heat finished the season with a 37-45 win/loss record, as Wade missed the post-season for just the second time in his career.\\r\\nOn June 29, 2015, Wade opted out of his contract with the Heat to become a free agent.[93] On July 10, 2015, he re-signed with the Heat once again to a one-year, $20 million contract.[94] Wade hit just seven shots from beyond the arc during the entire 2015ÿ16 regular season. However, the 2016 postseason saw a change in Wade's play. He converted on his first seven three-point shot attempts before missing his first one during a Game 3 loss to the Toronto Raptors in the conference semi-finals. According to Elias Sports Bureau, Wade had never made more than five three-pointers in a row during his career.[95]\\r\\nOn July 6, 2016, Wade announced, in a letter to Miami, that he had agreed to join the Chicago Bulls on a two-year deal worth $47.5 million.[96][97][98][99] Wade said he felt unwanted and under-appreciated by Heat president Pat Riley, and noted that his relationship with Riley was in tatters by the end of negotiations.[100] On July 15, he officially signed with the Bulls.[101] He made his debut for the Bulls in their season opener on October 27, scoring 22 points with four made three-pointers in a 105ÿ99 win over the Boston Celtics.[102] The next day, Wade was fined $25,000 for making a throat slash gesture after a game-sealing three-point shot.[103] On November 4, he scored 35 points on 12-of-20 shooting in a 117ÿ104 loss to the New York Knicks. He made five three-pointers to give him 10 in five games in 2016ÿ17; he had a total of seven in 2015ÿ16.[104] On January 21, 2017, he had 30 points and two key steals in the final minute of the Bulls' 102ÿ99 win over the Sacramento Kings.[105] After questioning the desire of the team's younger players following a loss to the Atlanta Hawks on January 25, Wade was fined and held out of the starting lineup against Miami on January 27 as punishment.[106] On March 16, 2017, Wade underwent an MRI for a right elbow injury suffered in the fourth quarter of the Bulls' game against the Memphis Grizzlies the previous night. The results of the MRI showed a sprain and a small fracture in the elbow.[107] Wade returned to action on April 8, 2017, scoring 14 points in a 107ÿ106 loss to the Brooklyn Nets.[108]\\r\\nWade was a member of the 2004 US Olympics team with fellow NBA All-Stars LeBron James and Carmelo Anthony. The team competed in the 2006 FIBA World Championship in Japan, in which Wade averaged 19.3 points per game.[109] The team won a bronze medal, which disappointed many USA fans who had hoped for a return to the days of the original \\"Dream Team\\".[110][111][112] Wade was named to the USA Men's Basketball National Team from 2006 to 2008. He was named co-captain of the 2006 team, along with James and Anthony.[113] In 2007, due to injury, Wade was unable to compete at the Tournament of Americas Olympic Qualifiers, where the United States compiled a 10ÿ0 record and qualified for the 2008 Olympics in Beijing, China.[114]\\r\\nAt the 2008 Olympics, the United States went unbeaten and earned gold medal honors, defeating the 2006 World Champion Spain in the final game. Wade led the team in scoring throughout the tournament and tallied a game-high 27 points in 27 minutes on 75% field goal shooting and added 4 steals, 2 assists and 2 rebounds in the game.[115] For the tournament, he averaged a team-high 16 points in 18 minutes on 67% field goal shooting, 4 rebounds, 2 assists and 2.3 steals, as the United States lived up to their Redeem Team moniker and captured gold medal honors for the first time since 2000.[115][116]\\r\\nOn June 28, 2012, it was reported that Wade would miss the 2012 Olympics in London because of knee surgery.[117]\\r\\nStanding at 6 feet 4 inches tall (1.93 m) and weighing 220 pounds (100?kg), Wade is a shooting guard that is also capable of playing point guard as he did during his rookie season and in subsequent seasons with smaller lineups. On offense, he has established himself as one of the quickest and most difficult players to guard, as well as one of the best slashers in the NBA. Wade's signature one-two step allows him to dash past bigger defenders and occasionally get the extra foul shot.[118] Wade is able to get to the free throw line consistently; he ranked first in free-throw attempts per 48?minutes in 2004ÿ05 and again in the 2006ÿ07 season. He has proven himself an unselfish player, averaging 6.1 assists per game throughout his career.[12] After winning the NBA Finals MVP Award in 2006, Wade developed a reputation as one of the premier clutch players in the NBA.[119] He has gained a reputation for being capable of hitting game-winning baskets and potential game-winning free throws.\\r\\nDavid Thorpe, an athletic trainer who runs a training center for NBA players in the offseason, also cites Wade's developing post up game as one of his strengths.[120] \\"Watching Wade operate on the left block is literally like watching old footage of MJ (Michael Jordan)\\", comments Thorpe.[120] Thorpe goes on to say that Wade's best moves from the post are his turnaround jump shot,[120] double pivot,[120] and what Thorpe terms as a \\"freeze fake\\",[121] a pump fake Wade uses to get his opponent to jump, so that he can then drive around him to the basket.[121] The main weakness cited in Wade's ability is his lack of three-point range; he has averaged .289 on three-point field goal attempts for his career.[12]\\r\\nWade is best known for his ability to convert difficult lay-ups, even after hard mid-air collisions with larger defenders.[118] As crowd pleasing as his high-flying style of basketball may be, some have expressed concerns over the dangers of playing in this manner,[118] as Wade has already hurt his knees and wrists after mid-air collisions with larger players. Wade has also established himself on defense for his ability to block shots and accumulate steals.[122] He became the NBA's all-time leader in blocks for players listed 6'4\\" (193?cm) and under, which he achieved in only 679 games, over 400 games less than the previous record holder: Dennis Johnson (1100).[123]\\r\\nDuring the big three era, Wade has seen his overall offensive production decrease, a result of sharing the offense with LeBron James and Chris Bosh, but has succeeded at overall shooting a greater percentage despite taking fewer shots and playing more off the ball.[citation needed]\\r\\nWade married his high school girlfriend Siohvaughn Funches in 2002. He filed for a divorce in 2007, which was granted in 2010 after a lengthy and acrimonious court battle.[125] In 2011, Wade was granted sole custody of his two sons with Funches,[126] Zaire Blessing Dwyane Wade (born February 4, 2002) and Zion Malachi Airamis Wade (born May 29, 2007).[127] Wade also raises a nephew, Dahveon (born 2002), who is the son of Wade's sister Deanna.[128][129] Wade began dating actress Gabrielle Union in 2009.[130][131] According to Wade, he and Union briefly split up at some point early in 2013 due to career demands.[129] During that time, Wade and longtime friend Aja Metoyer conceived a son, Xavier Zechariah Wade (born November 10, 2013).[132][133] Wade and Union became engaged in December 2013,[134] and married on August 30, 2014, in Miami.[135]\\r\\nWade has spoken out about violence in Chicago, in part due to his own family's experience with it. His nephew, Darin Johnson, was shot twice in the leg in 2012 but recovered. Wade's first cousin, 32-year-old Nykea Aldridge, was fatally shot on the afternoon of August 26, 2016, while pushing a stroller in Chicago's Parkway Gardens, when two men exchanged gunfire nearby, hitting her in the arm and the head. A mother of four, Aldridge was pronounced dead at the hospital. The child in the stroller was not hurt. Wade, who had recently spoken publicly the area's problem of violence, reacted by tweeting, \\"Another act of senseless gun violence. 4 kids lost their mom for NO REASON. Unreal. #EnoughIsEnough\\".[136]\\r\\nWade's nicknames include D-Wade and Flash, which was given to him by former teammate Shaquille O'Neal who would sing, \\"He's the greatest in the Universe\\", in reference to the Queen song of the same name from the 1980 film Flash Gordon.[137][138] The Heat's 2005 NBA Playoffs run and Wade's performances with Shaquille O'Neal hampered by injury, led to an explosion of media attention and rapid increase in Wade's popularity. During those playoffs, Wade's jersey became the top selling jersey in the league and remained so for nearly two years.[139] After the Heat's success and Wade's memorable performances during the 2006 NBA Playoffs, Wade was further elevated into the public's eye and appeared on several talk shows, including Late Show with David Letterman and Live with Regis and Kelly.[140] He also made a guest star appearance on Disney Channel's Austin & Ally as himself, who is an obsessed fan of Austin Moon.[141]\\r\\nWade has been featured in a number of magazine articles and publications. In 2005, he was featured on People's 50 Most Beautiful People,[142] and in 2006 he was named the NBA's best-dressed player by GQ Magazine.[143] In 2007, Esquire named him to their 4th annual Best Dressed Men in the World list for the second straight year.[144][145] Wade has endorsement deals with companies such as Gatorade, Lincoln, Staples, Sean John, T-Mobile (his TV commercials feature him paired with NBA legend Charles Barkley), and Topps.[146] He had his own line of shoes with Converse named \\"The Wade\\" and a series of Sidekick phones known as the D-Wade Edition with T-Mobile.[147][148] During the 2009ÿ10 season, Wade switched from Converse to Nike's Jordan Brand.[149] Wade noted that the partnership ended on good terms, stating, \\"When I came into the NBA, I didn't have a lot of exposure and Converse gave me an opportunity to head a brand and be the face of a brand. I'm really thankful for six long, good years. I've gotten five shoes out of the deal and my dream came true at the Converse brand because they put my name on a pair of sneakers.\\"[149] Wade was hand-chosen by Michael Jordan and debuted the Air Jordan 2010 during the 2010 NBA All-Star break. During the 2011 NBA Playoffs, Wade debuted his first signature shoe for the Jordan Brand, joining fellow players Carmelo Anthony and Chris Paul, who have their own signature shoes for the brand. After his Jordan Brand contract expired in 2012, Wade signed with the Chinese athletic brand Li-Ning.[150]\\r\\nWade is well known for his philanthropic involvement in various organizations. In 2003, he founded The Wade's World Foundation, which provides support to community-based organizations that promote education, health, and social skills for children in at-risk situations.[151] He hosts a variety of community outreach programs in Chicago and South Florida.[151] In 2008, he announced his partnership with former teammate Alonzo Mourning's charitable foundation and co-hosted ZO's Summer Groove, an annual summer event.[152][153] On December 24, 2008, Wade purchased a new home for a South Florida woman whose nephew accidentally burned down the family home.[154] In addition, Wade donated some furnishings, clothing, and gifts to the family for the holiday.[154]\\r\\nAfter breaking his own Miami Heat single-season scoring record, Wade gave the jersey he wore in that night's victory to 8-year-old Michael Stolzenberg, an avid Heat fan that had his hands and feet removed surgically due to a bacterial infection.[155] Wade stated that he knew Stolzenberg previously and wished to add to his collection of Heat memorabilia.[155] Wade has been known for visiting other sick children, usually in private to avoid placing himself in the media spotlight.[155]\\r\\nIn September 2009, Wade donated money from his foundation to keep the Robbins, Illinois public library from having to shut down.[156] He handed the library director Priscilla Coatney a $25,000 check in order to resurrect the building, which brought Coatney to tears. He called the donation a \\"small contribution\\", and reminisced about the difficult experiences he faced as a child, stating that he sometimes did not know how he would find his next meal.[157][158] In January 2010, Wade and Alonzo Mourning co-founded The Athletes Relief Fund for Haiti\\",[159] which raised money to help the victims of the 2010 Haiti earthquake. In the three days since the fund began soliciting donations from athletes, Wade announced that the \\"Athletes Relief Fund for Haiti\\" had already raised over $800,000.[159] Wade stated, \\"I expected nothing less from my friends and colleagues in the sports community, our commitment to this cause knows no bounds, and we will continue to accept any and all donations throughout the days ahead.\\"[159] Wade is also an avid supporter of St. Jude Children's Research Hospital and has served as an Ambassador for their Hoops for St. Jude basketball initiative.[160]\\r\\nWade is a devout Christian and chose the number 3 because it represents the Holy Trinity.[161][162] He tithes 10% of his salary to a church in Chicago.[7] His mother, Jolinda, strengthened her ties to Christianity in 2001 after years of drug abuse and dealing. She served as a minister during her final prison sentence in 2002 and 2003. She was ordained as a Baptist minister in January 2007 and formed the non-denominational Temple of Praise Binding and Loosing Ministry in Chicago. In May 2008, Wade purchased a church building for his mother's ministry.[163]","input":"Where did dwyane wade play high school basketball?"},{"output":"in an unnamed Italian city at carnival time in an unspecified year","context":"\\"The Cask of Amontillado\\" (sometimes spelled \\"The Casque of Amontillado\\" [a.mon.ti.??a.eo]) is a short story by Edgar Allan Poe, first published in the November 1846 issue of Godey's Lady's Book. The story, set in an unnamed Italian city at carnival time in an unspecified year, is about a man taking fatal revenge on a friend who, he believes, has insulted him. Like several of Poe's stories, and in keeping with the 19th-century fascination with the subject, the narrative revolves around a person being buried alive ÿ in this case, by immurement. As in \\"The Black Cat\\" and \\"The Tell-Tale Heart\\", Poe conveys the story from the murderer's perspective.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe story's narrator, Montresor, tells an unspecified person, who knows him very well, of the day he took his revenge on Fortunato (Italian for \\"the fortunate one\\"), a fellow nobleman. Angry over numerous injuries and some unspecified insult, Montresor plots to murder his \\"friend\\" during Carnival, while the man is drunk, dizzy, and wearing a jester's motley.\\r\\nMontresor lures Fortunato into a private wine-tasting excursion by telling him he has obtained a pipe (about 130 gallons,[1] 492 litres) of what he believes to be a rare vintage of Amontillado. He proposes obtaining confirmation of the pipe's contents by inviting a fellow wine aficionado, Luchesi, for a private tasting. Montresor knows Fortunato will not be able to resist demonstrating his discerning palate for wine and will insist that he taste the amontillado rather than Luchesi who, as he claims, \\"cannot tell Amontillado from Sherry\\". Fortunato goes with Montresor to the wine cellars of the latter's palazzo, where they wander in the catacombs. Montresor offers wine (first Medoc, then De Grave) to Fortunato in order to keep him inebriated. Montresor warns Fortunato, who has a bad cough, of the dampness, and suggests they go back, but Fortunato insists on continuing, claiming that \\"[he] shall not die of a cough\\". During their walk, Montresor mentions his family coat of arms: a golden foot in a blue background crushing a snake whose fangs are embedded in the foot's heel, with the motto Nemo me impune lacessit (\\"No one attacks me with impunity\\").\\r\\nAt one point, Fortunato makes an elaborate, grotesque gesture with an upraised wine bottle. When Montresor appears not to recognize the gesture, Fortunato asks, \\"You are not of the masons?\\" Montresor says he is, and when Fortunato, disbelieving, requests a sign, Montresor displays a trowel he had been hiding. When they come to a niche, Montresor tells his victim that the Amontillado is within. Fortunato enters drunk and unsuspecting and therefore, does not resist as Montresor quickly chains him to the wall. Montresor then declares that, since Fortunato won't go back, Montresor must \\"positively leave\\" him there.\\r\\nMontresor reveals brick and mortar, previously hidden among the bones nearby, and proceeds to wall up the niche using his trowel, entombing his friend alive. At first, Fortunato, who sobers up faster than Montresor anticipated, shakes the chains, trying to escape. Fortunato then screams for help, but Montresor mocks his cries, knowing nobody can hear them. Fortunato laughs weakly and tries to pretend that he is the subject of a joke and that people will be waiting for him (including the Lady Fortunato). As Montresor finishes the topmost row of stones, Fortunato wails, \\"For the love of God, Montresor!\\" to which Montresor replies, \\"Yes, for the love of God!\\" He listens for a reply but hears only the jester's bells ringing. Before placing the last stone, he drops a burning torch through the gap. He claims that he feels sick at heart, but dismisses this reaction as an effect of the dampness of the catacombs.\\r\\nIn the last few sentences, Montresor reveals that 50 years later, Fortunato's body still hangs from its chains in the niche where he left it. The murderer concludes: In pace requiescat! (\\"May he rest in peace!\\").\\r\\n\\"The Cask of Amontillado\\" was first published in the November 1846 issue of Godey's Lady's Book,[2] which was, at the time, the most popular periodical in America.[3] The story was only published one additional time during Poe's life.[4]\\r\\nAlthough the subject matter of Poe's story is a murder, \\"The Cask of Amontillado\\" is not a tale of detection like \\"The Murders in the Rue Morgue\\" or \\"The Purloined Letter\\"; there is no investigation of Montresor's crime and the criminal himself explains how he committed the murder. The mystery in \\"The Cask of Amontillado\\" is in Montresor's motive for murder. Without a detective in the story, it is up to the reader to solve the mystery.[5]\\r\\nMontresor never specifies his motive beyond the vague \\"thousand injuries\\" and \\"when he ventured upon insult\\" to which he refers. Some context is provided, including Montresor's observation that his family once was great (but no longer so), and Fortunato's belittling remarks about Montresor's exclusion from Freemasonry. Many commentators conclude that, lacking significant reason, Montresor must be insane, though even this is questionable because of the intricate details of the plot.[5]\\r\\nThere is also evidence that Montresor is almost as clueless about his motive for revenge as his victim.[6] In his recounting of the murder, Montresor notes, \\"A wrong is unredressed when retribution overtakes its redresser. It is equally unredressed when the avenger fails to make himself felt as such to him who has done the wrong\\". After Fortunato is chained to the wall and nearly entombed alive, Montresor merely mocks and mimics him, rather than disclosing to Fortunato the reasons behind his exacting revenge. Montresor may not have been entirely certain of the exact nature of the insults for which he expected Fortunato to atone.[6]\\r\\nAdditional scrutiny into the vague injuries and insults may have to do with a simple matter of Montresor's pride and not any specific words from Fortunato.[7] Montresor comes from an established family. His house had once been noble and respected, but has fallen slightly in status. Fortunato, as his name would seem to indicate, has been blessed with good fortune and wealth and is, therefore, viewed as unrefined by Montresor; however, this lack of refinement has not stopped Fortunato from surpassing Montresor in society, which could very well be the \\"insult\\" motive for Montresor's revenge.[7]\\r\\nThere is indication that Montresor blames his unhappiness and loss of respect and dignity within society on Fortunato.[8] It is easy to ascertain that Fortunato is a Freemason, while Montresor is not, which could be the source of Fortunato's recent ascension into upper class society. Montresor even imparts this blame to Fortunato when he states, \\"You are rich, respected, admired, beloved; you are happy, as once I was\\". This interchanging of fortunes is a suggestion that, since the names Montresor and Fortunato mirror one another, there is a psychological reciprocal identification between victim and executioner.[8] This identification reciprocity is further suggested when one takes into consideration that Montresor entombs Fortunato in the Montresor family catacombs rather than dispatching him elsewhere in the city amidst the chaos of the Carnival. It is with this converging of the two characters that one is able to see the larger symbolism of the Montresor crest ÿ the foot steps on the serpent while the serpent forever has his fangs embedded in the heel.[8]\\r\\nUpon further investigation into the true nature of character, double meaning can be derived from the Montresor crest.[6] It is the position of Montresor to view himself as the owner of the righteous foot that is crushing the insolent Fortunato serpent and his \\"thousand injuries\\" that progress into insult. A more allegoric meaning of Poe's places the actors in reverse.[6] The blind oaf Fortunato has unintentionally stepped upon the snake in the grass ÿ the sneaky and cunning Montresor ÿ who, as a reward for this accidental bruising, sinks his fangs deep into the heel of his offender, forever linking them in a form of mutual existence.[6]\\r\\nThough Fortunato is presented as a connoisseur of fine wine, L. Moffitt Cecil of Texas Christian University argues that his actions in the story make that assumption questionable. For example, Fortunato comments on another nobleman being unable to distinguish amontillado from sherry when amontillado is in fact a type of sherry, and treats De Grave, an expensive French wine, with very little regard by drinking it in a single gulp. Cecil also states that a true wine connoisseur would never sample wine while intoxicated and describes Fortunato as merely an alcoholic. Cecil also suggests that some people might feel Fortunato deserved to be buried alive for wasting a bottle of fine wine.[1]\\r\\nPoe may have known bricklaying through personal experience. Many periods in Poe's life lack significant biographical details, including what he did after leaving the Southern Literary Messenger in 1837.[9] Poe biographer John H. Ingram wrote to Sarah Helen Whitman that someone named \\"Allen\\" said that Poe worked \\"in the brickyard 'late in the fall of 1834'\\". This source has been identified as Robert T. P. Allen, a fellow West Point student during Poe's time there.[10]\\r\\nImmurement, a form of imprisonment, usually for life, in which a person is placed within an enclosed space with no exit, is featured in other works by Poe, including \\"The Fall of the House of Usher\\", \\"The Premature Burial\\", \\"The Black Cat\\", and \\"Berenice\\".\\r\\nAn apocryphal legend holds that the inspiration for \\"The Cask of Amontillado\\" came from a story Poe had heard at Castle Island (South Boston), Massachusetts, when he was a private Fort Independence in 1827.[11] According to this legend, while stationed at Castle Island in 1827 he saw a monument to Lieutenant Robert Massie. Massie had been killed in a sword duel on Christmas Day 1817 by Lieutenant Gustavus Drane, following a dispute during a card game.[12] According to the legend, other soldiers then took revenge on Drane by getting him drunk, luring him into the dungeon, chaining him to a wall, and sealing him in a vault.[13] This version of Drane's demise is false; Drane was courtmartialled for the killing and acquitted,[12] and lived until 1846.[14] A report of a skeleton discovered on the island may be a confused remembering of Poe's major source, Joel Headley's \\"A Man Built in a Wall\\"[15], which recounts the author's seeing an immured skeleton in the wall of a church in Italy.[16] Headley's story includes details very similar to \\"The Cask of Amontillado\\"; in addition to walling an enemy into a hidden niche, the story details the careful placement of the bricks, the motive of revenge, and the victim's agonized moaning. Poe may have also seen similar themes in Honor de Balzac's \\"La Grande Bretche\\" (Democratic Review, November 1843) or his friend George Lippard's The Quaker City, or The Monks of Monk Hall (1845).[17] Poe may have borrowed Montresor's family motto Nemo me impune lacessit from James Fenimore Cooper, who used the line in The Last of the Mohicans (1826).[18]\\r\\nPoe wrote his tale, however, as a response to his personal rival Thomas Dunn English. Poe and English had several confrontations, usually revolving around literary caricatures of one another. Poe thought that one of English's writings went a bit too far, and successfully sued the other man's editors at The New York Mirror for libel in 1846.[19] That year English published a revenge-based novel called 1844, or, The Power of the S.F. Its plot was convoluted and difficult to follow, but made references to secret societies and ultimately had a main theme of revenge. It included a character named Marmaduke Hammerhead, the famous author of \\"The Black Crow\\", who uses phrases like \\"Nevermore\\" and \\"lost Lenore\\", referring to Poe's poem \\"The Raven\\". This parody of Poe was depicted as a drunkard, liar, and an abusive lover.\\r\\nPoe responded with \\"The Cask of Amontillado\\", using very specific references to English's novel. In Poe's story, for example, Fortunato makes reference to the secret society of Masons, similar to the secret society in 1844, and even makes a gesture similar to one portrayed in 1844 (it was a signal of distress). English had also used an image of a token with a hawk grasping a snake in its claws, similar to Montresor's coat of arms bearing a foot stomping on a snake ÿ though in this image, the snake is biting the heel. In fact, much of the scene of \\"The Cask of Amontillado\\" comes from a scene in 1844 that takes place in a subterranean vault. In the end, then, it is Poe who \\"punishes with impunity\\" by not taking credit for his own literary revenge and by crafting a concise tale (as opposed to a novel) with a singular effect, as he had suggested in his essay \\"The Philosophy of Composition\\".[20]\\r\\nPoe may have also been inspired, at least in part, by the Washingtonian movement, a fellowship that promoted temperance. The group was made up of reformed drinkers who tried to scare people into abstaining from alcohol. Poe may have made a promise to join the movement in 1843 after a bout of drinking with the hopes of gaining a political appointment. \\"The Cask of Amontillado\\" then may be a \\"dark temperance tale\\", meant to shock people into realizing the dangers of drinking.[21]\\r\\nPoe scholar Richard P. Benton has stated his belief that \\"Poe's protagonist is an Englished version of the French Montrsor\\" and has argued forcefully that Poe's model for Montresor \\"was Claude de Bourdeille, comte de Montrsor (Count of Montrsor), the 17th-century political conspirator in the entourage of King Louis XIII's weak-willed brother, Gaston d'Orlans\\".[22] The \\"noted intriguer and memoir-writer\\" was first linked to \\"The Cask of Amontillado\\" by Poe scholar Burton R. Pollin.[22][23]\\r\\nFurther inspiration for the method of Fortunato's murder comes from the fear of live burial. During the time period of this short story some coffins were given methods of alerting the outside in the event of live entombment. Items such as bells tied to the limbs of a corpse to signal the outside were not uncommon. This theme is evident in Fortunato's costume of a jester with bells upon his hat, and his situation of live entombment within the catacombs.[8]\\r\\n.","input":"What is the setting of the cast of amontillado?"},{"output":"the One Seneca Center","context":"This list of the tallest buildings in Buffalo ranks skyscrapers in Buffalo, New York by height.

On 29 May 1953, Hillary and Nepalese Sherpa mountaineer Tenzing Norgay became the first climbers confirmed to have reached the summit of Mount Everest. They were part of the ninth British expedition to Everest, led by John Hunt.\\r\\n\\r\\nHillary became interested in mountaineering while in secondary school. He made his first major climb in 1939, reaching the summit of Mount Ollivier. He served in the Royal New Zealand Air Force as a navigator during World War II. Prior to the Everest expedition, Hillary had been part of the British reconnaissance expedition to the mountain in 1951 as well as an unsuccessful attempt to climb Cho Oyu in 1952. As part of the Commonwealth Trans-Antarctic Expedition he reached the South Pole overland in 1958. He subsequently reached the North Pole, making him the first person to reach both poles and summit Everest.\\r\\n\\r\\nFollowing his ascent of Everest, Hillary devoted himself to assisting the Sherpa people of Nepal through the Himalayan Trust, which he established. His efforts are credited with the construction of many schools and hospitals in Nepal. From 1985 to 1988 he served as New Zealand's High Commissioner to India and Bangladesh and concurrently as Ambassador to Nepal. Hillary had numerous honours conferred upon him, including the Order of the Garter in 1995. Upon his death in 2008, he was given a state funeral in New Zealand.\\r\\n\\r\\nHillary was born to Percival Augustus and Gertrude (ne Clark) Hillary in Auckland, New Zealand, on 20 July 1919.[1][2] His father Percy had served at Gallipoli with the 15th (North Auckland) Regiment, and was discharged \\"medically unfit\\" from the Army in 1916; he had married Gertrude after his return to New Zealand. His grandparents had emigrated from Yorkshire to northern Wairoa in the mid-19th century.[3]\\r\\n\\r\\nHis family moved to Tuakau, south of Auckland, in 1920, after Percy was allocated eight acres (3.2 ha) of land there as a returned soldier.[2] Percy had been a journalist prewar, and soon became founding editor of the weekly Tuakau District News as well as an apiarist. Ed had a sister June (born 1917) and a brother Rex (born 1920).[4]\\r\\n\\r\\nHillary was educated at Tuakau Primary School and then Auckland Grammar School.[2] He finished primary school aged 11 or two years early, and at \\"Grammar\\"  achieved average marks.[5] His mother wanted him to go to a \\"good school\\" and he commuted by train, cycling to Tuakau station before 7 am and returning after 6 pm for 3? years (a one hour and 40 minutes journey each way) until the family moved to Remuera, Auckland in 1935, his last of four years at \\"Grammar\\".[6]\\r\\n\\r\\nHe was initially smaller than his peers and shy, and did not enjoy \\"Grammar\\", where commuting barred him from after-school activities. He grew to be 6?feet 2?inches (188?cm)[7] and gained confidence after taking up boxing. \\r\\n\\r\\nHe became interested in climbing when he was 16 following a 1935 school trip to Mount Ruapehu, after which he showed more interest in tramping than in studying and said he \\"wanted to see the world\\".[8] He then attended Auckland University College, and joined the Tramping Club there. But in 1938 \\"after two notably unsuccessful years studying mathematics and science\\" he gave up on formal education.[9]\\r\\n\\r\\nHe then became an apiarist (beekeeper) with his father and brother Rex; with 1600 hives to attend, thousands of 90 lb (41 kg) boxes of honey comb to handle, and 12 to 100 bee-stings daily.[9][1][10]. So he kept bees in summer, and concentrated on climbing in winter.[11] His father also edited the journal \\"The N.Z. Honeybee\\" and his mother Gertrude was famous for breeding and selling queen bees.[12][13][14]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1938 he went to hear Herbert Sutcliffe, the proponent of a life philosophy called \\"Radiant Living\\", with his family. The family all became foundation members, and his mother became its secretary in 1939. He went to Gisborne as Sutcliffs assistant, and in 1941 sat examinations to become a teacher of Radiant Living, getting a 100% pass mark. His test lecture was on \\"Inferiority ÿ cause and cure\\". He said of his five year association with the movement that \\"I learned to speak confidently from the platform; to think more freely on important topics; to mix more readily with a wide variety of people\\". Tenets included healthy eating (the salads that June took to university for lunch) and pacificism. He joined the Radiant Living Tramping Club, and further developed his love of the outdoors in the Waitakere Ranges.[15][16]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1939 he completed his first major climb, reaching the summit of Mount Ollivier, near Aoraki / Mount Cook in the Southern Alps.[2] Climbing brought new friends; Harry Ayres and George Lowe became \\"the first real friends I'd ever had\\". [17]\\r\\n\\r\\nAt the outbreak of World War II, Hillary applied to join the Royal New Zealand Air Force (RNZAF) but quickly withdrew the application, later writing that he was \\"harassed by my religious conscience\\".[18] In 1943, with the Japanese threat in the Pacific and the arrival of conscription, he joined the RNZAF as a navigator in No. 6 Squadron RNZAF and later No. 5 Squadron RNZAF on Catalina flying boats.[18][19] In 1945, he was sent to Fiji and to the Solomon Islands, where he was badly burnt in an accident.[18]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn January 1948, Hillary and others ascended the south ridge of Aoraki / Mount Cook, New Zealand's highest peak.[20]\\r\\nIn 1951 he was part of a British reconnaissance expedition to Everest led by Eric Shipton,[21] before joining the successful British attempt of 1953. In 1952, Hillary and George Lowe were part of the British team led by Shipton, that attempted Cho Oyu.[22] After that attempt failed due to the lack of route from the Nepal side, Hillary and Lowe crossed the Nup La pass into Tibet and reached the old Camp II, on the northern side, where all the previous expeditions had camped.[23]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1949, the long-standing climbing route to the summit of Everest was closed by Chinese-controlled Tibet. For the next several years, Nepal allowed only one or two expeditions per year.[25] A Swiss expedition (in which Tenzing took part) attempted to reach the summit in 1952, but was forced back by bad weather around 800 feet (240?m) below the summit.[26] In 1952 Hillary learned that he and Lowe had been invited by the Joint Himalayan Committee for the 1953 British attempt and immediately accepted.[27]\\r\\n\\r\\nShipton was named as leader but was replaced by Hunt. Hillary was immediately impressed by Hunt's energy and determination.[28] Hillary had intended to climb with Lowe, but Hunt named two teams for the ascent: Tom Bourdillon and Charles Evans; and Hillary and Tenzing.[29] Hillary, therefore, made a concerted effort to forge a working friendship with Tenzing.[28]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Hunt expedition totalled over 400 people, including 362 porters, 20 Sherpa guides, and 10,000 pounds (4,500?kg) of baggage.[30][31] Lowe supervised the preparation of the Lhotse Face, a huge and steep ice face, for climbing. Hillary forged a route through the treacherous Khumbu Icefall.[32][33]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe expedition set up base camp in March 1953 and, working slowly, set up its final camp at the South Col at 25,900 feet (7,890?m). On 26 May, Bourdillon and Evans attempted the climb but turned back when Evans' oxygen system failed. The pair had reached the South Summit, coming within 300 vertical feet (91 m) of the summit.[31][34] Hunt then directed Hillary and Tenzing to attempt the summit.[34]\\r\\n\\r\\nSnow and wind delayed them at the South Col for two days. They set out on 28 May with the support of Lowe, Alfred Gregory, and Ang Nyima.[35] The two pitched a tent at 27,900 feet (8,500?m) on 28 May, while their support group returned down the mountain.[36] On the following morning Hillary discovered that his boots had frozen solid outside the tent. He spent two hours warming them over a stove before he and Tenzing, wearing 30-pound (14?kg) packs, attempted the final ascent.[37] The final obstacle was the 40-foot (12?m) rock face now called \\"Hillary Step\\"; Hillary later wrote:\\r\\n\\r\\nI noticed a crack between the rock and the snow sticking to the East Face. I crawled inside and wriggled and jammed my way to the top?... Tenzing slowly joined me and we moved on. I chopped steps over bump after bump, wondering a little desperately where the top could be. Then I saw the ridge ahead dropped away to the north and above me on the right was a rounded snow dome. A few more whacks with my ice-axe and Tenzing and I stood on top of Everest.[38]\\r\\n\\r\\nTenzing later wrote that Hillary took the first step onto the summit and he followed. They reached Everest's 29,028?ft (8,848 m) summit?ÿ the highest point on earth?ÿ at 11:30?am.[1][39]\\r\\n\\r\\nThey spent about 15 minutes at the summit. Hillary took a photo of Tenzing posing with his ice-axe, but there is no photo of Hillary. BBC News attributed this to Tenzing's having never used a camera;[40][41] Tenzing's autobiography says that Hillary simply declined to have his picture taken.\\r\\nThey also took photos looking down the mountain.[41]\\r\\n\\r\\nTenzing left chocolates at the summit as an offering, and Hillary left a cross given to him by John Hunt.[42] Their descent was complicated by drifting snow which had covered their tracks. The first person they met was Lowe; Hillary said, \\"Well, George, we knocked the bastard off.\\"[7]\\r\\n\\r\\nThey returned to Kathmandu a few days later and learned that Hillary had already been appointed a Knight Commander of the Order of the British Empire and Hunt a Knight Bachelor.[43] News reached Britain on the day of Queen Elizabeth II's coronation, and the press called it a coronation gift.[44] \\r\\nThe 37 members of the party later received the Queen Elizabeth II Coronation Medal with mount everest expedition engraved along the rim.[45]\\r\\nIn addition to the knighting of Hillary and Hunt, Tenzing?ÿ ineligible for knighthood as a Nepalese citizen?ÿ received the George Medal.[46][47][48] Tenzing also received the Star of Nepal from King Tribhuvan.[49]\\r\\n\\r\\nHillary climbed ten other peaks in the Himalayas on further visits in 1956, 1960ÿ1961, and 1963ÿ1965.  He also reached the South Pole as part of the Commonwealth Trans-Antarctic Expedition, for which he led the New Zealand section, on 4 January 1958. His party was the first to reach the Pole overland since Amundsen in 1911 and Scott in 1912, and the first ever to do so using motor vehicles.[50]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1960 Hillary organized an expedition to search for the fabled abominable snowman.[51] Hillary was with the expedition for five months, although it lasted for ten.[52] No evidence of Yetis was found, instead footprints and tracks were proven to be from other causes. During the expedition, Hillary travelled to remote temples which contained \\"Yeti scalps\\"; however after bringing back three relics, two were shown to be from bears and one from a goat antelope.[53][54] Hillary said after the expedition: \\"The yeti is not a strange, superhuman creature as has been imagined. We have found rational explanations for most yeti phenomena\\".[55]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1962 he was a guest on the television game show What's My Line?; he stumped the panel, comprising Dorothy Kilgallen, Arlene Francis, Bennett Cerf, and Merv Griffin.[56]\\r\\nIn 1977, he led a jetboat expedition, titled \\"Ocean to Sky\\", from the mouth of the Ganges River to its source.[57]  From 1977 to 1979 he commentated aboard Antarctic sightseeing flights operated by Air New Zealand.[58]\\r\\nIn 1985, he accompanied Neil Armstrong in a small twin-engined ski plane over the Arctic Ocean and landed at the North Pole. Hillary thus became the first man to stand at both poles and on the summit of Everest.[59][60][61][62] This accomplishment inspired generations of explorers to compete over what later was defined as Three Poles Challenge.\\r\\nIn January 2007, Hillary travelled to Antarctica as part of a delegation commemorating the 50th anniversary of the founding of Scott Base.[63][64][65]\\r\\n\\r\\nOn 6 June 1953 Hillary was appointed Knight Commander of the Order of the British Empire and received the Queen Elizabeth II Coronation Medal the same year.[66] On 6 February 1987, he was the fourth appointee to the Order of New Zealand.[67] He was also awarded the Polar Medal in 1958 for his part in the Commonwealth Trans-Antarctic Expedition,[68][69] the Order of Gorkha Dakshina Bahu, 1st Class of the Kingdom of Nepal in 1953, and the Coronation Medal in 1975.[70] On 22 April 1995 Hillary was appointed Knight Companion of The Most Noble Order of the Garter.[71][72] On 17 June 2004 Hillary was awarded Commander's Cross of the Order of Merit of the Republic of Poland.[73] The Government of India conferred on him its second highest civilian award, the Padma Vibhushan, posthumously, in 2008.[74]\\r\\n\\r\\nTo mark the 50th anniversary of the first successful ascent of Everest, the Nepalese government conferred honorary citizenship upon Hillary at a special Golden Jubilee celebration in Kathmandu, Nepal. He was the first foreign national to receive that honour.[75][14]\\r\\n\\r\\nSince 1992, New Zealand's $5 note has featured Hillary's portrait, making him the only living person not a current head of state ever to appear on a New Zealand banknote. In giving his permission, Hillary insisted that Aoraki / Mount Cook rather than Mount Everest be used as the backdrop.[76][77]\\r\\n\\r\\nAnnual Reader's Digest polls from 2005 to 2007 named Hillary as \\"New Zealand's most trusted individual\\".[79][80]\\r\\n\\r\\nHillary's favoured New Zealand charity was the Sir Edmund Hillary Outdoor Pursuits Centre, of which he was patron for 35 years.[81] He was particularly keen on how this organisation introduced young New Zealanders to the outdoors in a very similar way to his first experience of a school trip to Mt Ruapehu at the age of 16. A 2.3-metre (7.5?ft) bronze statue of Hillary was erected outside The Hermitage Hotel at Mount Cook Village; it was unveiled by Hillary himself in 2003.[82] Various streets, institutions and organisations around New Zealand and abroad are named after him ÿ for example, the Sir Edmund Hillary Collegiate in Otara, which was established by Hillary in 2001.[83]\\r\\n\\r\\nTwo Antarctic features are named after Hillary. The Hillary Coast is a section of coastline south of Ross Island and north of the Shackleton Coast.[84] The Hillary Canyon, an undersea feature in the Ross Sea, appears on the General Bathymetric Chart of the Oceans, published by the International Hydrographic Organization.[85]\\r\\n\\r\\nHillary married Louise Mary Rose on 3 September 1953, soon after the ascent of Everest; he admitted he was terrified of proposing to her and relied on her mother to propose on his behalf.[10][11][86] They had three children: Peter (born 1954), Sarah (born 1955) and Belinda (1959ÿ1975).[1][34] In 1975 while en route to join Hillary in the village of Phaphlu, where he was helping to build a hospital, Louise and Belinda were killed in a plane crash near Kathmandu airport shortly after take-off.[10] In 1989 he married June Mulgrew, the widow of his close friend Peter Mulgrew, who died on Air New Zealand Flight 901 in 1979.[11][87]\\r\\n\\r\\nHis son Peter Hillary also became a climber, summiting Everest in 1990. In May 2002 Peter climbed Everest as part of a 50th anniversary celebration; Jamling Tenzing Norgay (son of Tenzing who had died in 1986) was also part of the expedition.[88]\\r\\n\\r\\nHillary's home for most of his life was a property on Remuera Road in Auckland City,[89] where he enjoyed reading adventure and science fiction novels in his retirement.[89]\\r\\nHe also built a bach at Whites Beach,[90] one of Auckland's west coast beaches in the former Waitakere City, between Anawhata and North Piha;[91][92] a friend called it Hillary's place of solace, where he could escape media attention.[90]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Hillary family has had a connection with the west coast of Auckland since 1925, when Louise's father built a bach at Anawhata.[93] The family donated land at Whites Beach that is now crossed by trampers on the Hillary Trail, named for Edmund.[94]\\r\\nHillary said of the area: \\"That is the thing that international travel brings home to me ÿ it's always good to be going home.\\r\\nThis is the only place I want to live in; this is the place I want to see out my days.\\"[95]\\r\\n\\r\\nFollowing his ascent of Everest he devoted himself to assisting the Sherpa people of Nepal through the Himalayan Trust, which he established in 1960[96] and led until his death in 2008. His efforts are credited with the construction of many schools and hospitals in this remote region of the Himalayas. He was the Honorary President of the American Himalayan Foundation, a United States non-profit body that helps improve the ecology and living conditions in the Himalayas. He was also the Honorary President of Mountain Wilderness, an international NGO dedicated to the worldwide protection of mountains.[97]\\r\\n\\r\\nHillary supported the Labour Party in the 1975 New Zealand general election, as a member of the \\"Citizens for Rowling\\" campaign. His involvement in this campaign was seen as precluding his nomination as Governor-General;[98] the position was offered to Keith Holyoake in 1977. In 1985, Hillary was appointed New Zealand High Commissioner to India (concurrently High Commissioner to Bangladesh and Ambassador to Nepal) and spent four and a half years based in New Delhi.[99]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1975, Hillary served as a vice president for the Abortion Law Reform Association of New Zealand,[100] a national pro-choice advocacy group.[101] He was also a patron of REPEAL, an organization seeking repeal of the restrictive Contraception, Sterilisation, and Abortion Act 1977.[100]\\r\\n\\r\\nOn 22 April 2007, while on a trip to Kathmandu, Hillary suffered a fall, and was hospitalised after returning to New Zealand.[102]\\r\\nOn 11 January 2008 he died of heart failure at Auckland City Hospital.[103]\\r\\nFlags were lowered to half-mast on New Zealand public buildings and at Scott Base in Antarctica,[104] and Prime Minister Helen Clark called Hillary's death a \\"profound loss to New Zealand\\".[105]\\r\\n\\r\\nOn 21 January, Hillary's casket was taken into Holy Trinity Cathedral, Auckland, to lie in state.[106]\\r\\nA state funeral was held on 22 January 2008,[107] after which his body was cremated. On 29 February 2008 most of his ashes were scattered in Auckland's Hauraki Gulf per his desire.[108] The remainder went to a Nepalese monastery near Everest; a plan to scatter them on the summit was cancelled in 2010.[109]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn January 2008, Lukla Airport, in Lukla, Nepal, was renamed to TenzingÿHillary Airport in recognition of their promotion of its construction.[110][111]\\r\\nOn 2 April 2008, a service of thanksgiving in Hillary's honour at St George's Chapel at Windsor Castle was attended by Queen Elizabeth, New Zealand dignitaries including Prime Minister Helen Clark, and members of Hillary's and Norgay's families; Gurkha soldiers from Nepal stood guard outside the ceremony.[112][113]\\r\\nIn October 2008, it was announced that future rugby test matches between England and New Zealand would be played for the Hillary Shield.[114] In 2009 the Duke of Edinburgh's Award in New Zealand?ÿ formerly the Young New Zealanders' Challenge?ÿ was renamed \\"The Duke of Edinburgh's Hillary Award\\".[115]\\r\\nOn 5 November 2008, a commemorative set of five stamps was issued by New Zealand Post.[116][117]\\r\\n\\r\\nThere have been many calls for lasting tributes to Hillary. The first major public tribute has been by way of the \\"Summits for Ed\\" tribute tour organised by the Sir Edmund Hillary Foundation.[118] This tribute tour went from Bluff at the bottom of the South Island to Cape Reinga at the tip of the North Island, visiting 39 towns and cities along the way. In each venue, school children and members of the public were invited to join together to climb a significant hill or site in their area to show their respect for Hillary. The public were also invited to bring small rocks or pebbles that had special significance to them, that would be included in a memorial to Hillary at the base of Mt Ruapehu, in the grounds of the Sir Edmund Hillary Outdoor Pursuits Centre. Funds donated during the tour are used by the foundation to sponsor young New Zealanders on outdoor courses. Over 8,000 persons attended these \\"Summit\\" climbs between March and May 2008.[119]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe tribute song \\"Hillary 88\\", by the New Zealand duo The Kiwis, is the official world memorial song for Hillary, with the endorsement of Lady Hillary.[120]\\r\\n\\r\\nA four-day track in the Waitakere Ranges, along Auckland's west coast, is named the Hillary Trail,[121] in honour of Hillary.[94] Hillary's father-in-law, Jim Rose, who had built a bach at Anawhata in 1925, wrote in his 1982 history of Anawhata Beach, \\"My family look forward to the time when we will be able to walk from Huia to Muriwai on public walking tracks like the old-time Maori could do\\".[93][122] Hillary loved the area, and had his own bach near Anawhata. The track was opened on 11 January 2010, the second anniversary of Hillary's death.[103][123] Rose Track, descending from Anawhata Road to Whites Beach, is named after the Rose family.[95][124]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe South Ridge of Aoraki / Mount Cook, New Zealand's highest mountain, was renamed Hillary Ridge on 18 August 2011. Hillary and three other climbers were the first party to successfully climb the ridge in 1948.[125] In September 2013 the Government of Nepal proposed naming a 7,681 metres (25,200?ft) mountain in Nepal Hillary Peak in his honour.[126] After the New Horizons mission discovered a mountain range on Pluto on 14 July 2015, it was informally named Hillary Montes (Hillary Mountains) by NASA.[127]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Sir Edmund Hillary Mountain Legacy Medal, awarded by the Nepalese NGO Mountain Legacy \\"for remarkable service in the conservation of culture and nature in mountainous regions\\" was inaugurated in 2003, with the approval of Sir Edmund Hillary. \\r\\nA bronze bust of Hillary (circa 1953) by Ophelia Gordon Bell is in the Te Papa museum in Wellington, New Zealand.[128]\\r\\nThe Sir Edmund Hillary Archive was added to the UNESCO Memory of the world archive in 2013,[129] it is currently held by Auckland War Memorial Museum.[130]","input":"When did the first person climb mt everest?"},{"output":"4 October 1957","context":"Sputnik 1 (/?sp?tn?k/; \\"Satellite-1\\", or \\"PS-1\\", Prosteyshiy Sputnik-1, \\"Elementary Satellite 1\\")[5] was the first artificial Earth satellite.

The launch ushered in new political, military, technological, and scientific developments.[6][7]\\r\\nTracking and studying Sputnik 1 from Earth provided scientists with valuable information, even though the satellite itself wasn't equipped with sensors. The density of the upper atmosphere could be deduced from its drag on the orbit, and the propagation of its radio signals gave information about the ionosphere.\\r\\nSputnik 1 was launched during the International Geophysical Year from Site No.1/5, at the 5th Tyuratam range, in Kazakh SSR (now known as the Baikonur Cosmodrome). The satellite travelled at about 29,000 kilometres per hour (18,000?mph; 8,100?m/s), taking 96.2 minutes to complete each orbit. It transmitted on 20.005 and 40.002 MHz,[8] which were monitored by amateur radio operators throughout the world.[9] The signals continued for 21 days until the transmitter batteries ran out on 26 October 1957.[4] Sputnik burned up on 4 January 1958 while reentering Earth's atmosphere, after three months, 1440 completed orbits of the Earth,[1] and a distance travelled of about 70?million?km (43?million?mi).[10]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nOn 17 December 1954, chief Soviet rocket scientist Sergei Korolev proposed a developmental plan for an artificial satellite to Minister of Defence Industry Dimitri Ustinov. Korolev forwarded a report by Mikhail Tikhonravov with an overview of similar projects abroad.[11] Tikhonravov had emphasized that the launch of an orbital satellite was an inevitable stage in the development of rocket technology.[12]\\r\\nOn 29 July 1955, U.S. President Dwight D. Eisenhower announced through his press secretary that the United States would launch an artificial satellite during the International Geophysical Year (IGY).[13] A week later, on 8 August, the Politburo of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union approved the proposal to create an artificial satellite.[14] On 30 August Vasily Ryabikov ÿ the head of the State Commission on R-7 rocket test launches ÿ held a meeting where Korolev presented calculation data for a spaceflight trajectory to the Moon. They decided to develop a three-stage version of the R-7 rocket for satellite launches.[15]\\r\\nOn 30 January 1956 the Council of Ministers approved practical work on an artificial Earth-orbiting satellite. This satellite, named Object D, was planned to be completed in 1957ÿ58; it would have a mass of 1,000 to 1,400?kg (2,200 to 3,100?lb) and would carry 200 to 300?kg (440 to 660?lb) of scientific instruments.[16] The first test launch of \\"Object D\\" was scheduled for 1957.[12] Work on the satellite was to be divided between institutions as follows:[17]\\r\\nPreliminary design work was completed by July 1956 and the scientific tasks to be carried out by the satellite were defined. These included measuring the density of the atmosphere and its ion composition, the solar wind, magnetic fields, and cosmic rays. These data would be valuable in the creation of future artificial satellites. A system of ground stations was to be developed to collect data transmitted by the satellite, observe the satellite's orbit, and transmit commands to the satellite. Because of the limited time frame, observations were planned for only 7 to 10 days and orbit calculations were not expected to be extremely accurate.[18]\\r\\nBy the end of 1956 it became clear that the complexity of the ambitious design meant that 'Object D' could not be launched in time because of difficulties creating scientific instruments and the low specific impulse produced by the completed R-7 engines (304 sec instead of the planned 309 to 310 sec). Consequently, the government rescheduled the launch for April 1958.[12] Object D would later fly as Sputnik 3.[19]\\r\\nFearing the U.S. would launch a satellite before the USSR, OKB-1 suggested the creation and launch of a satellite in AprilÿMay 1957, before the IGY began in July 1957. The new satellite would be simple, light (100?kg or 220?lb), and easy to construct, forgoing the complex, heavy scientific equipment in favour of a simple radio transmitter. On 15 February 1957 the Council of Ministers of the USSR approved this simple satellite, designated 'Object PS'.[20] This version allowed the satellite to be tracked visually by Earth-based observers, and it could transmit tracking signals to ground-based receiving stations.[20] The launch of two satellites, PS-1 and PS-2, with two R-7 rockets (8K71) was approved, provided that the R-7 completed at least two successful test flights.[20]\\r\\nThe R-7 Semyorka was initially designed as an ICBM by OKB-1. The decision to build it was made by the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and the Council of Ministers of the USSR on 20 May 1954.[21] The R-7 was also known by its GRAU (later GURVO) designation 8K71.[22] At the time, the R-7 was known to NATO sources as the T-3 or M-104,[23] and Type A.[24] A special reconnaissance commission selected Tyuratam for the construction of a rocket proving ground (the 5th Tyuratam range, usually referred to as \\"NIIP-5\\", or \\"GIK-5\\" in the post-Soviet time). The selection was approved on 12 February 1955 by the Council of Ministers of the USSR, but the site would not be completed until 1958.[25] Actual work on the construction of the site began on 20 July by military building units. On 14 June 1956 Sergei Korolev decided to adapt the R-7 rocket to the 'Object D',[26] that would later be replaced by the much lighter 'Object PS'.\\r\\nThe first launch of an R-7 rocket (8K71 No.5L) occurred on 15 May 1957. A fire began in the Blok D strap-on almost immediately at liftoff, but the booster continued flying until T+98 seconds when the strap-on broke away and the vehicle crashed some 400?km downrange.[27] Three attempts to launch the second rocket (8K71 No.6) were made on 10ÿ11 June, but an assembly defect prevented launch.[28] The unsuccessful launch of the third R-7 rocket (8K71 No.7) took place on 12 July.[27] An electrical short caused the vernier engines to put the missile into an uncontrolled roll which resulted in all of the strap-ons separating 33 seconds into the launch. The R-7 crashed about 7?km from the pad.[29]\\r\\nThe launch of the fourth rocket (8K71 No.8), on 21 August at 15:25 Moscow Time,[27] was successful. The rocket's core boosted the dummy warhead to the target altitude and velocity, reentered the atmosphere, and broke apart at a height of 10?km (6.2?mi) after traveling 6,000?km. On 27 August TASS issued a statement on the successful launch of a long-distance multistage ICBM. The launch of the fifth R-7 rocket (8K71 No.9), on 7 September[27] was also successful, but the dummy was also destroyed on atmospheric re-entry,[29] and hence needed a redesign to completely fulfill its military purpose. The rocket, however, was deemed suitable for satellite launches, and Korolev was able to convince the State Commission to allow the use of the next R-7 to launch PS-1,[30] allowing the delay in the rocket's military exploitation to launch the PS-1 and PS-2 satellites.[31][32]\\r\\nOn 22 September a modified R-7 rocket, named Sputnik and indexed as 8K71PS,[33] arrived at the proving ground and preparations for the launch of PS-1 began.[34] Compared to the military R-7 test vehicles, the mass of 8K71PS was reduced from 280 tonnes to 272 tonnes; its length with PS-1 was 29.167 metres (95?ft 8.3?in) and the thrust at lift off was 3.90?MN (880,000?lbf).[35] These weight reductions were accomplished by deleting the inertial guidance system, several telemetry measurements, and assorted hardware designed to support a warhead.\\r\\nPS-1 was not designed to be controlled, it could only be observed. Initial data at the launch site would be collected at six separate observatories and telegraphed to NII-4.[31] Located back in Moscow (at Bolshevo), NII-4 was a scientific research arm of the Ministry of Defence dedicated to missile development.[36] The six observatories, designated IP-1 through IP-6, were clustered around the launch site, with the closest (IP-1) situated at a distance of 1?km (0.62?mi) from the launch pad.[31]\\r\\nA second, nationwide observation complex was established to track the satellite after its separation from the rocket. Called the Command-Measurement Complex, it consisted of the coordination center in NII-4 and seven distant stations situated along the line of the satellite's ground track.[37] These tracking stations were located at Tyuratam; Sary-Shagan; Yeniseysk; Klyuchi; Yelizovo; Makat in Guryev Oblast; and Ishkup in Krasnoyarsk Krai.[31][37] Stations were equipped with radar, optical instruments, and communications systems. Data from stations were transmitted by telegraphs into NII-4 where ballistics specialists calculated orbital parameters. The complex became an early prototype of the Soviet Mission Control Center.[38]\\r\\nThe observatories used a trajectory measurement system called \\"Tral,\\" developed by OKB MEI, by which they received and monitored data from transponders mounted on the R-7 rocket's core stage.[39] The data was useful even after the satellite's separation from the second stage of the rocket; Sputnik's location was calculated from the data on the second stage's location which followed Sputnik at a known distance.[40] Tracking of the booster during launch had to be accomplished through purely passive means such as visual coverage and radar detection. R-7 test launches demonstrated that the tracking cameras were only good up to an altitude of 200?km (120?mi) but radar could track it for almost 400?km (250?mi).\\r\\nOutside the Soviet Union, the satellite was tracked by amateur radio operators in many countries.[41] The US government followed it from the Central Radio Propagation Laboratory of the National Bureau of Standards,[42] and the booster rocket was located and tracked by the Lovell Telescope at the Jodrell Bank Observatory.[41] Canada's Newbrook Observatory was the first facility in North America to photograph Sputnik 1.[43]\\r\\nThe chief constructor of Sputnik 1 at OKB-1 was Mikhail S. Khomyakov.[44] The satellite was a 585-millimetre (23.0?in) diameter sphere, assembled from two hemispheres that were hermetically sealed with o-rings and connected by 36 bolts. It had a mass of 83.6 kilograms (184?lb).[45] The hemispheres were 2?mm thick,[46] and were covered with a highly polished 1?mm-thick heat shield[47] made of aluminium-magnesium-titanium AMG6T alloy (\\"AMG\\" is an abbreviation for \\"aluminium-magnesium\\" and \\"T\\" stands for \\"titanium\\"; the alloy is 6% magnesium and 0.2% titanium[48]). The satellite carried two pairs of antennas designed by the Antenna Laboratory of OKB-1 led by Mikhail V. Krayushkin.[17] Each antenna was made up of two whip-like parts: 2.4 and 2.9 meters (7.9 and 9.5?ft) in length,[49] and had an almost spherical radiation pattern,[50] so that the satellite beeps were transmitted with equal power in all directions, making reception of the transmitted signal independent of the satellite's rotation.\\r\\nThe power supply, with a mass of 51?kg (112?lb),[51] was in the shape of an octagonal nut with the radio transmitter in its hole.[52] It consisted of three silver-zinc batteries, developed at the All-Union Research Institute of Current Sources (VNIIT) under the leadership of Nikolai S. Lidorenko. Two of these batteries powered the radio transmitter and one powered the temperature regulation system.[51] The batteries had an expected lifetime of two weeks, and operated for 22 days. The power supply was turned on automatically at the moment of the satellite's separation from the second stage of the rocket.[53]\\r\\nThe satellite had a one-watt, 3.5?kg (7.7?lb)[31] radio transmitting unit inside, developed by Vyacheslav I. Lappo from NII-885,[53] that worked on two frequencies, 20.005 and 40.002?MHz. Signals on the first frequency were transmitted in 0.3 sec pulses (under normal temperature and pressure conditions on-board), with pauses of the same duration filled by pulses on the second frequency.[54] Analysis of the radio signals was used to gather information about the electron density of the ionosphere. Temperature and pressure were encoded in the duration of radio beeps. A temperature regulation system contained a fan, a dual thermal switch, and a control thermal switch.[53] If the temperature inside the satellite exceeded 36?C (97?F) the fan was turned on and when it fell below 20?C (68?F) the fan was turned off by the dual thermal switch.[50] If the temperature exceeded 50?C (122?F) or fell below 0?C (32?F), another control thermal switch was activated, changing the duration of the radio signal pulses.[53] Sputnik 1 was filled with dry nitrogen, pressurized to 1.3 atm.[33] The satellite had a barometric switch, activated if the pressure inside the satellite fell below 130 kPa, which would have indicated failure of the pressure vessel or puncture by a meteor, and would have changed the duration of radio signal impulse.[55]\\r\\nWhile attached to the rocket, Sputnik 1 was protected by a cone-shaped payload fairing, with a height of 80?cm (31.5?in).[31] The fairing separated from both Sputnik and the spent R-7 second stage at the same time as the satellite was ejected.[53] Tests of the satellite were conducted at OKB-1 under the leadership of Oleg G. Ivanovsky.[44]\\r\\nThe control system of the Sputnik rocket was adjusted to an intended orbit of 223 by 1,450?km (139 by 901?mi), with an orbital period of 101.5 min.[56] The trajectory had been calculated earlier by Georgi Grechko, using the USSR Academy of Sciences' mainframe computer.[31][57]\\r\\nThe Sputnik rocket was launched on 4 October 1957 at 19:28:34?UTC (5 October at the launch site[1]) from Site No.1 at NIIP-5.[58] Telemetry indicated that the strap-ons separated 116 seconds into the flight and the core stage engine shut down 295.4 seconds into the flight.[56] At shut down, the 7.5 tonne core stage with PS-1 attached had attained an altitude of 223?km (139?mi) above sea level, a velocity of 7,780?m/s (25,500?ft/s) and velocity vector inclination to the local horizon of 0 degrees 24 minutes. This resulted in an initial orbit of 223 kilometres (139?mi) by 950 kilometres (590?mi), with an apogee approximately 500 kilometres (310?mi) lower than intended, and an inclination of 65.1 degrees and a period of 96.2 minutes.[56]\\r\\nThe launch came very close to failurea postflight examination of telemetry data found that the Blok G strap-on had not attained full power at ignition and the resulting imbalanced thrust caused the booster to pitch over about 2 six seconds after liftoff. Two seconds later, the flight control system tried to compensate by rapidly moving the vernier engines and stabilizer fins. The Blok G strap-on finally reached 100% thrust only one second before the pitch angle would have been great enough to trigger an automatic shutdown command, which would have terminated the launch and sent the R-7 and Sputnik 1 crashing to the ground in a fireball only a short distance from the pad.\\r\\nA fuel regulator in the booster also failed around 16 seconds into launch, which resulted in excessive RP-1 consumption for most of powered flight and engine thrust 4% above nominal. Core stage cutoff was intended for T+296 seconds, but the premature propellant depletion caused thrust termination to occur one second earlier when a sensor detected overspeed of the empty RP-1 turbopump. There were 375 kilograms (827?lb) of LOX remaining at cutoff.[59]\\r\\nAt 19.9 seconds after engine cut-off, PS-1 separated from the second stage[1] and the satellite's transmitter was activated. These signals were detected at the IP-1 station by Junior Engineer-Lieutenant V.G. Borisov, where reception of Sputnik 1's \\"beep-beep-beep\\" tones confirmed the satellite's successful deployment. Reception lasted for two minutes, until PS-1 fell below the horizon.[31][60] The Tral telemetry system on the R-7 core stage continued to transmit and was detected on its second orbit.[1]\\r\\nThe designers, engineers and technicians who developed the rocket and satellite watched the launch from the range.[61] After the launch they drove to the mobile radio station to listen for signals from the satellite.[61] They waited about 90 minutes to ensure that the satellite had made one orbit and was transmitting, before Korolev called Soviet premier Nikita Khrushchev.[62]\\r\\nOn the first orbit the Telegraph Agency of the Soviet Union (TASS) transmitted: \\"As result of great, intense work of scientific institutes and design bureaus the first artificial Earth satellite has been built\\".[63] The R-7 core stage, with a mass of 7.5 tonnes and a length of 26 meters, also reached Earth orbit and was visible from the ground at night as a first magnitude object following the satellite. Deployable reflective panels were placed on the booster in order to increase its visibility for tracking.[62] The satellite itself, a small, highly polished sphere, was barely visible at sixth magnitude, and thus more difficult to follow optically. A third object, the payload fairing, also achieved orbit.\\r\\nThe core stage of the R-7 remained in orbit for two months until 2 December 1957, while Sputnik 1 orbited for three months, until 4 January 1958, having completed 1,440 orbits of the Earth.[1]\\r\\nOur movies and television programs in the fifties were full of the idea of going into space. What came as a surprise was that it was the Soviet Union that launched the first satellite. It is hard to recall the atmosphere of the time.\\r\\nThe Soviets provided details of Sputnik 1 before the launch but few outside the Soviet Union noticed. After reviewing information publicly available before the launch, the science writer Willy Ley wrote in 1958:\\r\\nIf somebody tells me that he has the rockets to shoot  which we know from other sources, anyway  and tells me what he will shoot, how he will shoot it, and in general says virtually everything except for the precise date  well, what should I feel like if I'm surprised when the man shoots?\\"[65]\\r\\nOrganized through the citizen science project Operation Moonwatch, teams of visual observers at 150 stations in the United States and other countries were alerted during the night to watch for the Soviet sphere at dawn and during the evening twilight through binoculars or telescopes as it passed overhead.[66] The USSR asked radio amateurs and commercial stations to record the sound of the satellite on magnetic tape.[66]\\r\\nNews reports at the time pointed out that \\"anyone possessing a short wave receiver can hear the new Russian earth satellite as it hurtles over this area of the globe\\".[this quote needs a citation] Directions, provided by the American Radio Relay League were to \\"Tune in 20 megacycles sharply, by the time signals, given on that frequency. Then tune to slightly higher frequencies. The 'beep, beep' sound of the satellite can be heard each time it rounds the globe.\\"[68] The first recording of Sputnik 1's signal was made by RCA engineers near Riverhead, Long Island. They then drove the tape recording into Manhattan for broadcast to the public over NBC radio. However, as Sputnik rose higher over the East Coast, its signal was picked up by ham station W2AEE, the ham radio station of Columbia University. Students working in the university's FM station, WKCR, made a tape of this, and were the first to rebroadcast the Sputnik signal to the American public (or whoever could receive the FM station).\\r\\nAt first the Soviet Union agreed to use equipment \\"compatible\\" with that of the United States, but later announced the lower frequencies.[66] The White House declined to comment on military aspects of the launch, but said \\"it did not come as a surprise.\\"[69] On 5 October the Naval Research Laboratory announced it had recorded four crossings of Sputnik 1 over the United States.[66] The USAF Cambridge Research Center collaborated with Bendix-Friez, Westinghouse Broadcasting Co., and the Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory to obtain a motion picture of Sputnik's rocket body crossing the pre-dawn sky of Baltimore, broadcast on 12 October by WBZ-TV in Boston.[70] U.S. President Eisenhower obtained photographs of the Soviet facilities from Lockheed U-2 flights conducted since 1956.[71]\\r\\nThe success of Sputnik 1 seemed to have changed minds around the world regarding a shift in power to the Soviets.[72]\\r\\nThe USSR's launch of Sputnik 1 spurred the United States to create the Advanced Research Projects Agency (ARPA, later DARPA) in February 1958 to regain a technological lead.[73][74][75]\\r\\nIn Britain the media and population initially reacted with a mixture of fear for the future, but also amazement about humankind's progress. Many newspapers and magazines heralded the arrival of the Space Age. However, when the Soviet Union launched a second craft containing the dog Laika, the media narrative returned to one of anti-communism and many people sent protests to the Russian embassy and the RSPCA.[76]\\r\\nSputnik 1 was not immediately used for Soviet propaganda. The Soviets had kept quiet about their earlier accomplishments in rocketry, fearing that it would lead to secrets being revealed and failures being exploited by the West.[77] When the Soviets began using Sputnik in their propaganda, they emphasized pride in the achievement of Soviet technology, arguing that it demonstrated the Soviets' superiority over the West. People were encouraged to listen to Sputnik's signals on the radio[77] and to look out for Sputnik in the night sky. While Sputnik itself had been highly polished, its small size made it barely visible to the naked eye. What most watchers actually saw was the much more visible 26 meter core stage of the R-7.[77] Shortly after the launch of PS-1, Khrushchev pressed Korolev to launch another satellite in time for the 40th anniversary of the October Revolution on 7 November 1957.[78]\\r\\nThe launch of Sputnik 1 surprised the American public and shattered the perception, furthered by American propaganda, of the United States as the technological superpower and the Soviet Union as a backward country.[79] Privately, however, the CIA and President Eisenhower were aware of progress being made by the Soviets on Sputnik from secret spy plane imagery.[80] Together with the Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL), the Army Ballistic Missile Agency built Explorer 1, and launched it on 31 January 1958. Before work was completed, however, the Soviet Union launched a second satellite, Sputnik 2, on 3 November 1957. Meanwhile, the televised failure of Vanguard TV3 on 6 December 1957 deepened American dismay over the country's position in the Space Race. The Americans took a more aggressive stance in the emerging space race,[81] resulting in an emphasis on science and technological research and reforms in many areas from the military to education systems.[82] The federal government began investing in science, engineering and mathematics at all levels of education.[79][83] An advanced research group was assembled for military purposes.[79] These research groups developed weapons such as ICBMs and missile defense systems, as well as spy satellites for the U.S.[79]\\r\\nOn Friday, 4 October 1957, the Soviets had orbited the world's first artificial satellite. Anyone who doubted its existence could walk into the backyard just after sunset and see it.\\r\\nInitially U.S. President Eisenhower was not surprised by Sputnik 1. He had been forewarned of the R-7s capabilities by information derived from U-2 spy plane overflight photos as well as signals and telemetry intercepts.[85][86] The Eisenhower administration's first response was low-key and almost dismissive.[87] Eisenhower was even pleased that the USSR, not the U.S., would be the first to test the waters of the still-uncertain legal status of orbital satellite overflights.[88] Eisenhower had suffered the Soviet protests and shoot-downs of Project Genetrix (Moby Dick) balloons[89] and was concerned about the probability of a U-2 being shot down.[90] To set a precedent for \\"freedom of space\\" before the launch of America's secret WS-117L spy satellites,[91] the U.S. had launched Project Vanguard as its own \\"civilian\\" satellite entry for the International Geophysical Year.[92] Eisenhower greatly underestimated the reaction of the American public, who were shocked by the launch of Sputnik and by the televised failure of the Vanguard Test Vehicle 3 launch attempt. The sense of fear was inflamed by Democratic politicians and professional cold warriors, who portrayed the United States as woefully behind.[93] One of the many books that suddenly appeared for the lay-audience noted seven points of \\"impact\\" upon the nation: Western leadership, Western strategy and tactics, missile production, applied research, basic research, education, and democratic culture.[23]\\r\\nThe U.S. soon had a number of successful satellites, including Explorer 1, Project SCORE, and Courier 1B. However, public reaction to the Sputnik crisis led to the creation of the Advanced Research Projects Agency (renamed the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency or DARPA in 1972),[94] NASA,[95] and an increase in U.S. government spending on scientific research and education. Not only did the launch of Sputnik spur America to action in the space race, it also led directly to the creation of NASA through the space act bill.\\r\\nSputnik also contributed directly to a new emphasis on science and technology in American schools. With a sense of urgency, Congress enacted the 1958 National Defense Education Act, which provided low-interest loans for college tuition to students majoring in math and science.[96][97] After the launch of Sputnik, a poll conducted and published by the University of Michigan showed that 26% of Americans surveyed thought that Russian sciences and engineering were superior to that of the United States. (A year later, however, that figure had dropped to 10% as the U.S. began launching its own satellites into space.)[98]\\r\\nOne consequence of the Sputnik shock was the perception of a \\"missile gap.\\"[99] This became a dominant issue in the 1960 Presidential campaign.\\r\\nOne irony of the Sputnik event was the initially low-key response of the Soviet Union. The Communist Party newspaper Pravda only printed a few paragraphs about Sputnik 1 on 4 October.[100] In the days following the world's startled response, the Soviets started celebrating their great accomplishment.\\r\\nSputnik also inspired a generation of engineers and scientists. Harrison Storms, the North American designer who was responsible for the X-15 rocket plane, and went on to head the effort to design the Apollo Command/Service Module and Saturn V launch vehicle's second stage was moved by the launch of Sputnik to think of space as being the next step for America.[101] Astronauts Alan Shepard, who was the first American in space, and Deke Slayton later wrote of how the sight of Sputnik I passing overhead inspired them to their new careers.[102] Homer Hickam's memoir Rocket Boys and the movie October Sky tell the story of how a coal miner's son, inspired by Sputnik, started building rockets in the mining town where he lived.\\r\\nThe launch of Sputnik 1 inspired United States writer Herb Caen to coin the term \\"beatnik\\" in an article about the Beat Generation in the San Francisco Chronicle on 2 April 1958.[103]\\r\\nAt least two vintage duplicates of Sputnik 1 exist, built apparently as backup units. One resides just outside Moscow in the corporate museum of Energia, the modern descendant of Korolev's design bureau, where it is on display by appointment only.[104][105] Another is in the Museum of Flight in Seattle, Washington. Unlike Energia's unit, it has no internal components, but it does have casings and molded fittings inside (as well as evidence of battery wear), which suggest it was built as more than just a model. Authenticated by the Memorial Museum of Cosmonautics in Moscow, the unit was auctioned in 2001 and purchased by an anonymous private buyer who donated it to the museum.[104] Two more Sputnik backups are said to be in the personal collections of American entrepreneurs Richard Garriott[104] and Jay S. Walker.[106]\\r\\nIn addition to the Soviets' donation to the UN, there are dozens of other full-size Sputnik replicas, more or less accurate, on display in locations around the world, including the National Air and Space Museum in Washington, D.C.;[104] the Frontiers of Flight Museum and the Fort Worth Museum of Science and History, both in Texas;[104][107] the Armstrong Air and Space Museum and the National Museum of the United States Air Force, both in Ohio; the Cosmosphere in Hutchinson, Kansas; the California Science Center in Los Angeles; the Science Museum, London; the World Museum in Liverpool; Powerhouse Museum in Sydney, Australia and outside the Russian embassy in Madrid, Spain.\\r\\nThree one-third scale student-built replicas of Sputnik 1 were deployed from the Mir space station between 1997 and 1999.[citation needed] The first, named Sputnik 40 to commemorate the fortieth anniversary of the launch of Sputnik 1, was deployed in November 1997.[71] Sputnik 41 was launched a year later, and Sputnik 99 was deployed in February 1999. A fourth replica was launched but never deployed, and was destroyed when Mir was deorbited.[104][108]","input":"When did the u.s.s.r launch the first satellite to orbit the world?"},{"output":"\\"Fifth of May\\"","context":"\\r\\n\\r\\nCinco de Mayo (pronounced?[?si?ko ee ?ma?o] in Latin America, Spanish for \\"Fifth of May\\") is an annual celebration held on May 5. The date is observed to commemorate the Mexican Army's unlikely victory over the French Empire at the Battle of Puebla, on May 5, 1862, under the leadership of General Ignacio Zaragoza.[1][2]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the United States, Cinco de Mayo has taken on a significance beyond that in Mexico.[3][4][5][6] More popularly celebrated in the United States than Mexico,[7] the date has become associated with the celebration of Mexican-American culture. In Mexico, the commemoration of the battle continues to be mostly ceremonial, such as through military parades or battle reenactments.\\r\\n\\r\\nCinco de Mayo is sometimes mistaken for  Mexico's Independence Daythe most important national holiday in Mexicowhich is celebrated on September 16, commemorating the Cry of Dolores that initiated the war of Mexican independence from Spain.[1][8]\\r\\n\\r\\nCinco de Mayo has its roots in the Second French intervention in Mexico, which took place in the aftermath of the 1846ÿ48 MexicanÿAmerican War and the 1858ÿ61 Reform War. The Reform War was a civil war that pitted Liberals (who believed in separation of church and state, and freedom of religion) against Conservatives (who favored a tight bond between the Catholic Church and the Mexican state).[9] These wars nearly bankrupted the Mexican Treasury. On July 17, 1861, Mexican President Benito Jurez issued a moratorium in which all foreign debt payments would be suspended for two years.[3][10]  In response, Britain,  France, and Spain sent naval forces to Veracruz to demand reimbursement. Britain and Spain negotiated with Mexico and withdrew, but France, at the time ruled by Napoleon III, decided to use the opportunity to establish an empire in Mexico that would favor French interests, the Second Mexican Empire. The empire was part of an envisioned \\"Latin America\\" (term used to imply cultural kinship of the region with France) that would rebuild French influence in the American continent and exclude Anglophone American territories.\\r\\n\\r\\nLate in 1861, a well-armed French fleet stormed Veracruz, landing a large French force and driving President Jurez and his government into retreat.[11]  Moving on from Veracruz towards Mexico City, the French army encountered heavy resistance from the Mexicans close to Puebla, at the Mexican forts of Loreto and Guadalupe.[12]  The French army of 8,000 [13][14][note 1] attacked the poorly equipped Mexican army of 4,000.[15][note 2]  On May 5, 1862,[16] the Mexicans decisively defeated the French army.[17][18][19] The victory represented a significant morale boost to the Mexican army and the Mexican people at large[20][21]  and helped establish a sense of national unity and patriotism.[22]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Mexican victory, however, was short-lived.  A year later, with 30,000 troops, the French were able to defeat the Mexican army, capture Mexico City, and install Emperor Maximilian I as ruler of Mexico.[23]  The French victory was itself short-lived, lasting only three years, from 1864 to 1867.[23]  By 1865, \\"with the American Civil War now over, the U.S. began to provide more political and military assistance to Mexico to expel the French\\".[23]  Upon the conclusion of the American Civil War, Napoleon III, facing a persistent Mexican guerilla resistance, the threat of war with Prussia, and \\"the prospect of a serious scrap with the United States\\", retreated from Mexico starting in 1866.[24] The Mexicans recaptured Mexico City, and Maximilian I was apprehended and executed, along with his Mexican generals Miguel Miram܇n and Toms Meja Camacho in Cerro de las Campanas, Quertaro.[10][23] \\"On June 5, 1867, Benito Jurez finally entered Mexico City where he installed a new government and reorganized his administration.\\"[10]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Battle of Puebla was significant, both nationally and internationally, for several reasons. First, although considerably outnumbered, the Mexicans defeated a much-better-equipped French army. \\"This battle was significant in that the 4,000 Mexican soldiers were greatly outnumbered by the well-equipped French army of 8,000 that had not been defeated for almost 50 years.\\"[25][26][note 3] Second, since the Battle of Puebla, some have argued that no country in the Americas has subsequently been invaded by any other European military force.[27][note 4]  Historian Justo Sierra has written in his Political Evolution of the Mexican People that, had Mexico not defeated the French in Puebla on May 5, 1862, France would have gone to the aid of the Confederacy in the U.S. Civil War and the United States' destiny would have been different.[28][29]\\r\\n\\r\\nAccording to a paper published by the UCLA Center for the Study of Latino Health and Culture about the origin of the observance of Cinco de Mayo in the United States, the modern American focus on that day first started in California in 1863 in response to the resistance to French rule in Mexico.[30] \\"Far up in the gold country town of Columbia (now Columbia State Park) Mexican miners were so overjoyed at the news that they spontaneously fired off rifle shots and fireworks, sang patriotic songs and made impromptu speeches.\\"[31]\\r\\n\\r\\nA 2007 UCLA Newsroom article notes that, \\"the holiday, which has been celebrated in California continuously since 1863, is virtually ignored in Mexico.\\"[30] TIME magazine reports that \\"Cinco de Mayo started to come into vogue in 1940s America during the rise of the Chicano Movement.\\"[21] The holiday crossed over from California into the rest of the United States in the 1950s and 1960s but did not gain popularity until the 1980s when marketers, especially beer companies, capitalized on the celebratory nature of the day and began to promote it.[32][33]  It grew in popularity and evolved into a celebration of Mexican culture and heritage, first in areas with large Mexican-American populations, like Los Angeles, Chicago, Houston and San Jose.[34]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn a 1998 study in the Journal of American Culture it was reported that there were more than 120 official US celebrations of Cinco de Mayo in 21 different states. An update in 2006 found that the number of official Cinco de Mayo events was 150 or more, according to Jos Alamillo, a professor of ethnic studies at Washington State University in Pullman, who has studied the cultural impact of Cinco de Mayo north of the border.[35]  Los Angeles' Fiesta Broadway has been billed as the largest Cinco de Mayo celebration in the world, which it most certainly was at its peak in the 1990s when it attracted crowds of 500,000 or more.  In recent years attendance has seen a dramatic decrease.[36][37]\\r\\n\\r\\nOn June 7, 2005, the United States Congress issued a concurrent resolution calling on the President of the United States to issue a proclamation calling upon the people of the United States to observe Cinco de Mayo with appropriate ceremonies and activities.[38] To celebrate, many display Cinco de Mayo banners while school districts hold special events to educate students about its historical significance. Special events and celebrations highlight Mexican culture, especially in its music and regional dancing. Examples include baile folkl܇rico and mariachi demonstrations held annually at the Plaza del Pueblo de Los ngeles, near Olvera Street. Commercial interests in the United States have capitalized on the celebration, advertising Mexican products and services, with an emphasis on alcoholic beverages,[39][40] foods, and music.[41][42] According to Nielsen, in 2013 more than $600 million worth of beer was purchased in the United States for Cinco de Mayo, more than for the Super Bowl or St. Patricks Day.[43]\\r\\n\\r\\nOn May 9, 1862, President Jurez declared that the anniversary of the Battle of Puebla would be a national holiday regarded as \\"Battle of Puebla Day\\" or \\"Battle of Cinco de Mayo\\".[44][45][46][47][48]\\r\\n\\r\\nToday, the commemoration of the battle is not observed as a national holiday in Mexico (i.e. not a statutory holiday).[49] However, all public schools are closed nationwide in Mexico on May 5.[50][51] The day is an official holiday in the State of Puebla, where the Battle took place, and also a full holiday (no work) in the neighboring State of Veracruz.[52][53]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn Puebla, historical reenactments, parades, and meals take place to commemorate the battle. Parade participants dress as French and Mexican soldiers to reenact the battle.[54] Every year the city also hosts the Festival Internacional de Puebla, which gathers national and international artists, traditional musicians and dancers.[54] As well as the Festival Internacional del Mole, with an emphasis on the city's iconic mole poblano.[54]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn Mexico City, military commemoration is occasionally held at the Campo Marte.[55] A street, Avenida Cinco de Mayo,  in the Historic Center of Mexico City was named after the battle in 1862 by Benito Jurez.\\r\\n\\r\\nEvents tied to Cinco de Mayo also occur outside Mexico and the United States. As in the United States, celebrations elsewhere also emphasize Mexican cuisine, culture and music. For example, Windsor, Ontario, Canada, holds a \\"Cinco de Mayo Street Festival\\",[56][57] some Canadian pubs play Mexican music and serve Mexican food and drink,[58] and a sky-diving club near Vancouver holds a Cinco de Mayo skydiving event.[59]  In the Cayman Islands, in the Caribbean, there is an annual Cinco de Mayo air guitar competition,[60] and at Montego Bay, Jamaica, there is a Cinco de Mayo celebration.[61] The city of Brisbane, Queensland, Australia, holds an annual Mexican Festival[62] to honor the day, and celebrations are held in London[63] and New Zealand.[64]  Other celebrations of the day can also be found in Cape Town, South Africa,[65] Lagos, Nigeria,[66] and in Paris.[67]  Cinco de Mayo is celebrated in Japan in Osaka and in Tokyo's Yoyogi Park Event Space as a celebration of Latin American culture.[68][69][70]\\r\\n\\r\\nNotes\\r\\n\\r\\nCitations\\r\\n\\r\\nSources\\r\\n\\r\\n(federal) = federal holidays, (state) = state holidays, (religious) = religious holidays, (week) = weeklong holidays, (month) = monthlong holidays, (36) = Title 36 Observances and Ceremonies\\r\\nBold indicates major holidays commonly celebrated in the United States, which often represent the major celebrations of the month.","input":"What does cinco de mayo mean in mexico?"},{"output":"dollar (currency code TTD)","context":"The dollar (currency code TTD) is the currency of Trinidad and Tobago. It is normally abbreviated with the dollar sign $, or alternatively TT$ to distinguish it from other dollar-denominated currencies. It is subdivided into 100 cents. Its predecessor currencies are the Trinidadian dollar and the Tobagan dollar.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe history of currency in the former British colony of Trinidad and Tobago closely follows that of the British Eastern Caribbean territories in general. Even though Queen Anne's proclamation of 1704 brought the gold standard to the West Indies, silver pieces of eight (Spanish dollars and later Mexican dollars) continued to form a major portion of the circulating currency right into the latter half of the nineteenth century.\\r\\nBritain adopted the gold standard in 1821 and an imperial order-in-council of 1838 resulted in Trinidad and Tobago formally adopting the sterling currency. However, despite the circulation of British coins in Trinidad and Tobago, the silver pieces of eight continued to circulate alongside them. The international silver crisis of 1873 signalled the end of the silver dollar era in the West Indies and silver dollars were demonetized in Tobago in 1879 and in Trinidad at around the same period. This left a state of affairs, in which the British coinage circulated, being reckoned in the private sector using dollar accounts at an automatic conversion rate of 1 dollar = 4 shillings 2 pence. Government offices kept their accounts in British pounds, shillings, and pence until the year 1935 when Trinidad and Tobago went decimal.\\r\\nFrom 1949, with the introduction of the British West Indies dollar, the currency of Trinidad and Tobago became officially tied up with that of the British Eastern Caribbean territories in general. The British sterling coinage was eventually replaced by a new decimal coinage in 1955, with the new cent being equal to one half of the old penny. In 1951, notes of the British Caribbean Territories, Eastern Group, were introduced, replacing Trinidad and Tobago's own notes. In 1955, coins were introduced when the dollar was decimalized. In 1964, Trinidad and Tobago introduced its own dollar. Between 1964 and 1968 the Trinidad and Tobago dollar was utilized in Grenada as legal tender until that country rejoined the common currency arrangements of the East Caribbean dollar.[2] The Trinidad and Tobago dollar and the Eastern Caribbean dollar were the last two currencies in the world to retain the old rating of one pound equals four dollars and eighty cents, as per the gold sovereign to the Pieces of eight. Both of these currencies ended this relationship within a few weeks of each other in 1976.\\r\\nAfter VAT was introduced in 1989, the dollar was switched from a fixed rate to a managed float regime on Easter Weekend, 1993.[3] For a wider outline of the history of currency in the region, see Currencies of the British West Indies.\\r\\nIn 1966, coins were introduced in denominations of 1S, 5S, 10S, 25S & 50S. A large sized $1 coin was first released for circulation in 1969 and again in 1979 before being replaced with a smaller sized version in 1995 more regularly minted. The 1S & 5S are struck in bronze, with the other denominations in cupro-nickel. The obverses all feature Trinidad and Tobago's coat of arms, with the reverse designs solely featuring the denomination until 1976, when they were replaced by either a national bird or flower in addition to the denomination after the declaration of a republic. The 50S & $1 coins are scarcely seen in circulation, but can be purchased from banks if requested.\\r\\nThere are also coins minted in $5, $10, $100 and $200 denominations as well. These coins are not in circulation, and can only be obtained from the Central Bank of Trinidad and Tobago, either as part of a special 'eight-coin proof set' collection (in the case of the $5 and $10 coins) or individually (in the case of the $100 and $200 coins.) Notably, the $5 and $10 coins are minted in sterling silver, whereas the $100 and $200 are minted in gold. The price of the gold coins fluctuate depending on the current state of the market for gold.\\r\\nIn the nineteenth century, the British gold sovereign was valued at four Spanish silver dollars and eighty cents. When the sterling coinage was finally accepted as the main circulating coinage in the British West Indies, the Eastern Caribbean colonies continued nevertheless to use the dollar unit for accounting purposes. The West Indian dollar was therefore equivalent to four shillings and two pence.\\r\\nThis Royal Bank of Canada note reflects this state of affairs with its overt mention of the fact that one hundred dollars is equal to twenty pounds, sixteen shillings, and eight pence sterling. This state of affairs was exclusively confined to the Eastern Caribbean region, possibly due to the geographical proximity to British Guiana. British Guiana had a reason to wish to retain the dollar unit owing to its recent changeover from Dutch currency. These factors did not affect Jamaica, Bermuda, or the Bahamas which adopted the sterling currency in both coinage and as the unit of account.\\r\\nIn 1898, the Colonial Bank introduced $20 notes. These were followed in 1901 by $5. $100 notes were also issued. The last notes were issued in 1926, after which the Colonial Bank was taken over by Barclays Bank, which issued $5, $20 & $100 notes until 1941. In 1905, notes were introduced by the government in denominations of $1 & $2, followed by $5 in 1935, followed by $10 & $20 in 1942.\\r\\nThe Royal Bank of Canada introduced $5, $20 & $100 notes in 1909. From 1920, the notes also bore the denomination in sterling. 100-dollar notes were not issued after 1920, whilst the $5 and $20 were issued until 1938. The Canadian Bank of Commerce introduced $5, $20 & $100 notes in 1921, with the $5 & $20 notes issued until 1939. The Royal Bank of Canada one hundred dollar note, shown here; is a relic of a monetary system, in which the unit of account was related to the circulating coinage on the basis of two historical coins which were no longer in use.\\r\\nOn 14 December 1964, the Central Bank of Trinidad and Tobago introduced notes for $1, $5, $10 & $20.[4] New denominations in the form of $50 & $100 notes were issued on 6 June 1977, although the $50 note was not continued after a shipment was stolen prior to issue. The $50 note was taken out of its brief circulation. The reverses of the current notes feature the Central Bank Building of Trinidad & Tobago. The obverses have the coat of arms in the center, a national bird and a place in Trinidad, such as a market, petroleum refinery, etc. In 2002, new $1 & $20 notes were introduced. In 2003, new $1, $5, $10 & $100 were also introduced. The notes were only slightly changed; they now have more security features & darker colour. Recently, more security features have been added to the notes by the Central Bank of Trinidad and Tobago. In 2012 the $50 note was reintroduced to commemorate Trinidad and Tobago's Golden Jubilee of Independence. On the front of the note is a Red-capped cardinal bird and the commemorative text around the center of the coat of arms.[5] Two versions of this denomination were released, one without the commemorative text around the centre of the coat of arms (general circulation) and one with the commemorative text.\\r\\nBanknotes in circulation are","input":"What is the currency in trinidad and tobago?"},{"output":"September 29, 1899","context":"The Veterans of Foreign Wars (officially known as the Veterans of Foreign Wars of the United States) is a U.S. war veterans organization established on September 29, 1899, whose membership consists of veterans who, as United States Army soldiers, United States Navy sailors, United States Marines, United States Coast Guard sailors, and/or United States Air Force airmen, served the U.S. in wars, campaigns, and expeditions on foreign soil or hostile waters.[2][3][4]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Veterans of Foreign Wars of the United States resulted from the amalgamation of several societies formed immediately following the SpanishÿAmerican War in 1899, little groups of veterans returning from campaigning in Cuba and the Philippine Islands, founded local societies upon that spirit of comradeship, known only to those who have faced the dangers of war side by side. Similar experiences and a common language drew them together.[5] The American Veterans of Foreign Service (predecessor to the Veterans of Foreign Wars of the United States) was established in Columbus, Ohio, September 29, 1899, by Spanish?American War veteran James C. Putnam.[6] The Colorado Society, Army of the Philippines, was organized in Denver, Colorado, December 12, 1899. Shortly thereafter, a society known as Foreign Service Veterans was born in Pennsylvania. These organizations grew up side by side, increasing in scope and membership until 1913, when at a convention held at Denver, they merged their interests and identities in a national organization now known as the Veterans of Foreign Wars of the United States.[5]\\r\\nThe purpose of the VFW is to speed rehabilitation of the nations disabled and needy veterans, assist veterans widows and orphans and the dependents of needy or disabled veterans, and promote Americanism by means of education in patriotism and by constructive service to local communities. The organization maintains both its legislative service and central office of its national rehabilitation service in Washington. The latter nationwide program serves disabled veterans of all wars, members and nonmembers alike, in matters of U.S. government compensation and pension claims, hospitalization, civil-service employment preference, and etc.[4]\\r\\nThe VFW's National Military Services unites three successful, long-standing programs; Operation Uplink, Unmet Needs, and Military Assistance Program (MAP). These initiatives focus on troop support.[7]\\r\\nMAP is the link between the VFW and the community. MAP is designed to promote VFW interaction within the local military community through the Adopt-A-Unit Program. MAP Grants are available to posts, districts, and departments who participate in a variety of morale boosting functions such as farewell and welcome home events.[7]\\r\\nOperation Uplink keeps military members in contact with their loved ones by allowing deployed troops to call home at no charge from MWR internet cafs in Afghanistan, Kuwait and other locations all around the world. Operation Uplink also distributes \\"virtual pins\\" which enable wounded warriors and veterans in Veterans Affairs facilities to call from home at no cost.[7]\\r\\nUnmet Needs assists military service members and their families who run into unexpected financial difficulties as a result of deployment or other hardships directly related to military service. Assistance is in the form of a grant of up to US$2,500. Unmet Needs assists with basic life needs such as: mortgage and rent, home and auto repairs, insurance, utilities, food and clothing.[7]\\r\\nThe good will of the VFW reaches far beyond the realm of veterans helping veterans.[8]\\r\\nThe VFW celebrates Americanism in communities across the nation.

The living standards in the Dominican Republic are considerably higher than those in Haiti. The deep-set cultural differences have contributed to a long-standing conflict.\\r\\n\\r\\nThough having vast demographic and cultural differences since colonial times, the inhabitants of modern-day Dominican Republic and Haiti have at times been allies and foes, constantly vying for dominance of Hispaniola. The conflicts began during the colonial era which developed into military and political conflicts between the two governments.[1] The political division of the island of Hispaniola is due in part to the European struggle for control of the New World during the 17th century, when France and Spain began fighting for control of the island. They resolved their dispute in 1697 by splitting the island into two countries.[2] It was not until the 19th century that Haiti became independent from France on January 1, 1804. Spanish Haiti, the predecessor of the Dominican Republic, became independent from Spain on December 1, 1821, after more than 300 years of Spanish rule.\\r\\n\\r\\nBy the end of the eighteenth century, the French colony was populated primarily by black African slaves who spoke Kreyl, a language derived from West African languages, and practiced voodoo, a religion influenced by West African spirituality. The people living in the Spanish colony, however, who represented less than one-fifth of the French colony's population, were primarily white and mulatto Spanish-speaking Roman Catholics.[3] In the midst of the Haitian Revolution, Spain ceded the Spanish part of Hispaniola to France in return for lands that had been conquered in Europe. This drew Santo Domingo deeply into the battles of the Haitian Revolution, as France sought to use its new acquisition as a base from which to quash the revolt. In 1801 Haitian leader Toussaint Louverture sought to frustrate the French strategy by occupying Santo Domingo. Before the arrival of the French troops his army marched east and expeditiously took over the former Spanish colony. When French forces landed the following year with the aim of seizing the entire island, they were unable to capture Saint-Domingue. They did succeed, however, in occupying Santo Domingo. French forces in Santo Domingo threatened Haitian sovereignty, and the French governor of Santo Domingo further provoked Haiti by authorizing colonists to capture and enslave Haitians. In 1805 Haitian president Jean-Jacques Dessalines responded with an unsuccessful invasion of Santo Domingo. Dominicans ejected the French in 1809 and reincorporated themselves into the Spanish Empire.[4]\\r\\n\\r\\nOn November 9, 1821 the Spanish colony of Santo Domingo was overthrown by a group of rebels at the command of Jos N~?ez de Cceres, the colony's former administrator,[1][5] as they proclaimed independence from the Spanish crown on December 1, 1821.[6] The new nation was known as Republic of Spanish Haiti (Spanish: Rep~blica del Hait Espa?ol), as Haiti had been the indigenous name of the island.[5][contradictory]\\r\\n\\r\\nA group of Dominican military officers favored uniting the newly independent nation with Haiti, as they sought for political stability under Haitian president Jean-Pierre Boyer. The Dominicans were unaware that Boyer made a concession with the French, and agreed to pay France for the lost territory of Haiti. Boyer agreed to pay a sum of 150 million Francs (more than twice what France had charged the United States for the much larger Louisiana territory in 1803) thus the Haitians would essentially be forced into paying to maintain their freedom from the French.\\r\\n\\r\\nDuring twenty-two years of Haitian occupation, the Haitians implemented what some Dominicans viewed as a brutal military regime.[citation needed] Use of the French language over Spanish was enforced, and the army closed Universidad Santo Toms de Aquino. In addition, the Haitian army confiscated all church land and property and imposed mandatory military service. This difficult time for the Dominicans created cultural conflicts in language, race, religion and national tradition between the Dominicans and Haitians. Many Dominicans developed a resentment of Haitians, who they saw as oppressors.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn order to raise funds for the huge indemnity of 150 million francs that Haiti agreed to pay the former French colonists, and which was subsequently lowered to 60 million francs, Haiti imposed heavy taxes on the Dominicans. Since Haiti was unable to adequately provision its army, the occupying forces largely survived by commandeering or confiscating food and supplies at gunpoint. Attempts to redistribute land conflicted with the system of communal land tenure (terrenos comuneros), which had arisen with the ranching economy, and newly emancipated slaves resented being forced to grow cash crops under Boyer's Code Rural.[7] In rural areas, the Haitian administration was usually too inefficient to enforce its own laws. It was in the city of Santo Domingo that the effects of the occupation were most acutely felt, and it was there that the movement for independence originated.[citation needed]\\r\\n\\r\\nHaiti's constitution also forbade non-citizens from owning land. However, it did protect citizens who were recognized for owning land from others who may have tried and taken this land from them. According to their constitution, it was unlawful for one to deny property from A citizen who already owned it. Template:Constitution of Haiti, 1964. Washington: Pan American Union, 1968. Print. Most emigrated to Cuba, Puerto Rico (these two being Spanish possessions at the time) or Gran Colombia, usually with the encouragement of Haitian officials, who acquired their lands. The Haitians, who associated the Roman Catholic Church with the French slave-masters who had exploited them before independence, confiscated all church property, deported all foreign clergy, and severed the ties of the remaining clergy to the Vatican. Santo Domingo's university, lacking both students and teachers had to close down, and thus the country suffered from a massive case of human capital flight.\\r\\n\\r\\nAlthough the occupation effectively eliminated colonial slavery and instated a constitution modeled after the United States Constitution throughout the island, several resolutions and written dispositions were expressly aimed at converting average Dominicans into second-class citizens: restrictions of movement, prohibition to run for public office, night curfews, inability to travel in groups, banning of civilian organizations, and the indefinite closure of the state university (on the alleged grounds of its being a subversive organization) all led to the creation of movements advocating a forceful separation from Haiti with no compromises.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn February 27, 1844, the people of Santo Domingo ended more than two decades of Haitian misrule by proclaiming their independence and welcoming home from exile the great advocate of Dominican nationalism, Juan Pablo Duarte. The new government was promptly beset by a three-pronged Haitian invasion, successfully repelled by an outnumbered, outarmed, and outtrained Dominican army under the command of the wealthy rancher Gen. Pedro Santana. The Dominicans thwarted the Haitians at sea, as well as on land. The first naval battle was fought on April 15, 1844. Three Dominican schooners under the command of Juan Bautista Cambiaso defeated a Haitian brigantine and two schooners off the coast of Azua. The sea battle not only protected the Dominican soldiers fighting in Azua, it also ensured Dominican naval superiority for the rest of the war. Haiti was not reconciled to the loss of the eastern, Spanish-speaking two-thirds of the island of Hispaniola. On March 9, 1849, President Faustin Soulouque of Haiti led 10,000 troops in an invasion of the Dominican Republic. Soulouque's forces were defeated and had to retreat, leaving a path of pillage and destruction in their wake.[8] Dominican President Buenaventura Bez launched a naval offensive against Haiti to forestall the threat of another invasion. His seamen under the French adventurer, Fagalde, raided the Haitian coasts, plundered seaside villages, as far as Cape Dame Marie, and butchered crews of captured enemy ships. Fagalde left the southern coast of Haiti aflame, but Soulouque's only immediate answer was to illuminate with holiday torches the streets of the capital in celebration of his first coronation.[9] In November 1855, Soulouque, having proclaimed himself Emperor Faustin I of a Haitian empire which he hoped to expand to include the Dominican Republic, invaded his neighbor again, this time with a ravaging and looting army of 30,000 men marching in three columns. In January of the following year, a Haitian contingent of 6,000 soldiers was terribly defeated in the border town of Ouanaminthe. More than 1,000 men were killed, and many were wounded.[10] After a Dominican victory by 8,000 defenders at Sabana Larga over 22,000 Haitians, the last Haitian invader had been pushed back over the frontier. Since then, DominicanÿHaitian relations have been unstable.[11]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn October 1937, claiming that Haiti was harboring his former Dominican opponents, Rafael Trujillo ordered an attack on the border, slaughtering tens of thousands of Haitians as they tried to escape. The number of dead is still unknown, though it is now calculated between 20,000[12] and 30,000.[13]\\r\\n\\r\\nOn the Dominican side, the people referred to the mass murder as el corte, the cutting, while the Haitians called it kout kouto-a, the stabbing. Eyewitness accounts from that week reported the terror they saw as Haitians ran screaming across the river near Dajab܇n as they tried to reach safety in Ouanaminthe, just over the border in Haiti. The soldiers followed them into the river to cut them down, causing the river to run with blood and bodies for several days.[14] After the initial slaughter, the bridge crossing between the nations closed, preventing escape and adding to the death toll.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the mid-twentieth century, the economies of the two countries were comparable. Since that time, the Dominican economy has grown while the Haitian economy has diminished. The economic downturn in Haiti has been the result of factors such as internal power struggles, rapid population growth, environmental degradation, and trade embargoes. Today, Haiti is the poorest country in the Western Hemisphere. There is a lack of resources, and Haiti's population density exceeds its neighbor's by far. Despite the UN sending missions since the 1990s, in order to maintain peace, terrible conditions persist.[15]\\r\\n\\r\\nOne large contributor to cultural dissonance is the language barrier, as Spanish is the primary language spoken in the eastern part of Hispaniola (Dominican Republic) while French and Haitian Creole are spoken in the western part (Haiti). Race is another defining factor of DominicanÿHaitian relations. The ethnic composition of the Dominican population is 73%?mulatto,[16] 16%?white, and 11%?black;[17] while 95% of the Haitian population is black.[18]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Dominican economy is also over 600% larger than the Haitian economy. The estimated annual per capita income is US$1,300 in Haiti and US$8,200 in Dominican Republic.[19]\\r\\nThe divergence between the level of economic development between Haiti and the Dominican Republic makes their border the one with the highest contrast of all Western world borders and it is evident that the Dominican Republic has one of the highest illegal migration issues in the Americas.[20]\\r\\n\\r\\nSome cross-border cooperation exists in areas such as health, business, and infrastructure. Many Haitians travel to the Dominican Republic to find seasonal or long-term work in order to send remittances to their families. Some of these Haitian workers, as well as Dominicans of Haitian descent have reported complaints of discrimination against them by the Dominican majority population. Other Haitians who would seek work, instead remain in Haiti, fearing discrimination on the other side of the border.[21]\\r\\n\\r\\nMigration has been taking place since the 1920s, when Haitian laborers were actively encouraged to come work in the thriving Dominican sugar industry. With modernization from the 1960s on, fewer workers were required, and other Dominican industries and services started employing more Haitian workers, often an inexpensive, less regulated labor source with fewer legal protections. Many Haitian women find work in Dominican households, and Haitian men at Dominican construction sites, often leading to the move of an entire family.[21]\\r\\n\\r\\nA large number of migrated Haitian workers have continued to live in the Dominican Republic over several generations. The two governments have been unable to agree upon a legal framework to address the nationality of these descendants, leaving around one million people of Haitian ancestry in the Dominican Republic effectively stateless, restricting their access to health care, education and employment opportunities.[21]\\r\\n\\r\\nThough migration from Haiti to the Dominican Republic is economically beneficial to both countries, it is one of the leading contributors to tension between the two countries as well; illegal immigration from Haiti resonates high dissonance with the Dominican people. It has led to anti-Haitian feelings and mistrust of the Haitian people. Another problem with Haitian migration into Dominican Republic is that it blurs the line of citizenship. This factor of migration affects not only Dominican economy but its culture as well.[22]\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter the devastating earthquake of 12 January 2010, countless Haitians fled across the border to escape the quake's effects. The Dominican government was one of the first to send teams to help distribute food and medicine to the victims and made it easier for Haitians to acquire visas to receive treatment in Dominican hospitals.  Supplies were transported to Haiti through the Dominican Republic, and many injured Haitians have been treated in Dominican hospitals. Virtually, every level of the Dominican efforts assisted its neighboring country.[23]\\r\\n\\r\\nHaitian refugees were also taken in and supported by many Dominicans, though relations deteriorated as the refugees have remained in the Dominican Republic. This has led to reported concerns among some Dominicans that quake refugees contribute to rising crime, over-crowding, cholera and unemployment. More and more discrimination has been attributed to the massive numbers of Haitian refugees in the Dominican Republic. Over the past years tensions have risen, causing the International Organization for Migration to offer Haitians $50 each plus additional relocation assistance to return to Haiti. More than 1,500 have accepted that assistance and returned.[23]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe baseball federations of the Dominican Republic and Haiti have agreed to develop and promote baseball in Haiti (especially at the border), on the basis that sport is a developmental element to foster peace, as well as strengthening friendship and mutual respect between the two peoples. With the support of the Dominican ministry of Sports, the president of the Dominican Baseball Federation (FEDOBE) was thankful and quoted saying \\"it allows our federation to fulfill the dream of helping Haiti in baseball.\\" He has pledged to put the Haitian Baseball Federation in relation to the international organizations. Coaches will be sent to Haiti for technical courses, referees and scorers by the Dominican Baseball Federation, while the Haitian Federation will support the logistics in the training and training programs.[24]","input":"Who was there first haiti or dominican republic?"},{"output":"San Fernando Valley area of Los Angeles","context":"A Cinderella Story is a 2004 American teen romantic comedy film directed by Mark Rosman, written by Leigh Dunlap and stars Hilary Duff, Chad Michael Murray, Jennifer Coolidge and Regina King. A modernization of the classic Cinderella folklore, the film's plot revolves around two Internet pen pals who plan to meet in person at their high school's Halloween dance.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe film was released on July 16, 2004. While it received negative reviews from critics, the film was a box office success, grossing $70 million against its $19 million budget, and spawned three straight-to-video sequels.\\r\\n\\r\\nSam Montgomery lives in the San Fernando Valley area of Los Angeles, with her widowed father Hal, who runs a popular sports-themed diner. Feeling Sam needs a mother, Hal marries a vain gold digger named Fiona, who has socially-awkward fraternal twin daughters, Brianna and Gabriella. During the 1994 Northridge earthquake, Hal is killed when he runs to save Fiona. Due to him having supposedly left no will, Fiona receives all of his belongings, including the house, the diner, and to her dismay, Sam.\\r\\n\\r\\nEight years later, Sam is employed as a waitress at the diner to save money to attend Princeton University, but she is regularly tormented by her step-family, who constantly insult her and treat her as if they were popular, despite being regarded as obnoxious. Even worse, Fiona, in her vanity, uses the inheritance to live as if they were insanely rich, including spending on minor facial surgeries, and even refuses to save water during the ongoing drought. She has also transformed Hal's beloved diner into something befitting of her own image, demands that salmon be served and included in over half the dishes and takes Sam's earnings. Sam struggles to cope socially at North Valley High School, where queen bee cheerleader Shelby Cummings also torments her and calls her \\"Diner Girl\\", along with other members of the popular clique.\\r\\n\\r\\nSam confides in her online pen pal \\"Nomad\\" about her dream to attend Princeton, a dream which he also shares. However, Nomad's true identity is Austin Ames, the popular, yet unhappy, quarterback of the school's football team and Shelby's ex-boyfriend, although she refuses to accept that he has broken up with her. He is unhappy because his father planned for him to go to the University of Southern California with a football scholarship rather than going to Princeton. Nomad proposes that they meet in person at the school's Halloween-themed homecoming dance. On the night of the dance, Fiona orders Sam to work the night shift at the diner, then leaves to drive Brianna and Gabriella to the dance. Initially reluctant, Sam is convinced by her best friend, Carter Ferrell, to go to the dance and meet her mysterious online friend.\\r\\n\\r\\nRhonda, the diner's head waitress who has looked after Sam, and the rest of the diner staff also convince her to disobey Fiona and go to the dance anyway. Sam, wearing a mask and Rhonda's old wedding dress, meets Nomad at the dance, and is surprised to learn that he is Austin, who had become smitten with her upon her entrance. The two decide to leave the party to walk alone and get to know each other a little better. While sharing a romantic dance, Sam and Austin begin to fall in love. But just as Austin is about to unmask her, Sam's cell phone alarm goes off, warning her to return to the diner before Fiona at midnight. She leaves without revealing her identity to Austin, and drops her phone on the way out.\\r\\n\\r\\nAustin picks up her phone and begins a desperate search to figure out who his \\"Cinderella\\" really is, but every girl at school claims to be the mysterious owner of the phone. Sam is reluctant to reveal her identity to Austin, feeling that he will not accept her due to their different social circles. When Austin comes into the diner one day, Sam is forced to help him and, after a talk, she attempts to reveal her identity to him, but is cut off by Fiona. Sam's stepsisters end up discovering Sam and Austin's email relationship, and (after having failed to convince Austin that one of them is the owner of the phone) convince Shelby that Sam tried to steal Austin from her. During a pep rally, they and the other cheerleaders humiliate Sam in front of the entire school and expose her identity, as well as naming her an impostor, horrifying the school staff, Carter and Sam. Austin, hurt by Sam's secrecy, is unable to step up to defend her, and Sam leaves the pep rally in tears.\\r\\n\\r\\nLike Austin, Sam is revealed to have been accepted to Princeton, only to be duped by Fiona into believing she was rejected by having a fake rejection letter made in order to keep Sam working at the diner and as her slave. Sam then decides to give up on her dreams and resigns herself to a lifetime of working at the diner, but Rhonda gives Sam a pep talk on not losing hope. When her stepsisters come into the diner, they slam the door, causing a guitar clock to fall off the wall, tearing the wallpaper down with it, and quickly blame it on Sam. However, the torn section reveals an inspirational quote Hal often said, \\"Never let the fear of striking out keep you from playing the game\\" (in real life, this quote came from Babe Ruth) and fills Sam with hope. She stands up to Fiona and her stepsisters stating that she will no longer put up with their emotional abuse, quits her job at the diner, and moves in with Rhonda, who also quits along with the entire diner staff, all of whom had only put up with so many years of Fiona's abuse after Hal's death for Sam's sake. The customers, who witness the entire scene, promptly leave in disgust as well.\\r\\n\\r\\nBefore the school's homecoming football game, Sam confronts Austin about his cowardice and not defending her at the pep rally, as well as for his seeming reluctance to show his true self. Before the final play of the game, he sees Sam making her way out of the stands, and finally stands up to his father, saying he wants to attend Princeton rather than simply play football all his life. He chases after Sam and apologizes. She accepts his apology, and they share their first kiss as rain falls over the drought-plagued valley (at the same time, the North Valley High Fighting Frogs win the football game). Soon after, Sam finds Hal's will hidden in her childhood fairy-tale book, stating that all of his money and possessions actually belong to her. Since this leaves her as the rightful and legal owner, Sam sells her step-family's fancy cars so that she can pay for college, and Fiona, who claims to have never seen the will before despite the fact she clearly signed it as a witness, is arrested for financial fraud and violating California's child labor laws for all the times she made Sam work long hours at the diner in spite of her being a minor.\\r\\n\\r\\nSam finds that she was in fact accepted at Princeton; the acceptance letter is retrieved from the garbage by her stepsisters, who knew where Fiona hid it. Fiona, Brianna, and Gabriella are made by the District Attorney to work off the money they stole from Sam at the diner, which is restored to its former glory by its new owners, Sam and Rhonda. Also, Austin's father comes to accept his son's desire to attend Princeton. Things even work out in the end for Carter as he makes a commercial for a new acne medication. Shelby, having previously cheated off of Carter's school work and rejected him for being an outcast even after he was a proper gentleman to her at the Halloween dance, aims to pursue him since he is now popular, but after finally seeing her true colors at the pep rally, he turns her down for Astrid, the high school's goth DJ and announcer. The film ends with Sam and Austin, now officially a couple, driving off to Princeton together after Sam gets her phone back from Austin.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn Rotten Tomatoes, the film has an approval rating of 11% based on 103 reviews, with an average rating of 3.6/10. The site's critical consensus reads, \\"An uninspired, generic updating of the classic fairy tale.\\"[2] On Metacritic, the film has a score on 25 out of 100, based on 30 critics, indicating \\"generally unfavorable reviews\\".[3] Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \\"Aÿ\\" on an A+ to F scale.[4]\\r\\n\\r\\nRoger Ebert called A Cinderella Story \\"a lame, stupid movie\\".[5] The film was nominated for five Teen Choice Awards at the 2005 ceremony, winning the award for Choice Movie Blush Scene, the same year Duff won the Kids Choice Awards for Favorite Movie Actress. In 2005, Duff also received a nomination for the Golden Raspberry Award for Worst Actress.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn its opening weekend, the film grossed $13,623,350 in 2,625 theaters in the United States and Canada, ranking #4 at the box office, behind I, Robot, Spider-Man 2 and Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy. The next week, it dropped in #5, with newcomers The Bourne Supremacy and Catwoman. By the end of its run, A Cinderella Story grossed $51,438,175 domestically and $18,629,734 internationally, totaling $70,067,909 worldwide.[1]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe film was followed by three direct-to-video sequels, are featured the modern day versions of the Cinderella character: Another Cinderella Story (2008) with Selena Gomez, A Cinderella Story: Once Upon a Song (2011) with Lucy Hale and A Cinderella Story: If the Shoe Fits (2016) with Sofia Carson. The sequels use the themes and situations but do not contain any characters from the first film. Unlike the first film, the sequels also include musical and dance themes.","input":"What is the setting of a cinderella story?"},{"output":"every four years","context":"The Commonwealth Games are an international multi-sport event involving athletes from the Commonwealth of Nations. The event was first held in 1930, and has taken place every four years since then.[1] The Commonwealth Games were known as the British Empire Games from 1930 to 1950, the British Empire and Commonwealth Games from 1954 to 1966, and British Commonwealth Games from 1970 to 1974. It is the world's first multi-sport event which inducted equal number of womens and mens medal events and was implemented recently in the 2018 Commonwealth Games.[2]\\r\\nTheir creation was inspired by the Inter-Empire Championships, as a part of the Festival of Empire, which were held in London, United Kingdom in 1911. Melville Marks Robinson founded the games as the British Empire Games which were first hosted in Hamilton in 1930.[3] During the 20th and 21st centuries, the evolution of the games movement has resulted in several changes to the Commonwealth Games. Some of these adjustments include the creation of the Commonwealth Winter Games for snow and ice sports for the commonwealth athletes,[4] the Commonwealth Paraplegic Games for commonwealth athletes with a disability[5] and the Commonwealth Youth Games for commonwealth athletes aged 14 to 18. The first edition of the winter games and paraplegic games were held in 1958 and 1962 respectively, with their last edition held in 1966 and 1974 respectively and the first youth games were held in 2000. The 1942 and 1946 Commonwealth Games were cancelled because of the second world war.[6]\\r\\nThe Commonwealth Games are overseen by the Commonwealth Games Federation (CGF), which also controls the sporting programme and selects the host cities. The games movement consists of international sports federations (IFs), Commonwealth Games Associations (CGAs), and organising committees for each specific Commonwealth Games. There are several rituals and symbols, such as the Commonwealth Games flag and Queen's Baton, as well as the opening and closing ceremonies. Over 5,000 athletes compete at the Commonwealth Games in more than 15 different sports and more than 250 events. The first, second, and third-place finishers in each event receive Commonwealth Games medals: gold, silver, and bronze, respectively. Apart from many Olympic sports, the games also include some sports that are played predominantly in Commonwealth countries but which are not part of the Olympic programme, such as lawn bowls, netball and squash.[7]\\r\\nAlthough there are currently 53 members of the Commonwealth of Nations, 71 teams currently participate in the Commonwealth Games, as a number of dependent territories compete under their own flags. The four Home Nations of the United KingdomEngland, Scotland, Wales, and Northern Irelandalso send separate teams.\\r\\nNineteen cities in nine countries (counting England, Wales, and Scotland separately) have hosted the event. Australia has hosted the Commonwealth Games five times (1938, 1962, 1982, 2006 and 2018); this is more times than any other nation. Two cities have hosted Commonwealth Games more than once: Auckland (1950, 1990) and Edinburgh (1970, 1986).\\r\\nOnly six countries have attended every Commonwealth Games: Australia, Canada, England, New Zealand, Scotland, and Wales. Australia has been the highest achieving team for twelve games, England for seven, and Canada for one.\\r\\nThe most recent Commonwealth Games were held at Gold Coast from 4 to 15 April 2018. The next Commonwealth Games are to be held in Birmingham from 27 July to 7 August 2022.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nA sporting competition bringing together the members of the British Empire was first proposed by John Astley Cooper in 1900, when he wrote an article in The Times suggesting a \\"Pan-Britannic-Pan-Anglican Contest and Festival every four years as a means of increasing goodwill and good understanding of the British Empire\\". John Astley Cooper Committees were formed worldwide (e.g. Australia) and helped Pierre de Coubertin to get his international Olympic Games off the ground.[8] In 1911, the Festival of the Empire was held at The Crystal Palace in London to celebrate the coronation of George V. As part of the Festival of the Empire, an Inter-Empire Championships were held in which teams from Australia, Canada, South Africa, and the United Kingdom competed in athletics, boxing, wrestling and swimming events.\\r\\nCanada won the championships and was gifted a silver cup which was 2 feet 6 inch high and weighed 340 oz (9.6 kg). It was gifted by Lord Lonsdale. However, the 1911 championships were followed by the first world war which happened from 1914 to 1918. The organisers had lost hopes of hosting such sporting events for the empire athletes.\\r\\nMelville Marks Robinson, who went to the 1928 Summer Olympics in Amsterdam to serve as the manager of the Canadian track and field team, strongly lobbied for the proposal of organising the first British Empire Games in Hamilton in 1930.\\r\\nThe?1930?British Empire?Games?were the first of what later become known as the?Commonwealth Games, and were held in?Hamilton, in the province of?Ontario?in?Canada?from August 16ÿ23, 1930.\\r\\nEleven countries sent a total of 400 athletes to the Hamilton Games. The opening and closing ceremonies as well as athletics took place at Civic Stadium. The participant nations were Australia, Bermuda, British Guyana, Canada, England, Northern Ireland, Newfoundland, New Zealand, Scotland, South Africa and Wales. The Hamilton Games featured six sports: athletics, boxing, lawn bowls, rowing, swimming and diving and wrestling and ran at a cost of $97,973. Women competed in only the aquatic events.[9] Canadian triple jumper Gordon Smallacombe won the first ever gold medal in the history of the Games.[3]\\r\\nThe?1934 British Empire Games?were the second of what is now known as the?Commonwealth Games, held in London, England. The host city was?London, with the main venue at?Wembley Park, although the track cycling events were in?Manchester. The 1934 Games had originally been awarded to Johannesburg, but were given to London instead because of serious concerns about prejudice against black and Asian athletes in South Africa. Seventeen national teams took part, including the Irish Free State (the only Games in which they did take part) and new participants Hong Kong, India, Jamaica, Southern Rhodesia and Trinidad and Tobago.[10]\\r\\nThe?1938 British Empire Games?were the third?British Empire Games, which were held in?Sydney,?New South Wales, Australia. They were timed to coincide with Sydney's sesqui-centenary (150 years since the foundation of British settlement in Australia).?Held in the southern hemisphere for the first time, the III Games opening ceremony took place at the famed Sydney Cricket Ground in front of 40,000 spectators. Fifteen nations participated down under at the Sydney Games involving a total of 464 athletes and 43 officials. Fiji and Ceylon made their debuts. Seven sports were featured in the Sydney Games ÿ athletics, boxing, cycling, lawn bowls, rowing, swimming and diving and wrestling.[11]\\r\\nThe?1950 British Empire Games?were the fourth edition and was held in?Auckland, New Zealand after a 12-year gap from the third edition of the games. The fourth games were originally awarded to?Montreal, Canada?and were to be held in 1942 but were cancelled due to?the Second World War. The opening ceremony at Eden Park was attended by 40,000 spectators, while nearly 250,000 people attended the Auckland Games. Twelve countries sent a total of 590 athletes to Auckland. Malaya and Nigeria made their first appearances.[12]\\r\\nThe fifth edition of the games, the 1954 British Empire and Commonwealth Games, were held in?Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada. These were the first games since the name change from?British Empire Games?took effect in 1952. The fifth edition of the Games placed Vancouver on a world stage and featured memorable sporting moments as well as outstanding entertainment, technical innovation and cultural events. The Miracle Mile, as it became known, saw both the gold medallist, Roger Bannister of England and silver medallist John Landy of Australia, run sub-four minute races in an event that was televised live across the world for the first time. Northern Rhodesia and Pakistan made their debuts and both performed well, winning eight and six medals respectively.[13]\\r\\nThe?1958 British Empire and Commonwealth Games were held in?Cardiff,?Wales.?The sixth edition of the games marked the largest sporting event ever held in Wales and it was the smallest country ever to host a British Empire and Commonwealth Games. Cardiff had to wait 12 years longer than originally scheduled to become host of the Games, as the 1946 event was cancelled because of the Second World War. The Cardiff Games introduced the?Queen's Baton Relay, which has been conducted as a prelude to every British Empire and Commonwealth Games ever since. Thirty-five nations sent a total of 1,122 athletes and 228 officials to the Cardiff Games and 23 countries and dependencies won medals, including for the first time, Singapore, Ghana, Kenya and the Isle of Man.[14]\\r\\nThe?1962 British Empire and Commonwealth Games?were held in?Perth,?Western Australia,?Australia. Thirty-five countries sent a total of 863 athletes and 178 officials to Perth. Jersey was among the medal winners for the first time, while British Honduras, Dominica, Papua and New Guinea and St Lucia all made their inaugural Games appearances. Aden also competed by special invitation. Sarawak, North Borneo and Malaya competed for the last time before taking part in 1966 under the Malaysian flag. In addition, Rhodesia and Nyasaland competed in the Games as an entity for the first and only time.[15]\\r\\nThe?1966 British Empire and Commonwealth Games?were held in?Kingston, Jamaica. This was the first time that the Games had been held outside the so-called?White Dominions. Thirty-four nations (including South Arabia) competed in the Kingston Games sending a total of 1,316 athletes and officials.[16]\\r\\nThe?1970 British Commonwealth Games?were held in?Edinburgh,?Scotland.?This was the first time the name?British Commonwealth Games?was adopted, the first time?metric units?rather than?imperial units?were used in events, the first time the games were held in?Scotland and also the first time that HM Queen Elizabeth II attended in her capacity as Head of the Commonwealth.[17]\\r\\nThe?1974 British?Commonwealth Games?were held in?Christchurch,?New Zealand. The Games were officially named \\"the friendly games\\".?Following the massacre of Israeli athletes at the 1972 Munich Olympics, the tenth games at Christchurch were the first multi-sport event to place the safety of participants and spectators as its uppermost requirement. Security guards surrounded the athletes village and there was an exceptionally high-profile police presence. Only 22 countries succeeded in winning medals from the total haul of 374 medals on offer, but first time winners included Western Samoa, Lesotho and Swaziland.[18]\\r\\nThe?1978?Commonwealth Games?were held in?Edmonton, Alberta, Canada. This event was the first to bear the current day name of the Commonwealth Games and also marked a new high as almost 1,500 athletes from 46 countries took part. They were boycotted by Nigeria in protest of New Zealand's sporting contacts with apartheid-era South Africa, as well as by Uganda in protest of alleged Canadian hostility towards the government of Idi Amin.[19][20]\\r\\nThe?1982?Commonwealth Games?were held in?Brisbane,?Queensland,?Australia. Forty-six nations participated in the Brisbane Games with a new record total of 1,583 athletes and 571 officials. As hosts, Australia headed the medal table leading the way ahead of England, Canada, Scotland and New Zealand respectively. Zimbabwe made its first appearance at the Games, having earlier competed as Southern Rhodesia and as part of Rhodesia and Nyasaland.[21]\\r\\nThe?1986 Commonwealth Games?were held in Edinburgh, Scotland and were the second Games to be held in Edinburgh. Participation at the 1986 Games was affected by a boycott by 32 African, Asian and Caribbean nations in protest of British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher's refusal to condemn sporting contacts of apartheid era South Africa in 1985, but the Games rebounded and continued to grow thereafter. Twenty-six nations did attend the second Edinburgh Games and sent a total of 1,662 athletes and 461 officials.[22]\\r\\nThe?1990 Commonwealth Games?were held in?Auckland,?New Zealand. It was the fourteenth?Commonwealth Games, the third to be hosted by New Zealand and Aucklands second. A new record of 55 nations participated in the second Auckland Games sending 2,826 athletes and officials.[23] Pakistan returned to the Commonwealth in 1989 after withdrawing in 1972, and competed in the 1990 Games after an absence of twenty years.[24]\\r\\nThe 1994 Commonwealth Games were held in?Victoria, British Columbia, the fourth to take place in Canada. The games marked?South Africa's return to the Commonwealth Games following the?apartheid?era, and over 30 years since the country last competed in the?Games in 1958. Namibia made its Commonwealth Games debut. It was also?Hong Kong's last appearance at the games before the?transfer of sovereignty?from Britain to?China. Sixty-three nations sent 2,557 athletes and 914 officials.[25]\\r\\nThe?1998 Commonwealth Games?were held in?Kuala Lumpur,?Malaysia. For the first time in its 68-year history, the Commonwealth Games were held in Asia. The sixteenth games were also the first Games to feature team sports - an overwhelming success that added large numbers to both participant and TV audience numbers. A new record of 70 countries sent a total of 5,065 athletes and officials to the Kuala Lumpur Games. The top five countries in the medal standing were Australia, England, Canada, Malaysia and South Africa. Nauru also achieved an impressive haul of three gold medals. Cameroon, Mozambique and Kiribati debuted.[26]\\r\\nThe?2002 Commonwealth Games were held in?Manchester, England. The 2002 Games were to be hosted in England to coincide with the?Golden Jubilee of Elizabeth II, head of the?Commonwealth. In terms of sports and events, the 2002 Games were until the 2010 edition the largest Commonwealth Games in history featuring 281 events across 17 sports. The final medal tally was led by Australia, followed by host England and Canada. The 2002 Commonwealth Games had set a new benchmark for hosting the Commonwealth Games and for cities wishing to bid for them with a heavy emphasis on legacy.[27]\\r\\nThe?2006?Commonwealth Games were held in?Melbourne, Victoria, Australia. The only difference between the 2006 games and the?2002 games?was the absence of?Zimbabwe, which withdrew from the?Commonwealth of Nations. For the first time in the history of the Games the Queen's Baton visited every single Commonwealth nation and territory taking part in the Games, a journey of 180,000?km (112,500 miles). Over 4000 athletes took part in the sporting competitions. Again the Top 3 on the medal table is Australia, followed by England and Canada.[28]\\r\\nThe 2010 Commonwealth Games were held in Delhi, India. The Games cost $11?billion and are the most expensive Commonwealth Games ever. It was the first time that the Commonwealth Games were held in India,also the first time that a Commonwealth Republic hosted the games and the second time they were held in Asia after?Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia in?1998.?A total of 6,081 athletes from 71?Commonwealth nations and dependencies?competed in 21 sports and 272 events. The final?medal tally?was led by?Australia. The host nation India achieved its?best performance ever in any sporting event, finishing second overall.[29] Rwanda made its Games debut.[30]\\r\\nThe 2014 Commonwealth Games were held in Glasgow, Scotland. It was the largest?multi-sport event?ever held in Scotland with around 4,950 athletes from 71 different nations and territories competing in 18 different sports, outranking the?1970?and?1986?Commonwealth Games in Edinburgh, capital city of Scotland.?Usain Bolt competed in the?4G100 metres relay?of the?2014 Commonwealth Games and set a?Commonwealth Games record with his teammates.[31] The Games received acclaim for their organisation, attendance, and the public enthusiasm of the people of Scotland, with?Commonwealth Games Federation?chief executive Mike Hooper hailing them as \\"the standout games in the history of the movement\\".[32]\\r\\nThe 2018 Commonwealth Games were held in Gold Coast, Queensland, Australia, the fifth time Australia hosted the Games. There were an equal number of events for men and women, the first time in history that a major?multi-sport event?had equality in terms of events.[33][34]\\r\\nThe 2022 Commonwealth Games will be held in Birmingham, England. They will be the third Commonwealth Games to be hosted in England following London 1934 and Manchester 2002.[35]\\r\\nThe three nations to have hosted the Commonwealth Games the most times are Australia (5), Canada (4) and New Zealand (3). Furthermore, six editions have taken place in the countries within the United Kingdom (Scotland (3), England (2) and Wales (1)), twice in Asia (Malaysia (1) and India (1)) and once in the Caribbean (Jamaica (1)).[1]\\r\\nThe Commonwealth Paraplegic Games were an international, multi-sport event involving athletes with a disability from the Commonwealth countries. The event was sometimes referred to as the Paraplegic Empire Games and British Commonwealth Paraplegic Games. Athletes were generally those with spinal injuries or polio. The event was first held in 1962 and disestablished in 1974.[36] The Games were held in the country hosting the Commonwealth Games for able-bodied athletes. The countries that had hosted the Commonwealth Paraplegic Games were Australia, Jamaica, Scotland and New Zealand in 1962, 1966, 1970 and 1974 respectively. Six countries  Australia, England, New Zealand, Northern Ireland, Scotland and Wales  had been represented at all Commonwealth Paraplegic Games. Australia and England had been the top-ranking nation two times each: 1962, 1974 and 1966, 1970 respectively.\\r\\nAthletes with a disability were then first included in exhibition events at the 1994 Commonwealth Games in Victoria, British Columbia,[37] and, at the 2002 Commonwealth Games in Manchester, England, they were included as full members of their national teams, making them the first fully inclusive international multi-sport games. This meant that results were included in the medal count.[38]\\r\\nDuring the 2007 General Assembly of the Commonwealth Games Federation (CGF) at Colombo, Sri Lanka, the International Paralympic Committee (IPC) and CGF signed a co-operative agreement to ensure a formal institutional relationship between the two bodies and secure the future participation of elite athletes with a disability (EAD) in future Commonwealth Games.\\r\\nIPC President Philip Craven said during the General Assembly:\\r\\n IPC President Sir Philip Craven\\r\\nThe co-operation agreement outlined the strong partnership between the IPC and the CGF. It recognized the IPC as the organization for overseeing the co-ordination and delivery of the Commonwealth Games EAD sports programme and committed both organizations to work together in supporting the growth of the Paralympic and Commonwealth Games Movements.[39]\\r\\nThe Commonwealth Winter Games were a multi-sport event comprising winter sports, last held in 1966. Three editions of the Games have been staged. The Winter Games were designed as a counterbalance to the Commonwealth Games, which focuses on summer sports, to accompany the Winter Olympics and Summer Olympic Games. The winter Games were founded by T.D. Richardson.[40] The 1958 Commonwealth Winter Games were held in St. Moritz, Switzerland and was the inaugural games for the winter edition.[41][42] The 1962 Games were also held in St. Moritz, complementing the 1962 British Empire and Commonwealth Games in Perth, Australia, and the 1966 event was held in St. Moritz as well, following which the idea was discontinued.[43]\\r\\nThe Commonwealth Youth Games are an international multi-sport event organized by the Commonwealth Games Federation. The games are held every four years with the current Commonwealth Games format. The Commonwealth Games Federation discussed the idea of a Millennium Commonwealth Youth Games in 1997. In 1998 the concept was agreed on for the purpose of providing a Commonwealth multi-sport event for young people born in the calendar year 1986 or later. The first version was held in Edinburgh, Scotland from 10 to 14 August 2000. The age limitation of the athletes is 14 to 18.[44]\\r\\nThe Commonwealth Games Federation (CGF) is the international organisation responsible for the direction and control of the Commonwealth Games and Commonwealth Youth Games, and is the foremost authority in matters relating to the games.[45] The Commonwealth House in London, United Kingdom hosts the headquarters of CGF.[46] The Commonwealth House also hosts the headquarters of the Royal Commonwealth Society and the Commonwealth Local Government Forum.[47][48]\\r\\nThe Commonwealth Games Movement is made of three major elements:\\r\\nEnglish is the official language of the Commonwealth. The other language used at each Commonwealth Games is the language of the host country (or languages, if a country has more than one official language apart from English). Every proclamation (such as the announcement of each country during the parade of nations in the opening ceremony) is spoken in these two (or more) languages, or the main depending on whether the host country is an English speaking country.\\r\\nThe Queen's Baton Relay, is a relay around the world held prior to the beginning of the Commonwealth Games. The Baton carries a message from the Head of the Commonwealth, currently Queen Elizabeth II. The Relay traditionally begins at Buckingham Palace in London as a part of the city's Commonwealth Day festivities. The Queen entrusts the baton to the first relay runner. At the Opening Ceremony of the Games, the final relay runner hands the baton back to the Queen or her representative, who reads the message aloud to officially open the Games.The Queen's Baton Relay is similar to the Olympic Torch Relay.[51]\\r\\nThe Relay was introduced at the 1958 British Empire and Commonwealth Games in Cardiff, Wales. Up until, and including, the 1994 Games, the Relay only went through England and the host nation. The Relay for the 1998 Games in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia was the first to travel to other nations of the Commonwealth. The Gold Coast 2018 Queens Baton Relay was the longest in Commonwealth Games history. Covering 230,000?km over 388 days, the Baton made its way through the six Commonwealth regions of Africa, the Americas, the Caribbean, Europe, Asia and Oceania. For the first time, the Queen's Baton was presented at the Commonwealth Youth Games during its sixth edition in 2017 which were held in Nassau, Bahamas.[52]\\r\\nVarious elements frame the opening ceremony of the Commonwealth Games. This ceremony takes place before the events have occurred. The ceremony typically starts with the hoisting of the host country's flag and a performance of its national anthem. The flag of the Commonwealth Games Federation, flag of the last hosting nation and the next hosting nation are also hosted during the opening ceremony. The host nation then presents artistic displays of music, singing, dance and theatre representative of its culture. The artistic presentations have grown in scale and complexity as successive hosts attempt to provide a ceremony that outlasts its predecessor's in terms of memorability. The opening ceremony of the Delhi Games reportedly cost $70?million, with much of the cost incurred in the artistic segment.[53]\\r\\nAfter the artistic portion of the ceremony, the athletes parade into the stadium grouped by nation. The last hosting nation is traditionally the first nation to enter. Nations then enter the stadium alphabetical or continental wise with the host country's athletes being the last to enter. Speeches are given, formally opening the Games. Finally, the Queen's Baton is brought into the stadium and passed on until it reaches the final baton carrier, often a successful Commonwealth athlete from the host nation, who hands it over to the Head of the Commonwealth or their representative.\\r\\nThe closing ceremony of the Commonwealth Games takes place after all sporting events have concluded. Flag-bearers from each participating country enter the stadium, followed by the athletes who enter together, without any national distinction. The president of the organizing committee and the CGF president make their closing speeches and the Games are officially closed. The CGF president also speaks about the conduct of the games. The mayor of the city that organized the Games transfers the CGF flag to the president of the CGF, who then passes it on to the mayor of the city hosting the next Commonwealth Games. The next host nation then also briefly introduces itself with artistic displays of dance and theater representative of its culture. Many great artists and singers had performed at the ceremonies of the Commonwealth Games.\\r\\nAt the closing ceremony of every Commonwealth Games the CGF President makes an award and presents a trophy to one athlete who has competed with particular distinction and honour both in terms of athletic performance and overall contribution to his or her team. Athletes are nominated by their Commonwealth Games Association at the end of the final day of competition and the winner is selected by a panel comprising the CGF President and representatives from each of the six Commonwealth Regions. The David Dixon Award as it is called was introduced in Manchester 2002, after the late David Dixon, former Honorary Secretary of the CGF, in honour of his monumental contribution to Commonwealth sport for many years.[54]\\r\\nA medal ceremony is held after each event is concluded. The winner, second and third-place competitors or teams stand on top of a three-tiered rostrum to be awarded their respective medals. After the medals are given out by a CGF member, the national flags of the three medallists are raised while the national anthem of the gold medallist's country plays. Volunteering citizens of the host country also act as hosts during the medal ceremonies, as they aid the officials who present the medals and act as flag-bearers.\\r\\nNote: The 1911 Inter-Empire Championships held in London is seen as a precursor to the modern Commonwealth Games, but is not normally considered an official edition of the Games themselves. Also, the United Kingdom competed as one country, unlike the Commonwealth Games today when they compete as England, Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland. Canada topped the medal table by winning 4 events.[56]\\r\\nBelow is a Top 10 all-time medal table.\\r\\nThere are a total of 22 sports (with three multi-disciplinary sports) and a further seven para-sports which are approved by the Commonwealth Games Federation. Core sports must be included on each programme. A number of optional sports may be picked by the host nation, which may include some team sports such as basketball.\\r\\nIn 2015, the Commonwealth Games Federation agreed large changes to the programme which increased the number of core sports, whilst removing a number of optionals, those removed are listed below. [59]\\r\\nRecognised sports are sports which have been approved by the Commonwealth Games Federation but which are deemed to need expansion; host nations may not pick these sports for their programme until the Federation's requirements are fulfilled.[61]\\r\\nOnly six teams have attended every Commonwealth Games: Australia, Canada, England, New Zealand, Scotland and Wales. Australia has been the highest scoring team for twelve games, England for seven and Canada for one.\\r\\n??Participated ??Withdrew for political reason ??Not eligible to participate ??To be determined\\r\\nVery few Commonwealth dependencies and nations have yet to take part:[65][66]\\r\\nThe 1934 British Empire Games, originally awarded in 1930 to Johannesburg was moved to London after South Africa's pre-apartheid government refused to allow nonwhite participants.[68]\\r\\nThe 2022 Commonwealth Games were originally awarded to Durban on 2 September 2015, at the CGF General Assembly in Auckland.[69] It was reported in February 2017 that Durban may be unable to host the games due to financial constraints. On 13 March 2017, the CGF stripped Durban of their rights to host and reopened the bidding process for the 2022 games.[70] Many cities from Australia, Canada, England and Malaysia expressed interest to host the games. However, the CGF received only one official bid and that was from Birmingham, England.[71] On 21 December 2017, Birmingham was awarded for the 2022 Games as Durban's replacement host.[72]\\r\\nNigeria boycotted the 1978 Commonwealth Games at Edmonton in protest of New Zealand's sporting contacts with apartheid-era South Africa. Uganda also stayed away, in protest of alleged Canadian hostility towards the government of Idi Amin.[19][73]\\r\\nDuring the 1986 Commonwealth Games at Edinburgh, a majority of the Commonwealth nations staged a boycott, so that the Games appeared to be a whites-only event. Thirty two of the eligible fifty nine countrieslargely African, Asian and Caribbean statesstayed away because of the Thatcher government's policy of keeping Britain's sporting links with apartheid South Africa in preference to participating in the general sporting boycott of that country. Consequently, Edinburgh 1986 witnessed the lowest number of athletes since Auckland 1950.[74] The boycotting nations were Antigua and Barbuda, Barbados, Bahamas, Bangladesh, Bermuda, Belize, Cyprus, Dominica, Gambia, Ghana, Guyana, Grenada, India, Jamaica, Kenya, Malaysia, Nigeria, Pakistan, Papua New Guinea, Solomon Islands, Sri Lanka, St. Vincent and the Grenadines, Sierra Leone, St. Kitts and Nevis, St. Lucia, Mauritius, Trinidad and Tobago, Tanzania, Turks and Caicos Islands, Uganda, Zambia and Zimbabwe.[75] Bermuda was a particularly late withdrawal, as its athletes appeared in the opening ceremony and in the opening day of competition before the Bermuda Olympic Association decided to formally withdraw.[76]\\r\\nThe estimated cost of the 2010 Commonwealth Games in Delhi were US$ 11 billion, according to Business Today magazine.[77] The initial total budget estimated by the Indian Olympic Association in 2003 was US$ 250 million. In 2010, however, the official total budget soon escalated to an estimated US$ 1.8 billion, a figure which excluded non-sports-related infrastructure development.[78] The 2010 Commonwealth Games are reportedly the most expensive Commonwealth Games ever.[79]\\r\\nLawn bowler Willie Wood from Scotland was the first competitor to have competed in seven Commonwealth Games, from 1974 to 2002, a record equalled in 2014 by Isle of Man cyclist Andrew Roche.[80]\\r\\nThey have both been surpassed by David Calvert of Northern Ireland who in 2018 attended his 11th games.[81]\\r\\nGreg Yelavich, a sports shooter from New Zealand, has won 12 medals in seven games from 1986 to 2010.\\r\\nLawn Bowler Robert Weale has represented Wales in 8 Commonwealth Games, 1986ÿ2014, winning 2 gold, 3 silver and 1 bronze.\\r\\nNauruan weightlifter Marcus Stephen won twelve medals at the Games between 1990 and 2002, of which seven gold, and was elected President of Nauru in 2007. His performance has helped place Nauru (the smallest independent state in the Commonwealth, at 21?km2 and with a population of fewer than 9,400 in 2011) in nineteenth place on the all-time Commonwealth Games medal table.\\r\\nIan Thorpe, Australian swimmer (now retired), has won 10 Commonwealth Games gold medals and 1 silver medal. At the 1998 Commonwealth Games in Kuala Lumpur, he won 4 gold medals. At the 2002 Commonwealth Games in Manchester, he won 6 gold medals and 1 silver medal.[82]\\r\\nChad le Clos, South Africas most decorated swimmer, has won 17 medals from just three Commonwealth Games (2010, 2014 & 2018), seven of which are gold. At the 2018 Commonwealth Games in Gold Coast, he won three golds, a silver and a bronze.[83]","input":"How often does the commonwealth games take place?"},{"output":"Marnie Oursler","context":"Marnie Oursler (born 1979) is an American home builder and television personality. She is the owner and operator of the homebuilding business Marnie Custom Homes, which is featured on the DIY Network show Big Beach Builds.[1]\\r\\n\\r\\nMarnie Oursler was born outside of Washington, D.C. in Prince George's County, Maryland into a family of homebuilders. The tradition began with her great-great grandfather and has been passed down through five successive generations. Her father, Marvin Oursler, owns Marrick Homes in Frederick, Maryland. She attended Northern High School[2] and graduated in 1996. During high school, Oursler spent her free time working at construction sites in the area with her uncles and her brother, Chris. She attended the Naval Academy for one year before transferring to East Carolina University, where she was on the softball team.[3] She proceeded to get her Master's in Business Administration from Duke University's Fuqua School of Business.[4]\\r\\n\\r\\nOursler bought her first house at the age of 24 in Bethany Beach, Delaware for $240,000 - costing her all of her savings. Unable to afford workers, she renovated the house using skills she obtained from working with her family. Nine months later, she sold the house for $340,000, using the profits to build another beach house. After living in that house for two years, Oursler sold it and built a third house.[5]\\r\\n\\r\\nRealizing her talent and passion for the homebuilding business, Oursler began tracking real estate patterns in 2007.

A 2016 survey conducted by the Razumkov Centre found that 70% of the population declared themselves believers. About 65.4% of the population declared adherence to various types of Orthodoxy (25% Orthodoxy of the Kiev Patriarchate, 21.2% just Orthodox, 15% Orthodoxy of the Moscow Patriarchate, 1.8% Ukrainian Autocephalous Orthodox Church, and 2% other types of Orthodoxy), 7.1% just Christians, 6.5% Greek Rite Catholics, 1.9% Protestants, 1.1% Muslims and 1.0% Latin Rite Catholics. Judaism and Hinduism were each the religions of 0.2% of the population. A further 16.3% declared themselves non-religious or did not identify in the above religions.[1] According to the surveys conducted by Razumkov in the 2000s and early 2010s, such proportions have remained relatively constant throughout the last decade, while the proportion of believers overall has decreased from 76% in 2014 to 70% in 2016.[1] (p.?22).\\r\\nAs of 2016, Christianity is particularly strong in westernmost Ukrainian regions, where most Greek Catholics live besides the Orthodox population. In central, southern and eastern regions, Christians constitute a smaller proportion of the total population, particularly low in the easternmost region of Donbass.[1] Another religion that is present in Ukraine besides Christianity is Rodnovery (Slavic native faith), which comprises Ukrainian- and Russian-language communities (some Rodnover organizations call the religion 楰־־' Pravoslavya, \\"Orthodoxy\\", thus functioning in homonymy with Christian Orthodox churches).[2][3] Hinduism has been spread after the collapse of the Soviet Union by Indian and International Society for Krishna Consciousness' missionaries and is particularly present in the Donbass region.[1] Crimean Tatars professing Islam represent a significant part of the population in Crimea, which prior 2014 was a subject of Ukraine, but has been since that year occupied by Russia. As of 2016, without Crimea, where Muslims formed 15% of the population in 2013,[4] only Donbass maintains a larger community of Muslims compared to other Ukrainian regions (6%).[1]\\r\\nA 2006 survey by the same Razumkov Center found that 62.5% of all respondents were unaware of their religious affiliation, not religious or not affiliated to any religious body, 33.6% were Christians (26.8% Orthodox, 5.9% Catholics, and 0.9% Protestants), 0.1% were Jewish, and 3.8% were members of other religions.[5]\\r\\nSince before the outbreak of the War in Donbass in 2014, but even more violently so from that year onwards, there has been unrest between pro-Ukrainian and pro-Russian religious groups in the country.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nIn pre-historic times and in the early Middle Ages, the territories of present-day Ukraine supported different tribes practising their traditional pagan religions (though note for example the Tengrism of Old Great Bulgaria in the Ukrainian lands in the 7th century CE). Byzantine-rite Christianity first became prominent about the turn of the first millennium. (Later traditions and legends relate that in the first century CE the Apostle Andrew himself had visited the site where the city of Kiev would later arise.[7])\\r\\nIn the 10th century the emerging state of Kievan Rus' came increasingly under the cultural influence of the Byzantine Empire. The first recorded Rus' convert to Eastern Orthodoxy, the Princess Saint Olga, visited Constantinople in 945 or 957. In the 980s, according to tradition, Olga's grandson, Knyaz (Prince) Vladimir had his people baptised in the Dnieper River. This began a long history of the dominance of Eastern Orthodoxy in Ruthenia, a religious ascendancy that would later influence both Ukraine and Russia. Domination of \\"Little Russia\\" by Moscow (from the 17th century onwards) and by Saint Petersburg (from 1721) eventually led to the decline of Uniate Catholicism (officially founded in 1596) in the Ukrainian lands under Tsarist control.\\r\\nJudaism has existed in the Ukrainian lands for approximately 2000 years: Jewish traders appeared in Greek colonies. After the 7th century Judaism influenced the neighbouring Khazar Khaganate. From the 13th century Ashkenazi Jewish presence in Ukraine increased significantly. In the 18th century a new teaching of Judaism originated and became established in the Ukrainian lands - Hasidism.\\r\\nThe Golden Horde (which adopted Islam in 1313) and the Sunni Ottoman Empire (which conquered the Ukrainian littoral in the 1470s) brought Islam to their subject territories in present-day Ukraine. Crimean Tatars accepted Islam as the state religion (1313ÿ1502) of the Golden Horde, and later ruled as vassals of the Ottoman Empire (until the late 18th century).\\r\\nDuring the period of Soviet rule (c. 1917ÿ1991) the governing Soviet authorities officially promoted atheism and taught it in schools, while promoting various levels of persecution of religious believers and of their organizations. Only a small fraction of people remained official church-goers in that period, and the number of non-believers increased.\\r\\nThe 20th century saw schisms within Eastern Orthodoxy in Ukrainian territory.\\r\\nAs of 2016, according to a survey held by the Razumkov Center, 70% of the total respondents declared to be believers, while 10.1% were uncertain whether they believed or not, 7.2% were uninterested in beliefs, 6.3% were unbelievers, 2.7% were atheists, and a further 3.9% found it difficult to answer the question. Of the total respondents, about 65.4% of the population declared to be adherents of various types of Orthodoxy (25% Orthodoxy of the Kievan Patriarchate, 21.2% just Orthodox, 15% Orthodoxy of the Moscovian Patriarchate, 1.8% Ukrainian Autocephalous Orthodox Church, and 2% other types of Orthodoxy), 7.1% just Christians, 6.5% Greek Rite Catholics, 1.9% Protestants, 1.1% Muslims and 1.0% Latin Rite Catholics. Judaism and Hinduism were the religions of 0.2% of the population each. A further 16.3% of the population were non-believers or believed in some other religion.[1]\\r\\nAmong those Ukrainians who declared to believe in Orthodoxy, 38.1% declared to be members of the Ukrainian Orthodox Church of the Kievan Patriarchate, while 23.0% declared to be members of the Ukrainian Orthodox Church of the Moscovian Patriarchate. A further 2.7% were members of the Ukrainian Autocephalous Orthodox Church. Among the remaining Orthodox Ukrainians, 32.3% declared to be \\"just Orthodox\\", without affiliation to any patriarchate, while a further 3.1% declared that they \\"did not know\\" which patriarchate or Orthodox church they belonged to.[1]\\r\\nIt is important to note that the Orthodox Church of the Kyevan Patriarchate is considered schismatic and doctrinally errant and ethnophyletic by the Orthodox Church of the Moscovian Patriarchate (officially called the Ukrainian Orthodox Church, which is the Ukrainian branch of the Russian Orthodox Church) and is not recognised as part of the broader Eastern Orthodox Church.[8]\\r\\n(including Greek)\\r\\n(other Christian)\\r\\nA February 2015 survey by Razumkov Centre, SOCIS, Rating and KIIS gave the following data at oblast level:[18]\\r\\n(unspecified)\\r\\n(incl. others)\\r\\nAs of 2016, 81.9% of the population of Ukraine declared to believe in Christianity.[1]\\r\\nAccording to the same survey, 65.4% of the total population adhered to Orthodoxy.[1]\\r\\nOrthodoxy is stronger in central (76.7%) and southern Ukraine (71.0%), while it comprises about two thirds of the total population in eastern Ukraine (63.2%), and a particularly low proportion of the population in western Ukraine (57.0%) and the Donbass (50.6%).[1]\\r\\nAs of 2016 the Ukrainian Orthodox Church of the Moscovian Patriarchate has 12,334 officially registered churches, by far more than any other religion in Ukraine.[19] The church is headed by the Metropolitan of Kiev and all Ukraine, Onuphrius (Berezovsky), and it uses predominantly the old Slavonic language for its services.\\r\\nThe Ukrainian Orthodox Church of the Kievan Patriarchate was formed after the declaration of independence of Ukraine in 1991, and has been headed since 1995 by Patriarch Filaret (Denysenko) with the title Patriarch of Kiev and all Rus-Ukraine, who was earlier the Russian Orthodox Metropolitan of Kiev and all Ukraine. The church claims direct lineage to the Kievan Metropolia of Petro Mohyla. As of 2016, the church has 4,921 registered communities.[19] They use both Ukrainian and common Slavonic as liturgical languages.\\r\\nThe Ukrainian Autocephalous Orthodox Church was founded in 1919 in Kiev, banned during the Soviet era, and then legalized in 1989. As of 2016, it is constituted by 1,217 communities divided in two branches.[19]\\r\\nIn the interest of the possible future unification of the country's Orthodox churches, it did not name a patriarch to succeed the late Patriarch Dmitriy. The Autocephalous Church was formally headed in the country by Metropolitan Methodij of Ternopil and Podil; however, the large eparchies of Kharkiv-Poltava, Lviv, Rivne-Volyn, and Tavriya have officially broken relations with Methodij and have asked to be placed under the direct jurisdiction of the Istanbul-based Ecumenical Patriarch Bartholomew. The church uses Ukrainian as its liturgical language.\\r\\nThere are also communities belonging to the Russian Orthodox Old-Rite Church and other Old Believers, to the Russian Orthodox Church Outside Russia, to the Ruthenian Orthodox Church, to various branches of the True Orthodox Church-Catacombism (including the Ruthenian True Orthodox Church, the Ukrainian True Orthodox Church and the Church of the Goths[20]), to the Romanian Orthodox Church (Metropolis of Bessarabia), to the Ukrainian Autocephalous Orthodox Church Canonical, and to a variety of other minor Christian Orthodox churches.[19]\\r\\nAdherents of Oriental Orthodox Christianity in Ukraine are mainly ethnic Armenians. Historical ties between peoples of Ukraine and Armenia have resulted in significant presence of Armenian diaspora in Ukraine throughout history and up to the modern times. Most of ethnic Armenians in Ukraine are adherents of the Armenian Apostolic Church, one of main churches of the Oriental Orthodoxy, distinctive from Eastern Orthodoxy in terms of particular miaphysite christology. In spite of those theological differences, relations between Armenian Apostolic Church and various Eastern Orthodox Churches in Ukraine are friendly. There is an Armenian eparchy (diocese) in Ukraine, centered in Armenian Cathedral of Lviv, and also there are many Armenian churches and other monuments on the territory of Ukraine.[21]\\r\\nByzantine Rite Catholicism is the religion of 6.5% of the population of Ukraine as of 2016. This church is largely concentrated in western Ukraine, where it gathers a significant proportion of the population (29.9%). Latin Rite Catholicism, instead, is the religion of 1.0% of the population of Ukraine, mostly in western (1.4%) and central (1.9%) regions. Catholicism is largely absent in eastern Ukraine and non-existent in Donbass.[1]\\r\\nAs of 2016, there are 4,733 registered Catholic churches, among which 3,799 belong to the two Byzantine Rite Churches and 933 belong to the Latin Church.[19]\\r\\nThe Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church traditionally constituted the second largest group of believers after the Christian Orthodox churches. The Union of Brest formed the Church in 1596 to unify Orthodox and Catholic believers. Outlawed by the Soviet Union in 1946 and legalized in 1987, the church was for forty-three years the single largest banned religious community in the world. Major Archbishop Sviatoslav Shevchuk is the present head of the Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church.[22] The church uses Ukrainian as its liturgical language.\\r\\nThe Church of the Latin Rite is traditionally associated with historical pockets of citizens of Polish ancestry who lived mainly in the central and western regions. It uses the Polish, Latin, Ukrainian and Russian as liturgical languages.\\r\\nMain concentrations of the Ruthenian Catholic Church are in Trans-Carpathia near the Hungarian border. This community has multiple ties in Hungary, Slovakia and the United States.\\r\\nThe Armenian Catholic Church has a very small presence. As of 2016 there is only one officially registered church belonging to Armenian Catholics.[19]\\r\\nAs of 2016, Protestants make up 1.9% of the population of Ukraine, with a strong concentration in western Ukraine (3.6%).[1] In the country there are communities of Evangelicalism, Baptists, Charismatic Christianity, as well as Methodists, Mennonites, Lutherans, Presbyterians, and others. There is also a Sub-Carpathian Reformed Church with about 140,000 members, which is one of the earliest Protestant communities in the country. The Embassy of God of Sunday Adelaja maintains a significant presence throughout the country, as do other neopentecostal groups.\\r\\nAs of 2016, there are 2,973 Evangelical churches, 2,853 churches of the Baptists, 1,082 Seventh-day Adventist churches, 128 Calvinist churches, 79 Lutheran churches, 1,337 churches of Charismatic Christianity, and 1,347 other organizations belonging to the Protestant spectrum (including 928 Jehovah's Witnesses' halls and 44 Mormon congregations).[19] In total, as of 2016 there are 9,799 registered Protestant groups in Ukraine.[19]\\r\\nAs of 2016, there are 29 registered communities belonging to the Church of the East.[19]\\r\\nJehovahs Witnesses claim to have 265,985 adherents, as reported in the movement's 2013 Yearbook. In 2010 the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (Mormons) dedicated its Kyiv Ukraine Temple, and in 2012 claimed a membership more than 11,000 in 57 congregations in Ukraine.[23]\\r\\nAs of 2016, Islam is the religion of 1.1% of the population of Ukraine. Muslims are mostly concentrated in Donbass, where they make up 6.0% of the population.[1] In the same year, there are 229 registered Islamic organizations.[19] In Crimea, which in 2014 was incorporated by Russia, Crimean Tatar Muslims make up to 15% of the population. A major part of the south steppes of modern Ukraine at a certain period of time were inhabited by Turkic peoples, most of whom were Muslims since the fall of the Khazar Khanate.\\r\\nThe Crimean Tatars are the only indigenous Muslim ethnic group in the country. The Nogays, another Muslim group who lived in the steppes of southern Ukraine, emigrated to Turkey in the 18th-19th century. In addition, there are Muslim communities in all major Ukrainian cities representing Soviet-era migrants from Muslim backgrounds. There are approximately 150 mosques in Ukraine. Many Muslim mosques use the Crimean Tatar language, Arabic, Azeri, the Tatar language and Russian.\\r\\nThere are no single administrative centre, instead there are five of them: Spiritual Administration of Crimea Muslims (DUMK) - Crimean Tatars; Spiritual Administration of Ukraine Muslims (DUMU) - people of Caucasus, Crimean and Volga Tatars, Pakistani, Afghans, Arabs, Russians, Ukrainians; Spiritual Centre of Ukraine Muslims (DCUM) - Volga Tatars; Kiev muftiat - Kazan and Volga Tatars; UMMA - Arabs, Uzbeks, Russians, Ukrainians.[24]\\r\\nThe size of the Jewish population of Ukraine has varied over time. Jews are primarily an ethnicity, closely linked with the religion of Judaism. Jews in Ukraine are estimated to be between 100 and 300 thousands. However, ethnic Jews may be irreligious or practise other religions than Judaism. It is estimated than only 35-40% of the Jewish population of Ukraine is religious. Most observant Jews are believers of Orthodox Judaism, but there are as well communities of Chabad-Lubavitch and Reform Judaism, Conservative Judaism and Reconstructionist Judaism.[25]\\r\\nJudaic congregations use Russian, Hebrew, Yiddish and Ukrainian languages. As of 2016, 0.2% of the population of Ukraine was found to be constituted by Jews believing in Judaism.[1] There are, in the same year, 271 officially registered Jewish religious communities.[1]\\r\\nHinduism is a minority faith in Ukraine. The International Society for Krishna Consciousness managed to propagate the Hindu faith through their missionary activities. As of 2016, Hindu believers constituted 0.2% of the population of Ukraine, with a slightly higher proportion in Donbass (0.6%).[1] In the same year, there were 85 Hindu, Hindu-inspired and other Eastern religions-inspired organizations in the country, among which 42 are Krishna Consciousness congregations.[19]\\r\\nThe Slavic native faith (Rodnovery, Ukrainian: ?־?Ѷ־ Ridnovirstvo, ?־?'

There are many other unregistered groups and federations, for instance the Ancestral Fire of the Slavic Native Faith (˾־ ̷Ͷ Ѷ־'^? ?? ?), the Wrath of God Native Orthodox Faith, the North Caucasian Scythian Regional Fire, the Order of the Knights of the Solar God and the Rodoliubye Russian Rodnover Community.[26]\\r\\nLev Sylenko founded the Church of the Native Ukrainian National Faith (RUNVira) in 1966 in Chicago, United States, and only opened their first temple in the mother country of Ukraine after the breakup of the Soviet Union in 1991. The current headquarters of RUNVira is in Spring Glen, New York, United States. The doctrine of the Church of the Native Ukrainian National Faith, \\"Sylenkoism\\" or \\"Dazhbogism\\", is monist and centered around the god Dazhbog.\\r\\nSociologists estimated between 1,000 and 95,000 Rodnovers (0.2%) in Ukraine in the early 2000s.[27] Since 1999, the Book of Veles, which is a central philosophical text for many Rodnover churches, is taught in Ukrainian school curricula.[28][29]\\r\\nRodnovery has taken a significant role in the War in Donbass. The Azov Battalion, fighting for Kiev, is mainly composed of Ukrainian Rodnovers. It has been reported that it has been collaborating with the Kievan Patriarchate and taking over its churches.[30] On the other side of the spectrum, Russian Rodnovers who fight for Moscow have organized into battalions such as the Svarog Battalion (of the Vostok Brigade), the Svarozhich Battalion (Slavic Unification and Revival Battalion), and the Rusich Company.[31] Donbass has been documented as being a stronghold of Rodnovery; there are Russian Rodnover organizations which are reorganizing local villages and society according to traditional Indo-European trifunctionalism (according to which males are born to play one out of three roles in society, whether priests, warriors or farmers).[32]\\r\\nThe group of worshipers of gods according to the Roman way Sarmatia (Roman name for modern-day Ukraine) is building a Temple of Jupiter Perennus or Jupiter Perunnus (Perun) in the city of Poltava. The site was attacked and desecrated by Christians in 2011, but construction works continue to the present.[33]\\r\\nAs of 2016, there were 241 officially registered churches belonging to various new religious movements (including the aforementioned Hindu-inspired ones, 11 congregations of the Bah' Faith, six congregations of the Church of the Last TestamentVissarionism, and others), 58 registered Buddhist groups, and various registered churches for minority ethnicitiesincluding two Chinese Taoist churches, one Korean Methodist church, four Jewish Karaite churches, eight churches for Christian Jews and 35 churches of Messianic Judaism.[19]\\r\\nIn December 1996, the All-Ukrainian Council of Churches and Religious Organizations was formed with the objective of uniting around 90-95% of religious communities of Ukraine.[34][35] Since the end of 2003, the Council of Representatives of the Christian Churches of Ukraine exists in parallel to the council to promote the principles of Christianity in Ukraine and religious freedom.[36] Affiliation with either or both of the assemblies is voluntary.\\r\\nIn 2007, the council accounted for representatives of 19 organizations, while in 2013, only 18.

Starting out in 1963 with the group the Wailers, he forged a distinctive songwriting and vocal style that would later resonate with audiences worldwide. The Wailers would go on to release some of the earliest reggae records with producer Lee \\"Scratch\\" Perry.[3]\\r\\nAfter the Wailers disbanded in 1974,[4] Marley pursued a solo career upon his relocation to England that culminated in the release of the album Exodus in 1977, which established his worldwide reputation and elevated his status as one of the world's best-selling artists of all time, with sales of more than 75 million records.[5][6] Exodus stayed on the British album charts for 56 consecutive weeks. It included four UK hit singles: \\"Exodus\\", \\"Waiting in Vain\\", \\"Jamming\\", and \\"One Love\\". In 1978, he released the album Kaya, which included the hit singles \\"Is This Love\\" and \\"Satisfy My Soul\\". The greatest hits album, Legend, was released in 1984, three years after Marley died. It subsequently became the best-selling reggae album of all time.\\r\\nDiagnosed with acral lentiginous melanoma in 1977, Marley died on 11 May 1981 in Miami at age 36. He was a committed Rastafari who infused his music with a sense of spirituality.[7]:242[8] He is credited with popularising reggae music around the world and served as a symbol of Jamaican culture and identity. Marley has also evolved into a global symbol and inspired numerous items of merchandise.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nBob Marley was born 6 February 1945 on the farm of his maternal grandfather in Nine Mile, Saint Ann Parish, Jamaica, to Norval Sinclair Marley (1885ÿ1955) and Cedella Booker (1926ÿ2008).[9] Norval Marley was a white Jamaican originally from Sussex, England, whose family claimed Syrian Jewish origins.[10][11][12] Norval claimed to have been a captain in the Royal Marines;[13] at the time of his marriage to Cedella Booker, an Afro-Jamaican then 18 years old, he was employed as a plantation overseer.[13][14] Bob Marley's full name is Robert Nesta Marley, though some sources give his birth name as Nesta Robert Marley, with a story that when Marley was still a boy a Jamaican passport official reversed his first and middle names because Nesta sounded like a girl's name.[15][16] Norval provided financial support for his wife and child but seldom saw them as he was often away. Bob Marley attended Stepney Primary and Junior High School which serves the catchment area of Saint Ann.[17][18] In 1955, when Bob Marley was 10 years old, his father died of a heart attack at the age of 70.[19] Marley's mother went on to marry Edward Booker, an American civil servant. The relationship brought Marley two American brothers: Richard and Anthony.[20][21]\\r\\nMarley and Neville Livingston (later known as Bunny Wailer) had been childhood friends in Nine Mile. They had started to play music together while at Stepney Primary and Junior High School.[22] Marley left Nine Mile with his mother when he was 12 and moved to Trenchtown, Kingston. Cedella Booker and Thadeus Livingston (Bunny Wailer's father) had a daughter together whom they named Claudette Pearl,[23] who was a younger sister to both Bob and Bunny. Now that Marley and Livingston were living together in the same house in Trenchtown, their musical explorations deepened to include the latest R&B from American radio stations whose broadcasts reached Jamaica, and the new Ska music.[24] The move to Trenchtown was proving to be fortuitous, and Marley soon found himself in a vocal group with Bunny Wailer, Peter Tosh, Beverley Kelso and Junior Braithwaite. Joe Higgs, who was part of the successful vocal act Higgs and Wilson, resided on 3rd St., and his singing partner Roy Wilson had been raised by the grandmother of Junior Braithwaite. Higgs and Wilson would rehearse at the back of the houses between 2nd and 3rd Streets, and it wasn't long before Marley (now residing on 2nd St), Junior Braithwaite and the others were congregating around this successful duo.[25] Marley and the others didn't play any instruments at this time, and were more interested in being a vocal harmony group. Higgs was glad to help them develop their vocal harmonies, although more importantly, he had started to teach Marley how to play guitarthereby creating the bedrock that would later allow Marley to construct some of the biggest-selling reggae songs in the history of the genre.[26][27]\\r\\nIn February 1962, Marley recorded four songs, \\"Judge Not\\", \\"One Cup of Coffee\\", \\"Do You Still Love Me?\\" and \\"Terror\\", at Federal Studio for local music producer Leslie Kong.[28] Three of the songs were released on Beverley's with \\"One Cup of Coffee\\" being released under the pseudonym Bobby Martell.[29]\\r\\nIn 1963, Bob Marley, Bunny Wailer, Peter Tosh, Junior Braithwaite, Beverley Kelso, and Cherry Smith were called the Teenagers. They later changed the name to the Wailing Rudeboys, then to the Wailing Wailers, at which point they were discovered by record producer Coxsone Dodd, and finally to the Wailers. Their single \\"Simmer Down\\" for the Coxsone label became a Jamaican #1 in February 1964 selling an estimated 70,000 copies.[30] The Wailers, now regularly recording for Studio One, found themselves working with established Jamaican musicians such as Ernest Ranglin (arranger \\"It Hurts To Be Alone\\"),[31] the keyboardist Jackie Mittoo and saxophonist Roland Alphonso. By 1966, Braithwaite, Kelso, and Smith had left the Wailers, leaving the core trio of Bob Marley, Bunny Wailer, and Peter Tosh.[32]\\r\\nIn 1966, Marley married Rita Anderson, and moved near his mother's residence in Wilmington, Delaware in the United States for a short time, during which he worked as a DuPont lab assistant and on the assembly line at a Chrysler plant, under the alias Donald Marley.[33]\\r\\nThough raised as a Catholic, Marley became interested in Rastafari beliefs in the 1960s, when away from his mother's influence.[34] After returning to Jamaica, Marley formally converted to Rastafari and began to grow dreadlocks. The Rastafari proscription against cutting hair is based on the biblical Samson, who as a Nazirite, was expected to make certain religious vows, including the ritual treatment of his hair as described in Chapter Six of the Book of Numbers: \\"All the days of the vow of his separation there shall no razor come upon his head: until the days be fulfilled, in the which he separateth himself unto the Lord, he shall be holy, and shall let the locks of the hair of his head grow.\\"(Numbers 6: 5 KJV)\\r\\nAfter a financial disagreement with Dodd, Marley and his band teamed up with Lee \\"Scratch\\" Perry and his studio band, the Upsetters. Although the alliance lasted less than a year, they recorded what many consider the Wailers' finest work. Marley and Perry split after a dispute regarding the assignment of recording rights, but they would remain friends and work together again.\\r\\n1969 brought another change to Jamaican popular music in which the beat slowed down even further. The new beat was a slow, steady, ticking rhythm that was first heard on the Maytals song \\"Do the Reggay.\\" Marley approached producer Leslie Kong, who was regarded as one of the major developers of the reggae sound. For the recordings, Kong combined the Wailers with his studio musicians called Beverley's All-Stars, which consisted of the bassists Lloyd Parks and Jackie Jackson, the drummer Paul Douglas, the keyboard players Gladstone Anderson and Winston Wright, and the guitarists Rad Bryan, Lynn Taitt, and Hux Brown.[35] As David Moskowitz writes, \\"The tracks recorded in this session illustrated the Wailers earliest efforts in the new reggae style. Gone are the ska trumpets and saxophones of the earlier songs, with instrumental breaks now being played by the electric guitar.\\" The songs recorded would be released as the album The Best of The Wailers, including tracks \\"Soul Shakedown Party,\\" \\"Stop That Train,\\" \\"Caution,\\" \\"Go Tell It on the Mountain,\\" \\"Soon Come,\\" \\"Cant You See,\\" \\"Soul Captives,\\" \\"Cheer Up,\\" \\"Back Out,\\" and \\"Do It Twice\\".[35]\\r\\nBetween 1968 and 1972, Bob and Rita Marley, Peter Tosh and Bunny Wailer re-cut some old tracks with JAD Records in Kingston and London in an attempt to commercialise the Wailers' sound. Bunny later asserted that these songs \\"should never be released on an album ... they were just demos for record companies to listen to\\". In 1968, Bob and Rita visited songwriter Jimmy Norman at his apartment in the Bronx. Norman had written the extended lyrics for Kai Winding's \\"Time Is on My Side\\" (covered by the Rolling Stones) and had also written for Johnny Nash and Jimi Hendrix.[36] A three-day jam session with Norman and others, including Norman's co-writer Al Pyfrom, resulted in a 24-minute tape of Marley performing several of his own and Norman-Pyfrom's compositions. This tape is, according to Reggae archivist Roger Steffens, rare in that it was influenced by pop rather than reggae, as part of an effort to break Marley into the American charts.[36] According to an article in The New York Times, Marley experimented on the tape with different sounds, adopting a doo-wop style on \\"Stay With Me\\" and \\"the slow love song style of 1960's artists\\" on \\"Splish for My Splash\\".[36] An artist yet to establish himself outside his native Jamaica, Marley lived in Ridgmount Gardens, Bloomsbury, during 1972.[37]\\r\\nIn 1972, Bob Marley signed with CBS Records in London and embarked on a UK tour with American soul singer Johnny Nash.[38] While in London the Wailers asked their road manager Brent Clarke to introduce them to Chris Blackwell, who had licensed some of their Coxsone releases for his Island Records. The Wailers intended to discuss the royalties associated with these releases; instead the meeting resulted in the offer of an advance of S4,000 to record an album.[39] Since Jimmy Cliff, Island's top reggae star, had recently left the label, Blackwell was primed for a replacement. In Marley, Blackwell recognised the elements needed to snare the rock audience: \\"I was dealing with rock music, which was really rebel music. I felt that would really be the way to break Jamaican music. But you needed someone who could be that image. When Bob walked in he really was that image.\\"[40] The Wailers returned to Jamaica to record at Harry J's in Kingston, which resulted in the album Catch a Fire.\\r\\nPrimarily recorded on an eight-track, Catch a Fire marked the first time a reggae band had access to a state-of-the-art studio and were accorded the same care as their rock 'n' roll peers.[40] Blackwell desired to create \\"more of a drifting, hypnotic-type feel than a reggae rhythm\\",[41] and restructured Marley's mixes and arrangements. Marley travelled to London to supervise Blackwell's overdubbing of the album which included tempering the mix from the bass-heavy sound of Jamaican music and omitting two tracks.[40]\\r\\nThe Wailers' first album for Island, Catch a Fire, was released worldwide in April 1973, packaged like a rock record with a unique Zippo lighter lift-top. Initially selling 14,000 units, it didn't make Marley a star, but received a positive critical reception.[40] It was followed later that year by the album Burnin' which included the song \\"I Shot the Sheriff\\". Eric Clapton was given the album by his guitarist George Terry in the hope that he would enjoy it.[42] Clapton was suitably impressed and chose to record a cover version of \\"I Shot the Sheriff\\" which became his first US hit since \\"Layla\\" two years earlier and reached number 1 on the Billboard Hot 100 on 14 September 1974.[43] Many Jamaicans were not keen on the new reggae sound on Catch a Fire, but the Trenchtown style of Burnin found fans across both reggae and rock audiences.[40]\\r\\nDuring this period, Blackwell gifted his Kingston residence and company headquarters at 56 Hope Road (then known as Island House) to Marley. Housing Tuff Gong Studios, the property became not only Marley's office, but also his home.[40]\\r\\nThe Wailers were scheduled to open 17 shows in the US for Sly and the Family Stone. After four shows, the band was fired because they were more popular than the acts they were opening for.[44] The Wailers disbanded in 1974, with each of the three main members pursuing a solo career. The reason for the breakup is shrouded in conjecture; some[who?] believe that there were disagreements amongst Bunny Wailer, Peter Tosh, and Marley concerning performances, while others claim that Wailer and Tosh simply preferred solo work.\\r\\nDespite the break-up, Marley continued recording as \\"Bob Marley & The Wailers\\". His new backing band included brothers Carlton and Aston \\"Family Man\\" Barrett on drums and bass respectively, Junior Marvin and Al Anderson on lead guitar, Tyrone Downie and Earl \\"Wya\\" Lindo on keyboards, and Alvin \\"Seeco\\" Patterson on percussion. The \\"I Threes\\", consisting of Judy Mowatt, Marcia Griffiths, and Marley's wife, Rita, provided backing vocals. In 1975, Marley had his international breakthrough with his first hit outside Jamaica, \\"No Woman, No Cry\\", from the Natty Dread album.[45] This was followed by his breakthrough album in the United States, Rastaman Vibration (1976), which reached the Top 50 of the Billboard Soul Charts.[46]\\r\\nOn 3 December 1976, two days before \\"Smile Jamaica\\", a free concert organised by the Jamaican Prime Minister Michael Manley in an attempt to ease tension between two warring political groups, Marley, his wife, and manager Don Taylor were wounded in an assault by unknown gunmen inside Marley's home. Taylor and Marley's wife sustained serious injuries, but later made full recoveries. Bob Marley received minor wounds in the chest and arm.[47] The attempt on his life was thought to have been politically motivated, as many felt the concert was really a support rally for Manley. Nonetheless, the concert proceeded, and an injured Marley performed as scheduled, two days after the attempt. When asked why, Marley responded, \\"The people who are trying to make this world worse aren't taking a day off. How can I?\\" The members of the group Zap Pow played as Bob Marley's backup band before a festival crowd of 80,000 while members of The Wailers were still missing or in hiding.[48][49]\\r\\nMarley left Jamaica at the end of 1976, and after a month-long \\"recovery and writing\\" sojourn at the site of Chris Blackwell's Compass Point Studios in Nassau, Bahamas, arrived in England, where he spent two years in self-imposed exile.\\r\\nWhilst in England, he recorded the albums Exodus and Kaya. Exodus stayed on the British album charts for 56 consecutive weeks. It included four UK hit singles: \\"Exodus\\", \\"Waiting in Vain\\", \\"Jamming\\", and \\"One Love\\" (a rendition of Curtis Mayfield's hit, \\"People Get Ready\\"). During his time in London, he was arrested and received a conviction for possession of a small quantity of cannabis.[50] In 1978, Marley returned to Jamaica and performed at another political concert, the One Love Peace Concert, again in an effort to calm warring parties. Near the end of the performance, by Marley's request, Michael Manley (leader of then-ruling People's National Party) and his political rival Edward Seaga (leader of the opposing Jamaica Labour Party), joined each other on stage and shook hands.[51]\\r\\nUnder the name Bob Marley and the Wailers 11 albums were released, four live albums and seven studio albums. The releases included Babylon by Bus, a double live album with 13 tracks, were released in 1978 and received critical acclaim. This album, and specifically the final track \\"Jamming\\" with the audience in a frenzy, captured the intensity of Marley's live performances.[52]\\r\\nSurvival, a defiant and politically charged album, was released in 1979. Tracks such as \\"Zimbabwe\\", \\"Africa Unite\\", \\"Wake Up and Live\\", and \\"Survival\\" reflected Marley's support for the struggles of Africans. His appearance at the Amandla Festival in Boston in July 1979 showed his strong opposition to South African apartheid, which he already had shown in his song \\"War\\" in 1976. In early 1980, he was invited to perform at 17 April celebration of Zimbabwe's Independence Day.\\r\\nUprising (1980) was Bob Marley's final studio album, and is one of his most religious productions; it includes \\"Redemption Song\\" and \\"Forever Loving Jah\\".[54] Confrontation, released posthumously in 1983, contained unreleased material recorded during Marley's lifetime, including the hit \\"Buffalo Soldier\\" and new mixes of singles previously only available in Jamaica.[55]\\r\\nIn July 1977, Marley was found to have a type of malignant melanoma under the nail of a toe. Contrary to urban legend, this lesion was not primarily caused by an injury during a football match that year, but was instead a symptom of the already-existing cancer. Marley turned down his doctors' advice to have his toe amputated (which would have hindered his performing career), citing his religious beliefs, and instead the nail and nail bed were removed and a skin graft taken from his thigh to cover the area.[56][57][58] Despite his illness, he continued touring and was in the process of scheduling a world tour in 1980.[59]\\r\\nThe album Uprising was released in May 1980. The band completed a major tour of Europe, where it played its biggest concert to 100,000 people in Milan. After the tour Marley went to America, where he performed two shows at Madison Square Garden in New York City as part of the Uprising Tour.\\r\\nMarley's last concert occurred at the Stanley Theater (now called The Benedum Center For The Performing Arts) in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, on 23 September 1980. Just two days earlier he had collapsed during a jogging tour in Central Park and was brought to hospital where he learned that the cancer had spread to his brain.\\r\\nThe only known photographs from the show were featured in Kevin Macdonald's documentary film Marley.[60]\\r\\nShortly afterwards, Marley's health deteriorated as the cancer had spread throughout his body. The rest of the tour was cancelled and Marley sought treatment at the Bavarian clinic of Josef Issels, where he received an alternative cancer treatment called Issels treatment partly based on avoidance of certain foods, drinks, and other substances. After fighting the cancer without success for eight months Marley boarded a plane for his home in Jamaica.[61]\\r\\nWhile Marley was flying home from Germany to Jamaica, his vital functions worsened. After landing in Miami, Florida, he was taken to the hospital for immediate medical attention. Marley died on 11 May 1981 at Cedars of Lebanon Hospital in Miami (now University of Miami Hospital), aged 36. The spread of melanoma to his lungs and brain caused his death. His final words to his son Ziggy were \\"Money can't buy life.\\"[62]\\r\\nMarley received a state funeral in Jamaica on 21 May 1981, which combined elements of Ethiopian Orthodoxy[63][64] and Rastafari tradition.[65] He was buried in a chapel near his birthplace with his red Gibson Les Paul (some accounts say it was a Fender Stratocaster).[66][67]\\r\\nOn 21 May 1981, Jamaican Prime Minister Edward Seaga delivered the final funeral eulogy to Marley, declaring:\\r\\nHis voice was an omnipresent cry in our electronic world. His sharp features, majestic looks, and prancing style a vivid etching on the landscape of our minds. Bob Marley was never seen. He was an experience which left an indelible imprint with each encounter. Such a man cannot be erased from the mind. He is part of the collective consciousness of the nation.[53]:58\\r\\nBob Marley was a member for some years of the Rastafari movement, whose culture was a key element in the development of reggae. Bob Marley became an ardent proponent of Rastafari, taking their music out of the socially deprived areas of Jamaica and onto the international music scene. He once gave the following response, which was typical, to a question put to him during a recorded interview:\\r\\nInterviewer: \\"Can you tell the people what it means being a Rastafarian?\\"\\r\\nAccording to Marley's biographers, he affiliated with the Twelve Tribes Mansion, one of the Mansions of Rastafari. He was in the denomination known as \\"Tribe of Joseph\\", because he was born in February (each of the twelve sects being composed of members born in a different month). He signified this in his 1976 Rastaman Vibration album liner notes, quoting the portion from Deuteronomy 33:16 that includes Jacob's blessing to his son Joseph. Jacob, aka Israel, was a Jewish patriarch whose twelve sons became the ancestors of much of the growing Israelite population. The Rastaman Vibration back cover also quoted the Genesis 49:22-24, where Jacob describes his son Joseph as a 'fruitful bough' growing taller than the others, 'over the wall,' and suffering an attempted murder by bowmen who 'provoke, hate and shoot arrows at him', wounding him seriously. But Joseph survived because 'his arms and hands were made strong by the hands of the God of Jacob', which was understood by many as an eerie prophecy as, a few days after the album was released, Kingston gunmen shot Marley (bullets hit his arm and chest) who like Joseph, survived.\\r\\nArchbishop Abuna Yesehaq baptised Marley into the Ethiopian Orthodox Church, giving him the name Berhane Selassie, on 4 November 1980, shortly before his death.[69][70]\\r\\nBob Marley married Alpharita Constantia \\"Rita\\" Anderson in Kingston, Jamaica, on 10 February 1966.[71] Marley had many children: four with his wife Rita, two adopted from Rita's previous relationships, and several others with different women. The Bob Marley official website acknowledges 11 children.\\r\\nThose listed on the official site are:\\r\\nOther sites have noted additional individuals who claim to be family members,[72] as noted below:\\r\\nAside from music, association football played a major role throughout his life.[75] As well as playing the game, in parking lots, fields, and even inside recording studios, growing up he followed the Brazilian club Santos and its star player Pel.[75] Marley surrounded himself with people from the sport, and in the 1970s made the Jamaican international footballer Allan \\"Skill\\" Cole his tour manager.[75] He told a journalist, \\"If you want to get to know me, you will have to play football against me and the Wailers.\\"[75]\\r\\nMarley was a Pan-Africanist, and believed in the unity of African people worldwide. His beliefs were rooted in his Rastafari religious beliefs.[76] He was substantially inspired by Marcus Garvey, and had anti-imperialist and pan-Africanist themes in many of his songs, such as \\"Zimbabwe\\", \\"Exodus\\", \\"Survival\\", \\"Blackman Redemption\\", and \\"Redemption Song\\". \\"Redemption Song\\" draws influence from a speech given by Marcus Garvey in Nova Scotia, 1937.[77] Marley held that independence of African countries from European domination was a victory for all those in the African diaspora. In the song \\"Africa Unite\\", he sings of a desire for all peoples of the African diaspora to come together and fight against \\"Babylon\\"; similarly, in the song \\"Zimbabwe\\", he marks the liberation of the whole continent of Africa, and evokes calls for unity between all Africans, both within and outside Africa.[78]\\r\\nMarley considered cannabis a healing herb, a \\"sacrament\\", and an \\"aid to medication\\"; he supported the legalisation of the drug.[79] He thought that marijuana use was prevalent in the Bible, reading passages such as Psalms 104:14 as showing approval of its usage.[79] Marley began to use cannabis when he converted to the Rastafari faith from Catholicism in 1966. He was arrested in 1968 after being caught with cannabis, but continued to use marijuana in accordance with his religious beliefs. Of his marijuana usage, he said, \\"When you smoke herb, herb reveal yourself to you. All the wickedness you do, the herb reveal itself to yourself, your conscience, show up yourself clear, because herb make you meditate. Is only a natural t'ing and it grow like a tree.\\"[80] Marley saw marijuana usage as a vital factor in religious growth and connection with Jah, and as a way to philosophise and become wiser.[81]\\r\\nA statue was inaugurated, next to the national stadium on Arthur Wint Drive in Kingston to commemorate him.[90] In 2006, the New York City Department of Education co-named a portion of Church Avenue from Remsen Avenue to East 98th Street in the East Flatbush section of Brooklyn as \\"Bob Marley Boulevard\\".[91][92] In 2008, a statue of Marley was inaugurated in Banatski Sokolac, Serbia.[93]\\r\\nInternationally, Marley's message also continues to reverberate among various indigenous communities. For instance, the Australian Aboriginal people continue to burn a sacred flame to honour his memory in Sydney's Victoria Park, while members of the Amerindian Hopi and Havasupai tribe revere his work.[53]:5 There are also many tributes to Bob Marley throughout India, including restaurants, hotels, and cultural festivals.[94][95]\\r\\nMarley has also evolved into a global symbol, which has been endlessly merchandised through a variety of mediums. In light of this, author Dave Thompson in his book Reggae and Caribbean Music, laments what he perceives to be the commercialised pacification of Marley's more militant edge, stating:\\r\\nBob Marley ranks among both the most popular and the most misunderstood figures in modern culture ... That the machine has utterly emasculated Marley is beyond doubt. Gone from the public record is the ghetto kid who dreamed of Che Guevara and the Black Panthers, and pinned their posters up in the Wailers Soul Shack record store; who believed in freedom; and the fighting which it necessitated, and dressed the part on an early album sleeve; whose heroes were James Brown and Muhammad Ali; whose God was Ras Tafari and whose sacrament was marijuana. Instead, the Bob Marley who surveys his kingdom today is smiling benevolence, a shining sun, a waving palm tree, and a string of hits which tumble out of polite radio like candy from a gumball machine. Of course it has assured his immortality. But it has also demeaned him beyond recognition. Bob Marley was worth far more.[96]\\r\\nSeveral film adaptations have evolved as well. For instance, a feature-length documentary about his life, Rebel Music, won various awards at the Grammys. With contributions from Rita, The Wailers, and Marley's lovers and children, it also tells much of the story in his own words.[97] In February 2008, director Martin Scorsese announced his intention to produce a documentary movie on Marley. The film was set to be released on 6 February 2010, on what would have been Marley's 65th birthday.[98] However, Scorsese dropped out due to scheduling problems. He was replaced by Jonathan Demme,[99] who dropped out due to creative differences with producer Steve Bing during the beginning of editing. Kevin Macdonald replaced Demme[100] and the film, Marley, was released on 20 April 2012.[101] In March 2008, The Weinstein Company announced its plans to produce a biopic of Bob Marley, based on the book No Woman No Cry: My Life With Bob Marley by Rita Marley. Rudy Langlais will produce the script by Lizzie Borden and Rita Marley will be executive producer.[102] In 2011, ex-girlfriend and filmmaker Esther Anderson, along with Gian Godoy, made the documentary Bob Marley: The Making of a Legend, which premiered at the Edinburgh International Film Festival.[103]\\r\\nIn October 2015, Jamaican author Marlon James' novel A Brief History of Seven Killings, a fictional account of the attempted assassination of Marley, won the 2015 Man Booker Prize at a ceremony in London.[104]","input":"What type of music does bob marley sing?"},{"output":"Venice","context":"The aerial bombing of cities in warfare is an optional element of strategic bombing which became widespread during World War I. The bombing of cities grew to a vast scale in World War II, and is still practiced today. The development of aerial bombardment marked an increased capacity of armed forces to deliver ordnance from the air against combatants, military bases, and factories, with a greatly reduced risk to its ground forces. Civilian and non-combatant casualties in bombed cities have variously been a purposeful result of the bombings, or unavoidable collateral damage depending on intent and technology. A number of multilateral efforts have been made to restrict the use of aerial bombardment so as to protect non-combatants.[2]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe first bombs delivered to their targets by air were launched on unmanned balloons, carrying a single bomb, by the Austrians against Venice in 1849,[3] during the First Italian War of Independence.\\r\\nThe first ever air raid was conducted during the Italo-Turkish War by Italian forces against the Ottoman province of Libya on November 1, 1911. Giulio Gavotti dropped 1.5?kg of bombs on Ain Zara, a village 8?km west of the capital Tripoli.[4]\\r\\nAdrianople (presently Edirne) was bombed by Bulgaria in 1912 in the First Balkan War.[5] Historically, it was the first bombardment of a city from a heavier-than-air aircraft.[6] In the morning of 29 October 1912 at 9:30?a.m. the plane Albatros F-3 took off from an airfield near the village of Mustafa Pasha - present day Svilengrad, Bulgaria. The pilot was captain Radul Mikov with spotter and bombardier Prodan Tarakchiev. The airfield was specially created to carry out the take off and landing. According to the report weather conditions were perfect. The flight lasted for 1 hour and 20 minutes and the altitude was 500m. During the flight the crew flew over the city of Edirne, discovered hidden Ottoman forces in the nearby villages and flew towards to city railroad station, near the village of Karaagach. The plane was equipped with two bombs, which were released at 10:00 am over the station. The crew landed successfully at the airfield with 4 holes on the hull. A number of journalists and military attachs attended the site.\\r\\nIn May 1914, during the revolution of 1910ÿ17, General Venustiano Carranza, later president, ordered a biplane to bomb Neveria Hill adjacent to the downtown area of Mazatln in order to take the city. The bomb landed not on target but in a city street and in the process killed two citizens and wounded several others.[citation needed]\\r\\nThe first civilian target to be bombed from the air was the Belgian city of Antwerp. This city, at that moment the National Redoubt of Belgium, was bombed during the night of 24ÿ25 August 1914. Instead of targeting the surrounding fortresses, the Zeppelin LZ 25's intention was to bomb the clearly distinguishable historical centre of the city. After dropping approximately ten bombs, ten people were killed and forty injured. The British Royal Naval Air Service (RNAS) undertook the first Entente strategic bombing missions on 22 September 1914 and 8 October, when it bombed the Zeppelin bases in Cologne and Dsseldorf. The aeroplanes carried twenty-pound bombs, and at least one airship was destroyed.[7][8] On 19 January 1915 two German Zeppelins dropped 24 fifty-kilogram (110?lb) high-explosive bombs and ineffective three-kilogram incendiaries on the English towns of Great Yarmouth, Sheringham, King's Lynn, and the surrounding villages; in all, four people were killed, 16 injured, and monetary damage was estimated at S7,740.[9]\\r\\nLondon was bombed for the first time on 30 May 1915. In July 1916, the German government allowed directed raids against urban centers, sparking 23 airship raids in 1916 in which 125 tons of ordnance were dropped, killing 293 people and injuring 691. Gradually British air defenses improved and the Germans also introduced large bomber aircraft for bombing Britain. In 1917 and 1918 there were only eleven Zeppelin raids against England, and the final raid occurred on 5 August 1918, which resulted in the death of KK Peter Strasser, commander of the German Naval Airship Department. By the end of the war, 51 raids had been undertaken, in which 5,806 bombs were dropped, killing 557 people and injuring 1,358[citation needed]. In the course of the Zeppelin raids the Germans lost more than half their airships and 40% of their crew. It has been argued that the raids were effective far beyond material damage inflicted, in diverting and hampering wartime production, and diverting twelve squadrons and over 10,000 men to air defenses.[citation needed] The British developed an Independent Force of long-range bombers that could bomb Berlin, but the war ended before these raids began.\\r\\nAfter the war, bombers' increasing sophistication led to the general belief that aerial bombing would both destroy cities and be impossible to stop; as Stanley Baldwin stated in a 1932 speech, \\"The bomber will always get through\\".\\r\\nAfter World War I, there were protests in Iraq against continued British rule. Many Iraqis across a wide spectrum of opinion opposed the British Mandate for Iraq. The Iraqi revolt against the British began, with peaceful demonstrations in May 1920. Initial demands were rejected by the British administration, and fighting broke out in June 1920. This was suppressed, with many deaths, and at very high costs to the Empire. A policy of 'aerial policing', an invention of Winston Churchill's was brought in. This amounted to bombing restive civilians, followed up by pacification by ground troops. This continued up to the mid 1920s.[10] The aerial campaign included Sir Arthur Harris, 1st Baronet, who commanded a Vickers Vernon squadron engaged in the bombing and strafing of recalcitrant civilians.[11] Harris felt that the Arab civilians required this kind of \\"heavy hand\\" treatment.[12]\\r\\nFollowing the end of World War I, the British stepped up their efforts in their war against the Somali Dervish state, led by the so-called \\"Mad Mullah\\", whom they had been fighting for the control the area formerly known as British Somaliland. However, they had been unable to defeat the Dervish state for nearly 25 years. In January 1920, the British launched a combined aerial and land attack, bombarding Taleeh, the capital of the Dervish State.[13] The Somaliland Campaign has been described as one of the bloodiest and longest-running conflicts in the history of sub-Saharan Africa and the Somali forces are noted for concurrently repelling the invading British, Italian and Abyssinian forces for a period of 25 years.[14]\\r\\nDuring the Cristero War in Mexico in 1929, Irish pilot and mercenary Patrick Murphy mistakenly dropped several improvised \\"suitcase bombs\\" on the border town of Naco, Arizona, while bombing government forces in the adjacent town of Naco, Sonora, for the Cristero revolutionaries. The bombing, which caused damage to many buildings and injured several bystanders on the American side of the international border, became the first aerial bombardment of the Continental United States by a foreign power in American history.[15][16]\\r\\nThe Italians used aircraft against the Ethiopian cities in the Second Italo-Abyssinian War. For example, in February 1936, the Italian invasion forces in the south prepared for a major thrust towards the city of Harar. On 22 March, the Regia Aeronautica bombed Harar and Jijiga as a prelude. Both cities were reduced to ruins even though Harar had been declared an \\"open city\\".[17]\\r\\nDuring the Spanish Civil War, the Nationalists under Francisco Franco made extensive use of aerial bombing on civilian targets. Nazi Germany gave aircraft to Franco to support the overthrow of the Spanish Republican government. The first major example of this came in November 1936, when German and Spanish aircraft bombed Republican-held Madrid; this bombardment was sustained throughout the Siege of Madrid. Barcelona and Valencia were also targeted in this way. On 26 April 1937, the German Luftwaffe (Condor Legion) bombed the Spanish city of Guernica carrying out the most high-profile aerial attack of the war. This act caused worldwide revulsion and was the subject of a famous painting by Picasso, but by the standards of bombings during World War II, casualties were fairly minor (estimates ranging from 500 to 1,500).[citation needed]\\r\\nShortly after, the front-page headlines of the Diario de Almeria, dated June 3, 1937, referred to the press in London and Paris carrying the news of the \\"criminal bombardment of Almeria by German planes\\".[18]\\r\\nBarcelona was bombarded for three days beginning on 16 March 1938, at the height of the Spanish Civil War. Under the command of the Italian dictator Benito Mussolini, Italian aircraft stationed on the island of Majorca attacked 13 times dropping 44 tons of bombs, aimed at the civil population. These attacks were at the request of General Franco as retribution against the Catalan population.[citation needed][dubious ÿ discuss] The medieval Cathedral of Barcelona suffered bomb damage and more than one thousand people died, including many children. The number of people injured is estimated to be in the thousands.[19] Many others Spanish towns and cities were bombed by the German Legion Condor and the Italian Aviazione Legionaria among them Jaen, Durango, Granollers and Alicante.\\r\\nDuring the Manchurian Incident of 1931, the Japanese widely used airplanes to indiscriminately bomb key targets and cities, such as Mukden. After the Marco Polo Bridge Incident, the Imperial Japanese Army Air Service, in conjunction with the Imperial Japanese Navy Air Service, began relentlessly bombing Shanghai, Beijing (Peking), Tianjin (Tientsin) and several cities on the Chinese coast from the beginning of the Second Sino-Japanese War in 1937.\\r\\nThe bombing campaigns on Nanking and Canton which started in September 1937 evoked protests from the Western powers culminating in a resolution by the Far Eastern Advisory Committee of the League of Nations. An example of the many expressions of indignation came from Lord Cranborne, the British Under-Secretary of State For Foreign Affairs:\\r\\nWords cannot express the feelings of profound horror with which the news of these raids had been received by the whole civilized world. They are often directed against places far from the actual area of hostilities. The military objective, where it exists, seems to take a completely second place. The main object seems to be to inspire terror by the indiscriminate slaughter of civilians?...[20]\\r\\nAt the beginning of World War II, bombing of cities prior to invasion was an integral part of Nazi Germany's strategy. In the first stages of war, the Germans carried out many bombings of towns and cities in Poland (1939), including the capital Warsaw (also bombed in 1944), with Wielu being the first city destroyed by 75%. The Soviet Union also attempted strategic bombing against Poland and Finland, bombing Helsinki.[citation needed]\\r\\nThe British bombed the German city of Monchengladbach on 11 May 1940.[21] While Germany had refrained from aerial bombing of British cities after the British declaration of war on Germany in September 1939, Britain started aerial bombing of Germany, officially focusing on military and industrial targets, on the night of 15/16 May with 78 bombers against oil targets, 9 against steelworks and 9 against marshaling yards.[22] Oil remained the main British objective until the summer of 1941, although German cities and towns were regularly bombed from May 1940.\\r\\nAfter the Fall of France, the Luftwaffe turned its attention to the United Kingdom. The scale of the attack increased greatly in July 1940, with 258 civilians killed, and again in August with 1,075 dead.[23] During the night of 25 August, British bombers raided targets in and around Greater Berlin for the first time, in response to the accidental bombing of Oxford Street and the West End by the Luftwaffe while it was bombing the London docks.[24] On 4 September 1940 Hitler, frustrated by the RAF's superiority over the Luftwaffe and enraged by its bombing of German cities, decided to retaliate by bombing London and other cities in the UK.[25] On 7 September the Luftwaffe began massed attacks on London. The bombing campaign was known in the UK as \\"the Blitz\\", and ran from September 1940 through to May 1941. The Coventry Blitz and the Belfast Blitz were two of the heaviest of all bombings by the Luftwaffe, killing 568-1,000 civilians of Coventry, killing over 1,100 civilians in Belfast, and destroying much of both city centres.\\r\\nBritish bombing policy evolved during the war. In the beginning, the RAF was forbidden to attack targets in Germany due to the risk of accidental civilian casualties.[26] Following a German attack on military targets in the Orkney Islands on 16 March 1940 that killed a civilian, the RAF mounted its first attack against a German land target, the seaplane base on the island of Sylt.[27] The RAF began attacking transport targets west of the Rhine on the night of 10 May following the German invasion of the Low Countries, and military targets in the rest of Germany after the bombing of Rotterdam.[28] On 9 September 1940 RAF crews were instructed that due to the \\"indiscriminate\\" nature of German bombing, if they failed to find their assigned targets they were to attack targets of opportunity rather than bring their bombs home.[29] On the 15/16 December the RAF carried out its first area bombing attack (destroying 45% of the city of Mannheim), officially in response to the raid on Coventry.[30] The bombing of Mannheim has often been described as the first deliberate \\"terror bombing\\" of the war.[31]\\r\\nIn 1942, the goals of the British attacks were defined: the primary goal was the so-called \\"morale bombing\\", to weaken the will of the civil population to resist. Following this directive intensive bombing of highly populated city centers and working class quarters started. On 30 May 1942, the RAF Bomber Command launched the first \\"1,000 bomber raid\\" when 1,046 aircraft bombed Cologne in Operation Millennium, dropping over 2,000 tons of high explosive and incendiaries on the medieval town and burning it from end to end. 411 civilians and 85 combatants were killed, more than 130,000 had to leave the city.[citation needed]\\r\\nTwo further 1,000 bomber raids were executed over Essen and Bremen, but to less effect than the destruction at Cologne. The effects of the massive raids using a combination of blockbuster bombs and incendiaries created firestorms in some cites. The most extreme examples were caused by the bombing of Hamburg in Operation Gomorrah (45,000 dead), and the bombings of Kassel (10,000 dead), Darmstadt (12,500 dead), Pforzheim (21,200 dead), Swinemuende (23,000 dead), and Dresden (25,000 dead[32]).[citation needed]\\r\\nThe Allies also bombed urban areas in the other countries, including occupied France (Caen) and the major industrial cities of northern Italy, like Milan and Turin. Some cities were bombed at the different times by the Luftwaffe and the Allies, for example Belgrade in Yugoslavia and Bucharest in Romania.[citation needed]\\r\\nThe Luftwaffe also bombed cities in the Soviet Union, destroying Stalingrad in a massive air raid at the start of the Battle of Stalingrad and bombing Leningrad during the siege of the city of 1941ÿ1943. The Soviet bombing of the German cities was limited in comparison with the RAF bombing (destruction caused by the Soviet army was mainly due to the land artillery). The Soviet Air Force also bombed Budapest in Hungary.[citation needed]\\r\\nIn the Pacific theater, Japan continued to bomb Chinese cities as well as other Asian cities such as Singapore, Rangoon, and Mandalay. In the first few months of the war with the Western Powers, Japan projected its airpower on cities as distant as Colombo and Darwin.\\r\\nThe U.S. firebombed Tokyo on the night of March 9ÿ10, 1945, and killed more than 100,000 people in the deadliest conventional bombing in history, known to the United States Army Air Forces (USAAF) as Operation Meetinghouse.[33] In a few hours, 100,000 people who were in Tokyo including civilians died either by the bombing or the conflagration that followed the bombing by 325 U.S. B-29's night attacks. The fleet included 279 bombers. The bombing was meant to burn wooden buildings and indeed the bombing caused fire that created a 50?m/s wind that is comparable to tornadoes. A total of 381,300 bombs amounting to 1783 tons, were used in the bombing.\\r\\nAfter the successful Operation Meetinghouse raid, the USAAF then went on to attack other Japanese cities with incendiary and high-explosives bombs in effort to pulverize the enemy's war industry and shatter the enemy's civilian morale to contribute to the war effort. From March to August 1945, the U.S. firebombing of 66 other Japanese cities had killed 350,000 civilians. In addition, the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki killed 120,000 non-combatants, most of them civilians, and combatants.[34]\\r\\nDuring the Korean War of 1950ÿ1953, U.S.-led UN air forces heavily bombed the cities in North Korea and the North-occupied South Korea, including their respective capital cities.[35] There were also plans to use nuclear weapons against North Korea and the People's Republic of China.[36]\\r\\nFrom 1965 to 1968, during the Vietnam War, the United States Air Force conducted an aerial campaign known as Operation Rolling Thunder. The campaign began with interdiction of supply lines in rural areas of southern North Vietnam but incrementally spread northward throughout the country. In 1966, restrictions against bombing the capital city of Hanoi and the country's largest port, Haiphong, were lifted, and they were bombed by the USAF and Navy.[37] The bombing of the city centers continued to be prohibited.[38] However, the South Vietnamese cities seized by the communists were bombed, including the former capital of Hu? during the 1968 Tet Offensive.[citation needed]\\r\\nThe Republic of Vietnam Air Force bombed contested cities in South Vietnam in 1968, 1972 and 1975, while the Vietnam People's Air Force attacked Southern cities (including the capital city of Saigon) in 1975.[citation needed]\\r\\nThe Lebanese capital of Beirut was attacked by the Israeli aircraft during the Siege of Beirut in 1982, and during the 2006 Lebanon War (using guided munitions). Israeli cities were bombed by Egyptian, Syrian and Jordanian aircraft during the 1948 Arab-Israeli war and the Six day war. The bombing included attacks on some of Israel's largest cities, such as Tel Aviv, Jerusalem and Haifa. Israel also conducted air strikes targeting Palestinian targets during the Second Intifada, including against Hamas in Gaza.[citation needed]\\r\\nIn March 1979, in response to an uprising, the Khalq-control army of Democratic Republic of Afghanistan carpet-bombed the Afghan third-largest city of Herat, causing massive destruction[39] and some 5,000 to 25,000 deaths.[40] Herat was also repeatedly bombed during the following Soviet involvement in the Afghan civil war.\\r\\nFollowing the September 11, 2001 attacks, the U.S.-led coalition attacked the urban targets in Afghanistan using mainly precision-guided munitions (or \\"smart bombs\\"). The United States government maintains that it has a policy of striking only significant combatant targets while doing all possible to avoid what it terms \\"collateral damage\\" to civilians and non-combatants during the U.S.-led war in Afghanistan.\\r\\nSaddam Hussein's Iraq attacked civilian targets in Iranian cities in the \\"War of the Cities\\" during the IranÿIraq War in the 1980s, with Iranians retaliating in kind (both sides soon switched to ballistic missile attacks).[citation needed] Iraqi aircraft also bombed the Iraqi Kurdistan city of Halabja with conventional and chemical weapons in 1988, killing more than 5,000 people in the largest aerial poison gas attack in history.\\r\\nIn 1988 Somali Air Force aircraft conducted intense aerial bombardment of major Isaaq cities targeting civilian Isaaqs during its campaign against Somali National Movement in the north of the country. Civilians were also strafed by Somali Air Force aircraft as they were fleeing the aerial bombardment.[42] The artillery shelling and aerial bombardment caused the deaths of estimated 50,000 - 200,000 Isaaq civilians, as well as the complete destruction of Somalia's second and third largest cities.[43] It also caused up to 500,000[44][45] Somalis (primarily of the Isaaq clan)[46] to flee and cross the border into Hartasheikh in Ethiopia as refugees in what was described as \\"one of the fastest and largest forced movements of people recorded in Africa\\",[47] and resulted in the creation of the world's largest refugee camp then (1988),[48] with another 400,000 being internally displaced.[49][50][51] The scale of destruction led to Hargeisa being known as the 'Dresden of Africa'.[52]\\r\\nThe Iraqi Air Force attacked Kuwait City in 1990 and bombed their own cities during the 1991 uprisings in Iraq, targeting civilians with the use of bomb-carrying helicopters (use of airplanes was banned by the Coalition as part of the ceasefire agreement that ended hostilities of the Gulf War but not the war itself).\\r\\nUN-led coalition aircraft attacked targets in Iraqi cities, including in the capital Baghdad and the largest southern city of Basra during Operation Desert Storm in 1991.[citation needed]\\r\\nAt the beginning of the Yugoslav Wars, in Croatia (1991), the Yugoslav People's Army (JNA) carried out aerial bombing of Dubrovnik and Vukovar.[53]\\r\\nNATO's aerial bombing of FR Yugoslavia in 1999, an answer to the conflict in Kosovo, included aerial bombing throughout Serbia, notably of Belgrade, Novi Sad and Ni?. There were civilian casualties. Despite that the NATO campaign indeed being a violation of NATO's own charter,[54] the UNSC rebutted the case on March 24 and March 26 1999.[55] NATO hit civilian economic infrastructure, the integrated national power grid (leaving many cities in the dark), schools, hospitals, water purification plants, dams, oil refineries fertilizer factories, a petrochemical plant, national parks and marketplaces, and also nearly hit nuclear reactors and waste facilities.[56] The 78-day bombing campaign is assessed as having been an 'economic catastrophe', cutting the Yugoslav economy in half.[56]\\r\\nPost-Soviet Russia heavily bombed the Chechen capital of Grozny from the air with mostly unguided munitions (including fuel-air explosives) as well as bombarding it with a massive artillery barrages (1994ÿ1995, 1996 and 1999ÿ2000), killing thousands of people (some estimates say 27,000 civilians were killed during the 1994-1995 siege alone[57]) including civilians during the First and Second Chechen Wars. Although the Russian pilots and soldiers were ordered to attack designated targets only, such as the Presidential Palace, due to their inexperience and lack of training, Russian soldiers and pilots bombed and shelled random targets inside the city. In 2003, the UN still called Grozny the most destroyed city on earth.[58]\\r\\nIn 2003 Invasion of Iraq, the U.S.-led coalition aircraft again bombed Iraq, including the Shock and Awe campaign of precision bombing[citation needed] of government targets in the city centers. Since then, coalition aircraft attack Iraqi insurgent targets, including in urban locations like Najaf, Fallujah, Basra and Baghdad.[citation needed] There are frequent reports of civilian casualties, though it is often hard to distinguish guerrillas and civilians.\\r\\nSyrian MiG-23s bombed the city of Aleppo on 24 July 2012, the first use of aerial bombing in the Syrian civil war.[59][60][61]\\r\\nBudapest was attacked by the Soviet air strikes in 1956 during the Hungarian Revolution.[citation needed] In 2008, the cities of Tskhinvali and Gori were hit by the Georgian and Russian aircraft during the war in Georgia.[62]\\r\\nAir warfare, theoretically, must comply with laws and customs of war, including international humanitarian law by protecting the victims of the conflict and refraining from attacks on protected persons.[63]\\r\\nThese restraints on aerial warfare are covered by the general laws of war, because unlike war on land and at seawhich are specifically covered by rules such as the 1907 Hague Convention and Protocol I additional to the Geneva Conventions, which contain pertinent restrictions, prohibitions and guidelines there are no treaties specific to aerial warfare.[63]\\r\\nTo be legal, aerial operations must comply with the principles of humanitarian law: military necessity, distinction, and proportionality:[63] An attack or action must be intended to help in the defeat of the enemy; it must be an attack on a legitimate military objective, and the harm caused to civilians or civilian property must be proportional and not excessive in relation to the concrete and direct military advantage anticipated.","input":"Where did the first air raid take place?"},{"output":"in 1972 and 1973","context":"The Dark Side of the Moon is the eighth studio album by English rock band Pink Floyd, released on 1 March 1973 by Harvest Records. The album built on ideas explored in earlier recordings and live shows, but lacks the extended instrumental excursions that characterised their earlier work. Its themes explore conflict, greed, the passage of time, and mental illness, the latter partly inspired by the deteriorating mental state of founding member and principal contributor, Syd Barrett.\\r\\nDeveloped during live performances, an early version was premiered several months before recording began; new material was recorded in two sessions in 1972 and 1973 at Abbey Road in London. The group used some advanced recording techniques at the time, including multitrack recording and tape loops. Analogue synthesizers were prominent in several tracks, and snippets from recorded interviews with Pink Floyd's road crew and others provided philosophical quotations throughout. Engineer Alan Parsons was responsible for many distinctive sonic aspects and the recruitment of singer Clare Torry. The album's iconic sleeve was designed by Storm Thorgerson; following keyboardist Richard Wright's request for a \\"simple and bold\\" design, it depicts a prism spectrum, representing the band's lighting and the record's themes.\\r\\nThe Dark Side of the Moon was a commercial and critical success. It topped the Billboard Top LPs & Tapes chart for a week and remained in the chart for 741 weeks from 1973 to 1988. With an estimated 45 million copies sold, it is Pink Floyd's most successful album and one of the best-selling worldwide. It has been remastered and re-released several times, and covered in its entirety by several acts. It produced two singles, \\"Money\\" and \\"Us and Them\\". It is often ranked as one of the greatest albums of all time.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nFollowing Meddle in 1971, Pink Floyd assembled for a tour of Britain, Japan and the United States in December of that year. In a band meeting at drummer Nick Mason's home in Camden, bassist Roger Waters proposed that a new album could form part of the tour. Waters' idea was for an album that dealt with things that \\"make people mad\\", focusing on the pressures faced by the band during their arduous lifestyle, and dealing with the apparent mental problems suffered by former band member Syd Barrett.[1][2] The band had explored a similar idea with 1969's The Man and The Journey.[3] In an interview for Rolling Stone, guitarist David Gilmour said: \\"I think we all thought ÿ and Roger definitely thought ÿ that a lot of the lyrics that we had been using were a little too indirect. There was definitely a feeling that the words were going to be very clear and specific.\\"[4]\\r\\nGenerally, all four members agreed that Waters' album concept unified by a single theme was a good idea.[4] Waters, Gilmour, Mason and keyboardist Richard Wright participated in the writing and production of the new material, and Waters created the early demo tracks at his Islington home in a small studio built in his garden shed.[5] Parts of the new album were taken from previously unused material; the opening line of \\"Breathe\\" came from an earlier work by Waters and Ron Geesin, written for the soundtrack of The Body,[6] and the basic structure of \\"Us and Them\\" borrowed from an original composition by Wright for Zabriskie Point.[7] The band rehearsed at a warehouse in London owned by The Rolling Stones, and then at the Rainbow Theatre in Finsbury Park, London. They also purchased extra equipment, which included new speakers, a PA system, a 28-track mixing desk with a four channel quadraphonic output, and a custom-built lighting rig. Nine tonnes of kit was transported in three lorries; this would be the first time the band had taken an entire album on tour.[8][9] The album had been given the provisional title of Dark Side of the Moon (an allusion to lunacy, rather than astronomy).[10] However, after discovering that that title had already been used by another band, Medicine Head, it was temporarily changed to Eclipse. The new material premired at The Dome in Brighton, on 20 January 1972,[11] and after the commercial failure of Medicine Head's album the title was changed back to the band's original preference.[12][13][nb 1]\\r\\nDark Side of the Moon: A Piece for Assorted Lunatics, as it was then known,[3] was performed in the presence of an assembled press on 17 February 1972 ÿ more than a year before its release ÿ at the Rainbow Theatre, and was critically acclaimed.[14] Michael Wale of The Times described the piece as \\"...?bringing tears to the eyes. It was so completely understanding and musically questioning.\\"[15] Derek Jewell of The Sunday Times wrote \\"The ambition of the Floyd's artistic intention is now vast.\\"[12] Melody Maker was, however, less enthusiastic: \\"Musically, there were some great ideas, but the sound effects often left me wondering if I was in a bird-cage at London zoo.\\"[16] However, the following tour was praised by the public. The new material was performed live, in the same order in which it would eventually be recorded, but obvious differences between the live version, and the recorded version released a year later, included the lack of synthesizers in tracks such as \\"On the Run\\", and Bible readings that were later replaced by Clare Torry's non-lexical vocables on \\"The Great Gig in the Sky\\".[14]\\r\\nThe band's lengthy tour through Europe and North America gave them the opportunity to make continual improvements to the scale and quality of their performances.[17] Work on the album was interrupted in late February when the band travelled to France and recorded music for French director Barbet Schroeder's film, La Valle.[18][nb 2] They then performed in Japan and returned to France in March to complete work on the film. After a series of dates in North America, the band flew to London to begin recording the album, from 24 May to 25 June. More concerts in Europe and North America followed before the band returned on 9 January 1973 to complete work on the album.[19][20][21]\\r\\nThe Dark Side of the Moon built upon experiments Pink Floyd had attempted in their previous live shows and recordings, but lacks the extended instrumental excursions which, according to critic David Fricke, had become characteristic of the band after founding member Syd Barrett left in 1968. Gilmour, Barrett's replacement, later referred to those instrumentals as \\"that psychedelic noodling stuff\\", and with Waters cited 1971's Meddle as a turning-point towards what would be realised on the album. The Dark Side of the Moon's lyrical themes include conflict, greed, the passage of time, death, and insanity, the latter inspired in part by Barrett's deteriorating mental state; he had been the band's principal composer and lyricist.[7] The album is notable for its use of musique concrte[3] and conceptual, philosophical lyrics, as found in much of the band's other work.\\r\\nEach side of the album is a continuous piece of music. The five tracks on each side reflect various stages of human life, beginning and ending with a heartbeat, exploring the nature of the human experience, and (according to Waters) \\"empathy\\".[7] \\"Speak to Me\\" and \\"Breathe\\" together stress the mundane and futile elements of life that accompany the ever-present threat of madness, and the importance of living one's own life ÿ \\"Don't be afraid to care\\".[22] By shifting the scene to an airport, the synthesizer-driven instrumental \\"On the Run\\" evokes the stress and anxiety of modern travel, in particular Wright's fear of flying.[23] \\"Time\\" examines the manner in which its passage can control one's life and offers a stark warning to those who remain focused on mundane aspects; it is followed by a retreat into solitude and withdrawal in \\"Breathe (Reprise)\\". The first side of the album ends with Wright and vocalist Clare Torry's soulful metaphor for death, \\"The Great Gig in the Sky\\".[3] Opening with the sound of cash registers and loose change, the first track on side two, \\"Money\\", mocks greed and consumerism using tongue-in-cheek lyrics and cash-related sound effects (ironically, \\"Money\\" has been the most commercially successful track from the album, with several cover versions produced by other bands).[24] \\"Us and Them\\" addresses the isolation of the depressed with the symbolism of conflict and the use of simple dichotomies to describe personal relationships. \\"Any Colour You Like\\" concerns the lack of choice one has in a human society. \\"Brain Damage\\" looks at a mental illness resulting from the elevation of fame and success above the needs of the self; in particular, the line \\"and if the band you're in starts playing different tunes\\" reflects the mental breakdown of former bandmate Syd Barrett. The album ends with \\"Eclipse\\", which espouses the concepts of alterity and unity, while forcing the listener to recognise the common traits shared by humanity.[25][26]\\r\\nThe album was recorded at Abbey Road Studios, in two sessions, between May 1972 and January 1973. The band were assigned staff engineer Alan Parsons, who had worked as assistant tape operator on Atom Heart Mother, and who had also gained experience as a recording engineer on the Beatles' Abbey Road and Let It Be.[27][28] The recording sessions made use of some of the most advanced studio techniques of the time; the studio was capable of 16-track mixes, which offered a greater degree of flexibility than the eight- or four-track mixes they had previously used, although the band often used so many tracks that to make more space available second-generation copies were made.[29]\\r\\nBeginning on 1 June, the first track to be recorded was \\"Us and Them\\", followed six days later by \\"Money\\". Waters had created effects loops from recordings of various money-related objects, including coins thrown into a food-mixing bowl taken from his wife's pottery studio, and these were later re-recorded to take advantage of the band's decision to record a quadraphonic mix of the album (Parsons has since expressed dissatisfaction with the result of this mix, attributed to a lack of time and the paucity of available multi-track tape recorders).[28] \\"Time\\" and \\"The Great Gig in the Sky\\" were the next pieces to be recorded, followed by a two-month break, during which the band spent time with their families and prepared for an upcoming tour of the US.[30] The recording sessions suffered regular interruptions; Waters, a supporter of Arsenal F.C., would often break to see his team compete, and the band would occasionally stop work to watch Monty Python's Flying Circus on the television, leaving Parsons to work on material recorded up to that point.[29] Gilmour has, however, disputed this claim; in an interview in 2003 he said: \\"We would sometimes watch them but when we were on a roll, we would get on.\\"[31][32]\\r\\nReturning from the US in January 1973, they recorded \\"Brain Damage\\", \\"Eclipse\\", \\"Any Colour You Like\\" and \\"On the Run\\", while fine-tuning the work they had already laid down in the previous sessions. A foursome of female vocalists was assembled to sing on \\"Brain Damage\\", \\"Eclipse\\" and \\"Time\\", and saxophonist Dick Parry was booked to play on \\"Us and Them\\" and \\"Money\\". With director Adrian Maben, the band also filmed studio footage for Pink Floyd: Live at Pompeii.[33] Once the recording sessions were complete, the band began a tour of Europe.[34]\\r\\nThe album features metronomic sound effects during \\"Speak to Me\\", and tape loops opening \\"Money\\". Mason created a rough version of \\"Speak to Me\\" at his home, before completing it in the studio. The track serves as an overture and contains cross-fades of elements from other pieces on the album. A piano chord, replayed backwards, serves to augment the build-up of effects, which are immediately followed by the opening of \\"Breathe\\". Mason received a rare solo composing credit for \\"Speak to Me\\".[nb 3][35][36]\\r\\nThe sound effects on \\"Money\\" were created by splicing together Waters' recordings of clinking coins, tearing paper, a ringing cash register, and a clicking adding machine, which were used to create a 7-beat effects loop (later adapted to four tracks in order to create a \\"walk around the room\\" effect in quadraphonic presentations of the album).[37] At times the degree of sonic experimentation on the album required the engineers and band to operate the mixing console's faders simultaneously, in order to mix down the intricately assembled multitrack recordings of several of the songs (particularly \\"On the Run\\").[7]\\r\\nAlong with the conventional rock band instrumentation, Pink Floyd added prominent synthesizers to their sound. For example, the band experimented with an EMS VCS 3 on \\"Brain Damage\\" and \\"Any Colour You Like\\", and a Synthi A on \\"Time\\" and \\"On the Run\\". They also devised and recorded unconventional sounds, such as an assistant engineer running around the studio's echo chamber (during \\"On the Run\\"),[38] and a specially treated bass drum made to simulate a human heartbeat (during \\"Speak to Me\\", \\"On the Run\\", \\"Time\\" and \\"Eclipse\\"). This heartbeat is most prominent as the intro and the outro to the album, but it can also be heard sporadically on \\"Time\\" and \\"On the Run\\".[7] \\"Time\\" features assorted clocks ticking, then chiming simultaneously at the start of the song, accompanied by a series of Rototoms. The recordings were initially created as a quadraphonic test by Parsons, who recorded each timepiece at an antique clock shop.[35] Although these recordings had not been created specifically for the album, elements of this material were eventually used in the track.[39]\\r\\nSeveral tracks, including \\"Us and Them\\" and \\"Time\\", demonstrated Richard Wright's and David Gilmour's ability to harmonise their voices. In the 2003 Classic Albums documentary The Making of The Dark Side of the Moon, Waters attributed this to the fact that their voices sounded extremely similar. To take advantage of this, Parsons utilised studio techniques such as the double tracking of vocals and guitars, which allowed Gilmour to harmonise with himself. The engineer also made prominent use of flanging and phase shifting effects on vocals and instruments, odd trickery with reverb,[7] and the panning of sounds between channels (most notable in the quadraphonic mix of \\"On the Run\\", when the sound of the Hammond B3 organ played through a Leslie speaker rapidly swirls around the listener).[40]\\r\\nThe album's credits include Clare Torry, a session singer and songwriter, and a regular at Abbey Road. She had worked on pop material and numerous cover albums, and after hearing one of those albums Parsons invited her to the studio to sing on Wright's composition \\"The Great Gig in the Sky\\". She declined this invitation as she wanted to watch Chuck Berry perform at the Hammersmith Odeon, but arranged to come in on the following Sunday. The band explained the concept behind the album, but were unable to tell her exactly what she should do. Gilmour was in charge of the session, and in a few short takes on a Sunday night Torry improvised a wordless melody to accompany Wright's emotive piano solo. She was initially embarrassed by her exuberance in the recording booth, and wanted to apologise to the band ÿ only to find them delighted with her performance.[41][42] Her takes were then selectively edited to produce the version used on the track.[4] For her contribution she was paid S30, equivalent to about S360 in 2018,[41][43] but in 2004 she sued EMI and Pink Floyd for songwriting royalties, arguing that her contribution to \\"The Great Gig in the Sky\\" was substantial enough to be considered co-authorship. The High Court agreed with her, but the terms of the settlement were not disclosed.[44][45] All post-2005 pressings therefore credit Wright and Torry jointly for the song.[46]\\r\\nSnippets of voices between and over the music are another notable feature of the album. During recording sessions, Waters recruited both the staff and the temporary occupants of the studio to answer a series of questions printed on flashcards. The interviewees were placed in front of a microphone in a darkened Studio 3,[47] and shown such questions as \\"What's your favourite colour?\\" and \\"What's your favourite food?\\", before moving on to themes more central to the album (such as madness, violence, and death). Questions such as \\"When was the last time you were violent?\\", followed immediately by \\"Were you in the right?\\", were answered in the order they were presented.[7] Roger \\"The Hat\\" Manifold proved difficult to find, and was the only contributor recorded in a conventional sit-down interview, as by then the flashcards had been mislaid. Waters asked him about a violent encounter he had had with another motorist, and Manifold replied \\"...?give 'em a quick, short, sharp shock?...\\" When asked about death he responded \\"live for today, gone tomorrow, that's me?...\\"[48] Another roadie, Chris Adamson, who was on tour with Pink Floyd, recorded the snippet which opens the album: \\"I've been mad for fucking years ÿ absolutely years\\".[49] The band's road manager Peter Watts (father of actress Naomi Watts)[50] contributed the repeated laughter during \\"Brain Damage\\" and \\"Speak to Me\\". His second wife, Patricia \\"Puddie\\" Watts (now Patricia Gleason), was responsible for the line about the \\"geezer\\" who was \\"cruisin' for a bruisin'\\" used in the segue between \\"Money\\" and \\"Us and Them\\", and the words \\"I never said I was frightened of dying\\" heard halfway through \\"The Great Gig in the Sky\\".[51]\\r\\nPerhaps the most notable responses \\"I am not frightened of dying. Any time will do: I don't mind. Why should I be frightened of dying? There's no reason for it?ÿ you've got to go sometime\\" and closing words \\"there is no dark side in the moon, really. As a matter of fact it's all dark\\" came from the studios' Irish doorman, Gerry O'Driscoll.[52] Paul and Linda McCartney were also interviewed, but their answers were judged to be \\"trying too hard to be funny\\", and were not included on the album.[53] McCartney's Wings bandmate Henry McCullough contributed the line \\"I don't know, I was really drunk at the time\\".[54]\\r\\nFollowing the completion of the dialogue sessions, producer Chris Thomas was hired to provide \\"a fresh pair of ears\\". Thomas's background was in music, rather than engineering. He had worked with Beatles producer George Martin, and was acquainted with Pink Floyd's manager Steve O'Rourke.[55] All four members of the band were engaged in a disagreement over the style of the mix, with Waters and Mason preferring a \\"dry\\" and \\"clean\\" mix which made more use of the non-musical elements, and Gilmour and Wright preferring a subtler and more \\"echoey\\" mix.[56] Thomas later claimed there were no such disagreements, stating \\"There was no difference in opinion between them, I don't remember Roger once saying that he wanted less echo. In fact, there were never any hints that they were later going to fall out. It was a very creative atmosphere. A lot of fun.\\"[57] Although the truth remains unclear, Thomas's intervention resulted in a welcome compromise between Waters and Gilmour, leaving both entirely satisfied with the end product. Thomas was responsible for significant changes to the album, including the perfect timing of the echo used on \\"Us and Them\\". He was also present for the recording of \\"The Great Gig in the Sky\\" (although Parsons was responsible for hiring Torry).[58] Interviewed in 2006, when asked if he felt his goals had been accomplished in the studio, Waters said:\\r\\nWhen the record was finished I took a reel-to-reel copy home with me and I remember playing it for my wife then, and I remember her bursting into tears when it was finished. And I thought, \\"This has obviously struck a chord somewhere\\", and I was kinda pleased by that. You know when you've done something, certainly if you create a piece of music, you then hear it with fresh ears when you play it for somebody else. And at that point I thought to myself, \\"Wow, this is a pretty complete piece of work\\", and I had every confidence that people would respond to it.[59]\\r\\nThe album was originally released in a gatefold LP sleeve designed by Hipgnosis and George Hardie. Hipgnosis had designed several of the band's previous albums, with controversial results; EMI had reacted with confusion when faced with the cover designs for Atom Heart Mother and Obscured by Clouds, as they had expected to see traditional designs which included lettering and words. Designers Storm Thorgerson and Aubrey Powell were able to ignore such criticism as they were employed by the band. For The Dark Side of the Moon, Richard Wright instructed them to come up with something \\"smarter, neater ÿ more classy\\".[61] The prism design was inspired by a photograph that Thorgerson had seen during a brainstorming session with Powell.\\r\\nThe artwork was created by their associate, George Hardie. Hipgnosis offered the band a choice of seven designs, but all four members agreed that the prism was by far the best. The final design depicts a glass prism dispersing light into colour. The design represents three elements: the band's stage lighting, the album lyrics, and Wright's request for a \\"simple and bold\\" design.[7] The spectrum of light continues through to the gatefold ÿ an idea that Waters came up with.[62] Added shortly afterwards, the gatefold design also includes a visual representation of the heartbeat sound used throughout the album, and the back of the album cover contains Thorgerson's suggestion of another prism recombining the spectrum of light, facilitating interesting layouts of the sleeve in record shops.[63] The light band emanating from the prism on the album cover has six colours, missing indigo compared to the traditional division of the spectrum into red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo and violet. Inside the sleeve were two posters and two pyramid-themed stickers. One poster bore pictures of the band in concert, overlaid with scattered letters to form PINK FLOYD, and the other an infrared photograph of the Great Pyramids of Giza, created by Powell and Thorgerson.[63]\\r\\nSince the departure of founder member Barrett in 1968, the burden of lyrical composition had fallen mostly on Waters.[8] He is therefore credited as the author of the album's lyrics, making The Dark Side of the Moon the first of five consecutive Pink Floyd albums with lyrics credited to him alone.[64][nb 4] The band were so confident of the quality of the words that, for the first time, they printed them on the album's sleeve.[8] \\"Roger's concerns in it are not out of date,\\" remarked Gilmour on the album's twentieth anniversary. \\"He did a fantastic job with those words. Then, Roger was always more verbal than the rest of us, who had no great confidence in our lyric-writing. Probably, in hindsight, we should have stuck at it: the roots of our problems were being set back then. But we all got the credit and money that we were happy with.\\"[65]\\r\\nAs the quadraphonic mix of the album was not then complete, the band (with the exception of Wright) boycotted the press reception held at the London Planetarium on 27 February.[75] The guests were, instead, presented with a quartet of life-sized cardboard cut-outs of the band, and the stereo mix of the album was presented through a poor-quality public address system.[76][77] Generally, however, the press were enthusiastic; Melody Maker's Roy Hollingworth described side one as \\"so utterly confused with itself it was difficult to follow\\", but praised side two, writing: \\"The songs, the sounds, the rhythms were solid and sound, Saxophone hit the air, the band rocked and rolled, and then gushed and tripped away into the night.\\"[78] Steve Peacock of Sounds wrote: \\"I don't care if you've never heard a note of the Pink Floyd's music in your life, I'd unreservedly recommend everyone to The Dark Side of the Moon\\".[76] In his 1973 review for Rolling Stone magazine, Loyd Grossman declared Dark Side \\"a fine album with a textural and conceptual richness that not only invites, but demands involvement\\".[79] In his 1981 review of the album, Robert Christgau found its lyrical ideas clichd and its music pretentious, but called it a \\"kitsch masterpiece\\" that can be charming with highlights such as taped speech fragments, Parry's saxophone, and studio effects which enhance Gilmour's guitar solos.[68]\\r\\nThe Dark Side of the Moon was released first in the US on 1 March 1973,[80] and then in the UK on 16 March.[81] It became an instant chart success in Britain and throughout Western Europe;[76] by the following month, it had gained a gold certification in the US.[82] Throughout March 1973 the band played the album as part of their US tour, including a midnight performance at Radio City Music Hall in New York City on 17 March before an audience of 6,000. The album reached the Billboard Top LP's & Tape chart's number one spot on 28 April 1973,[83] and was so successful that the band returned two months later for another tour.[84]\\r\\nMuch of the album's early American success is attributed to the efforts of Pink Floyd's US record company, Capitol Records. Newly appointed chairman Bhaskar Menon set about trying to reverse the relatively poor sales of the band's 1971 studio album Meddle. Meanwhile, disenchanted with Capitol, the band and manager O'Rourke had been quietly negotiating a new contract with CBS president Clive Davis, on Columbia Records. The Dark Side of the Moon was the last album that Pink Floyd were obliged to release before formally signing a new contract. Menon's enthusiasm for the new album was such that he began a huge promotional advertising campaign, which included radio-friendly truncated versions of \\"Us and Them\\" and \\"Time\\".[85] In some countries ÿ notably the UK ÿ Pink Floyd had not released a single since 1968's \\"Point Me at the Sky\\", and unusually \\"Money\\" was released as a single on 7 May,[75] with \\"Any Colour You Like\\" on the B-side. It reached number?13 on the Billboard Hot 100 in July 1973.[nb 5][86] A two-sided white label promotional version of the single, with mono and stereo mixes, was sent to radio stations. The mono side had the word \\"bullshit\\" removed from the song ÿ leaving \\"bull\\" in its place ÿ however, the stereo side retained the uncensored version. This was subsequently withdrawn; the replacement was sent to radio stations with a note advising disc jockeys to dispose of the first uncensored copy.[87] On 4 February 1974, a double A-side single was released with \\"Time\\" on one side, and \\"Us and Them\\" on the opposite side.[nb 6][88] Menon's efforts to secure a contract renewal with Pink Floyd were in vain however; at the beginning of 1974, the band signed for Columbia with a reported advance fee of $1M (in Britain and Europe they continued to be represented by Harvest Records).[89]\\r\\nThe Dark Side of the Moon became one of the best-selling albums of all time[90] and is in the top?25 of a list of best-selling albums in the United States.[46][91] Although it held the number one spot in the US for only a week, it remained in the Billboard album chart for 741?weeks.[92] The album re-appeared on the Billboard charts with the introduction of the Top Pop Catalog Albums chart in May 1991, and has been a perennial feature since then.[93] In the UK, it is the seventh-best-selling album of all time and the highest selling album never to reach number one.[94]\\r\\nIn the US the LP was released before the introduction of platinum awards on 1 January 1976. It therefore held only a gold disc until 16 February 1990, when it was certified 11G platinum. On 4 June 1998 the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) certified the album 15G platinum,[46] denoting sales of fifteen million in the United States ÿ making it their biggest-selling work there (The Wall is 23G platinum, but as a double album this signifies sales of 11.5?million).[95] \\"Money\\" has sold well as a single, and as with \\"Time\\", remains a radio favourite; in the US, for the year ending 20 April 2005, \\"Time\\" was played on 13,723?occasions, and \\"Money\\" on 13,731?occasions.[nb 7] Industry sources suggest that worldwide sales of the album total about 45 million.[96][97] \\"On a slow week\\" between 8,000 and 9,000?copies are sold,[90] and a total of 400,000 were sold in 2002, making it the 200th-best-selling album of that year ÿ nearly three decades after its initial release. The album has sold 9,502,000 copies in the US since 1991 when Nielsen SoundScan began tracking sales for Billboard.[98] To this day, it occupies a prominent spot on Billboard's Pop Catalog Chart. It reached number one when the 2003 hybrid CD/SACD edition was released and sold 800,000?copies in the US.[46] On the week of 5 May 2006 The Dark Side of the Moon achieved a combined total of 1,716?weeks on the Billboard?200 and Pop Catalog charts.[59] One in every fourteen people in the US under the age of?50 is estimated to own, or to have owned, a copy.[46] Upon a chart rule change in 2009 allowing catalogue titles to re-enter the Billboard 200, The Dark Side of the Moon returned to the chart at number 189 on 12 December of that year for its 742nd charting week.[99] It has continued to sporadically appear on the Billboard 200 since then, reaching 900 weeks on the chart in April 2015.[100]\\r\\n\\"The combination of words and music hit a peak,\\" explained Gilmour. \\"All the music before had not had any great lyrical point to it. And this one was clear and concise. The cover was also right. I think it's become like a benevolent noose hanging behind us. Throughout our entire career, people have said we would never top the Dark Side record and tour. But The Wall earned more in dollar terms.\\"[65]\\r\\nIn 1979, The Dark Side of the Moon was released as a remastered LP by Mobile Fidelity Sound Lab,[101] and in April 1988 on their \\"Ultradisc\\" gold CD format.[102] The album was released by EMI on the then-new compact disc format in 1984, and in 1992 it was re-released as a remastered CD in the box set Shine On.[103] This version was re-released as a 20th anniversary box set edition with postcards the following year. The cover design was again by Storm Thorgerson, the designer of the original 1973 cover.[104] On some pressings, a faintly audible orchestral version of the Beatles' \\"Ticket to Ride\\" can be heard after \\"Eclipse\\" over the album's closing heartbeats.[46]\\r\\nThe original quadraphonic mix[nb 8], created by Alan Parsons,[105] was commissioned by EMI but never endorsed by Pink Floyd, as Parsons was disappointed with his mix.[28][105] To celebrate the album's 30th anniversary, an updated surround version was released in 2003. The band elected not to use Parsons' quadraphonic mix (done shortly after the original release), and instead had engineer James Guthrie create a new 5.1?channel surround sound mix on the SACD format.[28][106] Guthrie had worked with Pink Floyd since co-producing and engineering their eleventh album, The Wall, and had previously worked on surround versions of The Wall for DVD-Video and Waters' In the Flesh for SACD. Speaking in 2003, Alan Parsons expressed some disappointment with Guthrie's SACD mix, suggesting that Guthrie was \\"possibly a little too true to the original mix\\", but was generally complimentary.[28] The 30th-anniversary edition won four Surround Music Awards in 2003,[107] and has since sold more than 800,000?copies.[108] The cover image was created by a team of designers including Storm Thorgerson.[104] The image is a photograph of a custom-made stained glass window, built to match the exact dimensions and proportions of the original prism design. Transparent glass, held in place by strips of lead, was used in place of the opaque colours of the original. The idea is derived from the \\"sense of purity in the sound quality, being 5.1 surround sound?...\\" The image was created out of a desire to be \\"the same but different, such that the design was clearly DSotM, still the recognisable prism design, but was different and hence new\\".[109]\\r\\nThe Dark Side of the Moon was also re-released in 2003 on 180-gram virgin vinyl (mastered by Kevin Gray at AcousTech Mastering) and included slightly different versions of the original posters and stickers that came with the original vinyl release, along with a new 30th anniversary poster.[110] In 2007 the album was included in Oh, by the Way, a box set celebrating the 40th anniversary of Pink Floyd,[111] and a DRM-free version was released on the iTunes Store.[108] In 2011 the album was re-released as part of the Why Pink Floyd...? campaign, featuring a remastered version of the album along with various other material.[112]\\r\\nThe success of the album brought wealth to all four members of the band; Richard Wright and Roger Waters bought large country houses, and Nick Mason became a collector of upmarket cars.[114] Some of the profits were invested in the production of Monty Python and the Holy Grail.[115] Engineer Alan Parsons received a Grammy Award nomination for Best Engineered Recording, Non-Classical for The Dark Side of the Moon,[116] and he went on to have a successful career as a recording artist with the Alan Parsons Project. Although Waters and Gilmour have on occasion downplayed his contribution to the success of the album, Mason has praised his role.[117] In 2003, Parsons reflected: \\"I think they all felt that I managed to hang the rest of my career on Dark Side of the Moon, which has an element of truth to it. But I still wake up occasionally, frustrated about the fact that they made untold millions and a lot of the people involved in the record didn't.\\"[32][nb 9]\\r\\nPart of the legacy of The Dark Side of the Moon is in its influence on modern music, the musicians who have performed cover versions of its songs, and even in modern urban myths. Its release is often seen as a pivotal point in the history of rock music, and comparisons are sometimes drawn between Pink Floyd and Radiohead ÿ specifically their 1997 album OK Computer ÿ which has been called The Dark Side of the Moon of the 1990s, owing to the fact that both albums share themes relating to the loss of a creative individual's ability to function in the modern world.[119][120][121]\\r\\nThe Dark Side of the Moon has frequently appeared on rankings of the greatest albums of all-time.[122] In 1987, Rolling Stone listed the record 35th on its \\"Top 100?Albums of the Last 20?Years\\",[123] and sixteen years later, in 2003 the album polled in 43rd position on the magazine's list of the \\"500 Greatest Albums of All Time\\".[124] In 2012, The Dark Side of the Moon was voted 43rd again on Rolling Stone magazine's list of the \\"500 Greatest Albums of All Time\\".[125] In 2006, it was voted \\"My Favourite Album\\" by the Australian Broadcasting Corporation's audience.[126] NME readers voted the album eighth in their 2006 \\"Best Album of All Time\\" online poll,[127] and in 2009, Planet Rock listeners voted the album the \\"greatest of all time\\".[128] The album is also number two on the \\"Definitive 200\\" list of albums, made by the National Association of Recording Merchandisers \\"in celebration of the art form of the record album\\".[129] It came 29th in The Observer's 2006 list of \\"The 50 Albums That Changed Music\\",[130] and 37th in The Guardian's 1997 list of the \\"100 Best Albums Ever\\", as voted for by a panel of artists and music critics.[131] The album's cover has been lauded by critics and listeners alike, VH1 proclaiming it the fourth greatest in history,[132] and Planet Rock listeners the greatest of all time.[133] In 2013, The Dark Side of the Moon was selected for preservation in the United States National Recording Registry by the Library of Congress for being deemed \\"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\\".[134] In 2014, readers of Rhythm voted it the seventh most influential progressive drumming album.[135]\\r\\nOne of the more notable covers of The Dark Side of the Moon is Return to the Dark Side of the Moon: A Tribute to Pink Floyd. Released in 2006, the album is a progressive rock tribute featuring artists such as Adrian Belew, Tommy Shaw, Dweezil Zappa, and Rick Wakeman.[136] In 2000, The Squirrels released The Not So Bright Side of the Moon, which features a cover of the entire album.[137][138] The New York dub collective Easy Star All-Stars released Dub Side of the Moon in 2003[139] and Dubber Side of the Moon in 2010.[140] The group Voices on the Dark Side released the album Dark Side of the Moon a Cappella, a complete a cappella version of the album.[141] The bluegrass band Poor Man's Whiskey frequently play the album in bluegrass style, calling the suite Dark Side of the Moonshine.[142] A string quartet version of the album was released in 2004.[143] In 2009, The Flaming Lips released a track-by-track remake of the album in collaboration with Stardeath and White Dwarfs, and featuring Henry Rollins and Peaches as guest musicians.[144] Industrial metal band Ministry called their seventh studio album Dark Side of the Spoon as a play of word to The Dark Side of the Moon with reference to heroin, as several members of the band suffered from long-term addiction to said substance at the time.\\r\\nSeveral notable acts have covered the album live in its entirety, and a range of performers have used samples from The Dark Side of the Moon in their own material. Jam-rock band Phish performed a semi-improvised version of the entire album as part their show on 2 November 1998 in West Valley City, Utah.[145] Progressive metal band Dream Theater have twice covered the album in their live shows,[146] and in May 2011 Mary Fahl released From the Dark Side of the Moon, a song-by-song \\"re-imagining\\" of the album.[147] Milli Vanilli used the tape loops from Pink Floyd's \\"Money\\" to open their track \\"Money\\", followed by Marky Mark and the Funky Bunch on Music for the People.[148]\\r\\nDark Side of the Rainbow and Dark Side of Oz are two names commonly used in reference to rumours (circulated on the Internet since at least 1994) that The Dark Side of the Moon was written as a soundtrack for the 1939 film The Wizard of Oz. Observers playing the film and the album simultaneously have reported apparent synchronicities, such as Dorothy beginning to jog at the lyric \\"no one told you when to run\\" during \\"Time\\", and Dorothy balancing on a tightrope fence during the line \\"balanced on the biggest wave\\" in \\"Breathe\\".[149] David Gilmour and Nick Mason have both denied a connection between the two works, and Roger Waters has described the rumours as \\"amusing\\".[150] Alan Parsons has stated that the film was not mentioned during production of the album.[151]\\r\\nAll lyrics written by Roger Waters.\\r\\n*sales figures based on certification alone\\r\\n^shipments figures based on certification alone\\r\\nNotes\\r\\nFootnotes\\r\\nBibliography","input":"When was dark side of the moon written?"},{"output":"Secretariat","context":"The Kentucky Derby /?d??rbi/, is a horse race that is held annually in Louisville, Kentucky, United States, on the first Saturday in May, capping the two-week-long Kentucky Derby Festival. The race is a Grade I stakes race for three-year-old Thoroughbreds at a distance of one and a quarter miles (2?km) at Churchill Downs. Colts and geldings carry 126 pounds (57 kilograms) and fillies 121 pounds (55 kilograms).[1]\\r\\nThe race is often called \\"The Run for the Roses\\" for the blanket of roses draped over the winner. It is also known in the United States as \\"The Most Exciting Two Minutes In Sports\\" or \\"The Fastest Two Minutes in Sports\\" in reference to its approximate duration. It is the first leg of the American Triple Crown and is followed by the Preakness Stakes, then the Belmont Stakes. Unlike the Preakness and Belmont Stakes, which took hiatuses in 1891ÿ1893 and 1911ÿ1912, respectively, the Kentucky Derby has been run every consecutive year since 1875, even during both World Wars. A horse must win all three races to win the Triple Crown.[2] In the 2015 listing of the International Federation of Horseracing Authorities (IFHA), the Kentucky Derby tied with the Whitney Handicap as the top Grade 1 race in the United States outside the Breeders' Cup races.[3]\\r\\nThe attendance at the Kentucky Derby ranks first in North America and usually surpasses the attendance of all other stakes races including the Preakness Stakes, Belmont Stakes, and the Breeders' Cup.[4]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1872, Col. Meriwether Lewis Clark, Jr., grandson of William Clark of the Lewis and Clark expedition, traveled to England, visiting Epsom in Surrey where The Derby had been running annually since 1780.[5] From there, Clark went on to Paris, France, where in 1863, a group of racing enthusiasts had formed the French Jockey Club and had organized the Grand Prix de Paris at Longchamp, which at the time was the greatest race in France.\\r\\nReturning home to Kentucky, Clark organized the Louisville Jockey Club for the purpose of raising money to build quality racing facilities just outside the city. The track would soon become known as Churchill Downs, named for John and Henry Churchill, who provided the land for the racetrack.[6] Officially, the racetrack was incorporated as Churchill Downs in 1937.[7]\\r\\nThe Kentucky Derby was first run at 1 1/2 miles (12 furlongs; 2.4 km) the same distance as the Epsom Derby. The distance was changed in 1896 to its current 1 1/4 miles (10 furlongs; 2 km). On May 17, 1875, in front of an estimated crowd of 10,000 people, a field of 15 three-year-old horses contested the first Derby. Under jockey Oliver Lewis, a colt named Aristides, who was trained by future Hall of Famer Ansel Williamson, won the inaugural Derby. Later that year, Lewis rode Aristides to a second-place finish in the Belmont Stakes.\\r\\nAlthough the first race meeting proved a success, the track ran into financial difficulties and in 1894 the New Louisville Jockey Club was incorporated with new capitalization and improved facilities. Despite this, the business floundered until 1902 when Col. Matt Winn of Louisville put together a syndicate of businessmen to acquire the facility. Under Winn, Churchill Downs prospered and the Kentucky Derby then became the preeminent stakes race for three-year-old thoroughbred horses in North America.\\r\\nThoroughbred owners began sending their successful Derby horses to compete later in the Preakness Stakes at the Pimlico Race Course, in Baltimore, Maryland, followed by the Belmont Stakes in Elmont, New York. The three races offered large purses and in 1919 Sir Barton became the first horse to win all three races. However, the term Triple Crown didn't come into use for another eleven years. In 1930, when Gallant Fox became the second horse to win all three races, sportswriter Charles Hatton brought the phrase into American usage. Fueled by the media, public interest in the possibility of a \\"superhorse\\" that could win the Triple Crown began in the weeks leading up to the Derby. Two years after the term was coined, the race, which had been run in mid-May since inception, was changed to the first Saturday in May to allow for a specific schedule for the Triple Crown races. Since 1931, the order of Triple Crown races has been the Kentucky Derby first, followed by the Preakness Stakes and then the Belmont Stakes. Prior to 1931, eleven times the Preakness was run before the Derby. On May 12, 1917 and again on May 13, 1922, the Preakness and the Derby were run on the same day. On eleven occasions the Belmont Stakes was run before the Preakness Stakes.\\r\\nOn May 16, 1925, the first live radio broadcast of the Kentucky Derby was originated by WHAS and was also carried by WGN in Chicago.[8] On May 7, 1949, the first television coverage of the Kentucky Derby took place, produced by WAVE-TV, the NBC affiliate in Louisville. This coverage was aired live in the Louisville market and sent to NBC as a kinescope newsreel recording for national broadcast. On May 3, 1952, the first national television coverage of the Kentucky Derby took place, aired from then-CBS affiliate WHAS-TV.[9] In 1954, the purse exceeded $100,000 for the first time. In 1968, Dancer's Image became the first (and to this day the only) horse to win the race and then be disqualified after traces of phenylbutazone, an analgesic and anti-inflammatory drug, were found in the horse's urinalysis; Forward Pass won after a protracted legal battle by the owners of Dancer's Image (which they lost). Forward Pass thus became the eighth winner for Calumet Farm. Unexpectedly, the regulations at Kentucky thoroughbred race tracks were changed some years later, allowing horses to run on phenylbutazone. In 1970, Diane Crump became the first female jockey to ride in the Derby, finishing 15th aboard Fathom.[10]\\r\\nThe fastest time ever run in the Derby was set in 1973 at 1:59.4 minutes when Secretariat broke the record set by Northern Dancer in 1964. Not only has Secretariat's record time yet to be topped, in the race itself, he did something unique in Triple Crown races: each successive quarter, his times were faster. Though times for non-winners were not recorded, in 1973 Sham finished second, two and a half lengths behind Secretariat in the same race. Using the thoroughbred racing convention of one length equaling one-fifth of a second to calculate Sham's time, he also finished in under two minutes. Another sub-two-minute finish, only the third, was set in 2001 by Monarchos at 1:59.97.[11]\\r\\nIn 2005, the purse distribution for the Derby was changed, so that horses finishing fifth would henceforth receive a share of the purse; previously only the first four finishers did so.[12]\\r\\nSince the Kentucky Derby is the biggest race in the world, millions of people from around the world bet at various live tracks and online sportsbooks.[13] In 2017, a crowd of 158,070 watched Always Dreaming win the Derby, making it the seventh biggest attendance in the history of the racetrack. The track reported a wagering total of $209.2 million from all the sources on all the races on the Kentucky Derby Day program. It was a 9 percent increase compared to the total of $192.6 million in 2016 and an increase of 8 percent over the previous record set in 2015 of $194.3 million.[14] TwinSpires, a platform for betting online and a partner of the Kentucky Derby and the Breeders' Cup, recorded $32.8 million in handle on the Churchill Down races for the Kentucky Derby Day program. This was a 22 percent increase over the preceding year. On the Kentucky Derby race alone, the handle of TwinSpires was $20.1 million, which is a 22 percent rise compared to the prior year.[15]\\r\\nThe race often draws celebrities. HM Queen Elizabeth II, on a visit to the United States, joined the racegoers at Churchill Downs in 2007.[16]\\r\\nThe 2004 Derby marked the first time that jockeysas a result of a court orderwere allowed to wear corporate advertising logos on their clothing.[17][18]\\r\\nNorman Adams has been the designer of the Kentucky Derby Logo since 2002. On February 1, 2006, the Louisville-based fast-food company Yum! Brands, Inc. announced a corporate sponsorship deal to call the race \\"The Kentucky Derby presented by Yum! Brands.\\"[19] In 2018, Woodford Reserve replaced Yum Brands as the presenting sponsor.[20]\\r\\nIn addition to the race itself, a number of traditions play a large role in the Derby atmosphere. The mint julepan iced drink consisting of bourbon, mint, and a sugar syrupis the traditional beverage of the race. The historic drink can be served in an ice-frosted silver julep cup, but most Churchill Downs patrons sip theirs from souvenir glasses (first offered in 1939 and available in revised form each year since) printed with all previous Derby winners.[21] Also, burgoo, a thick stew of beef, chicken, pork, and vegetables, is a popular Kentucky dish served at the Derby.[citation needed]\\r\\nThe infielda spectator area inside the trackoffers general admission prices but little chance of seeing much of the race, particularly prior to the jumbotron installation in 2014.[22][23] Instead, revelers show up in the infield to party with abandon. By contrast, \\"Millionaire's Row\\" refers to the expensive box seats that attract the rich, the famous and the well-connected. Women appear in fine outfits lavishly accessorized with large, elaborate hats. Following the Call to the Post, as the horses are paraded before the grandstands, the University of Louisville Cardinal Marching Band plays Stephen Foster's \\"My Old Kentucky Home,\\" a tradition which began in 1921.[24] The event attracts spectators from a large area, flying in hundreds of private aircraft to Louisville International Airport.[25]\\r\\nThe Derby is frequently referred to as \\"The Run for the Roses,\\" because a lush blanket of 554 red roses is awarded to the Kentucky Derby winner each year. The tradition originated in 1883 when New York socialite E. Berry Wall presented roses to ladies at a post-Derby party that was attended by Churchill Downs founder and president, Col. M. Lewis Clark. This gesture is believed to have led Clark to the idea of making the rose the race's official flower. However, it was not until 1896 that any recorded account referred to roses being draped on the Derby winner. The Governor of Kentucky awards the garland and the Kentucky Derby Trophy. Pop vocalist Dan Fogelberg composed the song \\"Run for the Roses\\" which was released in time for the 1980 running of the race.[26]\\r\\nRiders Up! is the traditional command from the Paddock Judge for jockeys to mount their horses in advance of the upcoming race. Since 2012, it was recited by a dignitary or celebrity attendee.\\r\\nIn the weeks preceding the race, numerous activities are held for the Kentucky Derby Festival.

The original boundaries protected an area of 35,528 acres (55.5?sq?mi).[6] A boundary change and redesignation as a national park and preserve was authorized on November 22, 2000 and then established by an act of Congress on September 24, 2004.[2] The park encompasses 107,342 acres (167.7?sq?mi) while the preserve protects an additional 41,686 acres (65.1?sq?mi) for a total of 149,028 acres (232.9?sq?mi).[1]\\r\\nThe park contains the tallest sand dunes in North America.[7] The dunes cover an area of about 30?sq?mi (78?km2) and are estimated to contain over 5 billion cubic meters of sand.[8] Sediments from the surrounding mountains filled the valley over geologic time periods. After lakes within the valley receded, exposed sand was blown by the predominant southwest winds toward the Sangre de Cristos, eventually forming the dunefield over an estimated tens of thousands of years.[9] The four primary components of the Great Sand Dunes system are the mountain watershed, the dunefield, the sand sheet, and the sabkha.[8] Ecosystems within the mountain watershed include alpine tundra, subalpine forests, montane woodlands, and riparian zones.[10]\\r\\nEvidence of human habitation in the San Luis Valley dates back about 11,000 years. The first historic peoples to inhabit the area were the Southern Ute Tribe, while Apaches and Navajo also have cultural connections in the dunes area. In the late 17th century, Don Diego de Vargasa Spanish governor of Santa Fe de Nuevo Mxicobecame the first European on record to enter the San Luis Valley. Juan Bautista de Anza, Zebulon Pike, John C. Frmont, and John Gunnison all travelled through and explored parts of the region in the 18th and 19th centuries. The explorers were soon followed by settlers who ranched, farmed and mined in the valley starting in the late 19th century. The park was first established as a national monument in 1932 to protect it from gold mining and the potential of a concrete manufacturing business.[11]\\r\\nVisitors must walk across the wide and shallow Medano Creek to reach the dunes in spring and summer months. The creek typically has a peak flow from late May to early June in most years. From July through April, the creek is usually no more than a few inches deep, if there is any water at all.[12] Hiking is permitted throughout the dunes with the warning that the sand surface temperature may reach 150?F (66?C) in summer.[13] Sandboarding and sandsledding are popular activities, both done on specially designed equipment which can be rented just outside the park entrance or in Alamosa.[14] Visitors with street-legal four-wheel drive vehicles may continue past the end of the park's main road to Medano Pass on 22 miles (35?km) of unpaved road, crossing the stream bed of Medano Creek nine times and traversing 4 miles (6.4?km) of deep sand.[15] Hunting is permitted in the preserve during the months of autumn, while hunting is prohibited within national park boundaries at all times.[16] The preserve encompasses nearly all of the mountainous areas north and east of the dunefield, up to the ridgeline of the Sangre de Cristos.[5]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe oldest evidence of humans in the area dates back about 11,000 years. Some of the first people to enter the San Luis Valley and the Great Sand Dunes area were nomadic hunter-gatherers whose connection to the area centered around the herds of mammoths and prehistoric bison. They were Stone Age people who hunted with large stone spear or dart points now identified as Clovis and Folsom points. These people only stayed when hunting and plant gathering was good, and avoided the region during times of drought and scarcity.[11]\\r\\nModern American Indian tribes were familiar with the area when Spaniards first arrived in the 17th century. The traditional Ute phrase for the Great Sand Dunes is Saa waap maa nache, \\"sand that moves.\\" Jicarilla Apaches settled in northern New Mexico and called the dunes Sei-anyedi, \\"it goes up and down.\\" Blanca Peak, just southeast of the dunes, is one of the four sacred mountains of the Navajo, who call it Sisnaajini. These various tribes collected the inner layers of bark from ponderosa pine trees for use as food and medicine. The people from the Tewa/Tiwa-speaking pueblos along the Rio Grande remember a traditional site of great importance located in the valley near the dunes: the lake through which their people emerged into the present world. They call the lake Sip'ophe, meaning \\"Sandy Place Lake\\", which is thought to be the springs and/or lakes immediately west of the dunefield.[11]\\r\\nIn 1694, Don Diego de Vargas became the first European known to have entered the San Luis Valley, although herders and hunters from the Spanish colonies in present-day northern New Mexico probably entered the valley as early as 1598. De Vargas and his men hunted a herd of 500 bison in the southern part of the valley before returning to Santa Fe. In 1776, Juan Bautista de Anza and an entourage of men and livestock probably passed near the dunes as they returned from a punitive raid against a group of Comanches. At this time, the valley was a travel route between the High Plains and Santa Fe for Comanches, Utes, and Spanish soldiers. The dunes were likely a visible landmark for travelers along the trail.[11]\\r\\nThe first known writings about Great Sand Dunes appear in Zebulon Pikes journals of 1807. As Lewis and Clarks expedition was returning east, U.S. Army Lt. Pike was commissioned to explore as far west as the Arkansas and Red Rivers. By the end of November 1806, Pike and his men had reached the site of todays Pueblo, Colorado. Still pushing southwest, and confused about the location of the Arkansas River, Pike crossed the Sangre de Cristos just above the Great Sand Dunes.[11]\\r\\nAfter marching some miles, we discovered ... at the foot of the White Mountains [todays Sangre de Cristos] which we were then descending, sandy hillsWhen we encamped, I ascended one of the largest hills of sand, and with my glass could discover a large river [the Rio Grande] The sand-hills extended up and down the foot of the White Mountains about 15 miles, and appeared to be about 5 miles in width. Their appearance was exactly that of the sea in a storm, except as to color, not the least sign of vegetation existing thereon.\\r\\nIn 1848, John C. Frmont was hired to find a railroad route from St. Louis to California. He crossed the Sangre de Cristos into the San Luis Valley in winter, courting disaster but proving that a winter crossing of this range was possible. He was followed in 1853 by Captain John Gunnison of the Corps of Topographical Engineers. Gunnisons party crossed the dunefield on horseback.[11]\\r\\nIn the years that followed, the Rockies were gradually explored, treaties were signed and broken with resident tribes, and people with widely differing goals entered the San Luis Valley from the United States and Mexico. In 1852, Fort Massachusetts was built and then relocated to Fort Garland, about 20 miles southeast of the Great Sand Dunes, to safeguard travel for settlers following the explorers into the valley. Although many settlers arrived via the trails from Santa Fe or La Veta Pass, several routes over the Sangre de Cristos into the valley were well-known to American Indians and increasingly used by settlers in the late 1800s. Medano Pass, also known as Sand Hill Pass, and Mosca Pass, also called Robidouxs Pass, offered more direct routes from the growing front range cities and dropped into the valley just east of the Great Sand Dunes. Trails were improved into wagon routes and eventually into rough roads. The Mosca Pass Toll Road was developed in the 1870s, and stages and the mail route used it regularly through about 1911 when the western portion was damaged in a flash flood. Partially rebuilt at times in the 1930s through the 1950s, the road was repeatedly closed due to flood damage and is now a hiking trail.[11]\\r\\nThe Herard familyafter whom Mount Herard is named[17]established a ranch and homestead along Medano Creek in 1875, using the old Medano Pass Road to travel to and from their home. The modern unpaved road follows the old route and is open only to four-wheel drive, high-clearance vehicles as it passes through deep sand, rises to Medano Pass, and continues east into the Wet Mountain Valley. The Herards grazed and bred cattle in the mountain meadows, raised horses, and established a trout hatchery in the stream. Other families homesteaded near the dunes as well, including the Teofilo Trujillo family whose sheep and cattle ranch in the valley later became part of the MedanoÿZapata Ranch, owned by the Nature Conservancy since 1999. The Trujillo's extant homestead and the ruins of a destroyed one were declared a National Historic Landmark in 2004.[18] Frank and Virginia Wellington built a cabin and hand-dug the irrigation ditch that parallels Wellington Ditch Trail located south of the park campground.[11]\\r\\nGold and silver rushes occurred around the Rockies after 1853, bringing miners by the thousands into the state and stimulating mining businesses that are still in operation. Numerous small strikes occurred in the mountains around the San Luis Valley. People had frequently speculated that gold might be present in the Great Sand Dunes, and local newspapers ran articles in the 1920s estimating its worth at anywhere from 17 cents/ton to $3/ton. Active placer mining operations sprang up along Medano Creek, and in 1932 the Volcanic Mining Company established a gold mill designed to recover gold from the sand. Although minute quantities of gold were recovered, the technique was too labor-intensive, the stream too seasonal, and the pay-out too small to support any business for long.[11]\\r\\nThe idea that the dunes could be destroyed by gold mining or concrete manufacturing alarmed residents of Alamosa and Monte Vista. By the 1920s, the dunes had become a source of pride for local people, and a potential source of tourist dollars for local businesses. Members of the P.E.O. Sisterhood sponsored a bill to Congress asking for national monument status for Great Sand Dunes. Widely supported by local people, the bill was signed into law in 1932 by President Herbert Hoover. Similar support in the late 1990s resulted in the monuments expansion into a national park and preserve in 2000-2004.[11]\\r\\nThe park contains the tallest sand dunes in North America,[7] rising to a maximum height of 750 feet (229?m)[4] from the floor of the San Luis Valley on the western base of the Sangre de Cristo Range. The dunes cover an area of about 30?sq?mi (78?km2) and are estimated to contain over 5 billion cubic meters of sand.[8]\\r\\nCreation of the San Luis Valley began when the Sangre de Cristo Range was uplifted in the rotation of a large tectonic plate. The San Juan Mountains to the west of the valley were created through extended and dramatic volcanic activity. The San Luis Valley encompasses the area between the two mountain ranges and is roughly the size of the state of Connecticut. Sediments from both mountain ranges filled the deep chasm of the valley, along with huge amounts of water from melting glaciers and rain. The presence of larger rocks along Medano Creek at the base of the dunes, elsewhere on the valley floor, and in buried deposits indicates that some of the sediment has been washed down in torrential flash floods.[9]\\r\\nIn 2002, geologists discovered lakebed deposits on hills in the southern part of the valley, confirming theories of a huge lake that once covered much of the San Luis Valley floor. The body of water was named Lake Alamosa after the largest town in the valley. Lake Alamosa suddenly receded after its extreme water pressure broke through volcanic deposits in the southern end of the valley. The water then drained through the Rio Grande, likely forming the steep Rio Grande Gorge near Taos, New Mexico. Smaller lakes still covered the valley floor, including two broad lakes in the northeastern side of the valley. Large amounts of sediment from the volcanic San Juan Mountains continued to wash down into these lakes, along with some sand from the Sangre de Cristo Range. Dramatic natural climate change later significantly reduced these lakes, leaving behind the sand sheet. Remnants of these lakes still exist in the form of sabkha wetlands.[9]\\r\\nSand that was left behind after the lakes receded blew with the predominant southwest winds toward a low curve in the Sangre de Cristo Range. The wind funnels toward three mountain passesMosca, Medano, and Music Passesand the sand accumulates in this natural pocket. The winds blow from the valley floor toward the mountains, but during storms the winds blow back toward the valley. These opposing wind directions cause the dunes to grow vertically. Two mountain streamsMedano and Sand Creeksalso capture sand from the mountain side of the dunefield and carry it around the dunes and back to the valley floor. The creeks then disappear into the sand sheet, and the sand blows back into the dunefield. Barchan and transverse dunes form near these creeks. The combination of opposing winds, a huge supply of sand from the valley floor, and the sand recycling action of the creeks, are all part of the reason that these are the tallest dunes in North America.[9]\\r\\nSufficient vegetation has grown on the valley floor that there is little sand blowing into the main dunefield from the valley; however, small parabolic dunes continue to originate in the sand sheet and migrate across grasslands, joining the main dunefield. Some of these migrating dunes become covered by grasses and shrubs and stop migrating. The dunes system is fairly stable as the opposing wind directions balance each other out over time. Also, the main dunefield is moist beneath a thin layer of dry surface sand. While the top few inches of sand are blown around during windstorms, the moist sand remains largely in place.[9]\\r\\nScientists estimate that Lake Alamosa disappeared about 440,000 years ago, but the dunes themselves apparently originate from sand deposits from later, smaller lakes. A relatively new dating process, optically stimulated luminescence (OSL), is still in development. This method takes core samples of sand from deep within a dune, and attempts to measure how long quartz grains have been buried in the dark. If the deepest sand deposits can be accurately dated, the age of the dunes could be determined. Samples of sand from deep in the dunes have returned OSL dates varying between a few hundred years to tens of thousands of years old. The oldest dated deposits found so far would have accumulated in the late Pleistocene epoch, during the middle years of the current ice age's third stage.[9]\\r\\nThe dunes contain dark areas which are deposits of magnetite, a mineral that has eroded out of the Sangre de Cristo Range. Magnetite is both attracted to a magnet and can be magnetized to become a magnet itself; it is the most magnetic mineral in nature.[19] Magnetite is an oxide of iron which is heavier than the surrounding particles of sand. When overlying sand is removed by wind, magnetite deposits stay in place and are visible as dark patches in the dunefield.[20]\\r\\nGreat Sand Dunes National Park and Preserve is located in Saguache and Alamosa Counties, Colorado at approximately 37.75 north latitude and 105.5 west longitude. The national park is located in the San Luis Valley while the national preserve is located to the east in an adjacent section of the Sangre de Cristo Range of the Rocky Mountains.[5] Elevations range from 7,515?ft (2,291?m) in the valley west of the dunes, to 13,604?ft (4,146?m) at the summit of Tijeras Peak in the northern part of the preserve.[21][10]\\r\\nThe dunes cover an area of about 30?sq?mi (78?km2) while the surrounding relatively flat sand sheet which feeds the large dunes is actually the largest component of the entire dunes system, containing about 90% of all the sand in the park.[8] The forested and often snowcapped mountains exceeding 13,000?ft (4,000?m) to the east are the most prominent feature, towering over the high dunes. Other features include snow-fed creeks originating high in the mountains, and several alpine lakes. Two spring-fed creeks in the sand sheet along with a few small lakes in the valley's sabkha section southwest of the dunes create a wetland that nurtures wildlife.[10]\\r\\nThe main dunefield measures roughly 4?mi (6.4?km) east-to-west and 6?mi (9.7?km) north-to-south, with an adjacent 6?sq?mi (16?km2) area to the northwest called the Star Dune Complex, for a total of about 30?sq?mi (78?km2). The park and preserve together are approximately 15?mi (24?km) east-to-west at the widest point, and approximately 15?mi (24?km) north-to-south, also at the widest point.[5] The park encompasses 107,342 acres (167.7?sq?mi), while the preserve protects an additional 41,686 acres (65.1?sq?mi) for a total of 149,028 acres (232.9?sq?mi).[1]\\r\\nThe Rio Grande National Forest is located to the north and southeast while the remaining forested slopes directly to the east of the dunes were redesignated the Great Sand Dunes National Preserve. The San Isabel National Forest is located to the east of the preserve just beyond the ridge of the Sangre de Cristo Range. Private property abuts most of the southern boundary of the park. The San Luis Lakes State Wildlife Area lies adjacent to the southwestern corner of the park, while the Rio Grande flows through the valley farther to the southwest. The Baca National Wildlife Refuge lies adjacent to the west, and the slopes of the San Juan Mountains begin at the western edge of the valley. Private property of the Baca Grande subdivision of Crestone lies adjacent to the northwest.[5]\\r\\nThe nearest city is Alamosa which is about 30?mi (48?km) away by road to the southwest.[22][23] The nearest towns are Crestone to the north, Mosca and Hooper to the west, Blanca and Fort Garland to the south, and Gardner to the east. Colorado Springs and Denver are located a few hours away by car to the northeast.[23] The major roads through the San Luis Valley are U.S. Route 160 on an eastÿwest alignment passing south of the park, and U.S. Route 285 on a northÿsouth alignment passing west of the park and generally parallel to Colorado State Highway 17, which is the closer of the two northÿsouth roadways.[23]\\r\\nThe Great Sand Dunes are located in the high elevation desert of the San Luis Valley, just west of the Sangre de Cristo Range. The summer high temperatures are atypical for a desert area as the average high temperature is only slightly above 80?F (27?C) in the warmest month of July; however, the large spread between high and low temperatures is typical of a high desert climate. Low temperatures during winter nights can be extremely cold, with average low temperatures well below 32?F (0?C) and record low temperatures below 0?F (?18?C) from November through April.[24] Precipitation is very low on the dunes, averaging just 11.13 inches (283?mm) of rainfall per year.[25] The high evaporation rates on the dunes qualify the area as a desert, even though precipitation exceeds 10 inches (250?mm).\\r\\nSpring can sometimes bring high winds, mainly in the afternoon. Spring conditions vary greatly, from mild and sunny to cold and snowy. March is the snowiest month of the year, though some days are above 50?F (10?C). In late spring, when Medano Creek usually has its peak flow, snow or high winds are still possible. In summer, daytime high temperatures average 75ÿ80?F (24ÿ27?C); however, sand surface temperatures can soar to 150?F (66?C) on sunny afternoons. Summer nights are coolthe park is located 8,200?ft (2,500?m) above sea levelwith nighttime temperatures often dropping below 50?F (10?C). Afternoon thundershowers are common in July and August with cool winds, heavy rain and lightning. Fall is generally mild, with Indian summer days when temperatures reach 60?F (16?C) and higher, but chilly nights below freezing. Occasional fall storms bring icy rain or snow. Cold temperatures well below freezing are typical in winter, although the sunshine is generally abundant and the dry air doesn't feel as cold as more humid areas. The average winter high temperatures are just above freezing even in January, which is the coldest month of the year.[26]\\r\\nThe four primary components of the Great Sand Dunes system are the mountain watershed, the dunefield, the sand sheet, and the sabkha. The mountain watershed receives heavy snow and rain which feeds creeks that flow down from alpine tundra and lakes, through subalpine and montane woodlands, and finally around the main dunefield. Sand that has blown from the valley floor is captured in streams and carried back toward the valley. As creeks disappear into the valley floor, the sand is picked up and carried to the dunefield once again. The recycling action of water and wind, along with a 7% moisture content below the dry surface holding the sand together, contributes to the great height of the dunes.[8]\\r\\nThe dunefield is composed of reversing dunes, transverse dunesalso called crescentic or barchan dunesand star dunes. The sand sheet is the largest component of the system, comprising sandy grasslands that extend around three sides of the dunefield. Almost 90% of the sand deposit is found in the sand sheet, while the remainder is found in the dunefield. Small parabolic dunes form in the sand sheet and then migrate into the main dunefield. Nabkha dunes form around vegetation. The sabkha forms where sand is seasonally saturated by rising ground water. When the water evaporates away in late summer, minerals similar to baking soda cement sand grains together into a hard, white crust. Areas of sabkha can be found throughout western portions of the sand sheet, wherever the water table meets the surface. Some wetlands in the sabkha are deeper with plentiful plants and animals, while others are shallow and salty.[8]\\r\\nThere are hundreds of plant species in the park and preserve, adapted for environments as diverse as alpine tundra and warm water wetlands. Trees include aspen, Douglas fir, pinyon pine, ponderosa pine, Rocky Mountain juniper, three-leaf sumac, bristlecone pine, red osier dogwood, and narrow-leaf cottonwood.[27][28]\\r\\nAmong the flowering plants are alpine phlox, dwarf clover, alpine forget-me-not, fairy primrose, alpine aven, Indian paintbrush, lousewort, blue-purple penstemon, aspen daisy, western paintbrush, elephantella, snow buttercups, scurfpea, Indian ricegrass, blowout grass, prairie sunflower, Rocky Mountain beeplant, rubber rabbitbrush, speargrass, small-flowered sand verbena, narrowleaf yucca, prickly pear cactus, Rocky Mountain iris, and white water buttercup.[27][28]\\r\\nInland saltgrass is the primary type of grass around sabkha wetlands in the park.[27]\\r\\nMammals includefrom alpine tundra to low elevation grasslandsthe pika, yellow-bellied marmot, bighorn sheep, black bear, snowshoe hare, Abert's squirrel, cougar, mule deer, water shrew, beaver, kangaroo rat, badger, pronghorn, and elk. Over 1500 bison are currently ranched within park boundaries on private land owned by The Nature Conservancy which is only open to the public through tours.[29]\\r\\nOver 200 species of birds are found throughout the park. From higher to lower elevations and dependent on season, some of the bird species include the brown-capped rosy finch, white-tailed ptarmigan, red-breasted nuthatch, peregrine falcon, mountain bluebird, northern pygmy owl, dusky grouse, hummingbird (four species), western tanager, burrowing owl, bald eagle, golden eagle, sandhill crane, American avocet, and great blue heron.[30]\\r\\nVarious reptiles live in the park, such as the short-horned lizard, fence lizard, many-lined skink, bullsnake, and garter snake.[31]\\r\\nFish living in the park's streams include the Rio Grande cutthroat trout, Rio Grande sucker (Catostomus plebeius), and fathead minnow.[32]\\r\\nAmphibians include the tiger salamander, chorus frog, northern leopard frog, spadefoot toad, Great Plains toad, and Woodhouse's toad.[33]\\r\\nThe park harbors several endemic insects including the Great Sand Dunes tiger beetle, a circus beetle (Eleodes hirtipennis), Werner's (Amblyderus werneri) and Triplehorn's (Amblyderus triplehorni) ant-like flower beetle, as well as undescribed species of clown beetle, noctuid moth, and robber fly. More than a thousand different kinds of arthropods have been found at the Great Sand Dunes.[34]\\r\\nAlpine tundra is the highest elevation ecosystem at Great Sand Dunes where the conditions are too harsh for trees to survive, but wildflowers, pikas, yellow-bellied marmots, ptarmigans, and bighorn sheep thrive. The tundra begins about 11,700?ft (3,600?m) and continues upward to the highest peaks in the park. At subalpine elevations near the tree line grow krummholz (meaning \\"crooked wood\\")trees which are stunted and twisted due to high winds, snow, ice, short growing seasons, and shallow, poorly developed soils. The transition zone between subalpine forest and alpine tundra is an important refuge during storms for some mammals and birds who primarily live on tundra. Bristlecone and limber pines grow at an extremely slow rate, with small statures that belie their true ages as some are more than a thousand years old.[10]\\r\\nSubalpine forests and meadows capture heavy snow in winter and soaking rains in summer. The highest diversity of Rocky Mountain species of plants and animals are found in this ecosystem. Subalpine forest extends from 9,500?ft (2,900?m) to tree line at 11,700?ft (3,600?m). Montane forests and woodlands are found along the drier foothills at approximately 8,000?ft (2,400?m) to 9,500?ft (2,900?m). Pinyon-juniper and ponderosa pine woodlands are found on open, drier slopes, while cottonwood and aspen trees are in drainages. Cougars hunt mule deer here at night. Owls, dusky grouse, turkeys, and bullsnakes all find habitat in these drier, open woodlands.[10]\\r\\nThe riparian zone follows creeks through the subalpine and montane ecosystems at Great Sand Dunes. Cottonwood and aspen trees, red osier dogwood, and alder grow well in this wet environment, in turn providing shade and habitat for black bears, water shrews, and western tanagers. Rio Grande cutthroat trout are found in Medano Creek.[10]\\r\\nWhile the top few inches of the dunefield are often dry, the dunes are moist year-round due to ongoing precipitation. Moisture content of 7% beneath the surface sand allows species such as Ord's kangaroo rat, Great Sand Dunes tiger beetle, scurfpea, and blowout grass to survive here. Many animals visit the dunes from other habitats, including elk, pronghorn, bison, coyotes, bobcats, and raptors.[10]\\r\\nThe sand sheet includes extensive grasslands and shrublands that surround the dunefield on three sides, from 7,500?ft (2,300?m) to 8,200?ft (2,500?m). The sand sheet varies from wet meadows to cool-grass prairie to desert shrubland, depending on proximity to groundwater and soil type. Elk and pronghorn are common, while burrowing owls nest in the ground and other raptors float through the skies searching for mice, kangaroo rats, and short-horned lizards.[10]\\r\\nThe sabkha is a wetland region where groundwater rises and falls seasonally, leaving white alkali deposits on the surface. Inland saltgrass is common in this area. Toads can reproduce in sabkha wetlands when they are seasonally filled with sufficient fresh water. Shore birds such as the American avocet hunt tadpoles and insects in the shallow water. Wetlands speckle the San Luis Valley and are important habitat for sandhill cranes, shore birds, amphibians, dragonflies, and freshwater shrimp. Grassland species such as elk also use these waters for drinking. The sabkha and wetlands are at approximately 7,500?ft (2,300?m) in elevation.[10]\\r\\nThe park preserves the tallest sand dunes in North America,[7] as well as alpine lakes and tundra, mountain peaks over 13,000 feet (3,962 m) in elevation, mixed conifer forests, grasslands, and wetlands.[35]\\r\\nMedano Creek, which borders the east side of the dunes, never finds a permanent and stable streambed as fresh sand falls in the creek. Small underwater sand ridges that act like dams form and break down, creating surges of water which resemble waves. The surges occur at an average interval of about 20 seconds. In a high-water year, the surges can be as high as 20?in (51?cm). The \\"surge flow\\" mainly occurs during the peak flow period from late May to early June in most years.[12]\\r\\nBig Spring Creek is a unique spring-fed creek formed by an unconfined aquifer which creates wetlands that support rare species and plant communities in a generally arid area. The creek was designated a National Natural Landmark in 2012.[36]\\r\\nAccessing the dunes requires walking across the wide and shallow Medano Creek. The creek typically flows past the main dunes parking area from late April through late June, with peak flow occurring from late May to early June in most years. In other months, the creek is usually only a few inches deep, if there is any water at all.[12] Hiking is permitted throughout the dunes, with the warning that the sand can get very hot in the summer, up to 150?F (66?C).[13] Sand wheelchairs are available at the visitor center.[37] Sandboards and sand sleds can be rented just outside the park entrance or in Alamosa which is the closest city.[14]\\r\\nMosca Pass Trail is a 7?mi (11?km) roundtrip hike that follows a small creek through aspen and evergreen forests to Mosca Passelevation 9,737?ft (2,968?m)[5]in the Sangre de Cristo Range. American Indians and early settlers used this route for travel between the San Luis Valley and the Wet Mountain Valley to the east. Several trails located in the northeastern section of the park lead to alpine lakes high in the mountains. A trail to Medano Lake and the summit of Mount Herard is located off Medano Pass Road. A trail along Sand Creek leads to the Sand Creek Lakes and Music Passelevation 11,380?ft (3,470?m)[5]with a view of the Upper Sand Creek basin. Spur trails along Sand Creek lead to the four alpine lakes which feed the creek, and to several 13,000?ft (4,000?m) peaks above the basin. The Sand Ramp Trail traverses between the dunefield and the mountains, connecting the park's campground to Medano Pass Road (follow the road up to Medano Lake and Pass), as well as the base of the Sand Creek Trail.[13][5] Most of the park's grasslands, shrublands and wetlands have no established trails but are generally open to hiking. The Nature Conservancy's Medano Ranch property may only be visited on a guided tour. A fence surrounds the property to contain the Conservancy's bison herd and demarcate the boundaries.[38]\\r\\nMedano Pass Road is a 22?mi (35?km) four-wheel drive (4WD) road that begins where the main park road ends.[39] The unpaved road crosses Medano Creek nine times and traverses 4?mi (6.4?km) of deep sand. Only street-licensed 4WD motor vehicles or motorcycles, and bicycles are permitted.[15] Fat tire bikes are the only type of bicycle recommended by the park service due to the deep sandy stretches.[40] The road winds around the eastern side of the dunefield, up through a forested mountain canyon inside the National Preserve, and then over Medano Passelevation 9,982?ft (3,043?m)[5]at the 11.2?mi (18.0?km) mark. The road then continues down into the Wet Mountain Valley and connects with Colorado State Highway 69. Travellers are advised that hunting is permitted in the National Preserve during the months of autumn.[15]\\r\\nMost of the national park and the entire national preserve are open to horseback riding and pack animals. Prohibited zones include all developed areassuch as the Pinyon Flats campground, picnic areas, and the visitor centerall paved roadways and many of the hiking trails, along with the dunes area from the parking lot to as far as the High Dune, which is for pedestrian use only. All national park horse camping areas are in the wilderness in designated backcountry campsites or other wilderness areas at least 0.25?mi (0.4?km) from roads or trails. Camping is permitted anywhere in the national preserve and at designated sites along the Medano Pass Road, as long as minimum impact guidelines are followed. Permitted pack animals in the national park and the preserve include horses, mules, burros, donkeys, alpacas, and llamas. Overnight guests at the Zapata Ranch may take guided trips into the park; Zapata Partners is the only NPS-licensed provider of horseback riding in the Great Sand Dunes.[41][42]\\r\\nUnlike all other national parks in the contiguous United States, Great Sand Dunes National Park is located directly adjacent to a national preserve. The preserve is also managed by the National Park Service and seasonal hunting is permitted there.[16] Sport hunting has regulations which include not pursuing a wounded animal if it leaves the preserve and enters the national park. Mountain lion hunting with dogs is also allowed in the preserve, but unless the dogs have spotted the lion and are pursuing it, they are required to be leashed.[43] Other game species include turkey, bear, bighorn sheep, elk and mule deer.[44]\\r\\nThe dunes and surrounding area were designated a national monument in 1932 after a billsponsored by the P.E.O. Sisterhood and widely supported by local residentswas signed into law by President Herbert Hoover. Similar support in the late 1990s resulted in the monuments redesignation as Great Sand Dunes National Park and Preserve in 2000-2004.[11] The original boundaries protected an area of 35,528 acres (55.5?sq?mi).[6]\\r\\nIn 1976, the U.S. Congress designated the Great Sand Dunes Wildernessa wilderness area encompassing 32,643 acres (51?sq?mi) within the monument. This wilderness is the only one in the U.S. that protects a saltbush-greasewood ecosystem and includes the entire dunefield as well as much of the area west of the dunes.[45][46] Congress also designated the Sangre de Cristo Wilderness in 1993, which contains a total of 219,776 acres (343.4?sq?mi) of mountainous terrain.[47] Most of the Sangre de Cristo Wilderness is managed by the U.S. Forest Service while the National Park Service manages the area that has since been designated a national preserve.[48] Mechanized transport and motorized equipment or vehicles are not permitted in wilderness areas, while ATVs are not permitted anywhere in the national park and preserve.[47] The restrictions of a wilderness designation protect native wildlife such as the endemic Great Sand Dunes tiger beetle from potential extinction caused by human activities.[49] Both of the wilderness area designations exclude the existing road corridors that pass through them, specifically the paved park road and the unpaved Medano Pass Road.[46]\\r\\nIn 1999, the Nature Conservancy purchased surrounding state-owned land.[50] The land is within the MedanoÿZapata Ranch, located to the west and south.[51] Some of the ranch land is located within the current national park boundary in its southwestern corner,[5] and includes a fenced area that contains a bison herd within 44,000 acres (68.8?sq?mi)[50]an area that can only be visited on a guided tour.[52][53] The objective of the Nature Conservancy, as well as the federal and state governments, is to combine conservation and sustainable use of the ecosystem, in a manner similar to the protected area mosaic recommended in the early 1980s for parts of the Yukon in Canada.[51]\\r\\nThe eventual redesignation as Great Sand Dunes National Park and Preserve was authorized on November 22, 2000 when President Bill Clinton signed the Congressionally-approved Great Sand Dunes National Park and Preserve Act. The act directed the Secretary of the Interior to \\"establish the Great Sand Dunes National Park when sufficient land having sufficient diversity of resources has been acquired to warrant its designation.\\"[54] The new designation as a national park and preserve would not be made official until 2004 after sufficient land had been acquired.[55][56]\\r\\nIn 2002, the Nature Conservancy purchased the Baca Ranchan area of 97,000 acres (151.6?sq?mi)for $31.28 million. Financing was provided by the Department of the Interior, the Colorado State Land Board and private donors. The Baca Ranch had property located in the valley and the adjacent mountains, ranging in elevation from 7,500?ft (2,286?m) west of the dunes to the 14,165?ft (4,317?m) summit of Kit Carson Peak. The purchase approximately tripled the size of the monument. The ranch was split into three sections: the Sangre de Cristos section east of Crestone became part of the Rio Grande National Forest; the section west of the dunes was designated the Baca National Wildlife Refuge and managed by the Fish and Wildlife Service; the section east of the dunes was transferred first to the Rio Grande National Forest and later redesignated a national preserve in 2004 managed by the National Park Service. The national preserve remains open to regulated seasonal hunting, as it was when designated national forest land, but is protected from logging and mining activities which are generally permitted in national forests.[57]\\r\\nThe boundaries of the Great Sand Dunes National Park and Preserve were established by an act of Congress on September 24, 2004.[2]\\r\\nIn 2016, the federal government began negotiations toward purchasing 12,518 acres (19.6?sq?mi) of the MedanoÿZapata Ranch from the Nature Conservancy. The plan is to complete the park, making it fully accessible to the public, by acquiring the final piece of privately-held land located within the current park boundaries. The land includes the area presently occupied by the bison herd, as well as adjacent meadows and wetland areas. The purchase is expected to be completed by 2018.[56]","input":"When did the great sand dunes become a national park?"},{"output":"Castor and Pollux","context":"Gemini is one of the constellations of the zodiac. It was one of the 48 constellations described by the 2nd century AD astronomer Ptolemy and it remains one of the 88 modern constellations today. Its name is Latin for \\"twins,\\" and it is associated with the twins Castor and Pollux in Greek mythology. Its symbol is  (Unicode ?).\\r\\n\\r\\nGemini lies between Taurus to the west and Cancer to the east, with Auriga and Lynx to the north and Monoceros and Canis Minor to the south.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Sun resides in the astrological sign of Gemini from June 20 to July 20 each year (though the zodiac dates that it's May 21 to June 21).[3] By mid-August, Gemini will appear along the eastern horizon in the morning sky prior to sunrise. The best time to observe Gemini at night is overhead during the months of January and February. By April and May, the constellation will be visible soon after sunset in the west.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe easiest way to locate the constellation is to find its two brightest stars Castor and Pollux eastward from the familiar V shaped asterism of Taurus and the three stars of Orions belt. Another way is to mentally draw a line from the Pleiades star cluster located in Taurus and the brightest star in Leo, Regulus. In doing so, you are drawing an imaginary line that is relatively close to the ecliptic, a line which intersects Gemini roughly at the midpoint of the constellation, just below Castor and Pollux.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe constellation contains 85 stars visible to observation on Earth without a telescope.[4][5]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe brightest star in Gemini is Pollux, and the second-brightest is Castor. Castor's Bayer designation as \\"Alpha\\" arose because Johann Bayer did not carefully distinguish which of the two was the brighter when he assigned his eponymous designations in 1603.[6]\\r\\n\\r\\nϫ Gem (Castor) is a sextuple star system 52 light-years from Earth, which appears as a magnitude-1.6 blue-white star to the unaided eye. Two spectroscopic binaries are visible at magnitudes 1.9 and 3.0 with a period of 470 years. A wide-set red dwarf star is also a part of the system; this star is an Algol-type eclipsing binary star with a period of 19.5 hours; its minimum magnitude is 9.8 and its maximum magnitude is 9.3.\\r\\n\\r\\n Gem (Pollux) is an orange-hued giant star of magnitude 1.14, 34 light-years from Earth. Pollux has an extrasolar planet revolving around it, as do two other stars in Gemini, HD 50554, and HD 59686.\\r\\n\\r\\n Gem (Alhena) is a blue-white hued star of magnitude 1.9, 105 light-years from earth. Ѵ Gem (Wasat) is a long-period binary star 59 light-years from Earth. The primary is a white star of magnitude 3.5, and the secondary is an orange dwarf star of magnitude 8.2. The period is over 1000 years; it is divisible in medium amateur telescopes.\\r\\n\\r\\n Gem (Mebsuta), a double star, includes a primary yellow supergiant of magnitude 3.1, nine hundred light-years from Earth. The optical companion, of magnitude 9.6, is visible in binoculars and small telescopes.[6]\\r\\n\\r\\n Gem (Mekbuda) is a double star, whose primary is a Cepheid variable star with a period of 10.2 days; its minimum magnitude is 4.2 and its maximum magnitude is 3.6. It is a yellow supergiant, 1,200 light-years from Earth, with a radius that is 60 times solar, making it approximately 220,000 times the size of the Sun. The companion, a magnitude-7.6 star, is visible in binoculars and small amateur telescopes.\\r\\n\\r\\n Gem (Propus) is a binary star with a variable component. 380 light-years away, it has a period of 500 years and is only divisible in large amateur telescopes. The primary is a semi-regular red giant with a period of 233 days; its minimum magnitude is 3.9 and its maximum magnitude is 3.1. The secondary is of magnitude 6.[6]\\r\\n\\r\\n Gem is a binary star 143 light-years from Earth. The primary is a yellow giant of magnitude 3.6; the secondary is of magnitude 8. The two are only divisible in larger amateur instruments because of the discrepancy in brightness.\\r\\n\\r\\n Gem is a double star divisible in binoculars and small amateur telescopes. The primary is a blue giant of magnitude 4.1, 550 light-years from Earth, and the secondary is of magnitude 8. 38 Gem, a binary star, is also divisible in small amateur telescopes, 84 light-years from Earth. The primary is a white star of magnitude 4.8 and the secondary is a yellow star of magnitude 7.8.[6]\\r\\n\\r\\nU Gem is a dwarf nova type cataclysmic variable discovered by J. R. Hind in 1855.[7]\\r\\n\\r\\nMu Gem is the Bayer designation for a star in the northern constellation of Gemini. It has the traditional name Tejat Posterior, which means back foot, because it is the foot of Castor, one of the Gemini twins.\\r\\n\\r\\nSince the sky area of Gemini is directed away from the Milky Way, there are comparatively few deep-sky objects of note.\\r\\n\\r\\nM35 (NGC 2168) is a large, elongated open cluster of magnitude 5, discovered in the year 1745 by Swiss astronomer Philippe Loys de Chseaux. It has an area of approximately 0.2 square degrees, the same size as the full moon. Its high magnitude means that M35 is visible to the unaided eye under dark skies; under brighter skies it is discernible in binoculars. The 200 stars of M35 are arranged in chains that curve throughout the cluster; it is 2800 light-years from Earth. Another open cluster in Gemini is NGC 2158. Visible in large amateur telescopes and very rich, it is more than 12,000 light-years from Earth.[6]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Eskimo Nebula or Clown Face Nebula (NGC 2392) is a planetary nebula with an overall magnitude of 9.2, located 4,000 light-years from Earth.[9] In a small amateur telescope, its 10th magnitude central star is visible, along with its blue-green elliptical disk. It is named for its resemblance to the head of a person wearing a parka.[6]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Medusa Nebula is another planetary nebula, some 1,500 light-years distant. Geminga is a neutron star approximately 550 light-years from Earth. Other objects include NGC 2129, NGC 2158, NGC 2266, NGC 2331, NGC 2355, and NGC 2395.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Geminids are a bright meteor shower that peaks on December 13ÿ14. It has a maximum rate of approximately 100 meteors per hour, making it one of the richest meteor showers.[6] The Epsilon Geminids peak between October 18 and October 29 and have only been recently confirmed. They overlap with the Orionids, which make the Epsilon Geminids difficult to detect visually. Epsilon Geminid meteors have a higher velocity than Orionids.[10]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn Babylonian astronomy, the stars Castor and Pollux were known as the Great Twins (MUL.MASH.TAB.BA.GAL.GAL). The Twins were regarded as minor gods and were called Meshlamtaea and Lugalirra, meaning respectively 'The One who has arisen from the Underworld' and the 'Mighty King'. Both names can be understood as titles of Nergal, the major Babylonian god of plague and pestilence, who was king of the Underworld.[11]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn Greek mythology, Gemini was associated with the myth of Castor and Pollux, the children of Leda and Argonauts both. Pollux was the son of Zeus, who seduced Leda, while Castor was the son of Tyndareus, king of Sparta and Leda's husband. Castor and Pollux were also mythologically associated with St. Elmo's fire in their role as the protectors of sailors.[12] When Castor died, because he was mortal, Pollux begged his father Zeus to give Castor immortality, and he did, by uniting them together in the heavens.\\r\\n\\r\\nGemini is dominated by Castor and Pollux, two bright stars that appear relatively very closely together forming an o shape, encouraging the mythological link between the constellation and twinship. The twin above and to the right (as seen from the Northern Hemisphere) is Castor, whose brightest star is ϫ Gem; it is a second-magnitude star and represents Castor's head. The twin below and to the left is Pollux, whose brightest star is  Gem (more commonly called Pollux); it is of the first magnitude and represents Pollux's head. Furthermore, the other stars can be visualized as two parallel lines descending from the two main stars, making it look like two figures.\\r\\n\\r\\nH. A. Rey has suggested an alternative to the traditional visualization that connected the stars of Gemini to show twins holding hands. Pollux's torso is represented by the star  Gem, Pollux's right hand by  Gem, Pollux's left hand by  Gem; all three of these stars are of the fourth magnitude. Pollux's pelvis is represented by the star Ѵ Gem, Pollux's right knee by  Gem, Pollux's right foot by  Gem, Pollux's left knee by  Gem, and Pollux's left foot by  Gem.  Gem is of the second magnitude, while Ѵ and  Gem are of the third magnitude. Castor's torso is represented by the star  Gem, Castor's left hand by  Gem (which he shares with Pollux), Castor's right hand by Ĳ Gem; all three of these stars are of the fourth magnitude. Castor's pelvis is represented by the star  Gem, Castor's left foot by  Gem, and Castor's right foot by  Gem and  Gem; , , and  Gem are of the third magnitude. The brightest star in this constellation is Pollux.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn Meteorologica (1 343b30) Aristotle mentions that he observed Jupiter in conjunction with and then occulting a star in Gemini. This is the earliest-known observation of this nature.[13] A study published in 1990 suggests the star involved was 1 Geminorum and the event took place on 5 December 337 BC.[14]\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen William Herschel discovered Uranus on 13 March 1781 it was located near  Gem.[15] In 1930 Clyde Tombaugh exposed a series of photographic plates centred on Ѵ Gem and discovered Pluto.[16]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn Chinese astronomy, the stars that correspond to Gemini are located in two areas: the White Tiger of the West (lԴa, Xؐ Fng Bi HѸ) and the Vermillion Bird of the South (qԴG??, Nn Fng Zh Qu).\\r\\n\\r\\nAs of  2002[update], the Sun appears in the constellation Gemini from June 20 to July 20.

These crimes included waging wars of aggression, mass murder and genocide of prisoners of war, and repressing the population of conquered countries.[1]\\r\\nAntony Beevor describes the Soviet rape of German women during the occupation of Germany as the \\"greatest phenomenon of mass rape in history\\", and has estimated that at least 1.4 million women were raped in East Prussia, Pomerania, and Silesia alone. He asserts that Soviet women and girls liberated from slave labor in Germany were also violated.[2]\\r\\nThe German historian and left-wing antiwar activist J?rg Friedrich, argues that Allied aerial bombardment of civilian areas and cultural targets in enemy territory, including the German cities of Cologne, Hamburg, and Dresden, the Abbey in Monte Cassino in Italy during the Battle of Monte Cassino,[3] the Japanese cities of Tokyo, Nagoya, Osaka, and especially the use of atomic bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki, which resulted in the total destruction of cities and the deaths of hundreds of thousands of civilians, should be considered war crimes [4][5][6] but no positive or specific customary international humanitarian law with respect to aerial warfare existed prior to and during World War II.[7] This is also why no Japanese and German officers were prosecuted at the post-World War II Allied war crime trials for the aerial raids on Shanghai, Chongqing, Warsaw, Rotterdam, and British cities during the Blitz.[8]\\r\\nC.P. Stacey, the Canadian official campaign historian, reports that on 14 April 1945 rumours spread that the popular commanding officer of the Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders of Canada, Lieutenant Colonel Frederick E. Wigle, had been killed by a civilian sniper. This rumour resulted in the Highlanders setting fire to civilian property in the town of Friesoythe in an act of reprisal.[9] Stacey later wrote that the Canadian troops first removed German civilians from their property before setting the houses on fire; he commented that he was \\"glad to say that [he] never heard of another such case\\".[10] It was later found that German soldiers had killed the Argyll's commander.[11]\\r\\nFollowing the Operation Dragoon landings in southern France and the collapse of the German military occupation in August 1944, large numbers of Germans could not escape from France and surrendered to the French Forces of the Interior. The Resistance executed a few of the Wehrmacht and most of the Gestapo or SS prisoners.[31]\\r\\nThe Maquis also executed 17 German prisoners of war at Saint-Julien-de-Crempse (in the Dordogne region), on 10 September 1944, 14 of whom have since been positively identified. The murders were revenge killings for German murders of 17 local inhabitants of the village of St. Julien on 3 August 1944, which were themselves reprisal killings in response to Resistance activity in the St. Julien region, which was home to an active Maquis cell.[32]\\r\\nFrench Moroccan troops of the French Expeditionary Corps, known as Goumiers, committed mass crimes in Italy during and after the Battle of Monte Cassino[33] and in Germany.[34] According to Italian sources, more than 12,000 civilians, above all young and old women, children, were kidnapped, raped, or killed by Goumiers.[35] This is featured in the Italian film La Ciociara (Two Women) with Sophia Loren.\\r\\nAnthony Clayton in his book 'France, Soldiers, and Africa' (Brassey's Defence Publishers, 1988) devotes several pages to the criminal activities of the Goumiers, which he partially ascribes to the record of what was considered normal practices in their homeland.\\r\\nOn 4 May 1940, in response to Germany's intensive unrestricted submarine warfare, during the Battle of the Atlantic and its invasion of Denmark and Norway, the Royal Navy conducted its own unrestricted submarine campaign. The Admiralty announced that all vessels in the Skagerrak, were to be sunk on sight without warning. This was contrary to the terms of the Second London Naval Treaty.[36][37]\\r\\nIn July 1941, the submarine HMS Torbay (under the command of Anthony Miers) was based in the Mediterranean where it sank several German ships. On two occasions, once off the coast of Alexandria, Egypt, and the other off the coast of Crete, the crew attacked and killed dozens of shipwrecked German sailors and troops. None of the shipwrecked survivors posed a major threat to Torbay's crew. Miers made no attempt to hide his actions, and reported them in his official logs. He received a strongly worded reprimand from his superiors following the first incident. Mier's actions violated the Hague Convention of 1907, which banned the killing of shipwreck survivors under any circumstances.[38][39]\\r\\nDuring Operation Overlord, British line of communication troops conducted small-scale looting in Bayeux and Caen in France, following their liberation, in violation of the Hague Conventions.[40] Looting, rape, and prisoner execution was committed by British soldiers in a smaller scale than other armies throughout the war.[41] On 23 May 1945, British troops in Schleswig-Holstein were alleged to have plundered Glcksburg castle, stealing jewellery, and desecrating 38 coffins from the castle's mausoleum.[42]\\r\\nThe \\"London Cage\\", a MI19 prisoner of war facility in the UK during and immediately after the war, was subject to allegations of torture.[43] The Bad Nenndorf interrogation centre in occupied Germany, managed by the Combined Services Detailed Interrogation Centre, was the subject of an official inquiry in 1947, which found that there was \\"mental and physical torture during the interrogations\\" and that \\"personal property of the prisoners were stolen\\".[44]\\r\\nThe Italian statistics record eight rapes and nineteen attempted rape by British soldiers in Italy between September 1943 and December 1945. Various sources, including the Special Investigation Branch as well as evidences from Belgian reporters, said that rape and sexual harassment by British troops occurred frequently following the invasion of Sicily in 1943.[45] In Germany, rapes of local women were committed by British and Canadian troops.[citation needed] Even elderly women were targeted.[citation needed] Though the Royal Military Police tended to turn a blind eye towards abuse of German prisoners and civilians, rape was a major issue for them. Some officers, however, treated the behaviour of their men with leniency. Many rapes were committed under the effects of alcohol or post-traumatic stress,[citation needed] but there were cases of premeditated attacks,[citation needed] like the assault on three German women in the town of Neustadt am Rbenberge or the attempted gang-rape of two local girls at gunpoint in the village of Oyle, near Nienburg, which ended in the death of one of the women when, whether intentionally or not, one of the soldiers discharged his gun, hitting her in the neck.[46] There were also reports of \\"sexual assault and indecency\\" committed by British soldiers against children in Belgium and the Netherlands, when a number of men were convicted of these crimes while fraternizing with Dutch and Belgian families during the winter of 1944ÿ1945.[46]\\r\\nThe Soviet Union had not signed the Geneva Convention of 1929 that protected, and stated how prisoners of war should be treated. This cast doubt on whether the Soviet treatment of Axis prisoners was therefore a war crime, although prisoners \\"were [not] treated even remotely in accordance with the Geneva Convention\\",[56] resulting in the deaths of hundreds of thousands.[57][unreliable source?] However, the Nuremberg Tribunal rejected this as a general argument. The tribunal held that the Hague Conventions (which the 1929 Geneva Convention did not replace but only augmented, and unlike the 1929 convention, were ones that the Russian Empire had ratified) and other customary laws of war, regarding the treatment of prisoners of war, were binding on all nations in a conflict whether they were signatories to the specific treaty or not.[58][59][60]\\r\\nActs of mass rape and other war crimes were committed by Soviet troops during the occupation of East Prussia (Danzig),[61][62][63][64] parts of Pomerania and Silesia, during the Battle of Berlin,[65] and during the Battle of Budapest.[citation needed]\\r\\nLate in the war, Yugoslavia's communist partisans complained about the rapes and looting committed by the Soviet Army while traversing their country. Milovan Djilas later recalled Joseph Stalin's response,\\r\\nDoes Djilas, who is himself a writer, not know what human suffering and the human heart are? Can't he understand it if a soldier who has crossed thousands of kilometers through blood and fire and death has fun with a woman or takes some trifle?[66]\\r\\nSoviet war correspondent Natalya Gesse observed the Red Army in 1945: \\"The Russian soldiers were raping every German female from eight to eighty. It was an army of rapists\\". Polish women as well as Russian, Belorussian and Ukrainian slave laborers were also mass raped by the Red Army. The Soviet war correspondent Vasily Grossman described: \\"Liberated Soviet girls quite often complain that our soldiers rape them\\".[67]\\r\\nThe Gegenmiao massacre of 1945; rapes and massacres conducted by the Soviet Army over half a group of 1,800 Japanese women and children who had taken refuge in the lamasery Gegenmiao/Koken-miao (WH?R) during the Soviet invasion of Manchuria.[68]\\r\\nAllied soldiers in Pacific and Asian theatres sometimes killed Japanese soldiers who were attempting to surrender or after they had surrendered. A social historian of the Pacific War, John W. Dower, states that \\"by the final years of the war against Japan, a truly vicious cycle had developed in which the Japanese reluctance to surrender had meshed horrifically with Allied disinterest in taking prisoners\\".[69] Dower suggests that most Japanese personnel were told that they would be \\"killed or tortured\\" if they fell into Allied hands and, as a consequence, most of those faced with defeat on the battlefield fought to the death or committed suicide.[70] In addition, it was held to be shamefully disgraceful for a Japanese soldier to surrender, leading many to commit suicide or to fight to the death regardless of any beliefs concerning their possible treatment as POWs. In fact, the Japanese Field Service Code said that surrender was not permissible.[71]\\r\\nAnd while it was \\"not official policy\\" for Allied personnel to take no prisoners, \\"over wide reaches of the Asian battleground it was everyday practice\\".[72]\\r\\nOn 4 March 1943, during the Battle of the Bismarck Sea, General George Kenney ordered Allied patrol boats and aircraft to attack Japanese rescue vessels, as well as the survivors from the sunken vessels on life rafts and swimming or floating in the sea. This was later justified on the grounds that rescued servicemen would have been rapidly landed at their military destination and promptly returned to active service.[73] These orders violated the Hague Convention of 1907, which banned the killing of shipwreck survivors under any circumstances.[74]\\r\\nDuring the Burma Campaign, there are recorded instances of British troops removing gold teeth from dead Japanese troops and displaying Japanese skulls as trophies.[75]\\r\\nDuring the Allied occupation of Japan, Australian, British, Indian and New Zealand troops in Japan as part of the British Commonwealth Occupation Force (BCOF) committed 62 recorded rapes. The commander of the BCOF's official reports state that members of the BCOF were convicted of committing 57 rapes in the period May 1946 to December 1947 and a further 23 between January 1948 and September 1951. No official statistics on the incidence of serious crimes during the BCOF's first three months in Japan (February to April 1946) are available.[76] Australian historian Robin Gerster contends that while the official statistics underestimate the level of serious crime among BCOF members, Japanese police often did not pass reports they received on to the BCOF and that the serious crimes which were reported were properly investigated by BCOF military police. The penalties given to members of the BCOF convicted of serious crimes were \\"not severe\\", however, and those imposed on Australians were often mitigated or quashed by Australian courts.[77]\\r\\nC. P. Fitzgerald describes China under the rule of the Guo Mindang (or Kuomintang; KMT) as: \\"the Chinese people groaned under a regime fascist in every quality except efficiency.\\"[78]\\r\\nThere has been relatively little research into the general treatment of Japanese prisoners taken by Chinese Nationalist forces, such as the National Revolutionary Army (NRA), during the Second Sino-Japanese War (1937ÿ45), according to R. J. Rummel.[79] However, civilians and conscripts, as well as Japanese civilians in China, were frequently maltreated by the Chinese military. Rummel says that Chinese peasants \\"often had no less to fear from their own soldiers than ... from the Japanese\\".[80] The Nationalist military was reinforced by recruits gained through violent campaigns of conscription directed at Chinese civilians. According to Rummel:\\r\\nThis was a deadly affair in which men were kidnapped for the army, rounded up indiscriminately by press-gangs or army units among those on the roads or in the towns and villages, or otherwise gathered together. Many men, some the very young and old, were killed resisting or trying to escape. Once collected, they would be roped or chained together and marched, with little food or water, long distances to camp. They often died or were killed along the way, sometimes less than 50 percent reaching camp alive. Then recruit camp was no better, with hospitals resembling Nazi concentration camps... Probably 3,081,000 died during the Sino-Japanese War; likely another 1,131,000 during the Civil War4,212,000 dead in total. Just during conscription [emphasis added].[81]\\r\\nWithin some intakes of Nationalist conscripts, there was a death rate of 90% from disease, starvation or violence before they commenced training.[82]\\r\\nExamples of war crimes committed by Chinese associated forces include:\\r\\nAccording to historian Mark Johnston, \\"the killing of unarmed Japanese was common\\" and Australian command tried to put pressure on troops to actually take prisoners, but the troops proved reluctant.[85] When prisoners were indeed taken \\"it often proved difficult to prevent them from killing captured Japanese before they could be interrogated\\".[86] According to Johnston, as a consequence of this type of behavior, \\"Some Japanese soldiers were almost certainly deterred from surrendering to Australians\\".[86]\\r\\nMajor General Paul Cullen indicated that the killing of Japanese prisoners in the Kokoda Track Campaign was not uncommon. In one instance he recalled during the battle at Gorari that \\"the leading platoon captured five or seven Japanese and moved on to the next battle. The next platoon came along and bayoneted these Japanese.\\"[87] He also stated that he found the killings understandable but that it had left him feeling guilty.\\r\\nAmerican soldiers in the Pacific often deliberately killed Japanese soldiers who had surrendered. According to Richard Aldrich, who has published a study of the diaries kept by United States and Australian soldiers, they sometimes massacred prisoners of war.[88] Dower states that in \\"many instances ... Japanese who did become prisoners were killed on the spot or en route to prison compounds\\".[72] According to Aldrich it was common practice for U.S. troops not to take prisoners.[89] This analysis is supported by British historian Niall Ferguson,[90] who also says that, in 1943, \\"a secret [U.S.] intelligence report noted that only the promise of ice cream and three days leave would ... induce American troops not to kill surrendering Japanese\\".[90]\\r\\nFerguson states such practices played a role in the ratio of Japanese prisoners to dead being 1:100 in late 1944. That same year, efforts were taken by Allied high commanders to suppress \\"take no prisoners\\" attitudes,[90] among their own personnel (as these were affecting intelligence gathering) and to encourage Japanese soldiers to surrender. Ferguson adds that measures by Allied commanders to improve the ratio of Japanese prisoners to Japanese dead, resulted in it reaching 1:7, by mid-1945. Nevertheless, taking no prisoners was still standard practice among US troops at the Battle of Okinawa, in AprilÿJune 1945.[90]\\r\\nUlrich Straus, a US Japanologist, suggests that frontline troops intensely hated Japanese military personnel and were \\"not easily persuaded\\" to take or protect prisoners, as they believed that Allied personnel who surrendered, got \\"no mercy\\" from the Japanese.[91] Allied soldiers believed that Japanese soldiers were inclined to feign surrender in order to make surprise attacks.[91] Therefore, according to Straus, \\"Senior officers opposed the taking of prisoners on the grounds that it needlessly exposed American troops to risks\\".[91] When prisoners nevertheless were taken at Guadalcanal, interrogator Army Captain Burden noted that many times these were shot during transport because \\"it was too much bother to take him in\\".[92]\\r\\nFerguson suggests that \\"it was not only the fear of disciplinary action or of dishonor that deterred German and Japanese soldiers from surrendering. More important for most soldiers was the perception that prisoners would be killed by the enemy anyway, and so one might as well fight on\\".[90]\\r\\nUS historian James J. Weingartner attributes the very low number of Japanese in US POW compounds to two important factors, a Japanese reluctance to surrender and a widespread American \\"conviction that the Japanese were \\"animals\\" or \\"subhuman\\" and unworthy of the normal treatment accorded to POWs.[93] The latter reason is supported by Ferguson, who says that \\"Allied troops often saw the Japanese in the same way that Germans regarded Russiansas Untermenschen\\".[90]\\r\\nSome Allied soldiers collected Japanese body parts. The incidence of this by American personnel occurred on \\"a scale large enough to concern the Allied military authorities throughout the conflict and was widely reported and commented on in the American and Japanese wartime press\\".[94]\\r\\nThe collection of Japanese body parts began quite early in the war, prompting a September 1942 order for disciplinary action against such souvenir taking.[94] Harrison concludes that, since this was the first real opportunity to take such items (the Battle of Guadalcanal), \\"[c]learly, the collection of body parts on a scale large enough to concern the military authorities had started as soon as the first living or dead Japanese bodies were encountered\\".[94]\\r\\nWhen Japanese remains were repatriated from the Mariana Islands after the war, roughly 60 percent were missing their skulls.[94]\\r\\nIn a 13 June 1944 memorandum, the US Army Judge Advocate General, (JAG) Major General Myron C. Cramer, asserted that \\"such atrocious and brutal policies\\", were both \\"repugnant to the sensibilities of all civilized people\\"[93] and also violations of the Geneva Convention for the Amelioration of the Condition of the Wounded and Sick in Armies in the Field, which stated that: \\"After each engagement, the occupant of the field of battle shall take measures to search for the wounded and dead, and to protect them against pillage and maltreatment.\\"[95] Cramer recommended the distribution to all commanders of a directive ordering them to prohibit the misuse of enemy body parts.[93]\\r\\nThese practices were in addition also in violation of the unwritten customary rules of land warfare and could lead to the death penalty.[93] The US Navy JAG mirrored that opinion one week later, and also added that \\"the atrocious conduct of which some US personnel were guilty could lead to retaliation by the Japanese which would be justified under international law\\".[93]\\r\\nUS soldiers raped Okinawan women during the Battle of Okinawa in 1945.[96]\\r\\nOkinawan historian and former director of the Okinawa Prefectural Historical Archives Oshiro Masayasu writes based on several years of research:\\r\\nThere were also 1,336 reported rapes during the first 10 days of the occupation of Kanagawa prefecture after the Japanese surrender.[96]\\r\\nAccording to interviews carried out by the New York Times and published by them in 2000, multiple elderly people from an Okinawan village confessed that after the United States had won the Battle of Okinawa three armed marines kept coming to the village every week to force the villagers to gather all the local women, who were then carried off into the hills and raped. The article goes deeper into the matter and claims that the villagers' tale - true or not - is part of a 'dark, long-kept secret' the unraveling of which 'refocused attention on what historians say is one of the most widely ignored crimes of the war': \\"the widespread rape of Okinawan women by American servicemen\\".[98] Although Japanese reports of rape were largely ignored at the time, academic estimates have been that as many as 10,000 Okinawan women may have been raped. It has been claimed that the rape was so prevalent that most Okinawans over age 65 around the year 2000 either knew or had heard of a woman who was raped in the aftermath of the war. Military officials denied the mass rapings, and all surviving veterans refused the New York Times' request for an interview.[99]\\r\\nProfessor of East Asian Studies and expert on Okinawa Steve Rabson said: \\"I have read many accounts of such rapes in Okinawan newspapers and books, but few people know about them or are willing to talk about them\\". Books, diaries, articles and other documents refer to rapes by American soldiers of various races and backgrounds. Samuel Saxton, a retired captain, explained that the American veterans and witnesses may have believed: \\"It would be unfair for the public to get the impression that we were all a bunch of rapists after we worked so hard to serve our country\\". Masaie Ishihara, a sociology professor, supports this: \\"There is a lot of historical amnesia out there, many people don't want to acknowledge what really happened\\".[99]\\r\\nAn explanation given for why the US military has no record of any rapes is that few - if any - Okinawan women reported abuse, mostly out of fear and embarrassment. Those who did report them are believed by historians to have been ignored by the US military police. A large scale effort to determine the extent of such crimes has also never been called for. Over five decades after the war has ended the women who were believed to have been raped still refused to give a public statement, with friends, local historians and university professors who had spoken with the women instead saying they preferred not to discuss it publicly. According to a Nago, Okinawan police spokesman: \\"Victimized women feel too ashamed to make it public\\".[99]\\r\\nIn his book \\"Tennozan: The Battle of Okinawa and the Atomic Bomb\\", George Feifer noted that by 1946 there had been fewer than 10 reported cases of rape in Okinawa. He explains that it was: \\"partly because of shame and disgrace, partly because Americans were victors and occupiers\\". Feifer claimed: \\"In all there were probably thousands of incidents, but the victims' silence kept rape another dirty secret of the campaign.\\"[100] Many people wondered why it never came to light after the inevitable American-Japanese babies the many women must have had. In interviews, historians and Okinawan elders said that some Okinawan women who were raped did give birth to biracial children, but that many of them were immediately killed or left behind out of shame, disgust or fearful trauma. More often, however, rape victims underwent crude abortions with the help of village midwives.[99]\\r\\nHowever, American professor of Japanese Studies Michael S. Molasky argues that Okinawan civilians \\"were often surprised at the comparatively humane treatment they received from the American enemy.\\"[101][102] According to Islands of Discontent: Okinawan Responses to Japanese and American Power by the American Mark Selden, the Americans \\"did not pursue a policy of torture, rape, and murder of civilians as Japanese military officials had warned.\\"[103]\\r\\nAccording to James D. Morrow, \\"Death rates of POWs held is one measure of adherence to the standards of the treaties because substandard treatment leads to death of prisoners\\". The \\"democratic states generally provide good treatment of POWs\\".[104]\\r\\nNovelist James Bacque claims an analysis of records supports a German POW death rate of over 25%,[111] although his figures have been disputed by academics,[who?] who describe Bacque's figures as \\"simply impossible\\".[112] A panel of historians concluded that Bacque is a Canadian novelist with no previous historical research or writing experience,[113] and his writing is \\"seriously? nay, spectacularly? flawed in its most fundamental aspects.\\"[114]\\r\\nThe focus on supposed Allied atrocities during the war has been a theme in Holocaust denial literature, particularly in countries where outright denial of the Holocaust is illegal.[115] According to historian Deborah Lipstadt, the concept of \\"comparable Allied wrongs\\", such as the post-war expulsions and Allied war crimes, is at the center of, and a continuously repeated theme of, contemporary Holocaust denial; phenomenon she calls \\"immoral equivalencies\\".[116]\\r\\nJapanese neo-nationalists argue that Allied war crimes and the shortcomings of the Tokyo War Crimes Tribunal were equivalent to the war crimes committed by Japanese forces during the war.[citation needed] American historian John W. Dower has written that this position is \\"a kind of historiographic cancellation of immoralityas if the transgressions of others exonerate one's own crimes\\".[117] While right-wing forces in Japan have tried to push for their perspective on war-time history, they have been unsuccessful due to opposition from both within and outside Japan.[118]","input":"What was considered a war crime in ww2?"},{"output":"Austin","context":"Bree Weston (ne Mason, previously Van de Kamp and Hodge) is a fictional character and one of the four protagonists on the ABC television series Desperate Housewives. She is played by actress Marcia Cross, who has received multiple awards and nominations for her portrayal, including an Emmy Award nomination, three Golden Globe Award nominations, and two Screen Actors Guild Awards. Cross' portrayal of Bree has been widely praised by critics and fans.\\r\\nCross originally auditioned for the role of Mary Alice Young, but series creator Marc Cherry thought she was better suited for the role of Bree. Dana Delany, who eventually was cast as Katherine Mayfair, was originally chosen for the role but turned it down, saying it was too similar to her role in Pasadena.[2] Bree's main struggle throughout the series has been her attempts to maintain a perfect life despite various obstacles such as widowhood, divorce, and alcoholism hindering her. She has been married three times; to Rex Van de Kamp (Steven Culp), Orson Hodge (Kyle MacLachlan), and Trip Weston (Scott Bakula).\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nBree Van de Kamp is one of the four main protagonists in Desperate Housewives. Bree grew up in Rhode Island when her father married a woman named Eleanor, after her mother's death, with whom she did not get along. In order to escape her stepmother's demands, Bree left for Lake Forest College near Chicago. Bree also mentioned on one of Eleanor's visits that she had to work for every kind word she ever was given from her step-mother. Bree met Rex Van de Kamp at a meeting of the Young Republicans. After they graduated, they married and had two children, Andrew and Danielle, and moved to Fairview.\\r\\nBree is very much written as an exaggerated version of the characteristics often attributed to White Anglo-Saxon Protestant Americans; she has been called a \\"hyper-uptight WASP.\\"[3] Bree is recognized for her perfectionist attitude and work ethic, which at times border on neurosis and obsessiveÿcompulsive disorder. While the writers have shied away from an official diagnosis, the character is recognised as suffering from obsessiveÿcompulsive personality disorder. The character herself refers to her \\"quirks\\" in terms of anal retentiveness but Rex once mentioned it by the name. Bree's perfectionism may stem from when her mother was killed in a hit and run: a 10-year-old Bree cleaned her blood off the road outside the house. She said that once everything was spotless, she felt much better.\\r\\nBree is known for her homemaking talents on the level of Martha Stewart, particularly her gourmet meals, breakfast treats and pineapple bran muffins. She is also well-versed in firearm training; she owns four guns and is a card-carrying member of the National Rifle Association. Bree supports the Republican Party, as stated in the season 3 opener, and is also known for being a member of the local Presbyterian church, as shown in the episode Sunday. Her neighbours Angie Bolen, Gabrielle Solis and Renee Perry have nicknamed her 'Nancy Reagan' on occasions. She has lived at 4354 Wisteria Lane in Fairview since 1994 and is also said to have a timeshare residence in Aspen that she never uses. Bree is based on creator Marc Cherry's own mother, and the Van de Kamp family is based on the family in which he grew up. Bree's family was based on Marc Cherry's teen years, while Lynette Scavo's family is based on Marc Cherry's childhood years.[4] Bree and her first husband, Rex, were both named after the overtly vain characters on two of Marc Cherry's previous failed sitcoms, The 5 Mrs. Buchanans (Bree) and The Crew (Rex).\\r\\nBoth of Bree's marriages have broken down and ended in divorce (Rex, however, died before their divorce was finalized). Following the request for divorce, both of Bree's former husbands attempted reconciliation with her. Rex succeeded, whereas her second husband Orson Hodge did not. During the breakdown of her second marriage, Bree had an affair with Karl Mayer, her divorce lawyer and ex-husband of her friend, Susan Delfino. Bree, however, did remarry in the series finale to her lawyer, Trip Weston, making him her third husband.\\r\\nBree is the only one of the main four housewives not to appear in every episode. Appearing only as a stand-in in \\"My Husband, The Pig\\", Bree is totally absent in its six following episodes (\\"Dress Big\\", \\"Liaisons\\", \\"God, That's Good\\", \\"Gossip\\", \\"Into the Woods\\" and \\"What Would We Do Without You?\\") due to Cross' pregnancy.\\r\\nBree Van de Kamp is introduced in season one as the \\"perfect\\" wife and mother. However, it becomes apparent that her emotional coldness and obsession with appearance makes her family resent her and as her husband Rex put it \\"I just can't live in this detergent commercial anymore.\\"\\r\\nShe insists she and Rex have marriage guidance counselling when he wants a divorce and demands that Andrew and Danielle refuse presents from their father if they want to continue living with her. Unfortunately, in Andrew's case, this leads to him drink-driving and accidentally knocking down Juanita Solis, leaving her seriously injured. Rex and Bree conceal this to protect him but Bree is soon disappointed with his lack of remorse. Determined to make him realize that there are consequences to his actions, she reveals, in an anonymous tip-off to the coach of the swimming team, that Andrew keeps marijuana in his locker. This discovery results in him being removed from the team. Bree is determined to keep her family together until Rex has a heart attack, leading her to discover that he regularly visited a prostitute. Worse still, the prostitute turns out to be an acquaintance of hers, Maisy Gibbons, who is later arrested for living off immoral earnings. Maisy is persuaded to do a deal with the District Attorney, naming her clients and despite a request from Bree, does not remove Rex's name. Furious, Bree tells Rex she will divorce him but is \\"persuaded\\" by Andrew and Danielle to look after him, while he recuperates from a heart attack. Initially wanting to hurt him, Bree starts dating local pharmacist, George Williams, but ends things when Rex asks her to give their marriage another chance. She and George agree to be just friends. Wanting to stop Rex visiting prostitutes, she reluctantly takes part in S&M scenarios with him.\\r\\nConcerned about Andrew's worsening behaviour, she is cheered when Rex backs her up on one occasion. Unfortunately this doesn't make any difference so Rex and Bree feel that they have no choice but to send Andrew away to a boot camp. While there, Andrew reveals to his parents that he is bisexual. Bree initially tells him that she will always love him regardless but quietly insists to Rex that they take Andrew home immediately, worried about what he might be doing with the other boys at night, and asks their vicar to give Andrew some counselling on lifestyle, believing that his soul is in danger. This has disastrous results, as Andrew thinks she doesn't love him and deliberately hurts her. Bree continues to confide in George about her family problems but, after Rex makes it clear that Bree will stay with him, George begins tampering with Rex's medication. This is uncovered when Rex has a second heart attack. Believing Bree was responsible, Rex writes a note forgiving her and dies. Bree's final scenes in the season involve her receiving the bad news and breaking down in tears.\\r\\nIn Season 2, Bree's mother-in-law, Phyllis (Shirley Knight), visits for her son's funeral. She so annoys Bree with her constant sniping and excessive displays of grief that Bree tells her that she cannot attend Rex's funeral, but Andrew persuades her to. The final straw, however, is when she discovers Phyllis reported her friendship with George to the company handling Rex's life insurance. Bree sends Phyllis home and is questioned by the police about meddling with Rex's medication. She is cleared and is furious when she discovers the note Rex had left her which claimed he thought she murdered him and she starts dating George. However, George constantly tries to rush things, making her uneasy. When George places an announcement of their engagement in the local paper, an ex-fiance of his visits Bree to warn her about him. Bree is horrified and sends the woman away but she is proved right when George loses his temper with an old school friend of Bree's, so she ends their relationship. He tries blackmailing her into a reconciliation by taking some pills and admits killing Rex. Devastated, Bree says that she has called an ambulance and it will be there soon, but in reality, she hasn't. She watches him die and tells Andrew, who tries blackmailing her for his trust fund.\\r\\nEvents with Rex, George and Andrew take their toll and she starts drinking heavily. She realizes she has a problem when she loses Lynette's children after passing out while babysitting. Andrew later begins making accusations about Bree physically abusing him and tries to seek emancipation rights, which Bree refuses. In denial, but not wanting Andrew to get his trust fund or give up on him, Bree joins AA but only takes it seriously after passing out in a shop changing room and not waking up until late at night. Her AA sponsor, Peter, and a security guard let her out. Bree also faces more turmoil when she discovers her new neighbours, the Applewhites are hiding from the police and is blackmailed into silence. To distract herself from her alcoholism, she has a brief relationship with Peter, who is addicted to sex. However, Andrew discovers this and seduces Peter to get revenge on Bree for denying him his trust fund.

Devastated, Bree relapsed into alcoholism but overcame it, thanks to Katherine.\\r\\nBree puts her career first, alienating her friends at times and causing a rift between her and Orson. In revenge, Orson begins stealing - initially to punish people who he feels have been rude, and to hurt Bree. Orson agrees to stop stealing, but when Bree learns that he was injured while attempting to rob an old woman (which led to Edie Britt's death) and that he has been trying to convince people that the old woman is senile, she decides she has had enough. She hires Karl Mayer as her divorce lawyer, who convinces her to stage a fake burglary so she can hide her precious/expensive things in a storage unit and not risk losing them in the divorce proceedings.

However, Karl's fragility convinces Bree he needs her and she begins falling for him, acknowledging her feelings when they attend the same event and Karl brings another woman. This distracts her from her business and only realises the extent of Katherine's instability when an event is ruined. Bree dismisses her and, after getting to know new neighbour, Angie Bolen, hires her instead. Meanwhile, Karl's romantic gestures make their affair harder to hide. Suspicious, Orson gets Angie to spy on Bree.

They fight, but despite her initial unhappiness, Susan eventually gives them her blessing. In order to get away from Orson, Karl suggests Bree threaten him, which she does, indicating she has evidence of him breaking his parole, and demands a divorce.

Wanting to help, Bree gets two disabled men to visit, but Orson asks her to let him kill himself, telling her that he wants to die because no one loves him. When asked, Bree can't say the words, but seeing Orson trying to drown himself at a party of an old married couple with such passion causes Bree to realize that she still wants things to work with Orson. She stops him by telling him how much she cares and wants to recapture what they once had, and they reconcile.\\r\\nA young man named Sam Allen (Sam Page) visits Bree, offering himself as a new assistant. Impressed by Sam's skills, Bree promotes him to vice-president, much to Andrew's anger. While visiting Sam's home, Bree is stunned to see a photo of Rex and Sam. Sam admits Rex was his father and that he spent years watching Bree's family, wondering why Rex chose them over him, and after his mother's death, came to see Bree. Shocked by this, Bree welcomes Sam into her life but finds herself at odds with Andrew, who suspects Sam has an ulterior motive. Sam plots to make Bree fire Andrew, which she does, but after she reveals that she and Andrew have a love-and-hate relationship, it's likely that Andrew will return. After she tells Orson about a sabotaged dinner, suspecting Andrew, Orson says Andrew couldn't be responsible because it was well planned, making Bree suspect Sam's true intentions. She discovers that Sam's mother is still alive and reveals that Sam found a letter from Rex, offering to take full custody of him. Bree confronts Sam about his lies and he angrily smashes a vase before leaving. She apologizes to Andrew but tells him and Orson she's not firing Sam for fear of how he might react.\\r\\nIn the season finale, Bree does try firing Sam but he retaliates by revealing he knows how Andrew ran over Carlos' mother years before (a drunken Danielle told him). He threatens to tell the police unless Bree turns over control of the company to him. Bree agrees to do so and then says she feels sorry for Sam for losing his chance to be part of a family and suspects no one will ever truly care for the man. Orson, who had not known what Andrew did, calls out Bree on the hypocrisy of demanding he go to jail for his hit-and-run of Mike but hiding Andrew's crime.

Bree tells Andrew she now knows Orson was right and is seen about to confess to Gabrielle.\\r\\nBree confesses to covering up the demise of Carlos' mom Mama Solis (Lupe Ontiveros). Gabrielle chooses not to tell her husband. After discovering her ex-husband has a new girlfriend only a week after they separated, Bree decides to redecorate the ground floor of her house, hiring Keith Watson (Brian Austin Green), to help but finds herself attracted to him. While looking at him from her car, she does not see Juanita Solis (Madison De La Garza) behind her before reversing, leading to Juanita being admitted to hospital. Upon finding out that Keith has a girlfriend, she agreed to go out clubbing with Renee Perry. She finds out that Keith broke up with his girlfriend, but he is instead going home with Renee. Bree sabotages their night and eventually asks Keith on a date. This begins Bree and Renee's fight over Keith.\\r\\nLater Bree only mentioned to Richard Watson, father of Keith, that she's finally a divorcee. Learning this, Richard, who has been having feelings for Bree, tries to make a move to destroy Bree's and Keith's relationship so that he could have Bree instead. Keith attempts to propose to Bree and after the second failed attempt, Keith begins to question his relationship with Bree. Richard manipulates Keith's mind by warning him that Bree might be using him as a diversion from her actual feelings after her divorce from Orson. As a result, Keith begins to avoid Bree. Richard then kisses Bree all of a sudden and after he leaves, Bree tells Keith everything about his father's attempts to tear them apart. Later, Keith confronts Richard about this and has a fistfight with him but when rioters, who are opposing Paul Young's plan to open a halfway house for ex-convicts on Wisteria Lane, see the two fight, they mistaken him as an ex-convict due to his tattoos and ex-convict-like clothing and begin to beat Keith up. Bree breaks up the fight by firing a gun into the sky and this triggers fear and panic among the rioters and supporters for the halfway house alike, thinking this is an assassination attempt, proceed to flee, resulting in a riot that goes out of control.\\r\\nBree is thrown when Orson returns, claiming he was dumped by his girlfriend. Keith is annoyed at how Bree is willing to let Orson stay with them. Over dinner, Orson makes it clear he doesn't think Keith is a good choice for Bree as they have nothing in common and Orson understands her more, the two throwing food at one another. Bree goes to see Orson's ex, who reveals that Orson was the one who broke up with her as he's still in love with Bree. She confronts him and Orson confesses how he feels and thinks Bree is too good for Keith. Keith is angered at Bree continuing to want Orson to stay with them, saying that she's still in love with Orson. Bree responds by shoving him down in her manure-covered lawn, getting herself dirty to prove how much she's changed. When one of Keith's old girlfriends comes by, Bree is suspicious and discovers the woman has been raising Keith's son. She mentions children to Keith, who seems unsure whether he is father material. Bree goes to the girlfriend, lying about how Keith doesn't want to know the child. Keith finds her cutting up her roses as she says \\"you have to be ruthless to protect what you want.\\" Bree meets the woman later to lend her money and when she leaves her son in Bree's care, Keith drops by the pizza parlor. Seeing Keith and the boy instantly bonding, Bree is overcome with guilt and confesses to Keith that the boy is actually his son. Keith desperately wants to be with his son, but he doesn't want to leave Bree, he pitches the idea of moving to Florida with Bree but she refuses to leave her home and friends. The next day Bree makes the ultimate decision and tells Keith that he must go to Florida for his son. She sacrifices their relationship and Keith leaves.\\r\\nBree discovers that Andrew has started drinking again, so much so that his husband leaves him. She encourages Andrew to go into rehab but is jarred when he decides to make amends by telling Carlos about running over his mother. When Carlos invites Andrew on a camping trip, Bree and Gabrielle fear the worst and follow them. Seeing Carlos with a bloody towel and a dirty shovel, Bree blurts out what Andrew did, just before her son enters the cabin. Carlos is outraged over this but eventually forgives Andrew. However, when Bree comes to thank him for not pressing charges, Carlos coldly tells her he won't forgive her for hiding the truth all these years and that they're no longer friends and that she and Gabby can no longer be friends. Bree ends up taking Gabby and her daughters into her house when Gabby leaves Carlos after telling him that she will not end her friendship with Bree. While the Solis' are staying with Bree she has a run in with Detective Chuck Vance (Jonathan Cake) who was on Wisteria Lane to check on parolee Felicia Tillman. Juanita Solis calls the police and tells them that Bree is trying to kill her and Celia (after Carlos tells her Bree's involvement in her grandmother's death). Chuck responds to the call at Bree's home and Carlos sorts everything out, explaining that the girls misunderstood what he had told them. Chuck leaves and gives Bree his number and the Solis' move out of Bree's and back with Carlos.\\r\\nChuck later returns to give Bree his number again after assuming she'd lost it since he hasn't received a call from her. Bree then agrees to go out on a date with him that night and when Bree tells this to Renee, Renee runs a background check on Chuck and reveals to Bree that he's still married (though he had filed for divorce a year ago). At dinner, Bree confronts Chuck with this information but Chuck retaliates by telling her that he had also run a background check on her, therefore becoming more aware of Bree's past. Offended, Bree abruptly ends their date and as Chuck drives her home, Chuck catches a hooker in the street and brings her back to the women's center. There, Chuck tells the hooker (who believes that she'll be a hooker forever) that she can turn her life around, pretending to reveal that Bree once was a prostitute and she had turned over a new leaf by going to school and starting a massive catering company. Moved by Chuck's whole-heartedly words, Bree gives Chuck a second chance and the two agree to go out on another date afterwards.\\r\\nDuring the \\"progressive dinner party\\" celebrating Susan's return to Wisteria Lane, Bree (along with Lynette and Susan) walks into Gaby's house to discover that Carlos has murdered Alejandro Perez, Gaby's stepfather. She spearheads the decision to cover up the murder to protect Carlos, thus earning his forgiveness for keeping the secret about his mother's hit-and-run for all those years.\\r\\nFollowing their agreement to cover up the murder of Alejandro, Bree's relationship with Chuck begins to suffer. She finds herself constantly paranoid that he will discover her involvement, and uses sex as a way to distract him. She then receives a note exactly like the one Mary Alice received when she shot herself. She then seeks out the counsel of Paul Young, asking if he was the one who sent it. Upset over the fact that Bree may still judge him for his past he sends her away. However, he later calls her back urging her to tell the other housewives to spare her Mary Alice's fate, and reveals to her the only other person who he told about the note to was the cop who was looking into Martha Huber's death, Chuck. At first suspicious, Bree decides to break up with Chuck when he tries to propose. He does not take it well, telling her she is making a big mistake. Danielle returns, having been dumped by her husband and Bree is at first supportive until she finds her daughter is now selling adult swings to make money.\\r\\nHaving avoided church over her guilt in hiding Alejandro, Bree is convinced to help Ben Faulkner in a soup kitchen. When a passing college student raves over her cooking, the kitchen is soon home to regular people, not the homeless and Bree realizes that's wrong. She tells everyone to leave, giving a speech on how this is meant to help the less fortunate. Ben is impressed and has Bree give a speech to the city council to convince them to let Ben build a homeless shelter in Fairview. At first happy about helping, Bree is horrified to realize the spot Ben is about to break ground on is where the girls buried Alejandro. She, Gabrielle and Lynette go to dig the body back up only to find it gone. It turns out Ben found it earlier, thinking he was just a drifter and Bree convinces him to help keep it quiet. However, Bree soon finds Chuck is suspicious and putting together clues to prove what the girls did. The pressure soon drives Bree to break her sobriety and pour herself a drink.\\r\\nChuck starts to dig deeper into Gabrielle's stepfather's disappearance. Gabrielle tells Bree that Chuck brought them in for questioning and Bree snaps, causing her to head to a motel. When she arrives she sits at a table in her room, pulls out a bottle of wine and a gun, and begins talking to the spirit of Mary Alice. Bree asks her asking if she is happy after having killed herself who replies, \\"I'm not unhappy\\". Bree is ready to kill herself when Renee kicks in the door, mistakenly believing Bree is with Ben. After yelling, threatening to hit her and telling her she's \\"nothing more than a skank in a Nancy Reagan nightie\\", Renee noticies the gun and the note. After reading it she takes Bree home and stays there to make sure she's okay. When Renee says she won't let a friend die, Bree points out they're not quite friends, hurting Renee. She confesses to Bree how her own mother committed suicide and makes Bree see it's not the way out. Bree is happy at first, more so when she hears Chuck was killed in a hit-and-run. However, when she opens her mailbox, she finds a note saying \\"You're welcome.\\"\\r\\nRenee takes Bree to a bar, encouraging her to live a little and Bree ends up going with a man, skinny-dipping in a pool before the owner of the house comes home. Bree soon is going to bed with a succession of men which gets the Reverend concerned about her behavior. Determined to show he's wrong, Bree comes to the bake sale where she meets one of her lovers, only to discover he's married. When Karen McCluskey says that they do not know what Bree is really like, Bree decides to live up her reputation as the new town slut. Bree is soon bed-hopping to the point where she hits upon a man in a bar without remembering she had gone home with him just two nights previously. When they hear about Renee taking Bree to a bar, her friends try and stage an intervention at which point Bree reaches boiling point and blasts them for their less than friend like behavior recently. At the bar, she's approached by a man and realizes how far she's fallen, ready to go home. The man follows her to the parking lot, threatening to assault Bree only to be interrupted by a wheelchair-bound Orson. He uses a taser to knock the man out, telling Bree her friends called him to help and if there's one thing they did well together, it was \\"cleaning up each other's messes.\\" Orson soon convinces Bree that the girls are still angry at her and to go away with him for a weekend. What Bree doesn't know is that Orson has been stalking her for months, seeing the girls bury Alejandro's body and he was the one leaving Bree the notes as part of his warped scheme to win her back. Bree soon discovers the truth while visiting Orson's apartment and despite his claims he did it all for her, she says she wants nothing to do with him. Orson calls her later, claiming that their love requires sacrifice and Bree believes he's going to kill himself. Instead, Orson mails a folder of evidence to the Fairview Police.\\r\\nBree is surprised when Andrew comes home, engaged to a woman named Mary Beth. Learning she's an heiress, Bree suspects Andrew is just marrying her for her money. Mary Beth tells Bree she knows Andrew is gay but is still willing to marry him as she's been unlucky in love. Bree convinces Mary Beth to find a man who truly loves her and she breaks up with Andrew. Andrew is upset at losing a chance at the money but Bree tells him he can stay with her and accept her help getting back on his feet.\\r\\nMeanwhile, the police become suspicious of Bree and the murder of Gaby's stepfather and the help of his cover-up, so they tread carefully in trying to get proof that she is one of the suspects. They interview her, and she says that she has nothing to do with it. But as she was drinking her cup of tea, her fingerprints were on the mug. The fingerprint that the police found on the body, and the fingerprint on Bree's cup match. The police go and talk to Ben, still about the murder of Alejandro. Ben keeps Bree's secret, and the police leave, with no more evidence than the fingerprint. - But they do not stop there: a detective tracks down a call of Bree to Ben that night regarding Alejandro's murder, and they record it.\\r\\nIn order to defend herself, Bree asks Bob Hunter for legal advice, but he tells her she needs a crime lawyer. He recommends lawyer Trip Weston, whom he calls a \\"shark\\". Bree goes to trial but does not tell Trip all the truth, and is about to go to prison until Mrs. McCluskey confesses the murder of Alejandro herself, after Bree and the girls agree to take care of her during her last days of life. Bree is acquitted of all charges. In the end, Bree ends up getting married to Trip and moving to Louisville, Kentucky where she joins a club for conservative women. Later she is encouraged by Trip to run for the city council, then the following November she is elected to the Kentucky Legislature.\\r\\nBree has received wide acclaim, both for the character's storylines, and for Cross' portrayal.[5] In a review of the pilot, Tim Goodman from the San Francisco Chronicle called Cross \\"almost too perfect as uptight Bree\\", and applauds her for \\"managing to give the character more shadings than merely insanely perfect.\\"[6] At the commencement of the second season, Bree was widely considered the series' most prominent role,[7] following the first year's emphasis on Susan Mayer.[8] Though a drop in quality was noted in the second season,[9] Bree's battles with alcohol, her teenage son, and her murderous pharmacist lover, while continuing to deal with the death of her husband, were well received, and considered the focal point of the series in light of the lagging Applewhite mystery. Cross retained her centre-stage position for the show's third season, which widely focused upon the mystery surrounding her new husband Orson.[10] Critics noted an improvement in quality from the second season to the third,[11] and many deemed Bree's storyline to be the most satisfying of the season, as well as noting a \\"loss of steam\\" during Cross' maternity leave at the latter part of the season.[12] Season 4's \\"fake pregnancy\\" storyline continued to satisfy critics, with one calling it the series' most \\"hysterical [storyline] yet\\", and singling Cross out for praise.[13][14] Her friction with Katherine Mayfair was also noted as a highlight. Following the five year leap, a new direction was taken with Bree's character as she made the transition from housewife to author/businesswoman, a development which received positive reception.[15] This change in character development was continued into season 6, with another side to Bree's personality being shown, which includes an affair with Karl Mayer. Critics lauded the comic relief provided by these developments,[15] as well as the more poignant and emotional turn mid-season as Bree deals with Orson's paralysis.[16] In Season 7, Bree finds herself newly divorced and embarks on a relationship with Keith Watson, a move which was praised for allowing \\"the for-so-long uptight Bree letting her hair down and having some fun for a change.\\"[17] By the climax of season 7, Bree is central in covering up the murder of Gabrielle's stepfather, a move which was praised as a sound set up for the final season.[18]\\r\\nMarcia Cross has received widespread acclaim for her portrayal of Bree. For her work on the second season of the show, she garnered the Satellite Award for Best Actress - Television Series Musical or Comedy (her second nomination), and has also received the Screen Actors Guild Award for Outstanding Performance by an Ensemble in a Comedy Series twice as part of the cast (being nominated a further three times).\\r\\nIn 2005, Cross was nominated for the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Lead Actress in a Comedy Series[19] for her performance in the season one episode, \\"Running to Stand Still\\". She also made the Top 10 Pre-Nomination Finalist listing for the same award three subsequent times, for her work on the second-season episode \\"Next\\", third-season episode \\"Listen to the Rain on the Roof\\", and fourth-season episode \\"Now You Know\\". She has received three nominations at the Golden Globe Awards, for Best Actress in a Television Series - Musical or Comedy,[20] for her work on the first three seasons of the show, and has also received three nominations at the Prism Awards (for Performance in a Comedy Series, in relation to Bree's alcoholism), and a nomination from the Television Critics Association for Individual Achievement in Comedy in 2005.\\r\\nBree is spoofed in MADtv's Desperate Housewives parody,[21] in which they mock the character's plastic exterior and demeanor. In a 2006 interview with Charmed Magazine, Michelle Stafford admitted that her character Mandi in Charmed episode \\"Desperate Housewitches\\" was almost entirely modeled on Marcia Cross as Bree. Looking at pictures and episodes of Bree to gain a sense of her posture and body language, she laughed, \\"I'm just mimicking her. I'm just ripping her off.\\"\\r\\nIn 2007, Madame Alexander released a line of 16-inch fashion dolls of the series' main characters, including Bree.[22]","input":"Who is the father of bree's baby?"},{"output":"900,000 square miles","context":"","input":"How much land did the us gain after the mexican american war?"},{"output":"Haiti","context":"Tortug'Air S.A. was a domestic airline in Haiti, and served as Haitis national flag carrier.[1] The airline was founded in March 2003, and was based in Port-au-Prince.[2] According to the airline, more than 200 people were employed with the company.

There have been seven Congress Prime Ministers, the first being Jawaharlal Nehru (1947ÿ1964), and the most recent Manmohan Singh (2004ÿ2014). Although it did not fare well in the last general elections in India in 2014, it remains one of two major, nationwide, political parties in India, along with the right-wing, Hindu nationalist, Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP).[e][19] In the 2014 general election, Congress had its poorest post-independence general election performance, winning only 44 seats of the 543-member Lok Sabha.\\r\\nFrom 2004 to 2014, the Congress-led United Progressive Alliance, a coalition of several regional parties, formed the Indian government, and was headed by Prime Minister Manmohan Singh. The leader of the party during the period, Sonia Gandhi has served the longest term as the president of the party. As of March?2018[update], the party is in power in three states: Punjab, Karnataka and Mizoram and the union territory of Puducherry.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe history of the Indian National Congress (INC) falls into two distinct eras:\\r\\nThe Indian National Congress conducted its first session in Bombay from 28ÿ31 December 1885 at the initiative of retired Civil service officer Allan Octavian Hume. In 1883, Hume had outlined his idea for a body representing Indian interests in an open letter to graduates of the University of Calcutta.[20] Its aim was to obtain a greater share in government for educated Indians, and to create a platform for civic and political dialogue between them and the British Raj. Hume took the initiative, and in March 1885 a notice convening the first meeting of the Indian National Union to be held in Poona the following December was issued.[21] Due to a cholera outbreak there, it was moved to Bombay.\\r\\nHume organised the first meeting in Bombay with the approval of the Viceroy Lord Dufferin. Womesh Chandra Bonnerjee was the first president of Congress; the first session was attended by 72 delegates. Representing each province of India, the delegates comprised 54 Hindus and two Muslims; the rest were of Parsi and Jain backgrounds. Notable representatives included Scottish ICS officer William Wedderburn, Dadabhai Naoroji, Pherozeshah Mehta of the Bombay Presidency Association, Ganesh Vasudeo Joshi of the Poona Sarvajanik Sabha, social reformer and newspaper editor Gopal Ganesh Agarkar, Justice K. T. Telang, N. G. Chandavarkar, Dinshaw Wacha, Behramji Malabari, journalist and activist Gooty Kesava Pillai, and P. Rangaiah Naidu of the Madras Mahajana Sabha.[22][23]\\r\\nWithin the next few years, Congress' demands became more radical in the face of constant opposition from the British government, and the party decided to advocate in favour of the independence movement because it would allow a new political system in which Congress could be a major party. By 1905, a division opened between the moderates led by Gokhale, who downplayed public agitation, and the new \\"extremists\\" who advocated agitation, and regarded the pursuit of social reform as a distraction from nationalism. Bal Gangadhar Tilak, who tried to mobilise Hindu Indians by appealing to an explicitly Hindu political identity displayed in the annual public Ganapati festivals he inaugurated in western India, was prominent among the extremists.[24]\\r\\nCongress included a number of prominent political figures. Dadabhai Naoroji, a member of the sister Indian National Association, was elected president of the party in 1886, and was the first Indian Member of Parliament in the British House of Commons (1892ÿ1895). Congress also included Bal Gangadhar Tilak, Bipin Chandra Pal, Lala Lajpat Rai, Gopal Krishna Gokhale, and Mohammed Ali Jinnahlater leader of the Muslim League and instrumental in the creation of Pakistan. Congress was transformed into a mass movement by Surendranath Banerjea during the partition of Bengal in 1905, and the resultant Swadeshi movement.[23]\\r\\nMahatma Gandhi returned from South Africa in 1915. With the help of the moderate group led by Ghokhale, Gandhi became president of Congress. After the First World War, the party became associated with Gandhi, who remained its unofficial spiritual leader and icon.[25] He formed an alliance with the Khilafat Movement in 1920 to fight for preservation of the Ottoman Caliphate, and rights for Indians using civil disobedience or satyagraha as the tool for agitation. In 1923, after the deaths of policemen at Chauri Chaura, Gandhi suspended the agitation. In protest, a number of leaders, Chittaranjan Das, Annie Besant, and Motilal Nehru, resigned to set up the Swaraj Party. The Khilafat movement collapsed and Congress was split.\\r\\nThe rise of Gandhi's popularity and his satyagraha art of revolution led to support from Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel, Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru, Dr. Rajendra Prasad, Khan Mohammad Abbas Khan, Khan Abdul Ghaffar Khan, Chakravarti Rajgopalachari, Dr. Anugraha Narayan Sinha, Jayaprakash Narayan, Jivatram Kripalani, and Maulana Abul Kalam Azad. As a result of prevailing nationalism, Gandhi's popularity, and the police's attempts at eradicating caste differences, untouchability, poverty, and religious and ethnic divisions, Congress became a forceful and dominant group. Although its members were predominantly Hindu, it had members from other religions, economic classes, and ethnic and linguistic groups.[citation needed]\\r\\nAt the Congress 1929 Lahore session under the presidency of Jawaharlal Nehru, Purna Swaraj (complete independence) was declared as the party's goal, declaring 26 January 1930 as \\"Purna Swaraj Diwas\\" (Independence Day). The same year, Srinivas Iyenger was expelled from the party for demanding full independence, not just home rule as demanded by Gandhi.[26]\\r\\nAfter the passage of the Government of India Act of 1935, provincial elections were held in India in the winter of 1936ÿ37 in eleven provinces: Madras, Central Provinces, Bihar, Orissa, United Provinces, Bombay Presidency, Assam, NWFP, Bengal, Punjab, and Sindh. After contesting these elections, the Indian National Congress gained power in eight of them except Bengal, Punjab, and Sindh. The All-India Muslim League failed to form a government in any province.[27] Congress ministries resigned in October and November 1939 in protest against Viceroy Lord Linlithgow's declaration that India was a belligerent in the Second World War without consulting the Indian people.[28]\\r\\nIn 1939, Subhas Chandra Bose, the elected president in both 1938 and 1939, resigned from Congress over the selection of the working committee. The party was not the sole representative of the Indian polity, other parties included the Hindu Mahasabha, and the Forward Bloc.[29] The party was an umbrella organisation, sheltering radical socialists, traditionalists, and Hindu and Muslim conservatives. Gandhi expelled all the socialist groupings, including the Congress Socialist Party, the Krishak Praja Party, and the Swarajya Party, along with Subhas Chandra Bose, in 1939.[25]\\r\\nAzad Hind, an Indian provisional government, had been established in Singapore in 1943, and was supported by Japan.[30][31]\\r\\nIn 1946, the British tried the Indian soldiers who had fought alongside the Japanese during World War II in the INA trials. In response, Congress helped form the INA Defence Committee, which assembled a legal team to defend the case of the soldiers of the Azad Hind government. The team included several famous lawyers, including Bhulabhai Desai, Asaf Ali, and Jawaharlal Nehru.[32] The same year, Congress members initially supported the sailors who led the Royal Indian Navy mutiny, but they withdrew support at a critical juncture and the mutiny failed.[citation needed]\\r\\nAfter Indian independence in 1947, the Indian National Congress became the dominant political party in the country. In 1952, in the first general election held after Independence, the party swept to power in the national parliament and most state legislatures. It held power nationally until 1977, when it was defeated by the Janata coalition. It returned to power in 1980 and ruled until 1989, when it was once again defeated. The party formed the government in 1991 at the head of a coalition, as well as in 2004 and 2009, when it led the United Progressive Alliance. During this period the Congress remained centre-left in its social policies while steadily shifting from a socialist to a neoliberal economic outlook. The Party's rivals at state level have been national parties including the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), the Communist Party of India (Marxist) (CPM), and various regional parties, such as the Telugu Desam Party.[citation needed]\\r\\nA post-partition successor to the party survived as the Pakistan National Congress, a party which represented the rights of religious minorities in the state. The party's support was strongest in the Bengali-speaking province of East Pakistan. After the Bangladeshi War of Independence, it became known as the Bangladeshi National Congress, but was dissolved in 1975 by the government.[33][34][33][35]\\r\\nFrom 1951 until his death in 1964, Jawaharlal Nehru was Congress' paramount leader under the tutelage of Mahatma Gandhi, whose Indian independence movement dominated the party. Congress gained power in landslide victories in the general elections of 1951ÿ52, 1957, and 1962.[36] During his tenure, Nehru implemented policies based on import substitution industrialisation, and advocated a mixed economy where the government-controlled public sector co-existed with the private sector.[37] He believed the establishment of basic and heavy industries was fundamental to the development and modernisation of the Indian economy.[36] The Nehru government directed investment primarily into key public sector industriessteel, iron, coal, and powerpromoting their development with subsidies and protectionist policies.[37] Nehru embraced secularism, socialistic economic practices based on state-driven industrialisation, and a non-aligned and non-confrontational foreign policy that became typical of the modern Congress Party.[38] The policy of non-alignment during the Cold War meant Nehru received financial and technical support from both the Eastern and Western Blocs to build India's industrial base from nothing.[39][40]\\r\\nDuring his period in office, there were four known assassination attempts on Nehru.[41] The first attempt on his life was during partition in 1947 while he was visiting the North-West Frontier Province in a car. The second was by a knife-wielding rickshaw-puller in Maharashtra in 1955.[42] A third attempt happened in Bombay in 1956.[43] The fourth was a failed bombing attempt on railway tracks in Maharashtra in 1961.[41] Despite threats to his life, Nehru despised having excess security personnel around him and did not like his movements to disrupt traffic.[41] In 1964, Nehru died because of an aortic dissection, raising questions about the party's future.[44][45][46]\\r\\nAfter his death, K. Kamaraj became the president of the All India Congress Committee.[47] Kamaraj had also been involved in the Indian independence movement, and he introduced education to millions of rural poor by providing free education along with a free midday meal, when he was chief minister of Tamil Nadu (1954ÿ1963).[48]\\r\\nAs a member of \\"the syndicate\\", a group within Congress, he proposed the Kamaraj Plan that encouraged six Congress chief ministers and six senior cabinet ministers to resign to take up party work.[49][50][51] Kamaraj was widely credited as the \\"kingmaker\\" in Indian politics for bringing Lal Bahadur Shastri to power in 1964.[52] No leader except Shastri had Nehru's popular appeal.[53] Shastri became a national hero following victory in the Indo-Pakistani War of 1965.[54] His slogan, \\"Jai Jawan Jai Kisan\\" (\\"Hail the soldier, Hail the farmer\\"), became very popular during the war.[55] Shastri retained many members of Nehru's Council of Ministers; T. T. Krishnamachari was retained as Finance Minister of India, as was Defence Minister Yashwantrao Chavan.[56] Shastri appointed Swaran Singh to succeed him as External Affairs Minister.[57]\\r\\nShashtri appointed Indira Gandhi, Jawaharlal Nehru's daughter and former party president, Minister of Information and Broadcasting.[58] Gulzarilal Nanda continued as the Minister of Home Affairs.[59] As Prime Minister, Shastri continued Nehru's policy of non-alignment,[60] but built closer relations with the Soviet Union. In the aftermath of the Sino-Indian War of 1962, and the formation of military ties between China and Pakistan, Shastri's government expanded the defence budget of India's armed forces. He also promoted the White Revolutiona national campaign to increase the production and supply of milk by creating the National Dairy Development Board.[61]\\r\\nThe Madras anti-Hindi agitation of 1965 occurred during Shastri's tenure.[62][63] On 11 January 1966, a day after signing the Tashkent Declaration, Shastri died in Tashkent, reportedly of a heart attack; but the circumstances of his death remain mysterious.[64][65][66]\\r\\nAfter Shastri's death, Congress elected Indira Gandhi as leader over Morarji Desai. Once again, politician K. Kamaraj was instrumental in achieving this result. In 1967, following a poor performance in the general election, Indira Gandhi started moving towards the political left. In mid-1969, she was involved in a dispute with senior party leaders on a number of issues. The two major issues were Gandhi supporting the independent candidate, V. V. Giri, rather than the official Congress party candidate, Neelam Sanjiva Reddy, for the vacant post of the President of India.[67][68] The second issue was Mrs. Gandhi's abrupt nationalization of the 14 biggest banks in India, which resulted in the resignation of the finance minister, Morarji Desai. Later in the year, the Congress party president, S. Nijalingappa, expelled her from the party for indiscipline.[69][70] Mrs. Gandhi as a counter-move launched her own faction of the INC. Mrs. Gandhi's faction, called Congress (R), was supported by most of the Congress MPs while the original party had the support of only 65 MPs.[71]\\r\\nIn the mid-term parliamentary elections held in 1971, the Gandhi-led Congress?(R) Party won a landslide victory on a platform of progressive policies such as the elimination of poverty (Garibi Hatao).[72] The policies of the Congress?(R) Party under Gandhi before the 1971 elections included proposals to abolish the Privy Purse to former rulers of the Princely states, and the 1969 nationalisation of India's 14 largest banks.[73]\\r\\nThe New Congress Party's popular support began to wane in the mid-1970s. From 1975, Gandhi's government grew increasingly more authoritarian and unrest among the opposition grew. On 12 June 1975, the High Court of Allahabad declared Indira Gandhi's election to the Lok Sabha, the lower house of India's parliament, void on the grounds of electoral malpractice.[74] However, Gandhi rejected calls to resign and announced plans to appeal to the Supreme Court. She moved to restore order by ordering the arrest of most of the opposition participating in the unrest. In response to increasing disorder and lawlessness, Gandhi's cabinet and government recommended that President Fakhruddin Ali Ahmed declare a State of Emergency, which he did on 25 June 1975 based on the provisions of Article 352 of the Constitution.[citation needed]\\r\\nDuring the nineteen-month emergency, widespread oppression and abuse of power by Gandhi's unelected younger son and political heir Sanjay Gandhi and his close associates occurred.[75][76][77] This period of oppression ended on 23 January 1977, when Gandhi released all political prisoners and called fresh elections for the Lok Sabha to be held in March.[78] The Emergency officially ended on 23 March 1977.[79] In that month's parliamentary elections, the opposition Janata Party won a landslide victory over Congress, winning 295 seats in the Lok Sabha against Congress' 153. Gandhi lost her seat to her Janata opponent Raj Narain. On 2 January 1978, she and her followers seceded and formed a new opposition party, popularly called Congress?(I)the I signifying Indira. During the next year, her new party attracted enough members of the legislature to become the official opposition.[citation needed]\\r\\nIn November 1978, Gandhi regained a parliamentary seat. In January 1980, following a landslide victory for Congress?(I), she was again elected prime minister.[80] The national election commission declared Congress?(I) to be the real Indian National Congress for the 1984 general election, and the designation I was dropped.[81][82]\\r\\nDuring Gandhi's new term as prime minister, her youngest son Sanjay died in an aeroplane crash in June 1980.[83][84] This led her to encourage her elder son Rajiv, who was working as a pilot, to enter politics. Gradually, Indira Gandhi's politics and outlook grew more authoritarian and autocratic, and she became the central figure within the Congress Party. As prime minister, she became known for her political ruthlessness and unprecedented centralisation of power.[citation needed]\\r\\nGandhi's term as prime minister also saw increasing turmoil in Punjab, with demands for Sikh autonomy by Jarnail Singh Bhindranwale and his militant followers.[85] In 1983, they headquartered themselves in the Golden Temple in Amritsar and started accumulating weapons.[86] In June 1984, after several futile negotiations, Gandhi ordered the Indian Army to enter the Golden Temple to establish control over the complex and remove Bhindranwale and his armed followers. This event is known as Operation Blue Star.[87]\\r\\nOn 31 October 1984, two of Gandhi's bodyguards, Satwant Singh and Beant Singh, shot her with their service weapons in the garden of the prime minister's residence in response to her authorisation of Operation Blue Star.[86] Gandhi was due to be interviewed by British actor Peter Ustinov, who was filming a documentary for Irish television.[88] Her assassination prompted the 1984 anti-Sikh riots, during which more than 3,000 people were killed.[89]\\r\\nIn 1984, Indira Gandhi's son Rajiv Gandhi became nominal head of Congress, and went on to became prime minister upon her assassination.[90] In December, he led Congress to a landslide victory, where it secured 401 seats in the legislature.[91] His administration took measures to reform the government bureaucracy and liberalise the country's economy.[92] Rajiv Gandhi's attempts to discourage separatist movements in Punjab and Kashmir backfired. After his government became embroiled in several financial scandals, his leadership became increasingly ineffectual.[93] Gandhi was regarded as a non-abrasive person who consulted other party members and refrained from hasty decisions.[94] The Bofors scandal damaged his reputation as an honest politician, but he was posthumously cleared of bribery allegations in 2004.[95] On 21 May 1991, Gandhi was killed by a bomb concealed in a basket of flowers carried by a woman associated with the Tamil Tigers.[96] He was campaigning in Tamil Nadu for upcoming parliamentary elections. In 1998, an Indian court convicted 26 people in the conspiracy to assassinate Gandhi.[97] The conspirators, who consisted of Tamil militants from Sri Lanka and their Indian allies, had sought revenge against Gandhi because the Indian troops he sent to Sri Lanka in 1987 to help enforce a peace accord there had fought with Tamil separatist guerrillas.[98][99]\\r\\nRajiv Gandhi was succeeded as party leader by P. V. Narasimha Rao, who was elected prime minister in June 1991.[100] His rise to the prime ministership was politically significant because he was the first holder of the office from South India. His administration oversaw major economic change and experienced several home incidents that affected India's national security.[101] Rao, who held the Industries portfolio, was personally responsible for the dismantling of the Licence Raj, which came under the purview of the Ministry of Commerce and Industry.[102] He is often called the \\"father of Indian economic reforms\\".[103][104]\\r\\nFuture prime ministers Atal Bihari Vajpayee and Manmohan Singh continued the economic reform policies begun by Rao's government. Rao accelerated the dismantling of the Licence Raj, reversing the socialist policies of previous governments.[105][106] He employed Manmohan Singh as his finance minister to begin a historic economic change. With Rao's mandate, Singh launched India's globalisation reforms that involved implementing International Monetary Fund (IMF) policies to prevent India's impending economic collapse.[102] Rao was also referred to as Chanakya for his ability to push tough economic and political legislation through the parliament while he headed a minority government.[107][108]\\r\\nBy 1996, the party's image was suffering from allegations of corruption, and in elections that year, Congress was reduced to 140 seats, its lowest number in the Lok Sabha to that point. Rao later resigned as prime minister and, in September, as party president.[109] He was succeeded as president by Sitaram Kesri, the party's first non-Brahmin leader.[110]\\r\\nThe 1998 general election saw Congress win 141 seats in the Lok Sabha, its lowest tally until then.[111] To boost its popularity and improve its performance in the forthcoming election, Congress leaders urged Sonia Gandhi, Rajiv Gandhi's widow, to assume leadership of the party. She had previously declined offers to become actively involved in party affairs, and had stayed away from politics. After her election as party leader, a section of the party that objected to the choice because of her Italian ethnicity broke away and formed the Nationalist Congress Party (NCP), led by Sharad Pawar. The breakaway faction commanded strong support in the state of Maharashtra and limited support elsewhere. The remainder continued to be known as the Indian National Congress.[112]\\r\\nSonia Gandhi struggled to revive the party in her early years as its president; she was under continuous scrutiny for her foreign birth and lack of political acumen. In the snap elections called by the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) government in 1999, Congress' tally further plummeted to just 114 seats.[113] Although the leadership structure was unaltered as the party campaigned strongly in the assembly elections that followed, Gandhi began to make such strategic changes as abandoning the partys 1998 Pachmarhi resolution of ekla chalo, or \\"go it alone\\" policy, and formed alliances with other like-minded parties. In the intervening years, the party was successful at various legislative assembly elections; at one point, Congress ruled 15 states.[114] For the 2004 general election, Congress forged alliances with regional parties including the NCP and the Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam.[115] The party's campaign emphasised social inclusion and the welfare of the common massesan ideology that Gandhi herself endorsed for Congress during her presidencywith slogans such as Congress ka haath, aam aadmi ke saath (\\"Congress hand in hand with the common man\\"), contrasting with the NDA's \\"India Shining\\" campaign.[113][116][117][118][119] The Congress-led United Progressive Alliance (UPA) won 222 seats in the new parliament, defeating the NDA by a substantial margin. With the subsequent support of the communist front, Congress won a majority and formed a new government. Despite massive support from within the party, Gandhi declined the post of prime minister, choosing to appoint Manmohan Singh instead. She remained as party president and headed the National Advisory Council (NAC).[120]\\r\\nDuring its first term in office, the UPA government passed several social reform bills. These included an employment guarantee bill, the Right to Information Act, and a right to education act. The NAC, as well as the Left Front that supported the government from the outside, were widely seen as being the driving force behind such legislation. The Left Front withdrew its support of the government over disagreements about the U.S.ÿIndia Civil Nuclear Agreement. Despite the effective loss of 62 seats in parliament, the government survived the trust vote that followed.[121] In the Lok Sabha elections held soon after, Congress won 207 seats, the highest tally of any party since 1991. The UPA as a whole won 262, enabling it to form a government for the second time. The social welfare policies of the first UPA government, and the perceived divisiveness of the BJP, are broadly credited with the victory.[122]\\r\\nBy the 2014 Lok Sabha elections, the party had lost much of its popular support, mainly because of several years of poor economic conditions in the country, and growing discontent over a series of corruption allegations involving government officials, including the 2G spectrum case and the Indian coal allocation scam.[123][124] Congress won only 44 seats,[125] which was its worst-ever performance in a national election and brought into question whether it would continue to be identified as an officially recognised party.[126] Gandhi retired as party president in December 2017, having served for a record nineteen years. She was succeeded by her son Rahul Gandhi.[118]\\r\\nAs of 2014, the election symbol of Congress, as approved by the Election Commission of India, is an image of a right hand with its palm facing front and its fingers pressed together;[127] this is usually shown in the centre of a tricolor flag. The hand symbol was first used by Indira Gandhi when she split from the Congress (R) faction following the 1977 elections and created the New Congress (I).[128]\\r\\nThe symbol of the original Congress during elections held between 1952 and 1971 was an image of two bullocks with a plough.[129] The symbol of Indira's Congress?(R) during the 1971ÿ1977 period was a cow with a suckling calf.[130]\\r\\nCongress is structured in a hierarchical manner, and the organisational structure, created by Mohandas Gandhi's re-arrangement of the party between 1918 and 1920, has been largely retained.[citation needed][131] A president and the All India Congress Committee (AICC) are elected by delegates from state and district parties at an annual national conference; in every Indian state and union territoryor pradeshthere is a Pradesh Congress Committee (PCC), which is the state-level unit of the party responsible for directing political campaigns at local and state levels, and assisting the campaigns for parliamentary constituencies.[citation needed][132] Each PCC has a working committee of twenty members, most of whom are appointed by the party president, the leader of the state party, who is chosen by the prime minister. Those elected as members of the states' legislative assemblies form the Congress Legislature Parties in the various state assemblies; their chairperson is usually the party's nominee for Chief Ministership. The party is also organised into various committees, and sections; it publishes a daily newspaper, the National Herald.[133] Despite being a party with a structure, Congress under Indira did not hold any organizational elections after 1972.[134]\\r\\nThe AICC is composed of delegates sent from the PCCs.[133] The delegates elect Congress committees, including the Congress Working Committee, consisting of senior party leaders and office bearers. The AICC takes all important executive and political decisions.[132] Since Indira Gandhi formed Congress?(I) in 1978, the President of the Indian National Congress has effectively been: the party's national leader, head of the organisation, head of the Working Committee and all chief Congress committees, chief spokesman, and Congress' choice for Prime Minister of India. Constitutionally, the president is elected by the PCCs and members of the AICC; however, this procedure has often been by-passed by the Working Committee, which has elected its own candidate.[133]\\r\\nThe Congress Parliamentary Party (CPP) consists of elected MPs in the Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha.[132] There is also a Congress Legislative Party (CLP) leader in each state. The CLP consists of all Congress Members of the Legislative Assembly (MLAs) in each state. In cases of states where the Congress is single-handedly ruling the government, the CLP leader is the Chief Minister.[132] Other directly affiliated groups include: the National Students Union of India (NSUI), the Indian Youth Congress  the party's youth wing, the Indian National Trade Union Congress, Mahila Congress, its women's division, and Congress Seva Dalits voluntary organisation.[135][136]\\r\\nCongress is a civic nationalist party that follows a form of nationalism that supports the values of freedom, tolerance, equality, and individual rights.[137]\\r\\nThroughout much of the Cold War period, Congress supported a foreign policy of nonalignment that called for India to form ties with both the Western and Eastern Blocs, but to avoid formal alliances with either.[citation needed] American support for Pakistan led the party to endorse a friendship treaty with the Soviet Union in 1971.[citation needed] In 2004, when the Congress-led United Progressive Alliance came to power, its chairperson Sonia Gandhi unexpectedly relinquished the premiership to Manmohan Singh. This Singh-led \\"UPA I\\" government executed several key pieces of legislation and projects, including the Rural Health Mission, Unique Identification Authority, the Rural Employment Guarantee scheme, and the Right to Information Act.[citation needed]\\r\\nThe history of economic policy of Congress-led governments can be divided into two periods. The first period lasted from independence, in 1947, to 1991 and put great emphasis on the public sector. The second period began with economic liberalization in 1991.\\r\\nAt the beginning of the first period, the Congress prime minister Jawaharlal Nehru implemented policies based on import substitution industrialization and advocated a mixed economy where the government-controlled public sector would co-exist with the private sector.[138] He believed that the establishment of basic and heavy industry was fundamental to the development and modernisation of the Indian economy. The government, therefore, directed investment primarily into key public-sector industriessteel, iron, coal, and powerpromoting their development with subsidies and protectionist policies.[139] This period was called the Licence Raj, or Permit Raj,[140] which was the elaborate system of licences, regulations, and accompanying red tape that were required to set up and run businesses in India between 1947 and 1990.[141] The Licence Raj was a result of Nehru and his successors' desire to have a planned economy where all aspects of the economy were controlled by the state, and licences were given to a select few. Up to 80 government agencies had to be satisfied before private companies could produce something; and, if the licence were granted, the government would regulate production.[142] The licence raj system continued under Indira Gandhi.In addition,many key sectors such as banking, steel coal, and oil were nationalized.[71][143] Under Rajiv Gandhi, small steps were taken to liberalize the economy.[144]\\r\\nIn 1991, the new Congress-party government, led by P. V. Narasimha Rao, initiated reforms to avert the impending 1991 economic crisis.[104][145] The reforms progressed furthest in opening up areas to foreign investment, reforming capital markets, deregulating domestic business, and reforming the trade regime. The goals of Rao's government were to reduce the fiscal deficit, privatize the public sector, and increase investment in infrastructure. Trade reforms and changes in the regulation of foreign direct investment were introduced in order to open India to foreign trade while stabilising external loans. Rao chose Manmohan Singh for the job. Singh, an acclaimed economist and former chairman of the Resrve Bank, played a central role in implementing these reforms.\\r\\nIn 2004, Singh became prime minister of the Congress-led UPA government. Singh remained prime minister after the UPA won the 2009 general elections. The UPA government introduced policies aimed at reforming the banking and financial sectors, as well as public sector companies.[146] It also introduced policies aimed at relieving farmers of their debt.[147] In 2005, Singh's government introduced the value added tax, replacing the sales tax. India was able to resist the worst effects of the global Economic crisis of 2008.[148][149] Singh's government continued the Golden Quadrilateral, the Indian highway modernisation program that was initiated by Vajpayee's government.[150]\\r\\nAt present, Congress endorses a mixed economy in which the private sector and the state both direct the economy, which has characteristics of both market and planned economies. Congress advocates import substitution industrialisationthe replacement of foreign imports with domestic products. Congress believes the Indian economy should be liberalised to increase the pace of development.\\r\\nIn 2005, the Congress-led government started the National Rural Health Mission, which employed about 500,000 community health workers. It was praised by American economist Jeffrey Sachs.[151] In 2006, it implemented a proposal to reserve 27% of seats in the All India Institute of Medical Studies (AIIMS), the Indian Institutes of Technology (IITs), the Indian Institutes of Management (IIMs), and other central higher education institutions, for Other Backward Classes, which led to the 2006 Indian anti-reservation protests.[citation needed] The Singh government also continued the Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan programme, which includes the introduction and improvement of mid-day school meals and the opening of new schools throughout India, especially in rural areas, to fight illiteracy.[152] During Manmohan Singh's prime-ministership, eight Institutes of Technology were opened in the states of Andhra Pradesh, Bihar, Gujarat, Orissa, Punjab, Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan, and Himachal Pradesh.[153]\\r\\nCongress has strengthened anti-terrorism laws with amendments to the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act (UAPA).[154] The National Investigation Agency (India) (NIA) was created by the UPA government soon after the November 2008 Mumbai terror attacks, in response to the need for a central agency to combat terrorism.[155] The Unique Identification Authority of India was established in February 2009 to implement the proposed Multipurpose National Identity Card, with the objective of increasing national security.[citation needed]\\r\\nCongress has continued the foreign policy started by P.?V. Narasimha Rao. This includes the peace process with Pakistan, and the exchange of high-level visits by leaders from both countries.[156] The party has tried to end the border dispute with the People's Republic of China through negotiations.[157][158] Relations with Afghanistan have also been a concern for Congress.[159] During Afghan President Hamid Karzai's visit to New Delhi in August 2008, Manmohan Singh increased the aid package to Afghanistan for the development of schools, health clinics, infrastructure, and defence.[160] India is now one of the single largest aid donors to Afghanistan.[160]\\r\\nWhen in power between 2004 and 2014, Congress worked on India's relationship with the United States. Prime Minister Manmohan Singh visited the US in July 2005 to negotiate an Indo-US civilian nuclear agreement. US President George W. Bush visited India in March 2006; during this visit, a nuclear agreement that would give India access to American nuclear fuel and technology in exchange for the IAEA inspection of its civil nuclear reactors was proposed. Over two years of negotiations, followed by approval from the IAEA, the Nuclear Suppliers Group and the US Congress, the agreement was signed on 10 October 2008.[161]\\r\\nCongress' policy has been to cultivate friendly relations with Japan as well as European Union countries including the United Kingdom, France, and Germany.[162] Diplomatic relations with Iran have continued, and negotiations over the Iran-Pakistan-India gas pipeline have taken place.[163] In April 2006, New Delhi hosted an IndiaÿAfrica summit attended by the leaders of 15 African states.[164] Congress' policy has also been to improve relations with other developing countries, particularly Brazil and South Africa.[165]\\r\\nAs of December 2017, Congress is in power in the states of Punjab, Karnataka and Mizoram, where the party has majority support. In Puducherry it shares power with alliance partners. Previously, Congress governed Andhra Pradesh, Tamil Nadu, Gujarat, Kerala, Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan, Uttarakhand, and Manipur.\\r\\nA majority of non-Congress prime ministers of India are former Congress members.","input":"How many states in india are under congress?"},{"output":"Tesla","context":"","input":"Who is the inventor of the tesla coil?"},{"output":"December 2001","context":"Global War on Terrorism\\r\\nThe International Security Assistance Force (ISAF) was a NATO-led security mission in Afghanistan, established by the United Nations Security Council in December 2001 by Resolution 1386, as envisaged by the Bonn Agreement.[1][2] Its main purpose was to train the Afghan National Security Forces (ANSF) and assist Afghanistan in rebuilding key government institutions, but was also engaged in the 2001ÿpresent war with the Taliban insurgency.\\r\\nISAF was initially charged with securing Kabul and the surrounding areas from the Taliban, al Qaeda and factional warlords, to allow for the establishment of the Afghan Transitional Administration headed by Hamid Karzai.[3] In October 2003, the UN Security Council authorized the expansion of the ISAF mission throughout Afghanistan,[4] and ISAF subsequently expanded the mission in four main stages over the whole of the country.[5] From 2006 to 2011, ISAF had become increasingly involved in more intensive combat operations in southern and eastern Afghanistan.\\r\\nTroop contributors included the United States, United Kingdom, Canada, and other NATO member states as well as a number of other countries. The intensity of the combat faced by contributing nations varied greatly, with the United States sustaining the most casualties overall. In early 2010, there were at least 700 military bases inside Afghanistan. About 400 of these were used by American?led NATO forces and 300 by ANSF.[6]\\r\\nISAF ceased combat operations and was disbanded in December 2014, with some troops remaining behind in an advisory role as part of ISAF's successor organization, the Resolute Support Mission.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nFor almost two years, the ISAF mandate did not go beyond the boundaries of Kabul. According to General Norbert Van Heyst, such a deployment would require at least ten thousand additional soldiers. The responsibility for security throughout the whole of Afghanistan was to be given to the newly reconstituted Afghan National Army. However, on 13 October 2003, the Security Council voted unanimously to expand the ISAF mission beyond Kabul with Resolution 1510. Shortly thereafter, Canadian Prime Minister Jean Chrtien said that Canadian soldiers (nearly half of the entire force at that time) would not deploy outside Kabul.\\r\\nOn 24 October 2003, the German Bundestag voted to send German troops to the region of Kunduz. Approximately 230 additional soldiers were deployed to that region, marking the first time that ISAF soldiers operated outside of Kabul. After the 2005 Afghan parliamentary election, the Canadian base Camp Julien in Kabul closed, and the remaining Canadian assets were moved to Kandahar as part of Operation Enduring Freedom in preparation for a significant deployment in January, 2006. On 31 July 2006, the NATO?led International Security Assistance Force assumed command of the south of the country, ISAF Stage 3, and by 5 October, also of the east of Afghanistan, ISAF Stage 4.\\r\\nISAF was mandated by UN Security Council Resolutions 1386, 1413, 1444, 1510, 1563, 1623, 1659, 1707, 1776,[7] and 1917 (2010). The last of these extended the mandate of ISAF to 23 March 2011.\\r\\nThe mandates given by the different governments to their forces varied from country to country.[citation needed] Some governments wished to take a full part in counter-insurgency operations;[citation needed] some were in Afghanistan for NATO alliance reasons;[citation needed] some were in the country partially because they wished to maintain their relationship with the United States,[citation needed] and[original research?] some were there for domestic political reasons.[citation needed] This meant that ISAF suffered from a lack of united aims.[citation needed]\\r\\nThe initial ISAF headquarters (AISAF) was based on 3rd UK Mechanised Division, led at the time by Major General John McColl. This force arrived in December, 2001. Until ISAF expanded beyond Kabul, the force consisted of a roughly division-level headquarters and one brigade covering the capital, the Kabul Multinational Brigade. The brigade was composed of three battle groups, and was in charge of the tactical command of deployed troops. ISAF headquarters served as the operational control center of the mission.\\r\\nEighteen countries were contributors to the force in February, 2002, and it was expected to grow to 5,000 soldiers.[8] Turkey assumed command of ISAF in June, 2002 (Major General Hilmi Akin Zorlu). During this period, the number of Turkish troops increased from about 100 to 1,300. In November, 2002, ISAF consisted of 4,650 troops from over 20 countries. Around 1,200 German troops served in the force alongside 250 Dutch soldiers operating as part of a German-led battalion. Turkey relinquished command in February, 2003, and assumed command for a second time in February, 2005. Turkey's area of operations expanded into the rugged west of Afghanistan. The expansion of its zone of activities saw ISAF troops operating in 50 percent of Afghanistan, double its previous responsibility.[9]\\r\\nOn 10 February 2003, Lieutenant General Norbert van Heyst, on behalf of Germany and the Netherlands, took command of ISAF. His Deputy was Brigadier General Bertholee of the Netherlands. The mission HQ was formed from HQ I.?German/Dutch Corps (1GNC), including staff from the UK, Italy, Turkey, Norway, and others. In March, 2003, ISAF was composed of 4,700 troops from 28 countries. Service in ISAF by NATO personnel from 1 June 2003. onward earns the right to wear the NATO Medal if a service-member met a defined set of tour length requirements.\\r\\nIn Kabul on 7 June 2003, a taxi packed with explosives rammed a bus carrying German ISAF personnel, killing four soldiers and wounding 29 others; one Afghan bystander was killed and 10 Afghan bystanders were wounded. The 33 German soldiers, after months on duty in Kabul, were en route to the Kabul International Airport for their flight home to Germany. At the time, Germans soldiers made up more than 40 percent of ISAF troops.\\r\\nISAF command originally rotated among different nations every six months. However, there was tremendous difficulty securing new lead nations. To solve the problem, command was turned over indefinitely to NATO on 11 August 2003. This marked NATO's first deployment outside Europe or North America.\\r\\nColombia had planned to deploy around 100 soldiers in Spring 2009.[19][20] These forces were expected to be de-mining experts.[21][22] General Freddy Padilla de Leon announced to CBS News that operators of Colombia's Special Forces Brigade were scheduled to be deployed to Afghanistan in either August or September, 2009.[23] However, the Colombians were not listed as part of the force as of June, 2011.\\r\\nThree NATO states announced withdrawal plans beginning in 2010. Canada in 2011,[24] Poland, in 2012,[25] and the United Kingdom in 2010.[26] Between 1 July 2014, and August, Regional Command Capital and Regional Command West were re-designated Train Advise and Assist Command Capital (TAAC Capital) and TAAC West.[27] The United States ended combat operations in Afghanistan in December, 2014. Sizable advisory forces would remain to train and mentor Afghan National Security Forces, and NATO will continue operating under the Resolute Support Mission. ISAF Joint Command, in its final deployment provided by Headquarters XVIII Airborne Corps, ceased operations ahead of the end of the NATO combat mission on 8 December 2014.[28]\\r\\nFrom 2006, the insurgency by the Taliban intensified, especially in the southern Pashtun parts of the country, areas that were the Taliban's original power base in the mid?1990s. After ISAF took over command of the south on 31 July 2006, British, Dutch, Canadian and Danish ISAF soldiers in the provinces of Helmand, Uruzgan, and Kandahar came under almost daily attack. British commanders said that the fighting for them was the fiercest since the Korean War, 50 years previously. In an article, BBC reporter Alistair Leithead, embedded with the British forces, called it \\"Deployed to Afghanistan's hell.\\"[29]\\r\\nBecause of the security situation in the south, ISAF commanders asked member countries to send more troops. On 19 October, for example, the Dutch government decided to send more troops because of increasing attacks by suspected Taliban on their Task Force Uruzgan, making it very difficult to complete the reconstruction work that they sought to accomplish.\\r\\nDerogatory alternative acronyms for the ISAF were created by critics, including \\"I Saw Americans Fighting,\\"[30] \\"I Suck at Fighting,\\" and \\"In Sandals and Flip Flops.\\"[31]\\r\\nPrior to October, 2008, ISAF had only served an indirect role in fighting the illegal opium economy in Afghanistan through shared intelligence with the Afghan government, protection of Afghan poppy crop eradication units and helping in the coordination and the implementation of the country's counter-narcotics policy. For example, Dutch soldiers used military force to protect eradication units that came under attack.\\r\\nCrop eradication often affects the poorest farmers who have no economic alternatives on which to fall back. Without alternatives, these farmers no longer can feed their families, causing anger, frustration, and social protest. Thus, being associated with this counterproductive drug policy, ISAF soldiers on the ground found it difficult to gain the support of the local population.[32]\\r\\nThough problematic for NATO, this indirect role allowed NATO to avoid the opposition of the local population who depended on the poppy fields for their livelihood. In October 2008, NATO altered its position in an effort to curb the financing of insurgency by the Taliban. Drug laboratories and drug traders became the targets, and not the poppy fields themselves.[33] In order to satisfy France, Italy and Germany, the deal involved the participation in an anti-drug campaign only of willing NATO member countries; the campaign was to be short-lived and with the cooperation of the Afghans.[33]\\r\\nOn 10 October 2008, during a news conference, after an informal meeting of NATO Defense Ministers in Budapest, Hungary, NATO Spokesman James Appathurai said:[34]\\r\\n...with regard to counter-narcotics, based on the request of the Afghan government, consistent with the appropriate U.N. Security Council Resolutions, under the existing operational plan, ISAF can act in concert with the Afghans against facilities and facilitators supporting the insurgency, subject to the authorization of respective nations.... The idea of a review is, indeed, envisioned for an upcoming meeting.\\r\\nISAF military casualties, and the civilian casualties caused by the war and Coalition/ISAF friendly fire, became a major political issue, both in Afghanistan and in the troop contributing nations. Increasing civilian casualties threatened the stability of President Hamid Karzai's government. Consequently, effective from 2 July 2009, coalition air and ground combat operations were ordered to take steps to minimize Afghan civilian casualties in accordance with a tactical directive issued by General Stanley A. McChrystal, USA, the commander of the International Security Assistance Force in Afghanistan.[35]\\r\\nAnother issue over the years has been numerous 'insider' attacks involving Afghan soldiers opening fire on ISAF soldiers. While these diminished, in part due to the planned ending of combat operations on 31 December 2014, they continued to occur, albeit at a lower frequency. On 5 August 2014, a gunman believed to have been an Afghan soldier opened fire on a number of international soldiers, killing a U.S. general, Harold J. Greene, and wounding about 15 officers and soldiers, including a German brigadier general and several U.S. soldiers, at a training academy near Kabul.[36]\\r\\nThroughout the four different regional stages of ISAF the number of Provincial Reconstruction Teams (PRTs) grew. The expansion of ISAF, to November 2006, to all provinces of the country brought the total number of PRTs to twenty-five. The twenty-fifth PRT, at Wardak, was established that month and was led by Turkey. Allied Joint Force Command Brunssum, at Brunssum, the Netherlands, was ISAF's superior NATO headquarters.[37] The headquarters of ISAF was located in Kabul. In October 2010, there were 6 Regional Commands, each with subordinate Task Forces and Provincial Reconstruction Teams. The lower strength numbers of the ISAF forces were as 6 October 2008.[38] The numbers also reflected the situation in the country. The north and west were relatively calm, while ISAF and Afghan forces in the south and east came under almost daily attack. In December 2014 the force reportedly numbered 18,636 from 48 states.[39]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe command of ISAF has rotated between officers of the participating nations. The first American took command in February 2007 and only Americans have commanded ISAF since that time.[53]\\r\\nAll NATO members have contributed troops to the ISAF, as well as some other partner states of the NATO.\\r\\nResolution 1386 of the United Nations Security Council established that the expense of the ISAF operation must be borne by participating states. For this purpose the resolution established a trust fund through which contributions could be channelled to the participating states or operations concerned, and encouraged the participating states to contribute to such a fund.[128]","input":"When did nato forces take command in afghanistan?"},{"output":"a stuffed rabbit","context":"The Velveteen Rabbit (or How Toys Become Real) is a children's book written by Margery Williams (also known as Margery Williams Bianco) and illustrated by William Nicholson.

The rabbit is awed by this idea; however, his chances of achieving this wish are slight.\\r\\nOne night, the boy's nana gives the rabbit to the boy to sleep with, in place of a lost toy.

Pictures.[4] It is the second of two cinematic parts based on the novel of the same name by J. K. Rowling.[5] The film, which is the eighth and final instalment in the Harry Potter film series, was written by Steve Kloves and produced by David Heyman, David Barron, and Rowling. The story continues to follow Harry Potter's quest to find and destroy Lord Voldemort's Horcruxes in order to stop him once and for all.\\r\\nThe film stars Daniel Radcliffe as Harry Potter, alongside Rupert Grint and Emma Watson as Harry's best friends, Ron Weasley and Hermione Granger. Principal photography began on 19 February 2009, and was completed on 12 June 2010,[6] with reshoots taking place in December 2010, more than ten years after filming started on the first instalment of the series. Part?2 was released in 2D, 3-D and IMAX cinemas worldwide from 13ÿ15 July 2011, and is the only Harry Potter film to be released in 3-D.[7]\\r\\nThe film became a financial success and was one of the best-reviewed films of 2011. The film received praise for its visual effects, cinematography, Yates' direction, the cast's performances, Alexandre Desplat's musical score, the action sequences and its satisfying conclusion of the saga.[8][9][10] At the box office, Part 2 claimed the worldwide opening weekend record, earning $483.2 million, as well as setting opening day and opening weekend records in various countries. As of 2016, the film is the eighth highest-grossing film of all time.[11] It became the highest-grossing film of 2011, the highest-grossing film in the Harry Potter series, and the ninth film to gross over $1 billion.[12]\\r\\nThe Blu-ray and DVD sets were released on 11 November 2011 in the United States[13] and on 2 December 2011 in the United Kingdom.[14] The film was also released in the Harry Potter: Complete 8-Film Collection box set on DVD and Blu-ray, which included all eight films and new special features. Part 1 and Part 2 were released as a combo pack on DVD and Blu-ray on 11 November 2011 in Canada.\\r\\nThe film won several awards and was nominated for many more, including three nominations at the Academy Awards for Best Art Direction, Best Makeup and Hairstyling and Best Visual Effects.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter burying Dobby, Harry Potter asks the goblin, Griphook, to help him, Ron, and Hermione break into Bellatrix Lestrange's vault at Gringotts bank, suspecting that a Horcrux might be there. Griphook agrees, in exchange for the Sword of Gryffindor. Wandmaker Ollivander tells Harry that two wands taken from Malfoy Manor belonged to Bellatrix and to Draco Malfoy, but Malfoy's has changed its allegiance to Harry.\\r\\nIn Bellatrix's vault, Harry discovers the Horcrux is Helga Hufflepuff's cup. He retrieves it, but Griphook snatches the sword and abandons the trio, leaving them cornered by security. The three release the dragon guardian and flee on its back. Harry sees a vision of Voldemort killing Gringott's personnel, including Griphook, and learns Voldemort is aware of the theft. Harry also realises there is a Horcrux at Hogwarts somehow connected to Rowena Ravenclaw. The trio apparate into Hogsmeade, where Aberforth Dumbledore reluctantly instructs the portrait of his deceased younger sister, Ariana, to fetch Neville Longbottom, who leads the trio through a secret passageway into Hogwarts.\\r\\nSeverus Snape hears of Harry's return and warns staff and students of punishment for aiding Harry. Along with Ron, Hermione, and members of the Order of the Phoenix, Harry confronts Snape, who flees after Minerva McGonagall challenges him to a duel. McGonagall gathers the Hogwarts community for battle. At Luna Lovegood's insistence, Harry speaks to Helena Ravenclaw's ghost, who reveals that Voldemort performed \\"dark magic\\" on her mother's diadem, which is in the Room of Requirement. In the Chamber of Secrets, Hermione destroys the Horcrux cup with a Basilisk fang, and she and Ron passionately kiss. In the Room of Requirement, Draco, Blaise Zabini, and Gregory Goyle attack Harry, but Ron and Hermione intervene. Goyle casts a Fiendfyre curse and, unable to control it, is burned to death, while Harry and his friends save Malfoy and Zabini. Harry stabs the diadem with the Basilisk fang and Ron kicks it into the Room of Requirement, where it is destroyed. As Voldemort's army attacks, Harry, seeing into Voldemort's mind, realises that Voldemort's snake Nagini is the final Horcrux. The trio then enter into the boathouse, whereupon Voldemort has summoned Snape. There, Voldemort explains his belief that the Elder Wand cannot serve him until Snape dies; he slashes Snape's throat before having Nagini fatally wound him. Before dying, Snape tells Harry to take his memories to the Pensieve. In the chaos at Hogwarts, Fred, Lupin, and Tonks have been killed.\\r\\nHarry learns from Snape's memories, that while Snape despised Harry's late father, James, who had bullied him, he loved his late mother, Lily. Following her death, Snape worked secretly with Dumbledore to protect Harry from Voldemort because of his love for Lily. Harry also learns Dumbledore was dying and wanted Snape to kill him, and that the Patronus doe he saw in the woods that led him to the sword had been conjured by Snape. Harry discovers that he himself became a Horcrux when Voldemort originally failed to kill him and that Harry must die to destroy the piece of Voldemort's soul within him. Harry then surrenders himself to Voldemort in the Forbidden Forest. Voldemort casts the Killing Curse upon Harry, who finds himself in limbo, where Dumbledore's spirit meets him and explains that the part of Voldemort within Harry was killed by Voldemort's own curse. Harry then returns to his body, determined to defeat Voldemort once and for all. He fakes being dead, and Narcissa Malfoy lies to Voldemort that Harry is dead after confirming that Draco is okay.\\r\\nVoldemort triumphantly announces Harry's apparent death to everyone at Hogwarts, and demands that they all surrender. As Neville gives a defiant response and draws the Sword of Gryffindor from the Sorting Hat, Harry awakens to reveal that he is still alive. An all-out battle ensues one last time, with the Malfoys and several Death Eaters abandoning Voldemort in the process. While Harry battles Voldemort throughout the castle, Molly Weasley kills Bellatrix in the Great Hall before Neville slays Nagini with the sword ÿ leaving Voldemort vulnerable. The confrontation between Harry and Voldemort ultimately ends with Voldemort's own Killing Curse rebounding, finally killing him and ending his reign once and for all. After the battle, Harry explains to Ron and Hermione that the Elder Wand had recognised him as its true master because he had disarmed Draco, who earlier had disarmed its previous owner ÿ Dumbledore. But, instead of claiming the Elder Wand, Harry breaks and discards it.\\r\\nNineteen years later, the former Hogwarts students proudly watch their own children leave for Hogwarts at King's Cross station.\\r\\nThe roles of several minor characters were recast or replaced for this film. For example, Ciarn Hinds assumed the role of Aberforth Dumbledore, Albus Dumbledore's brother and bartender of the Hog's Head inn.[15]\\r\\nIn the book, a significant number of characters who have not appeared since some of the earlier novels, reappear to defend Hogwarts in the large, final battle.[16] Director David Yates said, \\"I want to get them all back\\", referring to his desire to bring back as many actors who have appeared in the franchise as possible for the climactic battle sequence in the film. Sean Biggerstaff, Jim Broadbent, Gemma Jones, Miriam Margolyes, and Emma Thompson reprise their roles from earlier films briefly during the battle scene. For the final scene in the film which is set nineteen years after the film's main story, the actors playing the main characters were made to look older through the use of makeup and special effects.[17] After the initial look of the actors' aged appearances leaked onto the Internet, some fans reacted by opining that Radcliffe and Grint looked too old, while Watson did not appear significantly different at all. After primary filming concluded in June 2010, Yates examined the footage, and concluded that the problem could not be resolved through editing or CGI, and had the sequence re-shot that December, with redesigned makeup.[18]\\r\\nPart?2 was filmed back-to-back with Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows?ÿ Part 1 from 19 February 2009 to 12 June 2010,[19][20] with reshoots for the epilogue scene taking place at Leavesden Film Studios on 21 December 2010.[21] Director David Yates, who shot the film with director of photography Eduardo Serra, described Part 2 as \\"operatic, colourful and fantasy-oriented\\", a \\"big opera with huge battles.\\"[22][23]\\r\\nOriginally set for a single theatrical release, the idea to split the book into two parts was suggested by executive producer Lionel Wigram due to, what David Heyman called, \\"creative imperative\\". Heyman initially responded negatively to the idea, but Wigram asked, No, David. How are we going to do it?. After rereading the book and discussing it with screenwriter Steve Kloves, he agreed with the division.[24]\\r\\nIn an interview with Architectural Digest, production designer Stuart Craig remarked on creating sets for Part?2. Of the Gringotts Wizarding Bank, he said, \\"our banking hall, like any other, is made of marble and big marble columns. And it has great strength. The fact that the goblins are the bankers and tellers at the counter helps that feeling of grandeur and solidity and the big proportions. That was part of the fun of the set: we exaggerated the size of it, we exaggerated the weight of it, and we even exaggerated the shine of the marble.\\" About the multiplication of treasure in one of the bank's vaults, he noted, \\"We made literally thousands of pieces for it and vacuum metallised them to be shiny gold and silver. John Richardson, the special effects supervisor, made a floor that was capable of rising on different levels, so there was kind of a physical swelling of the treasure on it.\\"[25]\\r\\nCraig spoke about the Battle of Hogwarts to Art Insights Magazine, saying that \\"the great challenge is the destruction of Hogwarts. The sun rising behind the smoke ... the massive remains of destroyed walls, the entrance hall, the entrance of the Great Hall, part of the roof of the Great Hall completely gone, so yeah. A big challenge there and an enjoyable one really?ÿ maybe it helped me and the guys in the art department sort of prepare for the end ... we demolished it before we had to strike it completely.\\" When asked about the King's Cross scene near the end of the film, Craig said, \\"We experimented a lot, quite honestly. I mean it was quite a protracted process really but we did experiment the sense of it being very burnt out very very kind of white?ÿ so we experimented with underlit floors, we experimented with different kind of white covering everything: white paint, white fabric, and the cameraman was involved in how much to expose it, and a series of camera tests were done, so we got there but with a great deal of preparation and research.\\"[26]\\r\\nVisual Effects Supervisor Tim Burke said that \\"It was such a major job to stage the Battle of Hogwarts, and we had to do it in different stages of production. We had shots with complex linking camera moves from wide overviews, to flying into windows and interior spaces. So, we took the plunge at the end of 2008, and started rebuilding the school digitally with Double Negative.\\" He went on to say that \\"It's taken two years?ÿ getting renders out, texturing every facet of the building, constructing interiors to see through windows, building a destruction version of the school. We can design shots with the knowledge that we have this brilliant digital miniature that we can do anything with. With a practical Hogwarts, we would have shot it last summer and been so tied down. Instead, as David Yates finds the flow and structure, we are able to handle new concepts and ideas.\\"[27]\\r\\nOn the quality of 3-D in film, Burke told Los Angeles Times, \\"I think it's good, actually. I think people are going to be really pleased. I know everyone's a little nervous and sceptical of 3-D these days, but the work has been done very, very well. We've done over 200 shots in 3-D and in the visual effects as well, because so much of it is CG, so the results are very, very good. I think everyone's going to be really impressed with it, actually.\\" Producer David Heyman spoke to SFX magazine about the 3-D conversion, saying that \\"The way David Yates is approaching 3-D is he's trying to approach it from a character and story point of view. Trying to use the sense of isolation, of separation that sometimes 3-D gives you, to heighten that at appropriate moments. So we're approaching it in a storytelling way.\\"[28][29]\\r\\nIn 2012, the visual effects in the film were nominated for an Oscar. The film also won the BAFTA Award for Best Special Visual Effects at the 65th BAFTA Awards in 2012.\\r\\nIt was confirmed that the composer for Part?1, Alexandre Desplat, was set to return for Part?2.[30] In an interview with Film Music Magazine, Desplat stated that scoring Part?2 is \\"a great challenge\\" and that he has \\"a lot of expectations to fulfill and a great deal of work\\" ahead of him.[31] In a separate interview, Desplat also made note that John Williams' themes will be present in the film \\"much more than in part one.\\"[32] The soundtrack for the film was nominated for Best Score Soundtrack for Visual Media at the 54th Annual Grammy Awards.[33]\\r\\n\\r\\n In March 2011, the first preview for Deathly Hallows?ÿ Part 2 was released revealing new footage and new interviews from the starring cast.[34] The first United States poster was released on 28 March 2011, with the caption \\"It All Ends 7.15\\" (referring to its international release date).[35] On 27 April 2011 the first theatrical trailer for Part?2 was released. The trailer revealed a range of new and old footage.[36] The IMAX trailer for the film was released with IMAX screenings of Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides on 20 May 2011. During the MTV Movie Awards on 5 June 2011, Emma Watson presented a sneak peek of the film.[37]\\r\\nOn 2 April 2011, a test screening of the film was held in Chicago, with director David Yates, producers David Heyman and David Barron and editor Mark Day in attendance.[38] The film had its world premiere on 7?July?2011?(2011-07-07) in Trafalgar Square in London.[39] The United States premiere was held in New York City at Lincoln Center on 11?July?2011?(2011-07-11).[40] Although filmed in 2-D, the film was converted into 3-D in post-production and was released in both RealD 3D and IMAX 3D.[41]\\r\\nThe film was originally scheduled to open in Indonesia on 13 July 2011.[42] The Indonesian government levied a new value added tax on royalties from foreign films in February 2011, causing three film studios, including Warner Brothers, to halt the importation of their films, including Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows?ÿ Part 2 into the country.[42] The film was not released to cinemas in the Kingdom of Jordan due to recently enforced taxes on films. It had not been premiered in the Kingdom as of 13 August 2011[update].[43]\\r\\nOn 10 June, one month before the film's release, tickets went on sale.[44] On 16 June 2011, Part?2 received a 12A[45] certificate from the British Board of Film Classification, who note that the film \\"contains moderate threat, injury detail and language\\", becoming the only Harry Potter film to receive a warning for \\"injury detail\\". At midnight 15 July, Part?2 screened in 3,800 cinemas. In the United States, it played in 4,375 cinemas, 3,100 3D cinemas and 274 IMAX cinemas, the widest release for an IMAX, 3D and a Harry Potter film.\\r\\nHarry Potter and the Deathly Hallows?ÿ Part 2 was released on 11 November 2011 in the United States in four formats: a one-disc standard DVD, a two-disc standard DVD special edition, a one-disc standard Blu-ray, and three-Disc Blu-ray 2D Combo Pack (Blu-ray + DVD + Digital Copy).[13] In the United Kingdom and Ireland, the film was released on 2 December 2011 in three formats: a two-disc standard DVD, a three-disc Blu-ray 2D Combo Pack (Blu-ray + DVD + Digital Copy), and a four-disc Blu-ray 3D Combo Pack (Blu-ray 3D + Blu-ray 2D + DVD + Digital Copy).[14] The film set the record for fastest-selling pre-order DVD and Blu-ray on Amazon.com, just two days into the pre-order period.[46]\\r\\nDeathly Hallows?ÿ Part 2 sold 2.71?million Blu-ray units ($60.75?million) in three days (Friday to Sunday).[47] It also sold 2.83?million DVD units ($42.22?million) during its debut.[48] By 18 July 2012 it had sold 4.71?million Blu-ray units ($99.33?million)[49] and 6.47?million DVD units ($88.96?million).[50]\\r\\nOn 28 March 2017, Deathly Hallows?ÿ Part 2 made its Ultra HD Blu-ray debut, along with Deathly Hallows - Part 1, The Half-Blood Prince, and Order of the Phoenix.\\r\\nHarry Potter and the Deathly Hallows?ÿ Part 2 grossed $381,011,219 in the United States and Canada, along with $960,500,000 in other markets, for a worldwide total of $1,341,511,219. In worldwide earnings, it is currently the eighth highest-grossing film, the highest-grossing 2011 film,[12] the highest-grossing film in the Harry Potter franchise and the highest-grossing children's book adaptation.[11] Part 2 set a worldwide opening-weekend record with $483.2?million.[54][60] It set a worldwide IMAX opening-weekend record with $23.2?million.[61][62] In worldwide earnings, it is the fastest film to reach $400?million (5 days), $500?million (6 days), $600?million (8 days), $700?million (10 days), $800?million (12 days), $900?million (15 days), and $1?billion (19 days, tied with Avatar and Marvel's The Avengers).[63][64] On 31 July 2011 (its 19th day of release), it became the ninth film in cinematic history and the second in 2011 to surpass the $1-billion mark.[65]\\r\\nIn North America, it is the twenty-seventh highest-grossing film,[66] the highest grossing 2011 film,[67] the highest-grossing Harry Potter film, the highest-grossing children's book adaptation,[68] the highest-grossing fantasy/live action film[69] and the thirteenth highest-grossing 3-D film.[70] Box Office Mojo estimates that the film sold more than 40 million tickets.[71] It set new records in advance ticket sales with $32?million,[72][73] in its midnight opening with $43.5?million[55] and in its IMAX midnight opening with $2?million.[53][74] It grossed $91.1?million on its opening Friday, setting a Friday-gross record as well as single- and opening-day records.[75] It also set an opening-weekend record with $169.2?million, an IMAX opening-weekend record of $15.2?million and opening-weekend record for a 3-D film.[76][77][78] Although 3-D enhanced the film's earning potential, only 43% of the opening gross came from 3-D venues. This means only $72.8?million of the opening-weekend grosses originated from 3-D showings, the second-largest number at the time.[79]\\r\\nIt also scored the largest 3-day[80] and 4-day gross,[81][82] the sixth highest-grossing opening week (Friday to Thursday) with $226.2?million,[83] and even the seventh-largest 7-day gross.[84] It fell precipitously by 84% on its second Friday[85] and by 72% during its second weekend overall, grossing $47.4?million, which is the largest second-weekend drop for any film that opened to more than $90?million.[86] Still, it managed to become the fastest-grossing film in the franchise and also achieved the second-largest ten-day gross ever at the time (now eighth).[87] In its third weekend, the movie surpassed Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone to become the highest-grossing film of the franchise in North America.[88]\\r\\nOutside North America, Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows?ÿ Part 2 is the third highest-grossing film, the highest-grossing 2011 film, the highest-grossing Warner Bros. film and the highest-grossing Harry Potter film.[89] On its opening day, Deathly Hallows?ÿ Part 2 grossed $43.6?million from 26 countries, placing it 86% ahead of Deathly Hallows?ÿ Part 1 and 49% higher than Half-Blood Prince. From Wednesday until Sunday, on its 5-day opening weekend, it set an opening-weekend record outside North America by earning $314?million.[90][91] The average 3D share of Deathly Hallows?ÿ Part 2 was 60%, which was lower than the 3D share for Transformers: Dark of the Moon (70%) and On Stranger Tides (66%).[92] On its second weekend, it held to the top spot, but fell precipitously by 62% to $120.2?million despite minor competition. This amount is about the same as what On Stranger Tides made from its second weekend ($124.3?million).[93] Deathly Hallows?ÿ Part 2 was in first place at the box office outside North America for four consecutive weekends.[94][95]\\r\\nIn the United Kingdom, Ireland and Malta it brought in a record $14.8?million on its first day.[96] On its opening weekend it earned S23,753,171 in the United Kingdom, marking the second largest opening weekend in 2011. Its performance did not surpass that of Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban in 2004, which eared S23,882,688 on its opening weekend.[97] In United States dollars, its opening weekend was an all-time record $38.3?million, ahead of Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix ($33.5?million).[98] The film also achieved the largest single-day gross on its first Saturday[97] and the largest opening week with $57.6?million.[99] The film made a total of S73.1?million ($117.2?million) at the United Kingdom box office,[100] marking the fifth highest-grossing film.[101] It also is the highest-grossing film of 2011 and highest-grossing Harry Potter film.[102]\\r\\nDeathly Hallows?ÿ Part 2 also set opening-day records in Mexico ($6.1?million), Australia ($7.5?million), France and the Maghreb region ($7.1?million), Italy ($4.6?million), Sweden ($2.1?million), Norway ($1.8?million), Denmark ($1.6?million), the Netherlands ($1.7?million), Belgium ($1.4?million), the Czech Republic ($2.0?million), Argentina ($961,000), Finland ($749,000) and Hong Kong ($808,000).[53][103][104][105] It also established new Harry Potter opening-day records in Japan ($5.7?million), Brazil ($4.4?million), Russia and the CIS ($4.2?million), Spain ($3.3?million) and Poland ($1.25?million).[96]\\r\\nDeathly Hallows?ÿ Part 2 set opening weekend records in India with ?15 crores ($3.41?million),[106] Australia with $19.6?million, New Zealand with $2.46?million,[107] Brazil with $11.?million,[108] Scandinavia with $18.5?million, Mexico with $15.9?million[108][109] and many other Latin American and European countries.[53][110]\\r\\n\\r\\nOn the review aggregation website Rotten Tomatoes, the film has an approval rating of 96% based on 315 reviews, with an average rating of 8.3/10. The site's critical consensus reads, \\"Thrilling, powerfully acted, and visually dazzling, Deathly Hallows Part II brings the Harry Potter franchise to a satisfying?ÿ and suitably magical?ÿ conclusion.\\"[111] On Metacritic, which assigns a normalised rating to reviews, the film achieved an average of 87 out of 100, based on 41 critics, indicating \\"universal acclaim\\".[112] The film received a score of 93 from professional critics at the Broadcast Film Critics Association; it is the organisation's highest-rated Harry Potter film.[113] On CinemaScore, audiences gave the film an average grade of \\"A\\" on an A+ to F scale.[114]\\r\\nPhilip Womack in The Daily Telegraph commented, \\"This is monumental cinema, awash with gorgeous tones, and carrying an ultimate message that will resonate with every viewer, young or old: there is darkness in all of us, but we can overcome it.\\" He further expressed that David Yates \\"transmutes [the book] into a genuinely terrifying spectacle.\\"[115] Another review was released on the same day from Evening Standard, who rated the film 4 out of 5 and stated \\"Millions of children, parents, and those who should know better won't need reminding what a Horcrux is?ÿ and director David Yates does not let them down. In fact, in some ways, he helps make up for the shortcomings of the final book.\\"[116] The Daily Express remarked that the film showcases \\"a terrifying showdown that easily equals Lord of the Rings or Star Wars in terms of a dramatic and memorable battle between good and evil.\\"[117]\\r\\nRoger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times gave the film ?3?1?2 out of 4 stars and said, \\"The finale conjures up enough awe and solemnity to serve as an appropriate finale and a dramatic contrast to the lighthearted (relative) innocence of Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone all those magical years ago.\\"[118] Mark Kermode from the BBC said that the film is a \\"pretty solid and ambitious adaptation of a very complex book\\", but he criticised the post-converted 3D.[119] Christy Lemire of the Associated Press gave the film ?3?1?2 out of 4 stars and said \\"While Deathly Hallows: Part 2 offers long-promised answers, it also dares to pose some eternal questions, and it'll stay with you after the final chapter has closed.\\"[120] Richard Roeper, also from the Chicago Sun-Times, gave the film an A+ rating and said that \\"this is a masterful and worthy final chapter in one of the best franchises ever put to film.\\"[121]\\r\\nIn one of the few negative reviews, Brian Gibson of Vue Weekly described the film as \\"deadly dull\\" and a \\"visual overstatement\\".[122] Other reviews criticised the decision to split the novel into two cinematic parts, with Ben Mortimer of The Daily Telegraph writing \\"Deathly Hallows?ÿ Part 2 isn't a film. It's HALF a film?... it's going to feel somewhat emotionless.\\" Other critics wrote of the film's runtime; Alonso Duralde from The Wrap said, \\"If there's one substantial flaw to the film, it's that this cavalcade of people and places and objects can barely fit in the 130-minute running time.\\"[123] Rebecca Gillie from The Oxford Student gave the film 2 out of 5 stars and wrote, \\"at the end of [the film] there is nothing that stays with you once you've left the cinema.\\"[124]\\r\\nThe film garnered a number of accolades and nominations. Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows?ÿ Part 2 was nominated for Best Art Direction, Best Makeup, and Best Visual Effects at the 84th Academy Awards.[125] At the 65th BAFTA awards, the film won the Best Visual Effects award, and was nominated in the Best Sound, Best Production Design and Best Make-up and Hair categories.[126]\\r\\nThe film was nominated for Best Score Soundtrack for Visual Media at the 54th Annual Grammy Awards in 2012.[127] It won a Screen Actors Guild Award for Outstanding Performance by a Stunt Ensemble in a Motion Picture.[128] The film scored 10 nominations at the annual Saturn Awards, Winning for Best Fantasy Film.[129] In the 2011 Scream Awards, the film received a total of 14 nominations, and won in the Best Scream-Play, Best Fantasy Actor (Daniel Radcliffe), Best Villain (Ralph Fiennes), Best F/X, and Holy Sh*t scene of the Year categories.[130]","input":"What is the final harry potter movie called?"},{"output":"4 August 1900","context":"This is a list of tables of the oldest people in the world in ordinal ranks.

Under the provisions of the Act, any citizen of India may request information from a \\"public authority\\" (a body of Government or \\"instrumentality of State\\") which is required to reply expeditiously or within thirty days. The Act also requires every public authority to computerise their records for wide dissemination and to proactively certain categories of information so that the citizens need minimum recourse to request for information formally.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis law was passed by Parliament on 15 June 2005 and came fully into force on 12 October 2005. The first RTI application was filed at a police station in Pune by Shahid Raza Burney.[1] The first RTI application in Delhi was filed to the office of President about article 370 in Jammu & Kashmir.[2] Every day, over 4800 RTI applications are filed. In the first ten years of the commencement of the act over 17,500,000 applications have been filed.[3]\\r\\n\\r\\nInformation disclosure in India is restricted by the Official Secrets Act 1923 and various other special laws, which the new RTI Act relaxes. Right to Information codifies a fundamental right of the citizens of India.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Act covers the whole of India except Jammu and Kashmir, where J&K Right to Information Act is in force. It covers all the constitutional authorities, including executive, legislature and judiciary; any institution or body established or constituted by an act of Parliament or a state legislature.

The CIC said that six national parties - Congress, BJP, NCP, CPI(M), CPI and BSP and BJD - has been substantially funded indirectly by the Central Government and have the character of public authorities under the RTI Act as they perform public functions.[7][8] But in August 2013 the government introduced a Right To Information (Amendment) Bill which would remove political parties from the scope of the law.

Researchers in the study focussed on the Digital implementation and asked about plans or timeline to provide such facility. 64% State Public Information failed to respond while the rest of the responses merely took cognizance without any hard timelines.

Interconnected or interlinked networks, channels and node businesses combine in the provision of products and services required by end customers in a supply chain.[3] Supply-chain management has been defined [4] as the \\"design, planning, execution, control, and monitoring of supply chain activities with the objective of creating net value, building a competitive infrastructure, leveraging worldwide logistics, synchronizing supply with demand and measuring performance globally.\\"[5] SCM practice draws heavily from the areas of industrial engineering, systems engineering, operations management, logistics, procurement, information technology, and marketing [6] and strives for an integrated approach.[citation needed] Marketing channels play an important role in supply chain management [6] Current research in supply chain management is concerned with topics related to sustainability and risk management, among others, whereas the people dimension of SCM, ethical issues, internal integration, transparency/visibility, and human capital/talent management are topics that have, so far, been underrepresented on the research agenda.[7]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1982, Keith Oliver, a consultant at Booz Allen Hamilton (now Strategy),[8] introduced the term \\"supply chain management\\" to the public domain in an interview for the Financial Times.[9]\\r\\nIn the mid-1990s, more than a decade later, the term \\"supply chain management\\" gained currency when a flurry of articles and books came out on the subject. Supply chains were originally defined as encompassing all activities associated with the flow and transformation of goods from raw materials through to the end user, as well as the associated information flows. Supply chain management was then further defined as the integration of supply chain activities through improved supply chain relationships to achieve a competitive advantage.[9]\\r\\nIn the late 1990s, \\"supply chain management\\" (SCM) rose to prominence, and operations managers began to use it in their titles with increasing regularity.[10][11][12]\\r\\nOther commonly accepted definitions of supply chain management include:\\r\\nA supply chain, as opposed to supply chain management, is a set of organizations directly linked by one or more upstream and downstream flows of products, services, finances, or information from a source to a customer. Supply chain management is the management of such a chain.[13]\\r\\nSupply chain management software includes tools or modules used to execute supply chain transactions, manage supplier relationships, and control associated business processes.[citation needed]\\r\\nSupply chain event management (SCEM) considers all possible events and factors that can disrupt a supply chain. With SCEM, possible scenarios can be created and solutions devised.[citation needed]\\r\\nIn many cases the supply chain includes the collection of goods after consumer use for recycling. Including third-party logistics or other gathering agencies as part of the RM re-patriation process is a way of illustrating the new endgame strategy.[citation needed]\\r\\nSupply chain management is a cross-functional approach that includes managing the movement of raw materials into an organization, certain aspects of the internal processing of materials into finished goods, and the movement of finished goods out of the organization and toward the end consumer. As organizations strive to focus on core competencies and become more flexible, they reduce their ownership of raw materials sources and distribution channels. These functions are increasingly being outsourced to other firms that can perform the activities better or more cost effectively. The effect is to increase the number of organizations involved in satisfying customer demand, while reducing managerial control of daily logistics operations. Less control and more supply chain partners lead to the creation of the concept of supply chain management. The purpose of supply chain management is to improve trust and collaboration among supply chain partners thus improving inventory visibility and the velocity of inventory movement.\\r\\nOrganizations increasingly find that they must rely on effective supply chains, or networks, to compete in the global market and networked economy.[16] In Peter Drucker's (1998) new management paradigms, this concept of business relationships extends beyond traditional enterprise boundaries and seeks to organize entire business processes throughout a value chain of multiple companies.\\r\\nIn recent decades, globalization, outsourcing, and information technology have enabled many organizations, such as Dell and Hewlett Packard, to successfully operate collaborative supply networks in which each specialized business partner focuses on only a few key strategic activities (Scott, 1993). This inter-organisational supply network can be acknowledged as a new form of organisation. However, with the complicated interactions among the players, the network structure fits neither \\"market\\" nor \\"hierarchy\\" categories (Powell, 1990). It is not clear what kind of performance impacts different supply network structures could have on firms, and little is known about the coordination conditions and trade-offs that may exist among the players. From a systems perspective, a complex network structure can be decomposed into individual component firms (Zhang and Dilts, 2004). Traditionally, companies in a supply network concentrate on the inputs and outputs of the processes, with little concern for the internal management working of other individual players. Therefore, the choice of an internal management control structure is known to impact local firm performance (Mintzberg, 1979).\\r\\nIn the 21st century, changes in the business environment have contributed to the development of supply chain networks. First, as an outcome of globalization and the proliferation of multinational companies, joint ventures, strategic alliances, and business partnerships, significant success factors were identified, complementing the earlier \\"just-in-time\\", lean manufacturing, and agile manufacturing practices.[17] Second, technological changes, particularly the dramatic fall in communication costs (a significant component of transaction costs), have led to changes in coordination among the members of the supply chain network (Coase, 1998).\\r\\nMany researchers have recognized supply network structures as a new organisational form, using terms such as \\"Keiretsu\\", \\"Extended Enterprise\\", \\"Virtual Corporation\\", \\"Global Production Network\\", and \\"Next Generation Manufacturing System\\".[18] In general, such a structure can be defined as \\"a group of semi-independent organisations, each with their capabilities, which collaborate in ever-changing constellations to serve one or more markets in order to achieve some business goal specific to that collaboration\\" (Akkermans, 2001).\\r\\nSupply chain management is also important for organizational learning. Firms with geographically more extensive supply chains connecting diverse trading cliques tend to become more innovative and productive.[19]\\r\\nThe security management system for supply chains is described in ISO/IEC 28000 and ISO/IEC 28001 and related standards published jointly by the ISO and the IEC.Supply Chain Management draws heavily from the areas of operations management, logistics, procurement, and information technology, and strives for an integrated approach.\\r\\nSix major movements can be observed in the evolution of supply chain management studies: creation, integration, and globalization (Movahedi et al., 2009), specialization phases one and two, and SCM 2.0.\\r\\nThe term \\"supply chain management\\" was first coined by Keith Oliver in 1982. However, the concept of a supply chain in management was of great importance long before, in the early 20th century, especially with the creation of the assembly line. The characteristics of this era of supply chain management include the need for large-scale changes, re-engineering, downsizing driven by cost reduction programs, and widespread attention to Japanese management practices. However, the term became widely adopted after the publication of the seminal book Introduction to Supply Chain Management in 1999 by Robert B. Handfield and Ernest L. Nichols, Jr.,[20] which published over 25,000 copies and was translated into Japanese, Korean, Chinese, and Russian.[21]\\r\\nThis era of supply chain management studies was highlighted with the development of electronic data interchange (EDI) systems in the 1960s, and developed through the 1990s by the introduction of enterprise resource planning (ERP) systems. This era has continued to develop into the 21st century with the expansion of Internet-based collaborative systems. This era of supply chain evolution is characterized by both increasing value added and cost reductions through integration.\\r\\nA supply chain can be classified as a stage 1, 2 or 3 network. In a stage 1ÿtype supply chain, systems such as production, storage, distribution, and material control are not linked and are independent of each other. In a stage 2 supply chain, these are integrated under one plan and is enterprise resource planning(ERP) enabled. A stage 3 supply chain is one that achieves vertical integration with upstream suppliers and downstream customers. An example of this kind of supply chain is Tesco.\\r\\nThe third movement of supply chain management development, the globalization era, can be characterized by the attention given to global systems of supplier relationships and the expansion of supply chains beyond national boundaries and into other continents. Although the use of global sources in organisations' supply chains can be traced back several decades (e.g., in the oil industry), it was not until the late 1980s that a considerable number of organizations started to integrate global sources into their core business. This era is characterized by the globalization of supply chain management in organizations with the goal of increasing their competitive advantage, adding value, and reducing costs through global sourcing.\\r\\nIn the 1990s, companies began to focus on \\"core competencies\\" and specialization. They abandoned vertical integration, sold off non-core operations, and outsourced those functions to other companies. This changed management requirements, by extending the supply chain beyond the company walls and distributing management across specialized supply chain partnerships.\\r\\nThis transition also refocused the fundamental perspectives of each organization. Original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) became brand owners that required visibility deep into their supply base. They had to control the entire supply chain from above, instead of from within. Contract manufacturers had to manage bills of material with different part-numbering schemes from multiple OEMs and support customer requests for work-in-process visibility and vendor-managed inventory (VMI).\\r\\nThe specialization model creates manufacturing and distribution networks composed of several individual supply chains specific to producers, suppliers, and customers that work together to design, manufacture, distribute, market, sell, and service a product. This set of partners may change according to a given market, region, or channel, resulting in a proliferation of trading partner environments, each with its own unique characteristics and demands.\\r\\nSpecialization within the supply chain began in the 1980s with the inception of transportation brokerages, warehouse management (storage and inventory), and non-asset-based carriers, and has matured beyond transportation and logistics into aspects of supply planning, collaboration, execution, and performance management.\\r\\nMarket forces sometimes demand rapid changes from suppliers, logistics providers, locations, or customers in their role as components of supply chain networks. This variability has significant effects on supply chain infrastructure, from the foundation layers of establishing and managing electronic communication between trading partners, to more complex requirements such as the configuration of processes and work flows that are essential to the management of the network itself.\\r\\nSupply chain specialization enables companies to improve their overall competencies in the same way that outsourced manufacturing and distribution has done; it allows them to focus on their core competencies and assemble networks of specific, best-in-class partners to contribute to the overall value chain itself, thereby increasing overall performance and efficiency. The ability to quickly obtain and deploy this domain-specific supply chain expertise without developing and maintaining an entirely unique and complex competency in house is a leading reason why supply chain specialization is gaining popularity.\\r\\nOutsourced technology hosting for supply chain solutions debuted in the late 1990s and has taken root primarily in transportation and collaboration categories. This has progressed from the application service provider (ASP) model from roughly 1998 through 2003, to the on-demand model from approximately 2003 through 2006, to the software as a service (SaaS) model currently in focus today.\\r\\nBuilding on globalization and specialization, the term \\"SCM 2.0\\" has been coined to describe both changes within supply chains themselves as well as the evolution of processes, methods, and tools to manage them in this new \\"era\\". The growing popularity of collaborative platforms is highlighted by the rise of TradeCard's supply chain collaboration platform, which connects multiple buyers and suppliers with financial institutions, enabling them to conduct automated supply-chain finance transactions.[22]\\r\\nWeb 2.0 is a trend in the use of the World Wide Web that is meant to increase creativity, information sharing, and collaboration among users. At its core, the common attribute of Web 2.0 is to help navigate the vast information available on the Web in order to find what is being bought. It is the notion of a usable pathway. SCM 2.0 replicates this notion in supply chain operations. It is the pathway to SCM results, a combination of processes, methodologies, tools, and delivery options to guide companies to their results quickly as the complexity and speed of the supply chain increase due to global competition; rapid price fluctuations; changing oil prices; short product life cycles; expanded specialization; near-, far-, and off-shoring; and talent scarcity.\\r\\nSCM 2.0 leverages solutions designed to rapidly deliver results with the agility to quickly manage future change for continuous flexibility, value, and success. This is delivered through competency networks composed of best-of-breed supply chain expertise to understand which elements, both operationally and organizationally, deliver results, as well as through intimate understanding of how to manage these elements to achieve the desired results. The solutions are delivered in a variety of options, such as no-touch via business process outsourcing, mid-touch via managed services and software as a service (SaaS), or high-touch in the traditional software deployment model.\\r\\nSuccessful SCM requires a change from managing individual functions to integrating activities into key supply chain processes. In an example scenario, a purchasing department places orders as its requirements become known. The marketing department, responding to customer demand, communicates with several distributors and retailers as it attempts to determine ways to satisfy this demand. Information shared between supply chain partners can only be fully leveraged through process integration.\\r\\nSupply chain business process integration involves collaborative work between buyers and suppliers, joint product development, common systems, and shared information. According to Lambert and Cooper (2000), operating an integrated supply chain requires a continuous information flow. However, in many companies, management has concluded that optimizing product flows cannot be accomplished without implementing a process approach. The key supply chain processes stated by Lambert (2004)[23] are:\\r\\nMuch has been written about demand management[citation needed]. Best-in-class companies have similar characteristics, which include the following:\\r\\nOne could suggest other critical supply business processes that combine these processes stated by Lambert, such as:\\r\\nIntegration of suppliers into the new product development process was shown to have a major impact on product target cost, quality, delivery, and market share. Tapping into suppliers as a source of innovation requires an extensive process characterized by development of technology sharing, but also involves managing intellectual[25] property issues.\\r\\nThere are gaps in the literature on supply chain management studies at present (2015)[citation needed]: there is no theoretical support for explaining the existence or the boundaries of supply chain management. A few authors, such as Halldorsson et al. (2003), Ketchen and Hult (2006), and Lavassani et al. (2009), have tried to provide theoretical foundations for different areas related to supply chain by employing organizational theories, which may include the following:\\r\\nHowever, the unit of analysis of most of these theories is not the supply chain but rather another system, such as the firm or the supplier-buyer relationship. Among the few exceptions is the relational view, which outlines a theory for considering dyads and networks of firms as a key unit of analysis for explaining superior individual firm performance (Dyer and Singh, 1998).[28]\\r\\nIn the study of supply chain management, the concept of centroids has become an important economic consideration. A centroid is a location that has a high proportion of a country's population and a high proportion of its manufacturing, generally within 500?mi (805?km). In the US, two major supply chain centroids have been defined, one near Dayton, Ohio, and a second near Riverside, California.\\r\\nThe centroid near Dayton is particularly important because it is closest to the population center of the US and Canada. Dayton is within 500?miles of 60% of the US population and manufacturing capacity, as well as 60% of Canada's population.[29] The region includes the interchange between I-70 and I-75, one of the busiest in the nation, with 154,000 vehicles passing through per day, 30ÿ35% of which are trucks hauling goods. In addition, the I-75 corridor is home to the busiest north-south rail route east of the Mississippi River.[29]\\r\\nWal-Mart strategic sourcing approaches Direct sourcing from suppliers-In 2010, Wal-Mart announced what would be a big change in its sourcing strategy. Initially, Wal-Mart relied on the intermediaries in the sourcing process. It bought only 20% of its stock directly but the rests were bought through the intermediaries (Cmuscm, 2014). Therefore, the company came to realize that the presence of many intermediaries in the product sourcing was actually increasing the costs in the supply chain. To cut these costs, Wall-Mart decided to do away with intermediaries in the supply chain and started direct sourcing of its goods from the suppliers. Eduardo Castro-Wright the then vice president of Wal-Mart set an ambitious goal of buying 80% of all Wal-Mart goods directly from the suppliers (Lu, 2014). Wal-Mart started purchasing fruits and vegetables on a global scale where it interacted directly with the suppliers of these goods. It later engaged the suppliers of other goods such as cloth and home electronics appliances directly and eliminated the importing agents. One advantage of this strategy of direct sourcing is that the supplier and the purchaser collaborate in finding goods of the highest quality that would appeal to the consumers. Moreover, the purchaser in this case Wal-Mart can easily direct the suppliers on how to manufacture certain products so that they can be acceptable to the consumers (Gilmorte, 2010). Thus, Wal-Mart through direct sourcing manages to get the exact product quality as it expects since it engages the suppliers in the producing of these products hence quality consistency (Lu, 2014). Using agents in the sourcing process in most cases lead to inconsistency in the quality of the products since the agent's source the products from different manufacturers which have varying qualities. Wal-Mart managed to source directly 80%v profit its stock and this has greatly eliminated the intermediaries and cut down the costs between 5-15% as markups that are introduced by these middlemen in the supply chain hence saving approximately $4-15 billion (Cmuscm, 2014). This strategy of direct sourcing not only helped Wal-Mart in reducing the costs in the supply chain but also helped in the improvement of supply chain activities through boosting efficiency throughout the entire process. In other words, direct sourcing reduced the time that takes the company to source and stocks the products in its stock (Lu, 2014). The presence of the intermediaries elongated the time in the process of procurement which sometimes led to delays in the supply of the commodities in the stores thus, customers finding empty shelves. Creation of procurement centers- Wal-Mart adopted this strategy of sourcing through centralizing the entire process of procurement and sourcing by setting up four global merchandizing points for general goods and clothing. The company instructed all the suppliers to be bringing their products to these central points that are located in different markets (Gilmorte, 2010). The procurement team assesses the quality brought by the suppliers and buys the goods and distributes them to various regional markets. The procurement and sourcing at centralized places helped the company to consolidate the suppliers. The company has established four centralized points including an office in Mexico City and Canada. Just a mere piloting test on the combining the purchase of fresh apples across the United States, Mexico, and Canada led to the savings of about 10%. As a result, the company intended to increase centralization of its procurement in the North America for all its fresh fruits and vegetables (Cmuscm, 2014). Thus, centralization of the procurement process to various points where the suppliers would be meeting with the procurement team is the latest strategy which the company is implementing and signs show that this strategy is going to cut costs and also improve the efficiency of the procumbent process. Strategic vendor partnerships are another strategy the company is using in the sourcing process. Wal-Mart realized that in order for it to ensure consistency in the quality of the products it offers g to the consumers and also maintains a steady supply of goods in its stores at a lower cost, it had to create strategic vendor partnerships with the suppliers (Cmuscm, 2014). Wal-Mart identified and selected the suppliers who met its demand and at the same time offered it the best prices for the goods. It then made a strategic relationship with these vendors by offering and assuring the long-term and high volume of purchases in exchange for the lowest possible prices (Lu, 2014). Thus, the company has managed to source its products from same suppliers as bulky but at lower prices. This enables the company to offer competitive prices of its products in its stores hence, maintaining a competitive advantage over its competitors whose goods are a little expensive compared to those of Wal-Mart. Efficient communication relationship with the vendor networks to improve the material flow is another sourcing strategy Wal-Mart uses. The company has all the contacts with the suppliers whom they communicate regularly and make dates on when the goods would be needed so that the suppliers get ready to deliver the goods in time (Wisner, Leong, & Tan, 2005). The efficient communication between the companys procurement team and the inventory management team enables the company source goods and fill its shelves on time without causing delays and empty shelves (Roberts, 2002). In other words, the company-y realized that in ensuring a steady flow of the goods into the store, the suppliers have to be informed early enough so that they can act accordingly to avoid delays in the delivery of goods (Lu, 2014). Thus, efficient communication is another tool which Wal-Mart is using to make the supply chain to be more efficient and cutting the costs. Cross-docking is another strategy that Wal-Mart is using to cut costs in its supply chain. Cross-docking is the process of transferring goods directly from inbound trucks to outbound trucks (Cmuscm, 2014). When the trucks of from the suppliers arrive at the distribution centers, most of the trucks are not offloaded to keep the goods in the distribution centers or warehouses, but they are transferred directly to another truck designated to deliver goods to specific retail stores for sale. Cross-docking helps in saving the storage costs (Gilmorte, 2010). Initially, the company was incurring considerable costs of storing the suppliers from the suppliers in its warehouses and the distributions centers to await the distribution trucks to the retail stores in various regions.\\r\\nTax efficient supply chain management is a business model that considers the effect of tax in the design and implementation of supply chain management. As the consequence of globalization, cross-national businesses pay different tax rates in different countries. Due to these differences, they may legally optimize their supply chain and increase profits based on tax efficiency.[30]\\r\\nSupply chain sustainability is a business issue affecting an organization's supply chain or logistics network, and is frequently quantified by comparison with SECH ratings, which uses a triple bottom line incorporating economic, social, and environmental aspects.[31] SECH ratings are defined as social, ethical, cultural, and health' footprints. Consumers have become more aware of the environmental impact of their purchases and companies' SECH ratings and, along with non-governmental organizations (NGOs), are setting the agenda for transitions to organically grown foods, anti-sweatshop labor codes, and locally produced goods that support independent and small businesses. Because supply chains may account for over 75% of a company's carbon footprint, many organizations are exploring ways to reduce this and thus improve their SECH rating.\\r\\nFor example, in July 2009, Wal-Mart announced its intentions to create a global sustainability index that would rate products according to the environmental and social impacts of their manufacturing and distribution. The index is intended to create environmental accountability in Wal-Mart's supply chain and to provide motivation and infrastructure for other retail companies to do the same.[32]\\r\\nIt has been reported that companies are increasingly taking environmental performance into account when selecting suppliers. A 2011 survey by the Carbon Trust found that 50% of multinationals expect to select their suppliers based upon carbon performance in the future and 29% of suppliers could lose their places on 'green supply chains' if they do not have adequate performance records on carbon.[33]\\r\\nThe US DoddÿFrank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, signed into law by President Obama in July 2010, contained a supply chain sustainability provision in the form of the Conflict Minerals law. This law requires SEC-regulated companies to conduct third party audits of their supply chains in order to determine whether any tin, tantalum, tungsten, or gold (together referred to as conflict minerals) is mined or sourced from the Democratic Republic of the Congo, and create a report (available to the general public and SEC) detailing the due diligence efforts taken and the results of the audit. The chain of suppliers and vendors to these reporting companies will be expected to provide appropriate supporting information.\\r\\nIncidents like the 2013 Savar building collapse with more than 1,100 victims have led to widespread discussions about corporate social responsibility across global supply chains. Wieland and Handfield (2013) suggest that companies need to audit products and suppliers and that supplier auditing needs to go beyond direct relationships with first-tier suppliers. They also demonstrate that visibility needs to be improved if supply cannot be directly controlled and that smart and electronic technologies play a key role to improve visibility. Finally, they highlight that collaboration with local partners, across the industry and with universities is crucial to successfully managing social responsibility in supply chains.[34]\\r\\nSCM components are the third element of the four-square circulation framework. The level of integration and management of a business process link is a function of the number and level of components added to the link (Ellram and Cooper, 1990; Houlihan, 1985). Consequently, adding more management components or increasing the level of each component can increase the level of integration of the business process link.\\r\\nLiterature on business process re-engineering[35] buyer-supplier relationships,[36] and SCM[37] suggests various possible components that should receive managerial attention when managing supply relationships. Lambert and Cooper (2000) identified the following components:\\r\\nHowever, a more careful examination of the existing literature[38] leads to a more comprehensive understanding of what should be the key critical supply chain components, or \\"branches\\" of the previously identified supply chain business processesthat is, what kind of relationship the components may have that are related to suppliers and customers. Bowersox and Closs (1996) state that the emphasis on cooperation represents the synergism leading to the highest level of joint achievement. A primary-level channel participant is a business that is willing to participate in responsibility for inventory ownership or assume other financial risks, thus including primary level components (Bowersox and Closs, 1996). A secondary-level participant (specialized) is a business that participates in channel relationships by performing essential services for primary participants, including secondary level components, which support primary participants. Third-level channel participants and components that support primary-level channel participants and are the fundamental branches of secondary-level components may also be included.\\r\\nConsequently, Lambert and Cooper's framework of supply chain components does not lead to any conclusion about what are the primary- or secondary-level (specialized) supply chain components (see Bowersox and Closs, 1996, p.?93) that is, which supply chain components should be viewed as primary or secondary, how these components should be structured in order to achieve a more comprehensive supply chain structure, and how to examine the supply chain as an integrative one (See above sections 2.1 and 3.1).\\r\\nReverse logistics is the process of managing the return of goods. It is also referred to as \\"aftermarket customer services\\". Any time money is taken from a company's warranty reserve or service logistics budget, one can speak of a reverse logistics operation. Reverse logistics is also the process of managing the return of goods from store, which the returned goods are sent back to warehouse and after that either warehouse scrap the goods or send them back to supplier for replacement depending on the warranty of the merchandise. 3\\r\\nSupply chain systems configure value for those that organize the networks. Value is the additional revenue over and above the costs of building the network. Co-creating value and sharing the benefits appropriately to encourage effective participation is a key challenge for any supply system. Tony Hines defines value as follows: \\"Ultimately it is the customer who pays the price for service delivered that confirms value and not the producer who simply adds cost until that point\\".[14]\\r\\nGlobal supply chains pose challenges regarding both quantity and value. Supply and value chain trends include:\\r\\nThese trends have many benefits for manufacturers because they make possible larger lot sizes, lower taxes, and better environments (e.g., culture, infrastructure, special tax zones, or sophisticated OEM) for their products. There are many additional challenges when the scope of supply chains is global. This is because with a supply chain of a larger scope, the lead time is much longer, and because there are more issues involved, such as multiple currencies, policies, and laws. The consequent problems include different currencies and valuations in different countries, different tax laws, different trading protocols, vulnerability to natural disasters and cyber threats[39], and lack of transparency of cost and profit.\\r\\nSupply-chain consulting is the providing of expert knowledge in order to assess the productivity of a supply-chain and, ideally, to enhance the productivity.[40]\\r\\nSupply chain Consulting is a service involved in transfer of knowledge on how to exploit existing assets through improved coordination and can hence be a source of competitive advantage; Hereby the role of the consultant is to help management by adding value to the whole process through the various sectors from the ordering of the raw materials to the final product.[41]\\r\\nOn this regard, firms either build internal teams of consultants to tackle the issue or use external ones, (companies choose between these two approaches taking into consideration various factors).[42]\\r\\nThe use of external consultants is a common practice among companies.[43] The whole consulting process generally involves the analysis of the entire supply-chain process, including the countermeasures or correctives to take to achieve a better overall performance.[44]\\r\\nSupply chain professionals need to have knowledge of managing supply chain functions such as transportation, warehousing, inventory management, and production planning. In the past, supply chain professionals emphasized logistics skills, such as knowledge of shipping routes, familiarity with warehousing equipment and distribution center locations and footprints, and a solid grasp of freight rates and fuel costs. More recently, supply chain management extends to logistical support across firms and management of global supply chains.[45] Supply chain professionals need to have an understanding of business continuity basics and strategies.[46]\\r\\nSupply chain professionals play major roles in the design and management of supply chains. In the design of supply chains, they help determine whether a product or service is provided by the firm itself (insourcing) or by another firm elsewhere (outsourcing). In the management of supply chains, supply chain professionals coordinate production among multiple providers, ensuring that production and transport of goods happen with minimal quality control or inventory problems. One goal of a well-designed and maintained supply chain for a product is to successfully build the product at minimal cost. Such a supply chain could be considered a competitive advantage for a firm.[47][48]\\r\\nBeyond design and maintenance of a supply chain itself, supply chain professionals participate in aspects of business that have a bearing on supply chains, such as sales forecasting, quality management, strategy development, customer service, and systems analysis. Production of a good may evolve over time, rendering an existing supply chain design obsolete. Supply chain professionals need to be aware of changes in production and business climate that affect supply chains and create alternative supply chains as the need arises.[47] Individuals working in supply chain management can attain a professional certification by passing an exam developed by a third party certification organizations. The purpose of certification is to guarantee a certain level of expertise in the field.\\r\\nThe knowledge needed to pass a certification exam may be gained from several sources. Some knowledge may come from college courses, but most of it is acquired from a mix of on-the-job learning experiences, attending industry events, learning best practices with their peers, and reading books and articles in the field.[49] Certification organizations may provide certification workshops tailored to their exams.[50] There are also free websites that provide a significant amount of educational articles, as well as blogs that are internationally recognized which provide good sources of news and updates.\\r\\nThe following North American universities rank high in their master's education in the SCM World University 100 ranking, which was published in 2017 and which is based on the opinions of supply chain managers: Michigan State University, Penn State University, University of Tennessee, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Arizona State University, University of Texas at Austin and Western Michigan University. In the same ranking, the following European universities rank high: Cranfield School of Management, Vlerick Business School, INSEAD, Cambridge University, Eindhoven University of Technology, London Business School and Copenhagen Business School.[51] In the 2016 Eduniversal Best Masters Ranking Supply Chain and Logistics the following universities rank high: Massachusetts Institute of Technology, KEDGE Business School, Purdue University, Rotterdam School of Management, Pontificia Universidad Catolica del Peru, Universidade Nova de Lisboa, Vienna University of Economics and Business and Copenhagen Business School.[52]\\r\\nThere are a number of organizations that provide certification exams, such as CSCMP (Council of Supply Chain Management Professionals), IIPMR (International Institute for Procurement and Market Research), APICS (the Association for Operations Management), ISCEA (The International Supply Chain Education Alliance) and IoSCM (Institute of Supply Chain Management). APICS' certification is called Certified Supply Chain Professional, or CSCP, and ISCEA'S certification is called the Certified Supply Chain Manager (CSCM), CISCM (Chartered Institute of Supply Chain Management) awards certificate as Chartered Supply Chain Management Professional (CSCMP). Another, the Institute for Supply Management, is developing one called the Certified Professional in Supply Management (CPSM)[53] focused on the procurement and sourcing areas of supply chain management. The Supply Chain Management Association (SCMA) is the main certifying body for Canada with the designations having global reciprocity. The designation Supply Chain Management Professional (SCMP) is the title of the supply chain leadership designation.\\r\\nThe following table compares topics addressed by selected professional supply chain certification programmes.[53][54][55][56]","input":"When was the term supply chain management introduced?"},{"output":"Big Bird","context":"A wide variety of characters have appeared on the American children's television series Sesame Street. A large number of the characters are Muppets, which are puppets made in Jim Henson's distinctive puppet-creation style. Most of the non-Muppet characters are human characters, but there are a few characters that are animated. There are also Numberkids 0-10.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nJim Henson created many Muppet characters for the purpose of appearing on Sesame Street. His involvement with the show began when he and one of the creators, Joan Ganz Cooney, met in the summer of 1968 at one of the show's five three-day curriculum planning seminars in Boston. Author Christopher Finch reported that director Jon Stone, who had worked with Henson previously, felt that if they could not bring him on board, they should \\"make do without puppets\\".[1]\\r\\nHenson was initially reluctant, but he agreed to join Sesame Street for social goals. He also agreed to waive his performance fee for full ownership of the Sesame Street Muppets and to split any revenue they generated with the Children's Television Workshop, the series' non-profit producer.[2] The Muppets were a crucial part of the show's popularity and it brought Henson national attention.[3] In early research, the Muppet segments of the show scored high, and more Muppets were added during the first few seasons. The Muppets were effective teaching tools because children easily recognized them, they were predictable, and they appealed to adults and older siblings.[4]\\r\\nDuring the production of Sesame Street's first season, producers created five one-hour episodes to test the show's appeal to children and examine their comprehension of the material. Not intended for broadcast, they were presented to preschoolers in 60 homes throughout Philadelphia and in day care centers in New York City in July 1969.[5] The results were \\"generally very positive\\";[6] children learned from the shows, their appeal was high, and children's attention was sustained over the full hour.[5] However, the researchers found that although children's attention was high during the Muppet segments, their interest wavered during the \\"Street\\" segments, when no Muppets were on screen. This was because the producers had followed the advice of child psychologists who were concerned that children would be confused if human actors and Muppets were shown together. As a result of this decision, the appeal of the test episodes was lower than the target.[6][7]\\r\\nThe Street scenes were \\"the glue\\" that \\"pulled the show together\\",[8] so producers knew they needed to make significant changes. The producers decided to reject the advisers' advice and reshot the Street segments; Henson and his coworkers created Muppets that could interact with the human actors.[8][9] These test episodes were directly responsible for what writer Malcolm Gladwell called \\"the essence of Sesame Streetthe artful blend of fluffy monsters and earnest adults\\".[8] Since 2001, the full rights for the Sesame Street Muppets have been owned by Sesame Workshop, as the CTW was renamed in 2000.[10]\\r\\nThe first Muppet to appear on the show[11] was Big Bird, an 8-foot-tall yellow bird believed by writer Shalom M. Fisch and Dr. Lewis Bernstein to be a canary,[9] who resides in a large nest alongside the \\"123 Sesame Street\\" building[11] and represents the 6-year-old child with his tendency to question everything.[12][13] Also living outside of the building is Oscar the Grouch, a trash can-dwelling creature belonging to his own unique species, who is portrayed as a habitual pessimist[14] and was designed to give children \\"permission to feel grouchyand to demonstrate differing opinions\\".[15] Oscar and Big Bird were specifically created for the reshooting of the \\"Street\\" scenes with the idea that they would be able to interact with the human characters.[16] Big Bird's best friend is Aloysius Snuffleupagus (better known as \\"Snuffy\\"), who was portrayed as the bird's imaginary friend until revealed to the human cast in 1985.[17][18] For his part, Oscar has several friends of his own despite his pessimism; these include the Grouch's pet worm, Slimey,[14] and his girlfriend Grundgetta.[19] Two other Muppets who have appeared on the show since its beginning are Ernie and Bert, a pair of best friends with contrasting personalities; Ernie is portrayed as a free-spirited trickster who loves his rubber duck,[20][21] while Bert is the world-weary foil to his friend's na?ve trouble-making, and shows himself to be obsessed with things like pigeons and paper clips.[22]\\r\\nThe Three Bears from the story of Goldilocks appear in Muppet form on Sesame Street.[23] Also appearing on the show are an unidentified species of furry characters referred to as \\"monsters\\".[8] Among these are Cookie Monster, a blue monster who is addicted to the baked goods for which he is named[24] but ironically also likes healthy foods;[25] Telly Monster, a purple worrywart who overthinks everything, was described by writer David Borgenicht as \\"neurotic\\", and was originally portrayed as a television addict;[26] Zoe, a yellow-orange female monster who is \\"simultaneously dainty and strong, practical and impulsive\\"[27] and loves to dance ballet;[28] and Rosita, a bilingual turquoise monster (also female) who speaks both English and Spanish.[29] Grover, a blue monster described by Borgenicht as \\"self-confident, furry, cute, capable, and intelligent\\",[30] has a superhero alter-ego named \\"Super Grover\\", who is more well-meaning than helpful.[31] In addition to Ernie and Bert, recognizable humanoid Muppets appearing on the show also include Count von Count, a number-obsessed vampire based on Bela Lugosi's interpretation of Count Dracula;[32] and Prairie Dawn, a methodic and driven young girl who loves to write and direct pageants featuring her friends.[33]\\r\\nOne Muppet monster who became a household name in the show's recent history is Elmo, a red monster representing the three- to four-year-old child. Elmo became what his eventual portrayer, Kevin Clash, considered a \\"phenomenon\\"[34] after Clash took over the role in 1983, and his popularity ultimately grew to the point where he became what writer Michael Davis called \\"the embodiment\\" of Sesame Street.[35] In 1998, the Muppet got his own segment occupying the last 15 minutes of the show, \\"Elmo's World\\", in which he explored child-centered topics[36] from two worlds of live action and computer animation, which looked like \\"a child's squiggly crayon drawing come to life\\".[37] \\"Elmo's World\\" continued until 2012, when another segment starring the character, \\"Elmo the Musical\\", was introduced to replace it.[38]\\r\\nAt the show's twenty-fifth anniversary in 1993, the producers expanded and redesigned the show's set with a new series of locations dubbed \\"Around the Corner\\",[39] which was dropped from the show in 1997.[40] One of the \\"Around the Corner\\" locations, the Furry Arms Hotel, had a few original Muppets of its own: proprietor Sherry Netherland,[41] managers Humphrey and Ingrid[42] (who had a baby named Natasha),[23] and bellhop Benny Rabbit.[42] While the rights to Muppet characters from other productions were sold to The Walt Disney Company in 2004, Sesame Workshop continued to fully own the Sesame Street Muppets; as a result, Sesame Workshop was and is allowed to have new Muppets designed and built for the show.[43] These have included Abby Cadabby, a pink fairy-in-training, who was introduced in 2006 to increase the number of the show's female Muppets;[44] Murray Monster, an orange monster with an energetic, outgoing personality and a sense of quick wit,[45] who hosts a segment at the beginning of each episode called \\"Word on the Street\\";[46] and Julia, the first autistic Muppet on the show, introduced in 2017, who was created to familiarize young children with the autism spectrum.[47]\\r\\nOther Muppets that have appeared on Sesame Street over the years have included the Two-Headed Monster, who teaches cooperation while speaking in baby-like gibberish;[48] the Twiddlebugs, a family of cute and innovative insects;[48] the Yip Yips, a species of Martians who \\"valiantly explore our world despite their frequent terrifying encounters with everyday objects\\";[49] game show host Guy Smiley;[50] construction workers Biff and Sully;[51] Herry Monster, a burly blue monster who does not know his own strength;[52] Forgetful Jones, a \\"simpleton cowboy\\"[53] with a short-term memory disorder;[54] and even Kermit the Frog, the flagship character of The Muppets.[55]\\r\\nThe original human cast, chosen by Stone, consisted of four characters.[56] The first character to be introduced to the show was Gordon Robinson, a \\"well-liked and respected\\" African-American ultimately portrayed as a science teacher;[57] he was played by Garrett Saunders on the test pilots,[58] by Matt Robinson in the early years of the actual series,[57] and after being briefly played by Hal Miller, was taken over by his longest-serving portrayer, Roscoe Orman, in 1974.[59][60] The other three original human characters were Gordon's wife Susan, played by Loretta Long;[56] Mr. Harold Hooper, a \\"gruff grocer with [a] warm heart\\"[61] portrayed by Will Lee until his death in 1982;[62] and Bob Johnson, a music teacher played by Bob McGrath.[63] Unlike what was done for most children's television series at the time, the producers of Sesame Street decided against using a single host and cast a group of ethnically diverse actors,[56] with, as Sesame Street researcher Gerald S. Lesser put it, \\"a variety of distinctive and reliable personalities\\".[64]\\r\\nStone did not audition actors until the spring of 1969, a few weeks before the show's five test pilots were due to be filmed. Stone videotaped the auditions, and researcher Ed Palmer took them out into the field to test children's reactions. The actors who received the \\"most enthusiastic thumbs up\\" were cast.[65] For example, when the children saw Long's audition, they stood up and sang along with her rendition of \\"I'm a Little Teapot\\".[65][66] As Stone said, casting was the only aspect of the show that was \\"just completely haphazard\\".[67] Most of Sesame Street's cast and crew found their jobs through personal relationships with Stone and the other producers.[67]\\r\\nBob's former girlfriend was Linda (Linda Bove), a librarian who communicated using American Sign Language, and who became the longest-running deaf character in television history.[68][69] In 1985, Gordon and Susan adopted a shy child, Miles, who was later age-progressed into a fun-loving teenager who formed his own band.[68] In 1971, the show introduced a Mexican-American character named Luis Rodriguez (Emilio Delgado), a repairman who has been called the \\"Mr. Fix-It\\" of Sesame Street.[70][71] Luis married Maria (Sonia Manzano) in 1988,[72] and their daughter, Gabi, was born the following year.[73]\\r\\nWhen Lee died (and Mr. Hooper with him), Sesame Street dealt with his death in what Davis called a \\"landmark broadcast\\"[62] aired on Thanksgiving Day 1983.[68] After that, Mr. Hooper's apprentice David (Northern Calloway) took over as his store's proprietor until he himself left the show in 1989,[68] and was succeeded by Mr. Handford (played first by Leonard Jackson and then by David Smyrl from 1990 to 1998), a former firefighter.[68] The most recent owner of Hooper's Store is Alan, played by Alan Muraoka.[74] Gina Jefferson (played by Alison Bartlett O'Reilly)[75] started on the show as a teenager working at Hooper's Store, later ran a day care center, and eventually became a veterinarian.[76][77] The most recently introduced human characters on Sesame Street include Chris (Chris Knowings), Gordon and Susan's nephew, who works part-time at Hooper's Store;[78][79] Indian-American laundromat owner Leela (Nitya Vidyasagar);[80] and Armando (Ismael Cr~z Cordova), an energetic Latino writer and \\"techie [who] loves his gadgets\\".[81]\\r\\nMr. Noodle, a major character in the \\"Elmo's World\\" segment, was played by Broadway actor Bill Irwin, who had previously worked with Arlene Sherman (one of the show's executive producers) in short films for Sesame Street.[82] When he became unavailable, Sherman asked her friend Michael Jeter to replace Irwin as Mr. Noodle's brother Mr. Noodle.[83] Jeter was in the role beginning in 2000, until his death in 2003.[84] Kristin Chenoweth played Mr. Noodle's sister Ms. Noodle,[84] and Sarah Jones played Mr. Noodle's other sister Miss Noodle. Writer Louise A. Gikow called the Noodles \\"a dynasty of mimes...in the tradition of great silent film comedians like Charlie Chaplin, Buster Keaton, and Harold Lloyd\\".[84] They made mistakes, but solved them with the help of \\"enthusiastic kid voice-overs\\",[84] which empowered children and helped them feel smarter than the adults. According to long-time Sesame Street writer Judy Freudberg, \\"Mr. Noodle, who never speaks, is all about trial and error. When you throw him a hat, he acts like he's never seen one before. Kids feel empowered watching him because they can do what he can't\\".[85]\\r\\nIn addition to its \\"variety of distinctive and reliable personalities\\",[64] both Muppet and human, Sesame Street has also featured a few animated characters throughout its history, who have included (among others) Alice Braithwaite Goodyshoes, described by Lesser as an \\"arrogant, sanctimonious know-it-all\\",[64] and the Teeny Little Super Guy, a typical problem solver.[86] In 2008, Bert and Ernie got their own Claymation segment called \\"Bert and Ernie's Great Adventure\\", in which they explore the world, going on \\"active adventures in exotic locations\\", according to Sesame Street executive producer Carol-Lynn Parente.[87] The following year, Abby Cadabby got her own computer-animated segment, \\"Abby's Flying Fairy School\\",[88] where she takes fairy training classes from her teacher Mrs. Sparklenose,[89] along with her classmates Gonnigan and Bl?gg.[90] Additionally, several DC Comics characters were licensed for use in animated segments on the show during its first season, including Batman[91] and Superman.[92] Animated characters rarely if ever interact with the human and Muppet characters.

Consisting of nougat topped with caramel and peanuts, enrobed in milk chocolate,[2] Snickers has annual global sales of $2 billion.[3]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the United Kingdom, the Isle of Man, and Ireland, Snickers was sold under the brand name Marathon until July 19, 1990.[4] Snickers brand Marathon energy bars have since been sold in some markets.[5]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1930,[1]  Mars introduced Snickers, named after the favorite horse of the Mars family.[6]  The Snickers chocolate bar consists of nougat, peanuts, and caramel with a chocolate coating. The bar was marketed under the name \\"Marathon\\" in the UK and Ireland until July 19, 1990, when Mars decided to align the UK product with the global Snickers name (Mars had marketed and discontinued an unrelated bar named Marathon in the United States during the 1970s). There are also several other Snickers products such as Snickers mini, dark chocolate, ice cream bars, Snickers with almonds, Snickers with hazelnuts, Snickers peanut butter bars, Snickers protein and Snickers with Extra Caramel, as well as espresso, fiery, and sweet & salty versions.[7][8]\\r\\n\\r\\nA replacement for the king size Snickers bar was launched in the UK in 2004 and designed to conform to the September 2004 Food and Drink Federation (FDF) \\"Manifesto for Food and Health\\". Part of the FDF manifesto was seven pledges of action to encourage the food and drink industry to be more health conscious.[9] Reducing portion size, clearer food labels, and reduction of the levels of fat, sugar, and salt were among the FDF pledges. Mars Incorporated pledged to phase out their king-size bars in 2005 and replace them with shareable bars. A Mars spokesman said: \\"Our king-size bars that come in one portion will be changed so they are shareable or can be consumed on more than one occasion. The name king-size will be phased out.\\"[9]\\r\\n\\r\\nThese were eventually replaced by the 'Duo', a double bar pack.  Though this change to Duos reduced the weight from 3.5 to 3.29 ounces (99 to 93?g), the price remained the same. The packaging has step-by-step picture instructions of how to open a Duo into two bars, in four simple actions.[10] As Mars stated fulfillment of their promise, the Duo format was met with criticism by the National Obesity Forum and National Consumer Council.[11]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn December 2000, tens of thousands of Snickers and Mars Bars were removed from New South Wales store shelves due to a series of threatening letters which resulted in fears that the chocolate bars had been poisoned.[12] Mars received letters from an unidentified individual indicating that they planned to plant poisoned chocolate bars on store shelves.[12] The last letter sent included a Snickers bar contaminated with a substance which was later identified as rat poison.[12] The letters claimed that there were seven additional chocolate bars which had been tampered with and which were for sale to the public.[12] As a precautionary measure, Mars issued a massive recall.[12] Mars said that there had been no demand for money and complaints directed to an unidentified third party.[12]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe USDA lists the caloric value of a 2-ounce (57 gram) Snickers bar as 280 kilocalories (1,200?kJ).[13] As of 2018, the United Kingdom bar has a weight of 48g, with 245 kcal,[14] and the Canadian bar 52g with 250 kcal.[citation needed]\\r\\n\\r\\nOver the years, the bar weight has decreased: Before 2009, in the UK a single Snickers bar had a weight of 62.5g. This weight was subsequently reduced to 58g in 2009,[15] and to 48g in 2013.[16]\\r\\n\\r\\nContaining approximately 450 calories (1,900?J) per bar,[17] deep fried chocolate bars (including Snickers and Mars bars) became a specialty in fish and chips shops in Scotland in 1995,[18] and in the early 2000s, became popular at American state fairs.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 2012, the British Food Commission highlighted celebrity chef Antony Worrall Thompson's \\"Snickers pie\\",[19] which contained five Snickers bars among other ingredients, suggesting it was one of the unhealthiest desserts ever; one slice providing \\"over 1,250 calories (5,200?kJ) from sugar and fat alone\\", more than half a day's requirement for an average adult. The pie had featured on his BBC Saturday programme some two years earlier and the chef described it as an occasional treat only.[20]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1980, Snickers ran ads which featured a variety of everyday people discussing why they like Snickers. The ads featured a jingle that said \\"It's so satisfying\\" and had the classic hand that would open and close showing a handful of peanuts converting to a Snickers bar. \\"Packed with peanuts, Snickers really satisfies\\" was shown in the commercials.\\r\\n\\r\\nMars paid $5 million to have Snickers and M&M's named the \\"official snack\\" of the 1984 Summer Olympics, outraging nutritionists.[21] Sports promotions in international games continued to be a prominent marketing tool for Mars, that would keep Snickers as an international brand while also selling local bars in some markets.[22]\\r\\n\\r\\nBeginning in 1995, Snickers ran ads which featured someone making a self-inflicted mistake, with the voice-over saying \\"Not going anywhere for a while? Grab a Snickers!\\" The tag line at the end of each ad proclaimed, \\"Hungry? Why Wait?\\"\\r\\n\\r\\nOne such ad had a player for a fictional American football team showing off his new tattoo of the team's logo on his back to his teammates. He then shows it to his head coach who, after complimenting the tattoo, immediately tells him that he's been traded to Miami. The player then goes to have his old team's logo replaced with the new team's logo.[citation needed]\\r\\n\\r\\nSome of the ads were done in conjunction with the National Football League, with whom Snickers had a sponsorship deal at the time. One ad featured a member of the grounds crew at Arrowhead Stadium painting the field for an upcoming Kansas City Chiefs game in hot, late-summer weather. After finishing one of the end zones, and visibly exhausted, one of the Chiefs players walks up to him and says the field looks great, \\"but who are the Chefs?\\", showing that despite all the hard work the painter accidentally omitted the \\"i\\" in Chiefs.[23] Another had Marv Levy in the Buffalo Bills locker room lecturing his team that \\"no one's going anywhere\\" until the Bills figure out how to actually win a Super Bowl.[24]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 2007, Snickers launched a campaign which featured Henry the VIII and a Viking among others who attend the \\"Snickers Feast\\". It consisted of various commercials of the gang and their adventures on the feast.[citation needed]\\r\\n\\r\\nOn February 4, 2007, during Super Bowl XLI, Snickers commercials aired which resulted in complaints by gay and lesbian groups against the maker of the candy bar, Masterfoods USA of Hackettstown, New Jersey, a division of Mars, Incorporated. The commercial showed a pair of auto mechanics accidentally touching lips while sharing a Snickers bar. After quickly pulling away, one mechanic says, \\"I think we just accidentally kissed.\\", and another mechanic exclaims, \\"Quick! Do something manly!\\" and in three of the four versions, they do so mostly in the form of injury, including tearing out chest hair, striking each other with a very large pipe wrench, and drinking motor oil and windshield washer fluid. In the fourth version, however, a third mechanic shows up and asks \\"Is there room for three in this Love Boat?\\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nComplaints were lodged against Masterfoods that the ads were homophobic. Human Rights Campaign president Joe Solmonese is quoted as saying\\r\\n\\"This type of jeering from professional sports figures at the sight of two men kissing fuels the kind of anti-gay bullying that haunts countless gay and lesbian school children on playgrounds all across the country.\\"[25]\\r\\nGay and Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation (GLAAD) president Neil Giuliano said \\"That Snickers, Mars and the NFL would promote and endorse this kind of prejudice is simply inexcusable.\\" Masterfoods has since pulled the ads and the website.[25][26][27]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 2006, Mr. T starred in a Snickers advert in the UK where he rides up in an army tank and shouts abuse at a football player who appears to be faking an injury, threatening to introduce him to his friend Pain. Another advert featured Mr. T launching bars at a swimmer who appeared to refuse to get in a swimming pool because of the cold temperature of the water. In 2008, a European Snickers commercial in which Mr. T uses a Jeep-mounted Minigun to fire Snickers bars at a speedwalker for being a \\"disgrace to the man race\\" was pulled after complaints from a US pressure group that the advertisement was homophobic.[28] These adverts usually ended with Mr. T saying \\"Snickers: Get Some Nuts!\\"\\r\\n\\r\\nIn NASCAR racing, Snickers (and the rest of the Mars affiliated brands) sponsor Kyle Busch's #18 Toyota for Joe Gibbs Racing. Prior to that the brand served as a primary sponsor for Ricky Rudd's #88 Robert Yates Racing Ford as well as an associate sponsor for the team's #38 car driven first by Elliott Sadler and then by David Gilliland, and an associate sponsor for the MB2 Motorsports #36 Pontiac driven by Derrike Cope, Ernie Irvan, Ken Schrader, and others. In 1990, Bobby Hillin drove for Stavola Brothers Racing in the #8 Snickers Buick, marking the candy's first appearance as a sponsor; it had since been driven by Rick Wilson and Dick Trickle.\\r\\n\\r\\nSnickers was the Official Sponsor of the FIFA World Cup from 1990 until 1998 editions and the UEFA European Championship from 1996 until 2000.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 2010, a new advertising campaign was launched, based around people turning into different people (usually celebrities) when they're hungry (taking the new campaign's name \\"You're Not You When You're Hungry\\" quite literally). In 2010, Betty White and Abe Vigoda appeared in the first Snickers commercial in this campaign, playing American football. The commercial was ranked by ADBOWL as the best advertisement of the year. This commercial was also briefly spoofed in an episode of SportsNation on ESPN2 with Michelle Beadle playing the role instead of Betty White in 2011.[29] Later that year, Snickers commercials featured singers Aretha Franklin and Liza Minnelli, and comedians Richard Lewis and Roseanne Barr. A 2011 commercial featured actors Joe Pesci and Don Rickles.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe tagline varied depending on the commercial's location or what variety the commercial is showing. The UK version (featuring men in a changing room turning into Joan Collins and Stephanie Beacham as a result of hunger) retains Mr. T's slogan. In Latin America, the slogan was the same as in the UK version, except that men doing extreme sports turning into the Mexican singer Anah as a result of hunger.[30]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 2013, Robin Williams and Bobcat Goldthwait also appeared in a Snickers football commercial. In March 2014, a commercial featuring Godzilla was released to promote the 2014 Godzilla film. In the commercial, Godzilla is shown hanging out with humans on the beach, riding dirt bikes, and water skiing; he only begins rampaging once he's hungry. After being fed a Snickers bar, he resumes having fun with the humans.[31]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn October 2014, Rowan Atkinson as Mr. Bean returned on television by appearing on several UK Snickers commercials and cinema spots.[32]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn February 2015, Snickers' Super Bowl XLIX commercial featured a parody of a scene from an episode of The Brady Bunch entitled \\"Subject Was Noses.\\" In the commercial, Carol and Mike try to calm down a hungry and angry Danny Trejo. When the parents give Trejo a Snickers bar, he reverts into Marcia before an irate Jan (played by Steve Buscemi) rants upstairs and walks away.[33]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 2016, for Super Bowl 50, another Snickers commercial was made, featuring Willem Dafoe (as Marilyn Monroe) and Eugene Levy, where \\"Marilyn\\" complains about filming the iconic \\"subway grate\\" scene in The Seven Year Itch. After being given a Snickers, Marilyn goes ahead with the scene, with Levy operating the fan below, commenting that the scene won't make the movie's final cut, that nobody would want to see it.\\r\\n\\r\\nSnickers has been an official sponsor of WWE's WrestleMania events, including WrestleMania 2000, 22, 32, 33 and 34, while its Cruncher variant sponsored WrestleMania X-Seven, XIX, XX and 21. Since then, Snickers has sponsored superstars such as Enzo Amore and Big Cass with their signature term, SAWFT, which is labelled at the back of the chocolate bar.","input":"What are the ingredients of a snickers bar?"},{"output":"James John Liautaud","context":"James P. Liautaud\\r\\nJames John Liautaud (January 12, 1964) is the founder, chairman, and majority owner of Jimmy Johns sandwich chain.[1]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nJimmy John Liautaud was born in Arlington Heights, Illinois on January 12, 1964.[2] His father is James Liautaud, longtime entrepreneur, and his mother is Gina Gudaityte Liautaud. He has two brothers, Greg and Robby Liautaud, and a sister, Lara Liautaud Berry. He was born the third of four siblings.[3] He attended Elgin Academy, a private prep school in Elgin, Illinois. During high school he became close with and was influenced by the dean of the academy, James Lyons.[4]\\r\\nHe was enrolled at Eastern Illinois University but left in order to grow his up-and-coming restaurant business.[5]\\r\\nAfter Liautaud graduated from high school in 1982, his father offered him a loan of $25,000 to open a business on the condition that if the business failed, he would enlist in the US Army.[4] Although his father wanted him to enlist, he agreed to loan him the money in exchange for a 48% stake in the business. Initially he wanted to open a hot dog stand, but after visiting numerous such stands throughout the summer of 1982, he realized that $25,000 would not be enough for such a venture.[6] After a chance encounter at a sandwich shop, Jimmy John realized that he could open a sandwich shop within his available budget by purchasing premium meats at a neighborhood market and baking his own bread. With the help of his family as tasters, he decided to put four types of sandwiches on his original menu. On January 13, 1983 Jimmy Johns Gourmet Sandwiches opened in Charleston, Illinois.[1][6] Due to the poor location of his first store, Liautaud decided to include delivery of his sandwiches to boost sales. He began by bringing samples door-to-door to the nearby Eastern Illinois University dorms.[5] By the end of his first year, the restaurant started making a profit. At the end of his second year, Liautaud was able to purchase his fathers share in the business and he became Jimmy Johns owner in full. The business continued to grow, and he was able to open his second and third shops in 1986 and 1987, respectively.\\r\\nIn 1988, Liautaud met businessman Jamie Coulter. At the time, Coulter was a Pizza Hut Franchisee, and later became the Chairman, Founder, and CEO of Lone Star Steakhouse and Saloon and other chains. Coulter helped Liautaud take his business to the next level. In 1994 he sold his first Jimmy Johns franchise.[6] When franchising began, Liautaud had 10 Jimmy John's stores.[7]\\r\\nBy 2002, the company had about 200 stores, 10% of which were corporate stores that the Jimmy Johns owner oversaw himself. Sales at the stores managed by Liautaud were outpacing the franchised stores by a wide margin. Together with his partner, and now Jimmy Johns President & CEO, James North, he visited 70 of the poorest-performing stores. After 18 months of getting the stores back to basics and instilling in them some of that initial spark, he was able to help the stores become more profitable.[5]\\r\\nIn January 2007, Liautaud selected Weston Presidio, a private-equity firm, to help acquire better locations for the expanding company. Weston Presidio bought a 33% stake in the company, and during the first year closed on over 100 real estate deals.[6]\\r\\nIn September 2016, Roark Capital Group agreed to purchase a majority stake in Liautaud's company, as Weston Presidio sold their minority investment after 10 years. Terms of the transaction were not immediately disclosed, though it was later clarified that Liautaud retained 35% ownership of the company as part of the deal.[8] As part of the agreement, Liautaud, as the company's founder and largest individual shareholder, will continue as chairman of the board.[9][10]\\r\\nIn 2008, Liautaud donated $1 million to his high school, Elgin Academy, on one condition: that the building constructed using his donation bear not only his name, but also the name of the man who had been the dean of the school when Liautaud attended: James Lyons.[4]\\r\\nBeginning in 2011, Liautaud began donating to the Frances Nelson SmileHealthy dental clinic in Champaign, Illinois.[11]\\r\\nIn 2011, Liautaud and his wife pledged $1 million toward the construction of the new Champaign County YMCA.[12]\\r\\nIn July 2014, Liautaud donated $1 million to the Folds of Honor Foundation, an organization that supports the families of fallen soldiers.[13]\\r\\nIn July 2016, Liautaud and his wife Leslie donated $150,000 to help fund the first phase of construction for the Kickapoo Rail Trail, a 24.5-mile recreational trail between Urbana and the nearby St. Joseph.[14]\\r\\nIn December 2016, Liautaud and his wife Leslie established the Liautaud Family Foundation in order to make donations to a variety of charitable causes. The Foundation's first donation was $200,000 to fund a building expansion for Crisis Nursery, an emergency childcare facility for families in crisis.[15] In January 2018, Crisis Nursery announced that the Liautauds had made an additional matching grant offer of up to $100,000 to help cover an approximate $300,000 deficit from an unpaid state grant.[16]\\r\\nIn 2017, Liautaud and his wife partnered with Brewster Academy to kick off the fundraising for their new residence hall to house 22 students and 4 faculty residences.[17]\\r\\nIn December 2017, Liautaud and his wife donated $50,000 to cover the first 3 years of rent at a new location for Champaign County's Youth Assessment Center, a local juvenile diversion program.[18]\\r\\nIn January 2018, Liautaud donated over $45,000 to shore up health, wellness, and fine arts initiatives at several Champaign Unit 4 schools.[19]\\r\\nLiautaud is a member of the University of Illinois at Chicagos Chicago Area Entrepreneurship Hall of Fame.[20]\\r\\nIn 2003, he was named to Chicagos 40 Under 40 by Crains Chicago Business.[21]\\r\\nIn 2004, he was named the Ernst & Young Food & Beverage Entrepreneur of the Year in Illinois.

The Horatio Alger Association of Distinguished Americans recognizes people who have overcome personal challenges to achieve personal and professional success.[26][27]\\r\\nLiautaud is an avid hunter and fisherman. In an interview in 2015 with the Chicago Tribune, Liautaud said that the largest misconception about him is that people still connect him to 10-year-old photos of him posing with big game. According to Liautaud, he used to hunt big game in Africa on legally organized safaris, but he no longer does. During the interview with the Tribune, the subject made \\"[Liautaud's] eyes well up with tears.\\"[5] In 2015, his hunting prompted people to call for a boycott of his business.[28]\\r\\nLiautaud is married to dancer, playwright, actress, and choreographer Leslie Liautaud and has three children, Spencer, Lucy, and Fred.[6][29] Liautaud is an investor in wines and vineyards, at least one of which has been featured on the cover of Wine Spectator.[30]","input":"Who is the owner of jimmy john's?"},{"output":"Eliza Gladys \\"Millvina\\" Dean","context":"\\r\\n\\r\\nEliza Gladys \\"Millvina\\" Dean (2 February 1912 ÿ 31 May 2009) was a British civil servant, cartographer, and the last remaining survivor of the sinking of the RMS Titanic on 15 April 1912.[1] At 2 months old, she was also the youngest passenger aboard.[2]\\r\\n\\r\\nDean was born in Branscombe, England, on 2 February 1912 to Bertram Frank Dean (1886ÿ1912) and Georgette Eva Light (1879ÿ1975). She had an older brother, Bertram Vere Dean, born 21 May 1910. She never married and had no children.[3] Her father died on the Titanic; her mother died on 16 September 1975, aged 96; and her brother died on 14 April 1992, age 81, the 80th anniversary of the iceberg collision.\\r\\n\\r\\nDean's parents decided to leave the United Kingdom and emigrate to Wichita, Kansas, where her father had relatives, and his cousin owned a tobacco shop that he was going to co-own.[4] They were not supposed to be aboard the Titanic, but due to a coal strike, they were transferred onto it and boarded it as third-class passengers at Southampton, England. Dean was barely two months old when she boarded the ship. Her father felt its collision with the iceberg on the night of 14 April 1912, and after investigating, returned to his cabin, telling his wife to dress the children and go up on deck. Dean, her mother, and her brother were placed in Lifeboat 10 and were among the first third-class passengers to escape.[i] Her father, however, did not survive, and his body, if recovered, was never identified.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt first, Dean's mother wanted to continue on to Kansas to fulfil her husband's wish of a new life in the United States. However, after losing him and being left with two small children for whom to care, they returned to Britain aboard the RMS?Adriatic. While aboard the ship, Dean attracted considerable attention. An article in the Daily Mirror dated 12 May 1912 described the ordeal:\\r\\n\\r\\nMillvina and Bertram were raised mostly on pension funds and educated in Southampton schools, including The Gregg School. It was not until she was eight years old, and her mother was planning to remarry, that Dean was told she had been a passenger on the Titanic.\\r\\n\\r\\nDean worked for the British government during the Second World War and later as a purchaser for a local engineering firm. Other careers she held were as a cartographer, a secretary, and an assistant to a tobacconist.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was not until Dean was in her seventies that she became involved in Titanic-related events. Over the years, she participated in numerous conventions, exhibitions, documentaries, radio and television interviews, and personal correspondence. In 1998, she travelled to the United States to participate in a Titanic convention in Springfield, Massachusetts, and another in 1999 in Montreal, Quebec, Canada. She had also been scheduled to appear at a commemoration of the 94th anniversary of the sinking in 2006, but a broken hip prevented her appearance.[6] She also appeared in the History special Titanic's Final Moments: Missing Pieces.[citation needed]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn October 2007, Dean became the last Titanic survivor following the death of Barbara West Dainton, who died at age 96 in England.[7]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn December 2007, Dean criticised the BBC and its television programme Doctor Who for including an episode with a starship \\"cruise liner\\" called the Titanic, that was similar in appearance to the historical liner. Speaking from her nursing home, she said: \\"The Titanic was a tragedy which tore so many families apart. I lost my father and he lies on that wreck. I think it is disrespectful to make entertainment of such a tragedy.\\"[8] A spokeswoman for the show said: \\"No offence was intended. 'Voyage of the Damned' is set on a spaceship called The Titanic and not a boat.\\"[8]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn April 2008, Dean had accepted an invitation to speak in Southampton at an event commemorating the 96th anniversary of the sinking, but ill health resulting from a respiratory infection forced her to cancel.[9]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn December 2008, at age 96, Dean was forced to sell several of her family's possessions to pay for her private medical care following a broken hip. These included a letter sent to her mother from the Titanic Relief Fund, and a suitcase given to her and her mother in New York following the sinking. Their sale raised approximately S32,000. In February 2009, she announced that she would be selling several more items to pay for her increasing medical costs which she said exceeded S3,000 a month.[10]\\r\\n\\r\\nDean died of pneumonia on the morning of 31 May 2009, 97 years and seven weeks after the Titanic sailed, at a care home in Ashurst, Hampshire.[2][11] She was cremated, and on 24 October 2009, her ashes were scattered from a launch at the docks in Southampton where the Titanic set sail.[12]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn response to the escalating cost of Dean's healthcare, The Millvina Fund was set up in April 2009 by the Belfast, British, and International Titanic Societies with the exclusive aim of taking care of her nursing home bills. It was given a boost by the Irish author and campaigning journalist, Don Mullan, at the opening of his worldwide Nokia photographic exhibition, A Thousand Reasons for Living, (featuring a portrait of Dean) in Dublin on 22 April 2009.[13] Mullan introduced an additional portrait of Dean's hands, as she signed a card for a Titanic autograph collector, which he produced as a limited edition of 100 copies. He made the edition available at ?500 each and then challenged the director and stars of the film Titanic (1997) - James Cameron, Leonardo DiCaprio, and Kate Winslet - singer Celine Dion, and the corporations Sony Music, 20th Century Fox, and Paramount Pictures to match him euro-for-euro to support her with her bills.[14][15] DiCaprio and Winslet led the way with a joint contribution of US$20,000. Cameron and Dion donated US$10,000 each.","input":"Who was the last known survivor of the titanic?"},{"output":"University of Rochester","context":"The Memorial Art Gallery is the civic art museum of Rochester, New York. Founded in 1913, it is part of the University of Rochester and occupies the southern half of the University's former Prince Street campus. It is the focal point of fine arts activity in the region and hosts the biennial Rochester-Finger Lakes Exhibition and the annual Clothesline Festival.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Gallery is a memorial to James George Averell, a grandson of Hiram Sibley.[1] After Averell died at age 26, his mother, Emily S. Watson (by then the wife of James Sibley Watson), spent several years seeking a way to publicly commemorate him. Meanwhile, Rush Rhees, president of the University of Rochester, had been looking for benefactors to help him add to the University's campus, then located on Prince Street in the City of Rochester. Hiram Sibley had some 30 years previous funded the construction of the University's library which displayed part of Sibley's art collection on its upper floor for a time, but Rhees wanted to construct a dedicated art gallery. The Rochester Art Club, which was the focal point for art enthusiasts of the area and which had exhibited and taught at art venues of the time (Reynolds Arcade, the Bevier Memorial Building, and the Powers Block) supported the creation of the gallery.[2] Rhees assembled a board of managers, including the Art Club's president, George L. Herdle, in November 1912 and by the eighth of the following October, presided over the Gallery's opening. The inaugural exhibition consisted of paintings from dealers for sale, with the Gallery taking a 10% commission.[3] The most wealthy families immediately gifted their purchases to the gallery to start its permanent collection.\\r\\nExhibits in the early years of the Gallery consisted of loans from the private collections of George Eastman, the Sibleys, the Watsons, and other prominent Rochester families. Herdle labored mightily to keep the Gallery's walls filled with new works until his untimely death in 1922 at which point his daughter and University of Rochester graduate, Gertrude L. Herdle began what would become a 40-year career as the museum's director. Another daughter, Isabel C. Herdle, served in various curatorial roles beginning in 1932 after schooling at Radcliffe College, the Courtauld Institute of Art, and the Royal Institute of Technology in Stockholm and stints at the Fogg and the de Young museums.\\r\\nIn all of its years of operation, the Gallery has endured only two thefts:[6] During a 1927 Buddhist exhibition, a youth made off with a Tibetan banner on loan from a local family. Five years later,[7] after the youth had developed into a career fencer, police recovered the banner from his small apartment. Also, in 1978, someone pinched Picasso's Flowers in a Blue Vase during a busy Sunday afternoon; the painting found its way back to the Gallery within three weeks.\\r\\nThe Gallery, though sited on the University of Rochester's campus, existed as a separate organization from the University until 1935, when Alan Valentine renegotiated the 1912 charter.[8]\\r\\nToday, the Gallery is supported primarily by its membership, the University of Rochester, and public funds from Monroe County and the New York State Council on the Arts.[9]\\r\\nThe Gallery's permanent collection comprises some 11,000 objects, including works by Monet, Czanne, Matisse, Homer and Cassatt. Contemporary masters in the collection include Wendell Castle, Albert Paley and Helen Frankenthaler. Other notable works include:\\r\\nThe Gallery exhibited still photography and motion pictures until the 1949 opening of the George Eastman House.[12]\\r\\nThe Gallery began featuring arts and crafts of various immigrant groups starting in 1920, when a Homelands Exhibition was organized in Rochester's Exposition park for 10 days.[13] Director George Herdle organized local teams to solicit works from Rochester ethnic groups for the exhibition.\\r\\nBesides hosting exhibitions, classes, and educational programs, the Gallery puts on such major events as the biennial Rochester-Finger Lakes Exhibition and the annual Clothesline Festival.\\r\\nThe museum is located on the University of Rochester's former Prince Street campus and consists of the following structures:","input":"Who owns the memorial art gallery in rochester?"},{"output":"David Blatt","context":"The Cleveland Cavaliers are an American professional basketball team based in Cleveland, Ohio.

Although particular attention is paid to the four years of Chinese Communist Revolution from 1945 to 1949, the war actually started in August 1927, with the White Terror at the end of Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek's Northern Expedition, and essentially ended when major hostilities between the two sides ceased in 1950.[9] The conflict took place in two stages: the first between 1927 and 1937, and the second from 1946 to 1950, with the Second Sino-Japanese War in 1937ÿ1945 separating them. The war marked a major turning point in modern Chinese history, with the Communists gaining control of mainland China and establishing the People's Republic of China (PRC) in 1949, forcing the Republic of China (ROC) to retreat to Taiwan. It resulted in a lasting political and military standoff between the two sides of the Taiwan Strait, with the ROC in Taiwan and the PRC on mainland China with both officially claiming to be the legitimate government of all China.\\r\\nThe war represented an ideological split between the communist CPC and the nationalist KMT. Conflict continued intermittently until late 1937, when the two parties came together to form the Second United Front to counter the Imperial Japanese Army threat and to prevent the country from crumbling. Full-scale civil war in China resumed in 1946, a year after the end of hostilities with the Empire of Japan in September 1945. Four years later came the cessation of major military activity, with the newly founded People's Republic of China controlling mainland China (including the island of Hainan), and the Republic of China's jurisdiction restricted to Taiwan, Penghu, Quemoy, Matsu and several outlying islands.\\r\\nAs of April 2018 no armistice or peace treaty has ever been signed, and the debate continues as to whether the civil war has legally ended.[10] Relations between both sides, officially called the Cross-Strait relations, have been hindered by military threats and political and economic pressure, particularly over Taiwan's political status, with both governments officially adhering to the One-China policy. The PRC still actively claims Taiwan as part of its territory and continues to threaten the ROC with a military invasion if the ROC officially declares independence by changing its name to and gaining international recognition as the \\"Republic of Taiwan\\". The ROC, for its part, claims mainland China, and both parties continue the fight over diplomatic recognition. As of 2018[update] the war as such occurs on the political and economic fronts in the relations without actual military action. However, the two separate governments in China have close economic ties.[11]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nFollowing the collapse of the Qing Dynasty in the aftermath of the Xinhai Revolution, China fell into a brief period of civil war before Yuan Shikai assumed the presidency of the newly formed Republic of China.[11] The administration became known as the Beiyang Government, with its capital in Peking. After the death of Yuan Shikai in 1916, the following years were characterized by the power struggle between different cliques in the former Beiyang Army. In the meantime, the Kuomintang, led by Sun Yat-sen, created a new government in Guangzhou to resist the rule of Beiyang Government through a series of movements.\\r\\nSun's efforts to obtain aid from the Western countries were ignored, thus he turned to the Soviet Union in 1921. For political expediency, the Soviet leadership initiated a dual policy of support for both Sun and the newly established Communist Party of China, which would eventually found the People's Republic of China. Thus the struggle for power in China began between the KMT and the CPC.\\r\\nIn 1923, a joint statement by Sun and Soviet representative Adolph Joffe in Shanghai pledged Soviet assistance to China's unification.[12] The Sun-Joffe Manifesto was a declaration of cooperation among the Comintern, KMT and CPC.[12] Comintern agent Mikhail Borodin arrived in China in 1923 to aid in the reorganization and consolidation of the KMT along the lines of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union. The CPC joined the KMT to form the First United Front.[5]\\r\\nIn 1923, Sun sent Chiang Kai-shek, one of his lieutenants from his Tongmenghui days, for several months of military and political study in the Soviet capital Moscow.[13] By 1924, Chiang became the head of the Whampoa Military Academy, and rose to prominence as Sun's successor as head of the KMT.[13]\\r\\nThe Soviets provided the academy with much educational material, organization and equipment, including munitions.[13] They also provided education in many of the techniques for mass mobilization. With this aid, Sun was able to raise a dedicated \\"army of the party,\\" with which he hoped to defeat the warlords militarily. CPC members were also present in the academy, and many of them became instructors, including Zhou Enlai, who was made a political instructor.[14]\\r\\nCommunist members were allowed to join the KMT on an individual basis.[12] The CPC itself was still small at the time, having a membership of 300 in 1922 and only 1,500 by 1925.[15] As of 1923, the KMT had 50,000 members.[15]\\r\\nHowever, after Sun died in 1925, the KMT split into left- and right-wing movements. KMT members worried that the Soviets were trying to destroy the KMT from inside using the CPC. The CPC then began movements in opposition of the Northern Expedition, passing a resolution against it at a party meeting.\\r\\nThen, in March 1927, the KMT held its second party meeting where the Soviets helped pass resolutions against the Expedition and curbing Chiang's power. Soon, the KMT would be clearly divided.\\r\\nThroughout this time the Soviet Union had a large impact on the Communist Party of China. They sent money and spies to support the Chinese Communist Party. Without their support the communist party would have failed. There are documents showing of other communist parties in China at the time, one with as many as 10,000 members, but they all failed without support from the Soviet Union.[16]\\r\\nIn early 1927, the KMT-CPC rivalry led to a split in the revolutionary ranks. The CPC and the left wing of the KMT had decided to move the seat of the KMT government from Guangzhou to Wuhan, where communist influence was strong.[15] However, Chiang and Li Zongren, whose armies defeated warlord Sun Chuanfang, moved eastward toward Jiangxi. The leftists rejected Chiang's demand to eliminate Communist influence within KMT and Chiang denounced them for betraying Sun Yat-sen's Three Principles of the People by taking orders from the Soviet Union. According to Mao Zedong, Chiang's tolerance of the CPC in the KMT camp decreased as his power increased.[17]\\r\\nOn April 7, Chiang and several other KMT leaders held a meeting, during which they proposed that Communist activities were socially and economically disruptive and had to be undone for the Nationalist revolution to proceed. On April 12, in Shanghai, many Communist members in the KMT were purged through hundreds of arrests and executions[18] on the orders of General Bai Chongxi. The CPC referred to this as the April 12 Incident or Shanghai Massacre.[19] This incident widened the rift between Chiang and Wang Jingwei, another warlord who controlled the city of Wuhan.\\r\\nEventually, the left wing of the KMT also expelled CPC members from the Wuhan government, which in turn was toppled by Chiang Kai-shek. The KMT resumed its campaign against warlords and captured Beijing in June 1928.[20] Soon, most of eastern China was under the control of the Nanjing central government, which received prompt international recognition as the sole legitimate government of China. The KMT government announced, in conformity with Sun Yat-sen, the formula for the three stages of revolution: military unification, political tutelage, and constitutional democracy.[21]\\r\\nOn 1 August 1927, the Communist Party launched an uprising in Nanchang against the Nationalist government in Wuhan. This conflict led to the creation of the Red Army.[1][22] On August 4, the main forces of the Red Army left Nanchang and headed southwards for an assault on Guangdong. Nationalist forces quickly reoccupied Nanchang while the remaining members of the CPC in Nanchang went into hiding.[1] A CPC meeting on August 7 confirmed the objective of the party is to seize the political power by force, but the CPC was quickly suppressed the next day on August 8 by the Nationalist government in Wuhan led by Wang Jingwei. On August 14, Chiang Kai-shek announced his temporary retirement, as the Wuhan faction and Nanjing faction of the Kuomintang were allied once again with common goal of suppressing the Communist Party after the earlier split.[citation needed]\\r\\nAttempts were later made by the CPC to take the cities of Changsha, Shantou and Guangzhou. The Red Army consisting of mutinous former National Revolutionary Army (NRA) soldiers as well as armed peasants established control over several areas in southern China.[22] KMT forces continued to attempt to suppress the rebellions.[22] Then, in September, Wang Jingwei was forced out of Wuhan. September also saw an unsuccessful armed rural insurrection, known as the Autumn Harvest Uprising, led by Mao Zedong.[23] Borodin then returned to the USSR in October via Mongolia. In November, Chiang Kai-shek went to Shanghai and invited Wang to join him. On December 11, the CPC started the Guangzhou Uprising, establishing a soviet there the next day, but lost the city by December 13 to a counter-attack under the orders of General Zhang Fakui. On December 16, Wang Jingwei fled to France. There were now three capitals in China: the internationally recognized republic capital in Beijing, the CPC and left-wing KMT at Wuhan and the right-wing KMT regime at Nanjing, which would remain the KMT capital for the next decade.[24][25]\\r\\nThis marked the beginning of a ten-year armed struggle, known in mainland China as the \\"Ten-Year Civil War\\" (eʗM) which ended with the Xi'an Incident when Chiang Kai-shek was forced to form the Second United Front against invading forces from Japan. In 1930 the Central Plains War broke out as an internal conflict of the KMT. It was launched by Feng Yuxiang, Yan Xishan and Wang Jingwei. The attention was turned to root out remaining pockets of Communist activity in a series of five encirclement campaigns.[26] The first and second campaigns failed and the third was aborted due to the Mukden Incident. The fourth campaign (1932ÿ1933) achieved some early successes, but Chiang's armies were badly mauled when they tried to penetrate into the heart of Mao's Soviet Chinese Republic. During these campaigns, KMT columns struck swiftly into Communist areas, but were easily engulfed by the vast countryside and were not able to consolidate their foothold.\\r\\nFinally, in late 1934, Chiang launched a fifth campaign that involved the systematic encirclement of the Jiangxi Soviet region with fortified blockhouses.[27] Unlike previous campaigns in which they penetrated deeply in a single strike, this time the KMT troops patiently built blockhouses, each separated by about five miles, to surround the Communist areas and cut off their supplies and food sources.[27]\\r\\nIn October 1934 the CPC took advantage of gaps in the ring of blockhouses (manned by the forces of a warlord ally of Chiang Kai-shek's, rather than regular KMT troops) and broke out of the encirclement. The warlord armies were reluctant to challenge Communist forces for fear of losing their own men and did not pursue the CPC with much fervor. In addition, the main KMT forces were preoccupied with annihilating Zhang Guotao's army, which was much larger than Mao's. The massive military retreat of Communist forces lasted a year and covered what Mao estimated as 12,500?km (25,000 Li); it became known as the Long March.[28] The Long March was a military retreat taken on by the Communist Party of China, led by Mao Zedong to evade the pursuit or attack of the Kuomintang army. It consisted of a series of marches, during which numerous Communist armies in the south escaped to the north and west. Over the course of the march from Jiangxi the First Front Army, led by an inexperienced military commission, was on the brink of annihilation by Chiang Kai Shek's troops as their stronghold was in Jiangxi. The Communists, under the command of Mao Zedong and Zhou Enlai, \\"escaped in a circling retreat to the west and north, which reportedly traversed over 9,000 kilometers over 370 days\\". The route passed through some of the most difficult terrain of western China by traveling west, and then northwards towards Shaanxi. \\"In November 1935, shortly after settling in northern Shaanxi, Mao officially took over Zhou Enlai's leading position in the Red Army. Following a major reshuffling of official roles, Mao became the chairman of the Military Commission, with Zhou and Deng Xiaoping as vice-chairmen.\\" This marked Mao's position as the pre-eminent leader of the Party, with Zhou in second position to him.[citation needed]\\r\\nThe march ended when the CPC reached the interior of Shaanxi. Zhang Guotao's army, which took a different route through northwest China, was largely destroyed by the forces of Chiang Kai-shek and his Chinese Muslim allies, the Ma clique. Along the way, the Communist army confiscated property and weapons from local warlords and landlords, while recruiting peasants and the poor, solidifying its appeal to the masses. Of the 90,000ÿ100,000 people who began the Long March from the Soviet Chinese Republic, only around 7,000ÿ8,000 made it to Shaanxi.[29] The remnants of Zhang's forces eventually joined Mao in Shaanxi, but with his army destroyed, Zhang, even as a founding member of the CPC, was never able to challenge Mao's authority. Essentially, the great retreat made Mao the undisputed leader of the Communist Party of China.\\r\\nThe Kuomintang used Khampa troopswho were former banditsto battle the Communist Red Army as it advanced and to undermine local warlords who often refused to fight Communist forces to conserve their own strength. The KMT enlisted 300 \\"Khampa bandits\\" into its Consolatory Commission military in Sichuan, where they were part of the effort of the central government to penetrate and destabilize local Han warlords such as Liu Wenhui. The government was seeking to exert full control over frontier areas against the warlords. Liu had refused to battle the Communists in order to conserve his army. The Consolatory Commission forces were used to battle the Red Army, but they were defeated when their religious leader was captured by the Communists.[30]\\r\\nIn 1936, Zhou Enlai and Zhang Xueliang grew closer, with Zhang even suggesting that he join the CPC. However, this was turned down by the Comintern in the USSR. Later on, Zhou persuaded Zhang and Yang Hucheng, another warlord, to instigate the Xi'an Incident. Chiang was placed under house arrest and forced to stop his attacks on the Red Army, instead focusing on the Japanese threat.\\r\\nThe situation in China in 1929: After the Northern Expedition, the KMT had direct control over east and central China, while the rest of China proper as well as Manchuria was under the control of warlords loyal to the Nationalist government.\\r\\nMap showing the communist-controlled Soviet Zones of China during and after the encirclement campaigns.\\r\\nRoute(s) taken by Communist forces during the Long March.\\r\\nA Communist leader addressing survivors of the Long March.\\r\\nDuring Japan's invasion and occupation of Manchuria Chiang Kai-shek, who saw the CPC as a greater threat, refused to ally with them to fight against the Imperial Japanese Army. Chiang preferred to unite China by eliminating the warlords and CPC forces first. He believed that he was still too weak to launch an offensive to chase out Japan and that China needed time for a military build-up. Only after unification would it be possible for the KMT to mobilize a war against Japan. So he would rather ignore the discontent and anger among Chinese people at his policy of compromise with the Japanese, and ordered KMT generals Zhang Xueliang and Yang Hucheng to carry out suppression of the CPC; however, their provincial forces suffered significant casualties in battles with the Red Army.ref\\r\\nOn 12 December 1936, the disgruntled Zhang Xueliang and Yang Hucheng conspired to kidnap Chiang and force him into a truce with the CPC. The incident became known as the Xi'an Incident.[31] Both parties suspended fighting to form a Second United Front to focus their energies and fighting against the Japanese.[31] In 1937 Japan launched its full-scale invasion of China and its well-equipped troops overran KMT defenders in northern and coastal China.\\r\\nThe alliance of CPC and KMT was in name only.[32] Unlike the KMT troops, CPC shunned conventional warfare and instead engaged in guerrilla warfare against the Japanese. The level of actual cooperation and coordination between the CPC and KMT during World War II was at best minimal.[32] In the midst of the Second United Front, the CPC and the KMT were still vying for territorial advantage in \\"Free China\\" (i.e., areas not occupied by the Japanese or ruled by Japanese puppet governments such as Manchukuo and the Reorganized National Government of China).[32]\\r\\nThe situation came to a head in late 1940 and early 1941 when clashes between Communist and KMT forces intensified. In December 1940 Chiang demanded that the CPC's New Fourth Army evacuate Anhui and Jiangsu Provinces due to its provocation and harassment of KMT forces in this area. Under intense pressure, the New Fourth Army commanders complied. In 1941 they were ambushed by KMT forces during their evacuation, which led to several thousand deaths.[33] It also ended the Second United Front, which had been formed earlier to fight the Japanese.[33]\\r\\nDespite the intensified clashes between the CPC and KMT, countries such as the US and the Soviet Union attempted to prevent a disastrous civil war. After the New Fourth Army incident, US President Franklin D. Roosevelt sent special envoy Lauchlin Currie to talk with Chiang Kai-shek and KMT party leaders to express their concern regarding the hostility between the two parties, with Currie stating that the only ones to benefit from a civil war would be the Japanese. In 1941 the Soviet Union, with its closer alliance to the CPC, also sent an imperative telegram to Mao warning that the civil war would also make the situation easier for the Japanese military. Due to the international community's efforts, there was a temporary and superficial peace. In 1943 Chiang attacked the CPC with the propaganda piece China's Destiny, which questioned the CPC's power after the war, while the CPC strongly opposed Chiang's leadership and referred to his regime as fascist in an attempt to generate a negative public image. Both leaders knew that a deadly battle had begun between themselves.[34]\\r\\nIn general, developments in the Second Sino-Japanese War were to the advantage of the CPC, as its guerrilla war tactics had won them popular support within the Japanese-occupied areas, while the KMT's had to defend the country against the main Japanese campaigns to take over the country, since it was the legal Chinese government, and this proved costly to Chiang Kai-shek and his troops. In 1944 Japan launched its last major offensive, Operation Ichi-Go, against the KMT that resulted in the severe weakening of Chiang's forces.[35] Also, the CPC suffered fewer losses through their guerrilla tactics. By the end of the war, the Red Army had grown to more than 1.3 million members, with a separate militia of over 2.6 million members. About one hundred million people lived in CPC-controlled zones.\\r\\nUnder the terms of the Japanese unconditional surrender dictated by the United States, Japanese troops were ordered to surrender to KMT troops and not to the CPC, which was present in some of the occupied areas.[36] In Manchuria, however, where the KMT had no forces, the Japanese surrendered to the Soviet Union. Chiang Kai-shek ordered the Japanese troops to remain at their post to receive the Kuomintang and not surrender their arms to the Communists.[36]\\r\\nThe first post-war peace negotiation was attended by both Chiang Kai-shek and Mao Zedong in Chongqing from 28 August 1945 and concluded on 10 October 1945 with the signing of Double Tenth Agreement.[37] Both sides stressed the importance of a peaceful reconstruction, but the conference did not produce any concrete results.[37] Battles between the two sides continued even as peace negotiations were in progress, until the agreement was reached in January 1946. However, large campaigns and full-scale confrontations between the CPC and Chiang's troops were temporarily avoided.\\r\\nIn the last month of World War II in East Asia, Soviet forces launched the huge Manchurian Strategic Offensive Operation to attack the Japanese 2 million strong Kwantung Army in Manchuria and along the Chinese-Mongolian border.[38] This operation destroyed the fighting capability of Japan's Kwantung Army in just 3 weeks and left the USSR occupying all of Manchuria by the end of the war in a total power vacuum of local Chinese forces. Consequently, the 700,000 Japanese troops stationed in the region surrendered. Later in the year Chiang Kai-shek realized that he lacked the resources to prevent a CPC takeover of Manchuria following the scheduled Soviet departure.[39] He therefore made a deal with the Russians to delay their withdrawal until he had moved enough of his best-trained men and modern material into the region; however, the Russians refused permission for the Nationalist troops to traverse its territory. KMT troops were then airlifted by the US to occupy key cities in North China, while the countryside was already dominated by the CPC. On 15 November 1945, an offensive began with the intent of preventing the CPC from strengthening its already strong base.[40] The Soviets spent the extra time systematically dismantling the extensive Manchurian industrial base (worth up to $2 billion) and shipping it back to their war-ravaged country.[39]\\r\\nYang Kuisong, a Chinese historian, said that in 1945ÿ46, during the Soviet Red Army Manchurian campaign, Soviet leader Joseph Stalin commanded Marshal Rodion Malinovsky to give Mao Zedong most Imperial Japanese Army weapons that were captured.[41]\\r\\nChiang Kai-shek's forces pushed as far as Chinchow (Jinzhou) by 26 November 1945, meeting with little resistance. This was followed by a Communist offensive on the Shantung (Shandong) Peninsula that was largely successful, as all of the peninsula, except what was controlled by the US, fell to the Communists.[40] The truce fell apart in June 1946 when full-scale war between CPC and KMT forces broke out on June 26. China then entered a state of civil war that lasted more than three years.[42]\\r\\nBy the end of the Second Sino-Japanese War, the power of the Communist Party grew considerably. Their main force grew to 1.2 million troops, backed with additional militia of 2 million, totalling 3.2 million troops. Mao was very pleased with the force and decided to go on full rampage against the Kuomintang which he viewed as 'western lapdogs' that will sell out the country when requested by the Americans. Their \\"Liberated Zone\\" in 1945 contained 19 base areas, including one-quarter of the country's territory and one-third of its population; this included many important towns and cities. Moreover, the Soviet Union turned over all of its captured Japanese weapons and a substantial amount of their own supplies to the Communists, who received Northeastern China from the Soviets as well.[43]\\r\\nIn March 1946, despite repeated requests from Chiang, the Soviet Red Army under the command of Marshal Malinovsky continued to delay pulling out of Manchuria while Malinovsky secretly told the CPC forces to move in behind them, which led to full-scale war for the control of the Northeast. These favorable conditions also facilitated many changes inside the Communist leadership: the more radical hard-line faction who wanted full military bloodshed and warfare to take-over China finally gained the upper hand and defeated the careful opportunists.[44] Prior to giving control to Communist leaders, on March 27 Soviet diplomats requested a joint venture of industrial development with the Nationalist Party in Manchuria.[45]\\r\\nAlthough General Marshall stated that he knew of no evidence that the CPC was being supplied by the Soviet Union, the CPC was able to utilize a large number of weapons abandoned by the Japanese, including some tanks, but it was not until large numbers of well-trained KMT troops began surrendering and joining the Communist forces that the CPC was finally able to master the hardware.[46][47] However, despite the disadvantage in military hardware, the CPC's ultimate trump card was its land reform policy. The CPC continued to make the irresistible promise in the countryside to the massive number of landless and from hunger starving peasants that by fighting for the CPC they would be given their own land to grow crops once the victory was won.[48]\\r\\nThis strategy enabled the CPC to access an almost unlimited supply of manpower for both combat and logistical purposes, despite suffering heavy casualties throughout many of the war's campaigns, man power continued to pour in massively. For example, during the Huaihai Campaign alone the CPC was able to mobilize 5,430,000 peasants to fight against the KMT forces.[49]\\r\\nAfter the war with the Japanese ended, Chiang Kai-shek quickly moved KMT troops to newly liberated areas to prevent Communist forces from receiving the Japanese surrender.[43] The US airlifted many KMT troops from central China to the Northeast (Manchuria). President Harry Truman was very clear about what he described as \\"using the Japanese to hold off the Communists\\". In his memoirs he writes:\\r\\nIt was perfectly clear to us that if we told the Japanese to lay down their arms immediately and march to the seaboard, the entire country would be taken over by the Communists. We therefore had to take the unusual step of using the enemy as a garrison until we could airlift Chinese National troops to South China and send Marines to guard the seaports.\\r\\nUsing the pretext of \\"receiving the Japanese surrender\\", business interests within the KMT government occupied most of the banks, factories and commercial properties, which had previously been seized by the Imperial Japanese Army.[43] They also conscripted troops at a brutal pace from the civilian population and hoarded supplies, preparing for a resumption of war with the Communists. These hasty and harsh preparations caused great hardship for the residents of cities such as Shanghai, where the unemployment rate rose dramatically to 37.5%.[43]\\r\\nThe US strongly supported the Kuomintang forces. About 50,000 US soldiers were sent to guard strategic sites in Hupeh and Shandong. The US equipped and trained KMT troops, and transported Japanese and Koreans back to help KMT forces to occupy liberated zones as well as to contain Communist-controlled areas.[43] American aid included substantial amounts of mostly surplus military supplies; loans were made to the KMT.[51] Within less than two years after the Sino-Japanese War, the KMT had received $4.43 billion from the USmost of which was military aid.[43]\\r\\nSituation in 1947\\r\\nSituation in the fall of 1948\\r\\nSituation in the winter of 1948 and 1949\\r\\nSituation in April to October 1949\\r\\nAs postwar negotiations between the Nationalist government in Nanjing and the Communist Party failed, the civil war between these two parties resumed. This stage of war is referred to in mainland China and Communist historiography as the \\"War of Liberation\\" (Chinese: vؗMV; pinyin: Jifng Zhnzhng). On 20 July 1946, Chiang Kai-shek launched a large-scale assault on Communist territory in North China with 113 brigades (a total of 1.6 million troops).[43] This marked the first stage of the final phase in the Chinese Civil War.\\r\\nKnowing their disadvantages in manpower and equipment, the CPC executed a \\"passive defense\\" strategy. It avoided the strong points of the KMT army and was prepared to abandon territory in order to preserve its forces. In most cases the surrounding countryside and small towns had come under Communist influence long before the cities. The CPC also attempted to wear out the KMT forces as much as possible. This tactic seemed to be successful; after a year, the power balance became more favorable to the CPC. They wiped out 1.12 million KMT troops, while their strength grew to about two million men.[43]\\r\\nIn March 1947 the KMT achieved a symbolic victory by seizing the CPC capital of Yan'an.[52] The Communists counterattacked soon afterwards; on 30 June 1947 CPC troops crossed the Yellow River and moved to the Dabie Mountains area, restored and developed the Central Plain. At the same time, Communist forces also began to counterattack in Northeastern China, North China and East China.[43]\\r\\nBy late 1948, the CPC eventually captured the northern cities of Shenyang and Changchun and seized control of the Northeast after suffering numerous setbacks while trying to take the cities, with the decisive Liaoshen Campaign.[53] The New 1st Army, regarded as the best KMT army, was forced to surrender after the CPC conducted a brutal six-month siege of Changchun that resulted in more than 150,000 civilian deaths from starvation.[54]\\r\\nThe capture of large KMT units provided the CPC with the tanks, heavy artillery and other combined-arms assets needed to execute offensive operations south of the Great Wall. By April 1948 the city of Luoyang fell, cutting the KMT army off from Xi'an.[55] Following a fierce battle, the CPC captured Jinan and Shandong province on 24 September 1948. The Huaihai Campaign of late 1948 and early 1949 secured east-central China for the CPC.[53] The outcome of these encounters were decisive for the military outcome of the civil war.[53]\\r\\nThe Pingjin Campaign resulted in the Communist conquest of northern China. It lasted 64 days, from 21 November 1948, to 31 January 1949.[56] The PLA suffered heavy casualties while securing Zhangjiakou, Tianjin along with its port and garrison at Dagu and Beiping.[56] The CPC brought 890,000 troops from the northeast to oppose some 600,000 KMT troops.[55] There were 40,000 CPC casualties at Zhangjiakou alone. They in turn killed, wounded or captured some 520,000 KMT during the campaign.[56]\\r\\nAfter achieving decisive victory at Liaoshen, Huaihai and Pingjin campaigns, the CPC wiped out 144 regular and 29 non-regular KMT divisions, including 1.54 million veteran KMT troops, which significantly reduced the strength of Nationalist forces.[43] Stalin initially favored a coalition government in postwar China, and tried to persuade Mao to stop the CPC from crossing the Yangtze and attacking the KMT positions south of the river.[57] Mao rejected Stalin's position and on 21 April, Communist began the Yangtze River Crossing Campaign. On 23 April they captured the KMT's capital, Nanjing.[28] The KMT government retreated to Canton (Guangzhou) until October 15, Chongqing until November 25, and then Chengdu before retreating to Taiwan on December 10. By late 1949 the People's Liberation Army was pursuing remnants of KMT forces southwards in southern China, and only Tibet was left. In addition, the Ili Rebellion was a Soviet-backed revolt by the Second East Turkestan Republic against the KMT from 1944ÿ49, as the Mongolians in the People's Republic were in a border dispute with the Republic of China. A Chinese Muslim Hui cavalry regiment, the 14th Tungan Cavalry, was sent by the Chinese government to attack Mongol and Soviet positions along the border during the Pei-ta-shan Incident.[58][59]\\r\\nThe Kuomintang made several last-ditch attempts to use Khampa troops against the Communists in southwest China. The Kuomintang formulated a plan in which three Khampa divisions would be assisted by the Panchen Lama to oppose the Communists.[60] Kuomintang intelligence reported that some Tibetan tusi chiefs and the Khampa Su Yonghe controlled 80,000 troops in Sichuan, Qinghai and Tibet. They hoped to use them against the Communist army.[61]\\r\\nOn 1 October 1949, Mao Zedong proclaimed the founding of the People's Republic of China with its capital at Beiping, which was returned to the former name Beijing. Chiang Kai-shek and approximately two million Nationalist soldiers retreated from mainland China to the island of Taiwan in December after the PLA advanced into the Sichuan province. Isolated Nationalist pockets of resistance remained in the area, but the majority of the resistance collapsed after the fall of Chengdu on 10 December 1949, with some resistance continuing in the far south.[62]\\r\\nA PRC attempt to take the ROC-controlled island of Quemoy was thwarted in the Battle of Kuningtou, halting the PLA advance towards Taiwan.[63] In December 1949, Chiang proclaimed Taipei the temporary capital of the Republic of China and continued to assert his government as the sole legitimate authority in China.\\r\\nThe Communists' other amphibious operations of 1950 were more successful: they led to the Communist conquest of Hainan Island in April 1950, capture of Wanshan Islands off the Guangdong coast (MayÿAugust 1950), Zhoushan Island off Zhejiang (May 1950).[64]\\r\\nMost observers expected Chiang's government to eventually fall to the imminent invasion of Taiwan by the People's Liberation Army, and the US was initially reluctant in offering full support for Chiang in their final stand. US President Harry S. Truman announced on 5 January 1950 that the United States would not engage in any dispute involving the Taiwan Strait, and that he would not intervene in the event of an attack by the PRC.[65] The situation quickly changed after the onset of the Korean War in June 1950. This led to changing political climate in the US, and President Truman ordered the United States Seventh Fleet to sail to the Taiwan Strait as part of the containment policy against potential Communist advance.[66]\\r\\nIn June 1949 the ROC declared a \\"closure\\" of all mainland China ports and its navy attempted to intercept all foreign ships. The closure was from a point north of the mouth of Min River in Fujian to the mouth of the Liao River in Liaoning.[67] Since mainland China's railroad network was underdeveloped, north-south trade depended heavily on sea lanes. ROC naval activity also caused severe hardship for mainland China fishermen.\\r\\nAfter losing mainland China, a group of approximately 3,000 KMT Central soldiers retreated to Burma and continued launching guerrilla attacks into south China during the Kuomintang Islamic Insurgency in China (1950ÿ1958) and Campaign at the ChinaÿBurma Border. Their leader, Gen. Li Mi, was paid a salary by the ROC government and given the nominal title of Governor of Yunnan. Initially, the US supported these remnants and the Central Intelligence Agency provided them with military aid. After the Burmese government appealed to the United Nations in 1953, the US began pressuring the ROC to withdraw its loyalists. By the end of 1954 nearly 6,000 soldiers had left Burma and General Li declared his army disbanded. However, thousands remained, and the ROC continued to supply and command them, even secretly supplying reinforcements at times to maintain a base close to China.\\r\\nAfter the ROC complained to the United Nations against the Soviet Union for violating the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship and Alliance to support the CPC, the UN General Assembly Resolution 505 was adopted on 1 February 1952, condemning the Soviet Union.\\r\\nThough viewed as a military liability by the US, the ROC viewed its remaining islands in Fujian as vital for any future campaign to defeat the PRC and retake mainland China. On 3 September 1954, the First Taiwan Strait Crisis began when the PLA started shelling Quemoy and threatened to take the Dachen Islands in Zhejiang.[67] On 20 January 1955, the PLA took nearby Yijiangshan Island, with the entire ROC garrison of 720 troops killed or wounded defending the island. On January 24 of the same year, the United States Congress passed the Formosa Resolution authorizing the President to defend the ROC's offshore islands.[67] The First Taiwan Straits crisis ended in March 1955 when the PLA ceased its bombardment. The crisis was brought to a close during the Bandung conference.[67]\\r\\nThe Second Taiwan Strait Crisis began on 23 August 1958 with air and naval engagements between PRC and ROC forces, leading to intense artillery bombardment of Quemoy (by the PRC) and Amoy (by the ROC), and ended on November of the same year.[67] PLA patrol boats blockaded the islands from ROC supply ships. Though the US rejected Chiang Kai-shek's proposal to bomb mainland China artillery batteries, it quickly moved to supply fighter jets and anti-aircraft missiles to the ROC. It also provided amphibious assault ships to land supplies, as a sunken ROC naval vessel was blocking the harbor. On September 7 the US escorted a convoy of ROC supply ships and the PRC refrained from firing.\\r\\nThe Third Taiwan Strait Crisis in 1995ÿ96 escalated tensions between both sides when the PRC tested a series of missiles not far from Taiwan, although, arguably, Beijing ran the test to shift the 1996 presidential election vote in favor of the KMT, already facing a challenge from the opposition Democratic Progressive Party which did not agree with the \\"One China Policy\\" shared by the CPC and KMT.[68]\\r\\nOn 25 October 1971, the United Nations General Assembly admitted the PRC and expelled the ROC, which had been a founding member of the United Nations and was one of the five permanent members of the Security Council. Representatives of Chiang Kai-shek refused to recognise their accreditations as representatives of China and left the assembly. Recognition for the People's Republic of China soon followed from most other member nations, including the United States.[69]\\r\\nBy 1984 PRC and ROC began to de-escalate their diplomatic relations with each other, and cross-straits trade and investment has been growing ever since. The state of war was officially declared over by the ROC in 1991.[70] Despite the end of the hostilities, the two sides have never signed any agreement or treaty to officially end the war. According to Mao Zedong, there were three ways of \\"staving off imperialist intervention in the short term\\" during the continuation of the Chinese Revolution. The first was through a rapid completion of the military takeover of the country, and through showing determination and strength against \\"foreign attempts at challenging the new regime along its borders\\". The second was by \\"formalising a comprehensive military alliance with the Soviet Union\\", which would dedicate Soviet power to directly defending China against its enemies; this aspect became extensively significant given the backdrop of the start of the Cold War. And finally the regime had to \\"root out its domestic opponents?: the heads of secret societies, religious sects, independent unions, or tribal and ethic organisations.\\" By destroying the basis of domestic reaction, Mao believed a safer world for the Chinese revolution to spread in would come into existence.[71]\\r\\nUnder the new ROC president Lee Teng-hui, the Temporary Provisions Effective During the Period of Communist Rebellion was renounced in May 1991, thus ending the chances of the Kuomintang's conquest to retake the mainland.\\r\\nWith the election in 2000 of Democratic Progressive Party candidate Chen Shui-bian, a party other than the KMT gained the presidency for the first time in Taiwan. The new president did not share the Chinese nationalist ideology of the KMT and CPC. This led to tension between the two sides, although trade and other ties such as the 2005 Pan-Blue visit continued to increase.\\r\\nSince the election of President Ma Ying-jeou (KMT) in 2008, significant warming of relations has resumed between Taipei and Beijing, with high-level exchanges between the semi-official diplomatic organizations of both states such as the Chen-Chiang summit series. Although the Taiwan straits remain a potential flash point, regular direct air links were established in 2009.[11]\\r\\nHistorian Odd Arne Westad says the Communists won the Civil War because they made fewer military mistakes than Chiang Kai-shek and also because in his search for a powerful centralized government, Chiang antagonized too many interest groups in China. Furthermore, his party was weakened in the war against the Japanese. Meanwhile, the Communists targeted different groups, such as peasants, and brought them to its corner.[72]\\r\\nChiang wrote in his diary in June 1948 that the KMT had failed not because of external enemies but because of rot from within.[73]\\r\\nThe USSR generally supported Chiang's forces. Stalin distrusted Mao, tried to block him from leadership as late as 1942, and worried that Mao would become an independent rival force in world communism.[74]\\r\\nStrong American support for the Nationalists was hedged with the failure of the Marshall Mission, and then stopped completely mainly because of KMT corruption [75] (such as the notorious Yangtze Development Corporation [76] controlled by H.H. Kung and T. V. Soong's family) [77] and KMT's military setback in Northeast China.\\r\\nCommunist land reform policy promised poor peasants farmland from their landlords, ensuring popular support for the PLA.\\r\\nThe main advantage of the Chinese Communist Party was the \\"extraordinary cohesion\\" within the top level of its leadership. These skills were not only secured from defections that came about during difficult times but also coupled with \\"communications and top level debates over tactics\\". A big addition to this was the charismatic style of leadership of Mao Zedong which created a \\"unity of purpose\\" and a \\"unity of command\\" which the KMT lacked majorly. Apart from that the CPC had mastered the manipulation of local politics to their benefit, this was also derived from their propaganda skills that had also been decentralised successfully. By \\"portraying their opponents as enemies of all groups of Chinese\\" and itself as \\"defenders of the nation\\" and people (given the backdrop of the war with Japan).[78]\\r\\nIn the Chinese Civil War after 1945, the economy in the ROC areas collapsed because of hyperinflation and the failure of price controls by the ROC government and financial reforms; the Gold Yuan devaluated sharply in late 1948 [79] and resulted in the ROC government losing the support of the cities' middle classes. In the meantime, the Communists continued their relentless land reform (land redistribution) programs to win the support of the population in the countryside.\\r\\nDuring the war both the Nationalists and Communists carried out mass atrocities, with millions of non-combatants deliberately killed by both sides.[80] Benjamin Valentino has estimated atrocities in the Chinese Civil War resulted in the death of between 1.8 million and 3.5 million people between 1927 and 1949. Atrocities include deaths from forced conscription and massacres.[81][better?source?needed]\\r\\n Communist Party / ?People's Republic of China ( Red Army L  8th Route Army, N4A, etc. L  People's Liberation Army)","input":"What were the two opposing sides in china's civil war?"},{"output":"March 1856","context":"Gads Hill Place in Higham, Kent, sometimes spelt Gadshill Place and Gad's Hill Place, was the country home of Charles Dickens, the most successful British author of the Victorian era. Today the building is the independent Gad's Hill School. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe house was built in 1780 for a former Mayor of Rochester, Thomas Stephens, opposite the present Sir John Falstaff Public House.

Initially Dickens bought the house as an investment, intending to let it,[3] but changed his mind and used it instead as a country retreat, moving into the house in June 1857. \\r\\n\\r\\nDickens had bookshelves installed in his study at Gads Hill Place, some of which contained dummy books the titles of which he invented to reflect his own prejudices and opinions, including Hansard's Guide to Refreshing Sleep, History of a Short Chancery Suit in twenty-one volumes, Socrates on Wedlock, King Henry the Eighth's Evidences of Christianity, and the series The Wisdom of Our Ancestors: I Ignorance, II Superstition, III The Block, IV The Stake, V The Rack, VI Dirt, and VII Disease.

Dickens had it assembled on land he owned on the opposite side of the Rochester High Road.[6] Later, he had a brick-lined tunnel dug between the house's front lawn and the chalet. During the spring and summer months, Dickens worked on many of his later works in his study on the top floor of this Swiss chalet, including A Tale of Two Cities, Great Expectations, Our Mutual Friend and the unfinished The Mystery of Edwin Drood. The chalet has been preserved and was moved to the 'Dickens Centre' in Rochester High Street, Rochester, as a memorial to the writer.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe house remained Dickens's country home until his death in 1870, when he died from a stroke on a couch in the dining room of the house.

Designed by heraldic expert Peter Greenhill to reflect the many categories of Guild membership, it features: three escutcheons (shields) to represent artists, painters and stainers; a pair of compasses opened in chevron for building, construction and carpenters; a dovetail (separating the top third of the shield from the rest) to represent cabinetmaking, woodworking and joinery; and a gavel and chisel for masons and stoneworkers. The southern keep of Lewes Castle, which overlooks the Guilds headquarters, is featured above the helmet as the crest.\\r\\nWhile, for the most part, guilds as such do not exist, many trades continue the apprentice-journeyman-master model. Carpenters, electricians, pipefitters and plumbers are notable examples. There is also the United States Bartenders Guild, which, through a series of tests, grants bartenders the title of Master Mixologist. Even in academia, the tradition survives, with elementary, middle and high school completing general education; with post secondary degrees awarded in the Associates, Bachelor and Master levels; and PhD students as apprentices, post-docs and associate professors as journeymen and full professors as masters. [1] [2] [3]\\r\\nThe doctoral thesis which needs to be presented in order to get an academic degree, proving the student's proficiency in the chosen subject and whose quality is examined by existing lecturers, is in effect a form of the medieval masterpiece which needed to be prepared by anyone seeking to be accepted as a master in any professional guild.\\r\\nThe terms Master Mariner and harbormaster reflect the fact that the holders of such positions were originally Master craftsman in the Seamen's Guild. Further derived from \\"harbormaster\\" is \\"stationmaster\\", though guilds no longer existed when railways came into being.\\r\\nIn Germany, the master craftsman (Meister) is the highest professional qualification in crafts and is a state-approved grade. The certification is called Meisterbrief. The qualification includes theoretical and practical training in the craft as well as business and legal training. Additionally, it implies the qualification to train apprentices. These qualifications prepare the Meister for running their own business or alternatively for higher positions at a company. The status of master craftsmen is regulated in the German Gesetz zur Ordnung des Handwerks (Crafts and Trades Regulation Code).\\r\\nWhile privileged guilds have been abolished in Germany, the ranks of apprentice (Lehrling), journeyman (Geselle) and master craftsman have been retained even through modern times. For security-relevant crafts, e.g., electricians and chimney sweeps, any business in the trade has to be run by a master craftsman or has to employ at least one Meister.\\r\\nJourneymen and master craftsmen are by law automatically members of their regional chamber of crafts (Handwerkskammer), which is a self-governing public body. The chamber organizes vocational training and oversees the examination of the journeymen and masters.\\r\\nTo become a master craftsman, it is usually required to have completed vocational training in the craft in which the examination should be taken, which finishes with a final examination called Gesellenprfung (journeyman's examination), and to have practical experience of at least 3 to 5 years as a journeyman (Geselle). If these requirements are fulfilled, the candidate can take courses for the Meisterprfung (master craftman's examination). The duration of the courses takes 4 to 6 years depending on the craft. The examination includes theoretical, practical and oral parts and takes 5 to 7 days (depending on the craft). In some crafts, the creation of a masterpiece is also part of the examination.\\r\\nThe German Meister qualifies the holder to study for a bachelor's degree at University, whether the Meister holds a regular university entrance qualification or not.[1] According to the German Qualifications Framework, the Meisterbrief is at the same level as a bachelor's degree, even though it is not an academic degree and thus not directly comparable.[2]","input":"What is the definition of a master craftsman?"},{"output":"the journey of Dante through Hell, guided by the ancient Roman poet Virgil","context":"Inferno (pronounced?[im?f?rno]; Italian for \\"Hell\\") is the first part of Dante Alighieri's 14th-century epic poem Divine Comedy. It is followed by Purgatorio and Paradiso. The Inferno tells the journey of Dante through Hell, guided by the ancient Roman poet Virgil. In the poem, Hell is depicted as nine concentric circles of torment located within the Earth; it is the \\"realm ... of those who have rejected spiritual values by yielding to bestial appetites or violence, or by perverting their human intellect to fraud or malice against their fellowmen\\".[1] As an allegory, the Divine Comedy represents the journey of the soul toward God, with the Inferno describing the recognition and rejection of sin.[2]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCanto I\\r\\nThe poem begins on the night of Maundy Thursday on March 24 (or April 7) 1300 A.D., shortly before dawn of Good Friday.[3][4] The narrator, Dante himself, is thirty-five years old, and thus \\"midway in the journey of our life\\" (Nel mezzo del cammin di nostra vita[5]) ÿ half of the Biblical lifespan of seventy (Psalm 89:10, Vulgate; Psalm 90:10, KJV). The poet finds himself lost in a dark wood (selva oscura[6]), astray from the \\"straight way\\" (diritta via,[7] also translatable as \\"right way\\") of salvation. He sets out to climb directly up a small mountain, but his way is blocked by three beasts he cannot evade: a lonza[8] (usually rendered as \\"leopard\\" or \\"leopon\\"),[9] a leone[10] (lion), and a lupa[11] (she-wolf). The three beasts, taken from the Jeremiah 5:6, are thought to symbolize the three kinds of sin that bring the unrepentant soul into one of the three major divisions of Hell. According to John Ciardi, these are incontinence (the she-wolf); violence and bestiality (the lion); and fraud and malice (the leopard);[12] Dorothy L. Sayers assigns the leopard to incontinence and the she-wolf to fraud/malice.[13] It is now dawn of Good Friday, April 8, with the sun rising in Aries. The beasts drive him back despairing into the darkness of error, a \\"lower place\\" (basso loco[14]) where the sun is silent (l sol tace[15]). However, Dante is rescued by a figure who announces that he was born sub Iulio[16] (i.e. in the time of Julius Caesar) and lived under Augustus: it is the shade of the Roman poet Virgil, author of the Aeneid, a Latin epic.\\r\\nCanto II\\r\\nOn the evening of Good Friday, Dante is following Virgil but hesitates; Virgil explains how he has been sent by Beatrice, the symbol of Divine Love. Beatrice has been sent with prayers from the Virgin Mary (symbolic of compassion) and of Saint Lucia (symbolic of illuminating Grace). Rachel, symbolic of the contemplative life, also appears in the heavenly scene recounted by Virgil. The two of them then begin their journey to the underworld.\\r\\nCanto III\\r\\nDante passes through the gate of Hell, which bears an inscription ending with the famous phrase \\"Lasciate ogne speranza, voi ch'intrate\\",[17] most frequently translated as \\"Abandon all hope, ye who enter here.\\"[nb 1] Dante and his guide hear the anguished screams of the Uncommitted. These are the souls of people who in life took no sides; the opportunists who were for neither good nor evil, but instead were merely concerned with themselves. Among these Dante recognizes a figure implied to be Pope Celestine V, whose \\"cowardice (in selfish terror for his own welfare) served as the door through which so much evil entered the Church\\".[18] Mixed with them are outcasts who took no side in the Rebellion of Angels. These souls are forever unclassified; they are neither in Hell nor out of it, but reside on the shores of the Acheron. Naked and futile, they race around through the mist in eternal pursuit of an elusive, wavering banner (symbolic of their pursuit of ever-shifting self-interest) while relentlessly chased by swarms of wasps and hornets, who continually sting them.[19] Loathsome maggots and worms at the sinners' feet drink the putrid mixture of blood, pus, and tears that flows down their bodies. This symbolizes the sting of their guilty conscience and the repugnance of sin.[citation needed] This may also be seen as a reflection of the spiritual stagnation in which they lived.\\r\\nAfter passing through the vestibule, Dante and Virgil reach the ferry that will take them across the river Acheron and to Hell proper. The ferry is piloted by Charon, who does not want to let Dante enter, for he is a living being. Virgil forces Charon to take him by declaring, Vuolsi cos col dove si puote / ci che si vuole (\\"It is so willed there where is power to do / That which is willed\\"),[20] referring to the fact that Dante is on his journey on divine grounds. The wailing and blasphemy of the damned souls entering Charon's boat contrast with the joyful singing of the blessed souls arriving by ferry in the Purgatorio. The passage across the Acheron, however, is undescribed, since Dante faints and does not awaken until he is on the other side.\\r\\nCanto IV\\r\\nVirgil proceeds to guide Dante through the nine circles of Hell. The circles are concentric, representing a gradual increase in wickedness, and culminating at the centre of the earth, where Satan is held in bondage. The sinners of each circle are punished for eternity in a fashion fitting their crimes: each punishment is a contrapasso, a symbolic instance of poetic justice. For example, later in the poem, Dante and Virgil encounter fortune-tellers who must walk forward with their heads on backward, unable to see what is ahead, because they tried to see the future through forbidden means. Such a contrapasso \\"functions not merely as a form of divine revenge, but rather as the fulfilment of a destiny freely chosen by each soul during his or her life\\".[21] People who sinned, but prayed for forgiveness before their deaths are found not in Hell but in Purgatory, where they labour to become free of their sins. Those in Hell are people who tried to justify their sins and are unrepentant. Allegorically, the Inferno represents the Christian soul seeing sin for what it really is.\\r\\nDante's Hell is structurally based on the ideas of Aristotle, but with \\"certain Christian symbolisms, exceptions, and misconstructions of Aristotle's text\\".[22] Dante's three major categories of sin, as symbolized by the three beasts that Dante encounters in Canto I, are Incontinence, Violence and Bestiality, and Fraud and Malice.[22][23] Sinners punished for incontinence ÿ the lustful, the gluttonous, the hoarders and wasters, and the wrathful and sullen ÿ all demonstrated weakness in controlling their appetites, desires, and natural urges; according to Aristotle's Ethics, incontinence is less condemnable than malice or bestiality, and therefore these sinners are located in four circles of Upper Hell (Circles 2-5). These sinners endure lesser torments than do those consigned to Lower Hell, located within the walls of the City of Dis, for committing acts of violence and fraud ÿ the latter of which involves, as Dorothy L. Sayers writes, \\"abuse of the specifically human faculty of reason\\".[23] The deeper levels are organized into one circle for violence (Circle 7) and two circles for fraud (Circles 8 and 9). As a Christian, Dante adds Circle 1 (Limbo) to Upper Hell and Circle 6 (Heresy) to Lower Hell, making 9 Circles in total; incorporating the Vestibule of the Futile, this leads to Hell containing 10 main divisions.[23] This \\"9+1=10\\" structure is also found within the Purgatorio and Paradiso. Lower Hell is further subdivided: Circle 7 (Violence) is divided into three rings, Circle 8 (Simple Fraud) is divided into ten bolge, and Circle 9 (Complex Fraud) is divided into four regions. Thus, Hell contains, in total, 24 divisions.\\r\\nDante wakes up to find that he has crossed the Acheron, and Virgil leads him to the first circle of the abyss, Limbo, where Virgil himself resides. The first circle contains the unbaptized and the virtuous pagans, who, although not sinful, did not accept Christ. Dorothy L. Sayers writes, \\"After those who refused choice come those without opportunity of choice. They could not, that is, choose Christ; they could, and did, choose human virtue, and for that they have their reward.\\"[24] Limbo shares many characteristics with the Asphodel Meadows; thus, the guiltless damned are punished by living in a deficient form of Heaven. Without baptism (\\"the portal of the faith that you embrace\\"[25]) they lacked the hope for something greater than rational minds can conceive. When Dante asked if anyone has ever left Limbo, Virgil states that he saw Jesus (\\"a Mighty One\\") descend into Limbo and take Noah, Moses, Abraham, David, and Rachel (see Limbo of the Patriarchs) into his all-forgiving arms and transport them to Heaven as the first human souls to be saved. The event, known as the Harrowing of Hell, would have occurred in A.D. 33 or 34.\\r\\nDante encounters the poets Homer, Horace, Ovid, and Lucan, who include him in their number and make him \\"sixth in that high company\\".[26] They reach the base of a great Castle ÿ the dwelling place of the wisest men of antiquity ÿ surrounded by seven gates, and a flowing brook. After passing through the seven gates, the group comes to an exquisite green meadow and Dante encounters the inhabitants of the Citadel. These include figures associated with the Trojans and their descendants (the Romans): Electra (mother of Troy's founder Dardanus), Hector, Aeneas, Julius Caesar in his role as Roman general (\\"in his armor, falcon-eyed\\"),[27] Camilla, Penthesilea (Queen of the Amazons), King Latinus and his daughter, Lavinia, Lucius Junius Brutus (who overthrew Tarquin to found the Roman Republic), Lucretia, Julia, Marcia, and Cornelia Africana. Dante also views Saladin, a Muslim military leader known for his struggle against the Crusaders as well as his generous, chivalrous, and merciful conduct.\\r\\nDante next encounters a group of philosophers, including Aristotle with Socrates and Plato at his side, as well as Democritus, \\"Diogenes\\" (either Diogenes the Cynic or Diogenes of Apollonia), Anaxagoras, Thales, Empedocles, Heraclitus, and \\"Zeno\\" (either Zeno of Elea or Zeno of Citium). He sees the scientist Dioscorides; the mythical Greek poets Orpheus and Linus; and Roman statesmen Marcus Tullius Cicero and Seneca. Dante sees the Alexandrian geometer Euclid and Ptolemy, the Alexandrian astronomer and geographer, as well as the physicians Hippocrates and Galen. He also encounters Avicenna, a Persian polymath, and Averroes, a medieval Andalusian polymath known for his commentaries on Aristotle's works. Dante and Virgil depart from the four other poets and continue their journey.\\r\\nAlthough Dante implies that all virtuous non-Christians find themselves here, he later encounters two (Cato of Utica and Statius) in Purgatory and two (Trajan and Ripheus) in Heaven. In Purg. XXII, Virgil names several additional inhabitants of Limbo who were not mentioned in the Inferno.[28]\\r\\nCanto V\\r\\nDante and Virgil leave Limbo and enter the Second Circle ÿ the first of the circles of Incontinence ÿ where the punishments of Hell proper begin. It is described as \\"a part where no thing gleams\\".[29] They find their way hindered by the serpentine Minos, who judges all of those condemned for active, deliberately willed sin to one of the lower circles. Minos sentences each soul to its torment by wrapping his tail around himself a corresponding number of times. Virgil rebukes Minos, and he and Dante continue on.\\r\\nIn the second circle of Hell are those overcome by lust. These \\"carnal malefactors\\"[30] are condemned for allowing their appetites to sway their reason. These souls are buffeted back and forth by the terrible winds of a violent storm, without rest. This symbolizes the power of lust to blow one about needlessly and aimlessly: \\"as the lovers drifted into self-indulgence and were carried sway by their passions, so now they drift for ever. The bright, voluptuous sin is now seen as it is ÿ a howling darkness of helpless discomfort.\\"[31] Since lust involves mutual indulgence and is not, therefore, completely self-centered, Dante deems it the least heinous of the sins and its punishment is the most benign within Hell proper.[31][32] The \\"ruined slope\\"[33] in this circle is thought to be a reference to the earthquake that occurred after the death of Christ.\\r\\nIn this circle, Dante sees Semiramis, Dido, Cleopatra, Helen of Troy, Paris, Achilles, Tristan, and many others who were overcome by sexual love during their life. Dante comes across Francesca da Rimini, who married the deformed Giovanni Malatesta (also known as \\"Gianciotto\\") for political purposes but fell in love with his younger brother Paolo Malatesta; the two began to carry on an adulterous affair. Sometime between 1283 and 1286, Giovanni surprised them together in Francesca's bedroom and violently stabbed them both to death. Francesca explains:\\r\\nLove, which in gentlest hearts will soonest bloom\\r\\n???seized my lover with passion for that sweet body\\r\\n???from which I was torn unshriven to my doom.\\r\\nLove, which permits no loved one not to love,\\r\\n???took me so strongly with delight in him\\r\\n???that we are one in Hell, as we were above.\\r\\nLove led us to one death. In the depths of Hell\\r\\n???Ca?na waits for him who took our lives.\\"\\r\\n???This was the piteous tale they stopped to tell.[34]\\r\\nFrancesca further reports that she and Paolo yielded to their love when reading the story of the adultery between Lancelot and Guinevere in the Old French romance Lancelot du Lac. Francesca says, \\"Galeotto fu 'l libro e chi lo scrisse.\\"[35] The word \\"Galeotto\\" means \\"pander\\" but is also the Italian term for Gallehaut, who acted as an intermediary between Lancelot and Guinevere, encouraging them on to love. John Ciardi renders line 137 as \\"That book, and he who wrote it, was a pander.\\"[36] Inspired by Dante, author Giovanni Boccaccio invoked the name Prencipe Galeotto in the alternative title to The Decameron, a 14th-century collection of novellas. The English poet John Keats, in his sonnet \\"On a Dream,\\" imagines what Dante does not give us, the point of view of Paolo:\\r\\n... But to that second circle of sad hell,\\r\\nWhere 'mid the gust, the whirlwind, and the flaw\\r\\nOf rain and hail-stones, lovers need not tell\\r\\nTheir sorrows. Pale were the sweet lips I saw,\\r\\nPale were the lips I kiss'd, and fair the form\\r\\nI floated with, about that melancholy storm.[37]\\r\\nAs he did at the end of Canto III, Dante ÿ overcome by pity and anguish ÿ describes his swoon: \\"I fainted, as if I had met my death. / And then I fell as a dead body falls\\"[38]\\r\\nCanto VI\\r\\nIn the third circle, the gluttonous wallow in a vile, putrid slush produced by a ceaseless, foul, icy rain ÿ \\"a great storm of putrefaction\\"[39] ÿ as punishment for subjecting their reason to a voracious appetite. Cerberus (described as \\"il gran vermo\\", literally \\"the great worm\\", line 22), the monstrous three-headed beast of Hell, ravenously guards the gluttons lying in the freezing mire, mauling and flaying them with his claws as they howl like dogs. Virgil obtains safe passage past the monster by filling its three mouths with mud.\\r\\nDorothy L. Sayers writes that \\"the surrender to sin which began with mutual indulgence leads by an imperceptible degradation to solitary self-indulgence\\".[40] The gluttons grovel in the mud by themselves, sightless and heedless of their neighbors, symbolizing the cold, selfish, and empty sensuality of their lives.[40] Just as lust has revealed its true nature in the winds of the previous circle, here the slush reveals the true nature of sensuality ÿ which includes not only overindulgence in food and drink, but also other kinds of addiction.[41]\\r\\nIn this circle, Dante converses with a Florentine contemporary identified as Ciacco, which means \\"hog\\".[42] A character with the same nickname later appears in The Decameron of Giovanni Boccaccio.[43] Ciacco speaks to Dante regarding strife in Florence between the \\"White\\" and \\"Black\\" Guelphs, which developed after the Guelph/Ghibelline strife ended with the complete defeat of the Ghibellines. In the first of several political prophecies in the Inferno, Ciacco \\"predicts\\" the expulsion of the White Guelphs (Dante's party) from Florence by the Black Guelphs, aided by Pope Boniface VIII, which marked the start of Dante's long exile from the city. These events occurred in 1302, prior to when the poem was written but in the future at Easter time of 1300, the time in which the poem is set.[42]\\r\\nCanto VII\\r\\nThe Fourth Circle is guarded by a figure Dante names as Pluto: this is Plutus, the deity of wealth in classical mythology. Although the two are often conflated, he is a distinct figure from Pluto (Dis), the classical ruler of the underworld.[nb 2] At the start of Canto VII, he menaces Virgil and Dante with the cryptic phrase Pap Satn, pap Satn aleppe, but Virgil protects Dante from him.\\r\\nThose whose attitude toward material goods deviated from the appropriate mean are punished in the fourth circle. They include the avaricious or miserly (including many \\"clergymen, and popes and cardinals\\"),[44] who hoarded possessions, and the prodigal, who squandered them. The hoarders and spendthrifts joust, using as weapons great weights that they push with their chests:\\r\\nHere, too, I saw a nation of lost souls,\\r\\n???far more than were above: they strained their chests\\r\\n???against enormous weights, and with mad howls\\r\\nrolled them at one another. Then in haste\\r\\n???they rolled them back, one party shouting out:\\r\\n???\\"Why do you hoard?\\" and the other: \\"Why do you waste?\\"[45]\\r\\nRelating this sin of incontinence to the two that preceded it (lust and gluttony), Dorothy L. Sayers writes, \\"Mutual indulgence has already declined into selfish appetite; now, that appetite becomes aware of the incompatible and equally selfish appetites of other people. Indifference becomes mutual antagonism, imaged here by the antagonism between hoarding and squandering.\\"[46] The contrast between these two groups leads Virgil to discourse on the nature of Fortune, who raises nations to greatness and later plunges them into poverty, as she shifts, \\"those empty goods from nation unto nation, clan to clan\\".[47] This speech fills what would otherwise be a gap in the poem, since both groups are so absorbed in their activity that Virgil tells Dante that it would be pointless to try to speak to them ÿ indeed, they have lost their individuality and been rendered \\"unrecognizable\\"[48]\\r\\nIn the swampy, stinking waters of the river Styx ÿ the Fifth Circle ÿ the actively wrathful fight each other viciously on the surface of the slime, while the sullen (the passively wrathful) lie beneath the water, withdrawn, \\"into a black sulkiness which can find no joy in God or man or the universe\\".[46] At the surface of the foul Stygian marsh, Dorothy L. Sayers writes, \\"the active hatreds rend and snarl at one another; at the bottom, the sullen hatreds lie gurgling, unable even to express themselves for the rage that chokes them\\".[46] As the last circle of Incontinence, the \\"savage self-frustration\\" of the Fifth Circle marks the end of \\"that which had its tender and romantic beginnings in the dalliance of indulged passion\\".[46]\\r\\nCanto VIII\\r\\nPhlegyas reluctantly transports Dante and Virgil across the Styx in his skiff. On the way they are accosted by Filippo Argenti, a Black Guelph from the prominent Adimari family. Little is known about Argenti, although Giovanni Boccaccio describes an incident in which he lost his temper; early commentators state that Argenti's brother seized some of Dante's property after his exile from Florence.[49] Just as Argenti enabled the seizing of Dante's property, he himself is \\"seized\\" by all the other wrathful souls.\\r\\nWhen Dante responds \\"In weeping and in grieving, accursed spirit, may you long remain,\\"[50] Virgil blesses him with words used to describe Christ himself (Luke 11:27). Literally, this reflects the fact that souls in Hell are eternally fixed in the state they have chosen, but allegorically, it reflects Dante's beginning awareness of his own sin.[51]\\r\\nIn the distance, Dante perceives high towers that resemble fiery red mosques. Virgil informs him that they are approaching the City of Dis. Dis, itself surrounded by the Stygian marsh, contains Lower Hell within its walls.[52] Dis is one of the names of Pluto, the classical king of the underworld, in addition to being the name of the realm. The walls of Dis are guarded by fallen angels. Virgil is unable to convince them to let Dante and him enter, and Dante is threatened by the Furies (consisting of Alecto, Megaera, and Tisiphone) and Medusa.\\r\\nCanto IX\\r\\nAn angel sent from Heaven secures entry for the poets, opening the gate by touching it with a wand, and rebukes those who opposed Dante. Allegorically, this reveals the fact that the poem is beginning to deal with sins that philosophy and humanism cannot fully understand. Virgil also mentions to Dante how Erichtho sent him down to the lowest circle of Hell to bring back a spirit from there.[51]\\r\\nCanto X\\r\\nIn the sixth circle, heretics, such as Epicurus and his followers (who say \\"the soul dies with the body\\")[53] are trapped in flaming tombs. Dante holds discourse with a pair of Epicurian Florentines in one of the tombs: Farinata degli Uberti, a famous Ghibelline leader (following the Battle of Montaperti in September 1260, Farinata strongly protested the proposed destruction of Florence at the meeting of the victorious Ghibellines; he died in 1264 and was posthumously condemned for heresy in 1283); and Cavalcante de' Cavalcanti, a Guelph who was the father of Dante's friend and fellow poet, Guido Cavalcanti. The political affiliation of these two men allows for a further discussion of Florentine politics. In response to a question from Dante about the \\"prophecy\\" he has received, Farinata explains that what the souls in Hell know of life on earth comes from seeing the future, not from any observation of the present. Consequently, when \\"the portal of the future has been shut\\",[54] it will no longer be possible for them to know anything. Farinata explains that also crammed within the tomb are Emperor Frederick II, commonly reputed to be an Epicurean, and Ottaviano degli Ubaldini, to whom Dante refers to as il Cardinale.\\r\\nCanto XI\\r\\nDante reads an inscription on one of the tombs indicating it belongs to Pope Anastasius II ÿ although some modern scholars hold that Dante erred in the verse mentioning Anastasius (\\"Anastasio papa guardo, / lo qual trasse Fotin de la via dritta\\", lines 8-9), confusing the pope with the Byzantine emperor of the time, Anastasius I.[55][56][57][58] Pausing for a moment before the steep descent to the foul-smelling seventh circle, Virgil explains the geography and rationale of Lower Hell, in which the sins of violence (or bestiality) and fraud (or malice) are punished. In his explanation, Virgil refers to the Nicomachean Ethics and the Physics of Aristotle, with medieval interpretations. Virgil asserts that there are only two legitimate sources of wealth: natural resources (\\"Nature\\") and human labor and activity (\\"Art\\"). Usury, to be punished in the next circle, is therefore an offence against both; it is a kind of blasphemy, since it is an act of violence against Art, which is the child of Nature, and Nature derives from God.[59]\\r\\nVirgil then indicates the time through his unexplained awareness of the stars' positions. The \\"Wain\\", the Great Bear, now lies in the northwest over Caurus (the northwest wind). The constellation Pisces (the Fish) is just appearing over the horizon: it is the zodiacal sign preceding Aries (the Ram). Canto I notes that the sun is in Aries, and since the twelve zodiac signs rise at two-hour intervals, it must now be about two hours prior to sunrise: 4:00 A.M. on Holy Saturday, April 9.[59][60]\\r\\nCanto XII\\r\\nThe Seventh Circle, divided into three rings, houses the Violent. Dante and Virgil descend a jumble of rocks that had once formed a cliff to reach the Seventh Circle from the Sixth Circle, having first to evade the Minotaur (L'infamia di Creti, \\"the Infamy of Crete\\", line 12); at the sight of them, the Minotaur gnaws his flesh. Virgil assures the monster that Dante is not its hated enemy, Theseus. This causes the Minotaur to charge them as Dante and Virgil swiftly enter the seventh circle. Virgil explains the presence of shattered stones around them: they resulted from the great earthquake that shook the earth at the moment of Christ's death (Matt. 27:51), at the time of the Harrowing of Hell. Ruins resulting from the same shock were previously seen at the beginning of Upper Hell (the entrance of the Second Circle, Canto V).\\r\\nCanto XIII\\r\\nCanto XIV\\r\\nCanto XV\\r\\nProtected by the powers of the boiling rivulet, Dante and Virgil progress across the burning plain. They pass a roving group of Sodomites, and Dante, to his surprise, recognizes Brunetto Latini. Dante addresses Brunetto with deep and sorrowful affection, \\"paying him the highest tribute offered to any sinner in the Inferno\\",[66] thus refuting suggestions that Dante only placed his enemies in Hell.[67] Dante has great respect for Brunetto and feels spiritual indebtedness to him and his works (\\"you taught me how man makes himself eternal; / and while I live, my gratitude for that / must always be apparent in my words\\"),[68] Brunetto prophesies Dante's bad treatment by the Florentines. He also identifies other sodomites, including Priscian, Francesco d'Accorso, and Bishop Andrea de' Mozzi.\\r\\nCanto XVI\\r\\nThe Poets begin to hear the waterfall that plunges over the Great Cliff into the Eighth Circle when three shades break from their company and greet them. They are Iacopo Rusticucci, Guido Guerra, and Tegghiaio Aldobrandi ÿ all Florentines much admired by Dante. Rusticucci blames his \\"savage wife\\" for his torments. The sinners ask for news of Florence, and Dante laments the current state of the city. At the top of the falls, at Virgil's order, Dante removes a cord from about his waist and Virgil drops it over the edge; as if in answer, a large, distorted shape swims up through the filthy air of the abyss.\\r\\nCanto XVII\\r\\nThe creature is Geryon, the Monster of Fraud; Virgil announces that they must fly down from the cliff on the monster's back. Dante goes alone to examine the Usurers: he does not recognize them, but each has a heraldic device emblazoned on a leather purse around his neck (\\"On these their streaming eyes appeared to feast\\"[69]). The coats of arms indicate that they came from prominent Florentine families; they indicate the presence of Catello di Rosso Gianfigliazzi, Ciappo Ubriachi, the Paduan Reginaldo degli Scrovegni (who predicts that his fellow Paduan Vitaliano di Iacopo Vitaliani will join him here), and Giovanni di Buiamonte. Dante then rejoins Virgil and, both mounted atop Geryon's back, the two begin their descent from the great cliff in the Eighth Circle: the Hell of the Fraudulent and Malicious.\\r\\nGeryon, the winged monster who allows Dante and Virgil to descend a vast cliff to reach the Eighth Circle, was traditionally represented as a giant with three heads and three conjoined bodies.[70] Dante's Geryon, meanwhile, is an image of fraud,[71] combining human, bestial, and reptilian elements: Geryon is a \\"monster with the general shape of a wyvern but with the tail of a scorpion, hairy arms, a gaudily-marked reptilian body, and the face of a just and honest man\\".[72] The pleasant human face on this grotesque body evokes the insincere fraudster whose intentions \\"behind the face\\" are all monstrous, cold-blooded, and stinging with poison.\\r\\nCanto XVIII\\r\\nDante now finds himself in the Eighth Circle, called Malebolge (\\"Evil Ditches\\"): the upper half of the Hell of the Fraudulent and Malicious. The Eighth Circle is a large funnel of stone shaped like an amphitheatre around which run a series of ten deep, narrow, concentric ditches or trenches called bolge (singular: bolgia). Within these ditches are punished those guilty of Simple Fraud. From the foot of the Great Cliff to the Well (which forms the neck of the funnel) are large spurs of rock, like umbrella ribs or spokes, which serve as bridges over the ten ditches. Dorothy L. Sayers writes that the Malebolge is, \\"the image of the City in corruption: the progressive disintegration of every social relationship, personal and public. Sexuality, ecclesiastical and civil office, language, ownership, counsel, authority, psychic influence, and material interdependence ÿ all the media of the community's interchange are perverted and falsified\\".[73]\\r\\nCanto XIX\\r\\nCanto XX\\r\\nCanto XXI\\r\\nCanto XXII\\r\\nOne of the grafters, an unidentified Navarrese (identified by early commentators as Ciampolo) is seized by the demons, and Virgil questions him. The sinner speaks of his fellow grafters, Friar Gomita (a corrupt friar in Gallura eventually hanged by Nino Visconti (see Purg. VIII) for accepting bribes to let prisoners escape) and Michel Zanche (a corrupt Vicar of Logodoro under King Enzo of Sardinia). He offers to lure some of his fellow sufferers into the hands of the demons, and when his plan is accepted he escapes back into the pitch. Alichino and Calcabrina start a brawl in mid-air and fall into the pitch themselves, and Barbariccia organizes a rescue party. Dante and Virgil take advantage of the confusion to slip away.\\r\\nCanto XXIII\\r\\nCanto XXIV\\r\\nCanto XXV\\r\\nVanni hurls an obscenity at God and the serpents swarm over him. The centaur Cacus arrives to punish the wretch; he has a fire-breathing dragon on his shoulders and snakes covering his equine back. (In Roman mythology, Cacus, the monstrous, fire-breathing son of Vulcan, was killed by Hercules for raiding the hero's cattle; in Aeneid VIII, 193-267, Virgil did not describe him as a centaur). Dante then meets five noble thieves of Florence and observes their various transformations. Agnello Brunelleschi, in human form, is merged with the six-legged serpent that is Cianfa Donati. A figure named Buoso (perhaps either Buoso degli Abati or Buoso Donati, the latter of whom is mentioned in Inf. XXX.44) first appears as a man, but exchanges forms with Francesco de' Cavalcanti, who bites Buoso in the form of a four-footed serpent. Puccio Sciancato remains unchanged for the time being.\\r\\nCanto XXVI\\r\\n'Brothers,' I said, 'o you, who having crossed\\r\\n???a hundred thousand dangers, reach the west,\\r\\n???to this brief waking-time that still is left\\r\\nunto your senses, you must not deny\\r\\n???experience of that which lies beyond\\r\\n???the sun, and of the world that is unpeopled.\\r\\nConsider well the seed that gave you birth:\\r\\n???you were not made to live your lives as brutes,\\r\\n???but to be followers of worth and knowledge.'[89]\\r\\nCanto XXVII\\r\\nDante is approached by Guido da Montefeltro, head of the Ghibellines of Romagna, asking for news of his country. Dante replies with a tragic summary of the current state of the cities of Romagna. Guido then recounts his life: he advised Pope Boniface VIII to offer a false amnesty to the Colonna family, who, in 1297, had walled themselves inside the castle of Palestrina in the Lateran. When the Colonna accepted the terms and left the castle, the Pope razed it to the ground and left them without a refuge. Guido describes how St. Francis, founder of the Franciscan order, came to take his soul to Heaven, only to have a devil assert prior claim. Although Boniface had absolved Guido in advance for his evil advice, the devil points out the invalidity: absolution requires contrition, and a man cannot be contrite for a sin at the same time that he is intending to commit it[90]\\r\\nCanto XXVIII\\r\\nCanto XXIX\\r\\nCanto XXX\\r\\nSuddenly, two spirits ÿ Gianni Schicchi de' Cavalcanti and Myrrha, both punished as Imposters (Falsifiers of Persons) ÿ run rabid through the pit. Schicchi sinks his tusks into Capocchio's neck and drags him away like prey. Griffolino explains how Myrrha disguised herself to commit incest with her father King Cinyras, while Schicchi impersonated the dead Buoso Donati to dictate a will giving himself several profitable bequests. Dante then encounters Master Adam of Brescia, one of the Counterfeiters (Falsifiers of Money): for manufacturing Florentine florins of twenty-one (rather than twenty-four) carat gold, he was burned at the stake in 1281. He is punished by a loathsome dropsy-like disease, which gives him a bloated stomach, prevents him from moving, and an eternal, unbearable thirst. Master Adam points out two sinners of the fourth class, the Perjurers (Falsifiers of Words). These are Potiphar's wife (punished for her false accusation of Joseph, Gen. 39:7-19) and Sinon, the Achaean spy who lied to the Trojans to convince them to take the Trojan Horse into their city (Aeneid II, 57-194); Sinon is here rather than in Bolgia 8 because his advice was false as well as evil. Both suffer from a burning fever. Master Adam and Sinon exchange abuse, which Dante watches until he is rebuked by Virgil. As a result of his shame and repentance, Dante is forgiven by his guide. Sayers remarks that the descent through Malebolge \\"began with the sale of the sexual relationship, and went on to the sale of Church and State; now, the very money is itself corrupted, every affirmation has become perjury, and every identity a lie\\"[94] so that every aspect of social interaction has been progressively destroyed.\\r\\nCanto XXXI\\r\\nDante and Virgil approach the Central Well, at the bottom of which lies the Ninth and final Circle of Hell. The classical and biblical Giants ÿ who perhaps symbolize pride and other spiritual flaws lying behind acts of treachery[95] ÿ stand perpetual guard inside the well-pit, their legs embedded in the banks of the Ninth Circle while their upper halves rise above the rim and can be visible from the Malebolge.[96] Dante initially mistakes them for great towers of a city. Among the Giants, Virgil identifies Nimrod (who tried to build the Tower of Babel; he shouts out the unintelligible Raphl mai amcche zab almi); Ephialtes (who with his brother Otus tried to storm Olympus during the Gigantomachy; he has his arms chained up) and Briareus (who Dante claimed to have challenged the Gods); and Tityos and Typhon, who insulted Jupiter. Also here is the Giant Antaeus, who did not join in the rebellion against the Olympian Gods and therefore is not chained. At Virgil's persuasion, Antaeus takes the Poets in his large palm and lowers them gently to the final level of Hell.\\r\\nCanto XXXII\\r\\nAt the base of the well, Dante finds himself within a large frozen lake: Cocytus, the Ninth Circle of Hell. Trapped in the ice, each according to his guilt, are punished sinners guilty of treachery against those with whom they had special relationships. The lake of ice is divided into four concentric rings (or \\"rounds\\") of traitors corresponding, in order of seriousness, to betrayal of family ties, betrayal of community ties, betrayal of guests, and betrayal of lords. This is in contrast to the popular image of Hell as fiery; as Ciardi writes, \\"The treacheries of these souls were denials of love (which is God) and of all human warmth. Only the remorseless dead center of the ice will serve to express their natures. As they denied God's love, so are they furthest removed from the light and warmth of His Sun. As they denied all human ties, so are they bound only by the unyielding ice.\\"[97] This final, deepest level of hell is reserved for traitors, betrayers and oathbreakers (its most famous inmate is Judas Iscariot).\\r\\nCanto XXXIII\\r\\nThe gnawing sinner tells his story: he is Count Ugolino, and the head he gnaws belongs to Archbishop Ruggieri. In \\"the most pathetic and dramatic passage of the Inferno\\",[99] Ugolino describes how he conspired with Ruggieri in 1288 to oust his nephew and take control over the Guelphs of Pisa. However, as soon as Nino was gone, the Archbishop, sensing the Guelphs' weakened position, turned on Ugolino and imprisoned him with his sons and grandsons in the Torre dei Gualandi. In March 1289, the Archbishop condemned the prisoners to death by starvation in the tower.\\r\\nCanto XXXIV\\r\\nIn the very centre of Hell, condemned for committing the ultimate sin (personal treachery against God), is the Devil, referred to by Virgil as Dis (the Roman god of the underworld; the name \\"Dis\\" was often used for Pluto in antiquity, such as in Virgil's Aeneid). The arch-traitor, Lucifer was once held by God to be fairest of the angels before his pride led him to rebel against God, resulting in his expulsion from Heaven. Lucifer is a giant, terrifying beast trapped waist-deep in the ice, fixed and suffering. He has three faces, each a different color: one red (the middle), one a pale yellow (the right), and one black (the left):\\r\\n... he had three faces: one in front bloodred;\\r\\nand then another two that, just above\\r\\n???the midpoint of each shoulder, joined the first;\\r\\n???and at the crown, all three were reattached;\\r\\nthe right looked somewhat yellow, somewhat white;\\r\\n???the left in its appearance was like those\\r\\n???who come from where the Nile, descending, flows.[104]\\r\\nDorothy L. Sayers notes that Satan's three faces are thought by some to suggest his control over the three human races: red for the Europeans (from Japheth), yellow for the Asiatic (from Shem), and black for the African (the race of Ham).[105] All interpretations recognize that the three faces represent a fundamental perversion of the Trinity: Satan is impotent, ignorant, and full of hate, in contrast to the all-powerful, all-knowing, and all-loving nature of God.[105] Lucifer retains his six wings (he originally belonged to the angelic order of Seraphim, described in Isaiah 6:2), but these are now dark, bat-like, and futile: the icy wind that emanates from the beating of Lucifer's wings only further ensures his own imprisonment in the frozen lake. He weeps from his six eyes, and his tears mix with bloody froth and pus as they pour down his three chins. Each face has a mouth that chews eternally on a prominent traitor. Marcus Junius Brutus and Gaius Cassius Longinus dangle with their feet in the left and right mouths, respectively, for their involvement in the assassination of Julius Caesar (March 15, 44 BC) ÿ an act which, to Dante, represented the destruction of a unified Italy and the killing of the man who was divinely appointed to govern the world.[105] In the central, most vicious mouth is Judas Iscariot, the apostle who betrayed Christ. Judas is receiving the most horrifying torture of the three traitors: his head is gnawed inside Lucifer's mouth while his back is forever flayed and shredded by Lucifer's claws. According to Dorothy L. Sayers, \\"just as Judas figures treason against God, so Brutus and Cassius figure treason against Man-in-Society; or we may say that we have here the images of treason against the Divine and the Secular government of the world\\".[105]\\r\\nAt about 6:00 p.m. on Saturday evening, Virgil and Dante begin their escape from Hell by clambering down Satan's ragged fur, feet-first. When they reach Satan's genitalia, the poets pass through the center of the universe and of gravity from the Northern Hemisphere of land to the Southern Hemisphere of water. When Virgil changes direction and begins to climb \\"upward\\" towards the surface of the Earth at the antipodes, Dante, in his confusion, initially believes they are returning to Hell. Virgil indicates that the time is halfway between the canonical hours of Prime (6 a.m.) and Terce (9 a.m.) ÿ that is, 7:30 a.m. of the same Holy Saturday which was just about to end. Dante is confused as to how, after about an hour and a half of climbing, it is now apparently morning. Virgil explains that as a result of passing through the Earth's center into the Southern Hemisphere, which is twelve hours ahead of Jerusalem, the central city of the Northern Hemisphere (where, therefore, it is currently 7:30 p.m.).\\r\\nVirgil goes on to explain how the Southern Hemisphere was once covered with dry land, but the land recoiled in horror to the north when Lucifer fell from Heaven and was replaced by the ocean. Meanwhile, the inner rock Lucifer displaced as he plunged into the center of the earth rushed upwards to the surface of the Southern Hemisphere to avoid contact with him, forming the Mountain of Purgatory. This mountain ÿ the only land mass in the waters of the Southern Hemisphere ÿ rises above the surface at a point directly opposite Jerusalem. The poets then ascend a narrow chasm of rock through the \\"space contained between the floor formed by the convex side of Cocytus and the underside of the earth above,\\"[106] moving in opposition to Lethe, the river of oblivion, which flows down from the summit of Mount Purgatory. The poets finally emerge a little before dawn on the morning of Easter Sunday (April 10, 1300 A.D.) beneath a sky studded with stars.","input":"What is the story of dante's inferno?"},{"output":"20.95%","context":"The atmosphere of Earth is the layer of gases, commonly known as air, that surrounds the planet Earth and is retained by Earth's gravity. The atmosphere of Earth protects life on Earth by absorbing ultraviolet solar radiation, warming the surface through heat retention (greenhouse effect), and reducing temperature extremes between day and night (the diurnal temperature variation).\\r\\nBy volume, dry air contains 78.09% nitrogen, 20.95% oxygen,[1] 0.93% argon, 0.04% carbon dioxide, and small amounts of other gases. Air also contains a variable amount of water vapor, on average around 1% at sea level, and 0.4% over the entire atmosphere. Air content and atmospheric pressure vary at different layers, and air suitable for use in photosynthesis by terrestrial plants and breathing of terrestrial animals is found only in Earth's troposphere and in artificial atmospheres.\\r\\nThe atmosphere has a mass of about 5.15G1018?kg,[2] three quarters of which is within about 11?km (6.8?mi; 36,000?ft) of the surface. The atmosphere becomes thinner and thinner with increasing altitude, with no definite boundary between the atmosphere and outer space. The Krmn line, at 100?km (62?mi), or 1.57% of Earth's radius, is often used as the border between the atmosphere and outer space. Atmospheric effects become noticeable during atmospheric reentry of spacecraft at an altitude of around 120?km (75?mi). Several layers can be distinguished in the atmosphere, based on characteristics such as temperature and composition.\\r\\nThe study of Earth's atmosphere and its processes is called atmospheric science (aerology). Early pioneers in the field include Lon Teisserenc de Bort and Richard Assmann.[3]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe three major constituents of air, and therefore of Earth's atmosphere, are nitrogen, oxygen, and argon. Water vapor accounts for roughly 0.25% of the atmosphere by mass. The concentration of water vapor (a greenhouse gas) varies significantly from around 10 ppm by volume in the coldest portions of the atmosphere to as much as 5% by volume in hot, humid air masses, and concentrations of other atmospheric gases are typically quoted in terms of dry air (without water vapor).[4] The remaining gases are often referred to as trace gases,[5] among which are the greenhouse gases, principally carbon dioxide, methane, nitrous oxide, and ozone. Filtered air includes trace amounts of many other chemical compounds. Many substances of natural origin may be present in locally and seasonally variable small amounts as aerosols in an unfiltered air sample, including dust of mineral and organic composition, pollen and spores, sea spray, and volcanic ash. Various industrial pollutants also may be present as gases or aerosols, such as chlorine (elemental or in compounds), fluorine compounds and elemental mercury vapor. Sulfur compounds such as hydrogen sulfide and sulfur dioxide (SO2) may be derived from natural sources or from industrial air pollution.\\r\\n(A) volume fraction is equal to mole fraction for ideal gas only,\\r\\n????also see volume (thermodynamics)\\r\\n(B) ppmv: parts per million by volume\\r\\n(C) Water vapor is about 0.25% by mass over full atmosphere\\r\\n(D) Water vapor strongly varies locally[4]\\r\\nThe relative concentration of gasses remains constant until about 10,000?m (33,000?ft).[8]\\r\\nIn general, air pressure and density decrease with altitude in the atmosphere. However, temperature has a more complicated profile with altitude, and may remain relatively constant or even increase with altitude in some regions (see the temperature section, below). Because the general pattern of the temperature/altitude profile is constant and measurable by means of instrumented balloon soundings, the temperature behavior provides a useful metric to distinguish atmospheric layers. In this way, Earth's atmosphere can be divided (called atmospheric stratification) into five main layers. Excluding the exosphere, the atmosphere has four primary layers, which are the troposphere, stratosphere, mesosphere, and thermosphere.[9] From highest to lowest, the five main layers are:\\r\\nThe exosphere is the outermost layer of Earth's atmosphere (i.e. the upper limit of the atmosphere). It extends from the exobase, which is located at the top of the thermosphere at an altitude of about 700?km above sea level, to about 10,000?km (6,200?mi; 33,000,000?ft) where it merges into the solar wind.\\r\\nThis layer is mainly composed of extremely low densities of hydrogen, helium and several heavier molecules including nitrogen, oxygen and carbon dioxide closer to the exobase. The atoms and molecules are so far apart that they can travel hundreds of kilometers without colliding with one another. Thus, the exosphere no longer behaves like a gas, and the particles constantly escape into space. These free-moving particles follow ballistic trajectories and may migrate in and out of the magnetosphere or the solar wind.\\r\\nThe exosphere is located too far above Earth for any meteorological phenomena to be possible. However, the aurora borealis and aurora australis sometimes occur in the lower part of the exosphere, where they overlap into the thermosphere. The exosphere contains most of the satellites orbiting Earth.\\r\\nThe thermosphere is the second-highest layer of Earth's atmosphere. It extends from the mesopause (which separates it from the mesosphere) at an altitude of about 80?km (50?mi; 260,000?ft) up to the thermopause at an altitude range of 500ÿ1000?km (310ÿ620?mi; 1,600,000ÿ3,300,000?ft). The height of the thermopause varies considerably due to changes in solar activity.[10] Because the thermopause lies at the lower boundary of the exosphere, it is also referred to as the exobase. The lower part of the thermosphere, from 80 to 550 kilometres (50 to 342?mi) above Earth's surface, contains the ionosphere.\\r\\nThe temperature of the thermosphere gradually increases with height. Unlike the stratosphere beneath it, wherein a temperature inversion is due to the absorption of radiation by ozone, the inversion in the thermosphere occurs due to the extremely low density of its molecules. The temperature of this layer can rise as high as 1500?C (2700?F), though the gas molecules are so far apart that its temperature in the usual sense is not very meaningful. The air is so rarefied that an individual molecule (of oxygen, for example) travels an average of 1 kilometre (0.62?mi; 3300?ft) between collisions with other molecules.[12] Although the thermosphere has a high proportion of molecules with high energy, it would not feel hot to a human in direct contact, because its density is too low to conduct a significant amount of energy to or from the skin.\\r\\nThis layer is completely cloudless and free of water vapor. However, non-hydrometeorological phenomena such as the aurora borealis and aurora australis are occasionally seen in the thermosphere. The International Space Station orbits in this layer, between 350 and 420?km (220 and 260?mi).\\r\\nThe mesosphere is the third highest layer of Earth's atmosphere, occupying the region above the stratosphere and below the thermosphere. It extends from the stratopause at an altitude of about 50?km (31?mi; 160,000?ft) to the mesopause at 80ÿ85?km (50ÿ53?mi; 260,000ÿ280,000?ft) above sea level.\\r\\nTemperatures drop with increasing altitude to the mesopause that marks the top of this middle layer of the atmosphere. It is the coldest place on Earth and has an average temperature around ?85?C (?120?F; 190?K).[13][14]\\r\\nJust below the mesopause, the air is so cold that even the very scarce water vapor at this altitude can be sublimated into polar-mesospheric noctilucent clouds. These are the highest clouds in the atmosphere and may be visible to the naked eye if sunlight reflects off them about an hour or two after sunset or a similar length of time before sunrise. They are most readily visible when the Sun is around 4 to 16 degrees below the horizon. A type of lightning referred to as either sprites or ELVES occasionally forms far above tropospheric thunderclouds. The mesosphere is also the layer where most meteors burn up upon atmospheric entrance. It is too high above Earth to be accessible to jet-powered aircraft and balloons, and too low to permit orbital spacecraft. The mesosphere is mainly accessed by sounding rockets and rocket-powered aircraft.\\r\\nThe stratosphere is the second-lowest layer of Earth's atmosphere. It lies above the troposphere and is separated from it by the tropopause. This layer extends from the top of the troposphere at roughly 12?km (7.5?mi; 39,000?ft) above Earth's surface to the stratopause at an altitude of about 50 to 55?km (31 to 34?mi; 164,000 to 180,000?ft).\\r\\nThe atmospheric pressure at the top of the stratosphere is roughly 1/1000 the pressure at sea level. It contains the ozone layer, which is the part of Earth's atmosphere that contains relatively high concentrations of that gas. The stratosphere defines a layer in which temperatures rise with increasing altitude. This rise in temperature is caused by the absorption of ultraviolet radiation (UV) radiation from the Sun by the ozone layer, which restricts turbulence and mixing. Although the temperature may be ?60?C (?76?F; 210?K) at the tropopause, the top of the stratosphere is much warmer, and may be near 0?C.[15]\\r\\nThe stratospheric temperature profile creates very stable atmospheric conditions, so the stratosphere lacks the weather-producing air turbulence that is so prevalent in the troposphere. Consequently, the stratosphere is almost completely free of clouds and other forms of weather. However, polar stratospheric or nacreous clouds are occasionally seen in the lower part of this layer of the atmosphere where the air is coldest. The stratosphere is the highest layer that can be accessed by jet-powered aircraft.\\r\\nThe troposphere is the lowest layer of Earth's atmosphere. It extends from Earth's surface to an average height of about 12?km, although this altitude actually varies from about 9?km (30,000?ft) at the poles to 17?km (56,000?ft) at the equator,[11] with some variation due to weather. The troposphere is bounded above by the tropopause, a boundary marked in most places by a temperature inversion (i.e. a layer of relatively warm air above a colder one), and in others by a zone which is isothermal with height.[16][17]\\r\\nAlthough variations do occur, the temperature usually declines with increasing altitude in the troposphere because the troposphere is mostly heated through energy transfer from the surface. Thus, the lowest part of the troposphere (i.e. Earth's surface) is typically the warmest section of the troposphere. This promotes vertical mixing (hence the origin of its name in the Greek word ??, tropos, meaning \\"turn\\"). The troposphere contains roughly 80% of the mass of Earth's atmosphere.[18] The troposphere is denser than all its overlying atmospheric layers because a larger atmospheric weight sits on top of the troposphere and causes it to be most severely compressed. Fifty percent of the total mass of the atmosphere is located in the lower 5.6?km (18,000?ft) of the troposphere.\\r\\nNearly all atmospheric water vapor or moisture is found in the troposphere, so it is the layer where most of Earth's weather takes place. It has basically all the weather-associated cloud genus types generated by active wind circulation, although very tall cumulonimbus thunder clouds can penetrate the tropopause from below and rise into the lower part of the stratosphere. Most conventional aviation activity takes place in the troposphere, and it is the only layer that can be accessed by propeller-driven aircraft.\\r\\nWithin the five principal layers that are largely determined by temperature, several secondary layers may be distinguished by other properties:\\r\\nThe average temperature of the atmosphere at Earth's surface is 14?C (57?F; 287?K)[21] or 15?C (59?F; 288?K),[22] depending on the reference.[23][24][25]\\r\\nThe average atmospheric pressure at sea level is defined by the International Standard Atmosphere as 101325 pascals (760.00?Torr; 14.6959?psi; 760.00?mmHg). This is sometimes referred to as a unit of standard atmospheres (atm). Total atmospheric mass is 5.1480G1018 kg (1.135G1019 lb),[27] about 2.5% less than would be inferred from the average sea level pressure and Earth's area of 51007.2 megahectares, this portion being displaced by Earth's mountainous terrain. Atmospheric pressure is the total weight of the air above unit area at the point where the pressure is measured. Thus air pressure varies with location and weather.\\r\\nIf the entire mass of the atmosphere had a uniform density from sea level, it would terminate abruptly at an altitude of 8.50?km (27,900?ft). It actually decreases exponentially with altitude, dropping by half every 5.6?km (18,000?ft) or by a factor of 1/e every 7.64?km (25,100?ft), the average scale height of the atmosphere below 70?km (43?mi; 230,000?ft). However, the atmosphere is more accurately modeled with a customized equation for each layer that takes gradients of temperature, molecular composition, solar radiation and gravity into account.\\r\\nIn summary, the mass of Earth's atmosphere is distributed approximately as follows:[28]\\r\\nBy comparison, the summit of Mt. Everest is at 8,848?m (29,029?ft); commercial airliners typically cruise between 10?km (33,000?ft) and 13?km (43,000?ft) where the thinner air improves fuel economy; weather balloons reach 30.4?km (100,000?ft) and above; and the highest X-15 flight in 1963 reached 108.0?km (354,300?ft).\\r\\nEven above the Krmn line, significant atmospheric effects such as auroras still occur. Meteors begin to glow in this region, though the larger ones may not burn up until they penetrate more deeply. The various layers of Earth's ionosphere, important to HF radio propagation, begin below 100?km and extend beyond 500?km. By comparison, the International Space Station and Space Shuttle typically orbit at 350ÿ400?km, within the F-layer of the ionosphere where they encounter enough atmospheric drag to require reboosts every few months. Depending on solar activity, satellites can experience noticeable atmospheric drag at altitudes as high as 700ÿ800?km.\\r\\nThe division of the atmosphere into layers mostly by reference to temperature is discussed above. Temperature decreases with altitude starting at sea level, but variations in this trend begin above 11?km, where the temperature stabilizes through a large vertical distance through the rest of the troposphere. In the stratosphere, starting above about 20?km, the temperature increases with height, due to heating within the ozone layer caused by capture of significant ultraviolet radiation from the Sun by the dioxygen and ozone gas in this region. Still another region of increasing temperature with altitude occurs at very high altitudes, in the aptly-named thermosphere above 90?km.\\r\\nBecause in an ideal gas of constant composition the speed of sound depends only on temperature and not on the gas pressure or density, the speed of sound in the atmosphere with altitude takes on the form of the complicated temperature profile (see illustration to the right), and does not mirror altitudinal changes in density or pressure.\\r\\nThe density of air at sea level is about 1.2?kg/m3 (1.2?g/L, 0.0012 g/cm3). Density is not measured directly but is calculated from measurements of temperature, pressure and humidity using the equation of state for air (a form of the ideal gas law). Atmospheric density decreases as the altitude increases. This variation can be approximately modeled using the barometric formula. More sophisticated models are used to predict orbital decay of satellites.\\r\\nThe average mass of the atmosphere is about 5 quadrillion (5G1015) tonnes or 1/1,200,000 the mass of Earth. According to the American National Center for Atmospheric Research, \\"The total mean mass of the atmosphere is 5.1480G1018?kg with an annual range due to water vapor of 1.2 or 1.5G1015?kg, depending on whether surface pressure or water vapor data are used; somewhat smaller than the previous estimate. The mean mass of water vapor is estimated as 1.27G1016?kg and the dry air mass as 5.1352 I0.0003G1018?kg.\\"\\r\\nSolar radiation (or sunlight) is the energy Earth receives from the Sun. Earth also emits radiation back into space, but at longer wavelengths that we cannot see. Part of the incoming and emitted radiation is absorbed or reflected by the atmosphere. In May 2017, glints of light, seen as twinkling from an orbiting satellite a million miles away, were found to be reflected light from ice crystals in the atmosphere.[30][31]\\r\\nWhen light passes through Earth's atmosphere, photons interact with it through scattering. If the light does not interact with the atmosphere, it is called direct radiation and is what you see if you were to look directly at the Sun. Indirect radiation is light that has been scattered in the atmosphere. For example, on an overcast day when you cannot see your shadow there is no direct radiation reaching you, it has all been scattered. As another example, due to a phenomenon called Rayleigh scattering, shorter (blue) wavelengths scatter more easily than longer (red) wavelengths. This is why the sky looks blue; you are seeing scattered blue light. This is also why sunsets are red. Because the Sun is close to the horizon, the Sun's rays pass through more atmosphere than normal to reach your eye. Much of the blue light has been scattered out, leaving the red light in a sunset.\\r\\nDifferent molecules absorb different wavelengths of radiation. For example, O2 and O3 absorb almost all wavelengths shorter than 300 nanometers. Water (H2O) absorbs many wavelengths above 700?nm. When a molecule absorbs a photon, it increases the energy of the molecule. This heats the atmosphere, but the atmosphere also cools by emitting radiation, as discussed below.\\r\\nThe combined absorption spectra of the gases in the atmosphere leave \\"windows\\" of low opacity, allowing the transmission of only certain bands of light. The optical window runs from around 300?nm (ultraviolet-C) up into the range humans can see, the visible spectrum (commonly called light), at roughly 400ÿ700?nm and continues to the infrared to around 1100?nm. There are also infrared and radio windows that transmit some infrared and radio waves at longer wavelengths. For example, the radio window runs from about one centimeter to about eleven-meter waves.\\r\\nEmission is the opposite of absorption, it is when an object emits radiation. Objects tend to emit amounts and wavelengths of radiation depending on their \\"black body\\" emission curves, therefore hotter objects tend to emit more radiation, with shorter wavelengths. Colder objects emit less radiation, with longer wavelengths. For example, the Sun is approximately 6,000?K (5,730?C; 10,340?F), its radiation peaks near 500?nm, and is visible to the human eye. Earth is approximately 290?K (17?C; 62?F), so its radiation peaks near 10,000?nm, and is much too long to be visible to humans.\\r\\nBecause of its temperature, the atmosphere emits infrared radiation. For example, on clear nights Earth's surface cools down faster than on cloudy nights. This is because clouds (H2O) are strong absorbers and emitters of infrared radiation. This is also why it becomes colder at night at higher elevations.\\r\\nThe greenhouse effect is directly related to this absorption and emission effect. Some gases in the atmosphere absorb and emit infrared radiation, but do not interact with sunlight in the visible spectrum. Common examples of these are CO2 and H2O.\\r\\nThe refractive index of air is close to, but just greater than 1. Systematic variations in refractive index can lead to the bending of light rays over long optical paths. One example is that, under some circumstances, observers onboard ships can see other vessels just over the horizon because light is refracted in the same direction as the curvature of Earth's surface.\\r\\nThe refractive index of air depends on temperature, giving rise to refraction effects when the temperature gradient is large. An example of such effects is the mirage.\\r\\nAtmospheric circulation is the large-scale movement of air through the troposphere, and the means (with ocean circulation) by which heat is distributed around Earth. The large-scale structure of the atmospheric circulation varies from year to year, but the basic structure remains fairly constant because it is determined by Earth's rotation rate and the difference in solar radiation between the equator and poles.\\r\\nThe first atmosphere consisted of gases in the solar nebula, primarily hydrogen. There were probably simple hydrides such as those now found in the gas giants (Jupiter and Saturn), notably water vapor, methane and ammonia. As the solar nebula dissipated, these gases escaped, partly driven off by the solar wind.[32]\\r\\nOutgassing from volcanism, supplemented by gases produced during the late heavy bombardment of Earth by huge asteroids, produced the next atmosphere, consisting largely of nitrogen plus carbon dioxide and inert gases.[32] A major part of carbon-dioxide emissions soon dissolved in water and built up carbonate sediments.[clarification needed]\\r\\nResearchers have found water-related sediments dating from as early as 3.8 billion years ago.[33] About 3.4 billion years ago, nitrogen formed the major part of the then stable \\"second atmosphere\\". An influence of life has to be taken into account rather soon in the history of the atmosphere, because hints of early life-forms appear as early as 3.5 billion years ago.[34] How Earth at that time maintained a climate warm enough for liquid water and life, if the early Sun put out 30% lower solar radiance than today, is a puzzle known as the \\"faint young Sun paradox\\".\\r\\nThe geological record however shows a continually relatively warm surface during the complete early temperature record of Earth - with the exception of one cold glacial phase about 2.4 billion years ago. In the late Archean Eon an oxygen-containing atmosphere began to develop, apparently produced by photosynthesizing cyanobacteria (see Great Oxygenation Event), which have been found as stromatolite fossils from 2.7 billion years ago. The early basic carbon isotopy (isotope ratio proportions) strongly suggests conditions similar to the current, and that the fundamental features of the carbon cycle became established as early as 4 billion years ago.\\r\\nAncient sediments in the Gabon dating from between about 2,150 and 2,080 million years ago provide a record of Earth's dynamic oxygenation evolution. These fluctuations in oxygenation were likely driven by the Lomagundi carbon isotope excursion.[35]\\r\\nThe constant re-arrangement of continents by plate tectonics influences the long-term evolution of the atmosphere by transferring carbon dioxide to and from large continental carbonate stores. Free oxygen did not exist in the atmosphere until about 2.4 billion years ago during the Great Oxygenation Event and its appearance is indicated by the end of the banded iron formations.\\r\\nBefore this time, any oxygen produced by photosynthesis was consumed by oxidation of reduced materials, notably iron. Molecules of free oxygen did not start to accumulate in the atmosphere until the rate of production of oxygen began to exceed the availability of reducing materials that removed oxygen. This point signifies a shift from a reducing atmosphere to an oxidizing atmosphere. O2 showed major variations until reaching a steady state of more than 15% by the end of the Precambrian.[38] The following time span from 541 million years ago to the present day is the Phanerozoic Eon, during the earliest period of which, the Cambrian, oxygen-requiring metazoan life forms began to appear.\\r\\nThe amount of oxygen in the atmosphere has fluctuated over the last 600 million years, reaching a peak of about 30% around 280 million years ago, significantly higher than today's 21%. Two main processes govern changes in the atmosphere: Plants use carbon dioxide from the atmosphere, releasing oxygen. Breakdown of pyrite and volcanic eruptions release sulfur into the atmosphere, which oxidizes and hence reduces the amount of oxygen in the atmosphere. However, volcanic eruptions also release carbon dioxide, which plants can convert to oxygen. The exact cause of the variation of the amount of oxygen in the atmosphere is not known. Periods with much oxygen in the atmosphere are associated with rapid development of animals. Today's atmosphere contains 21% oxygen, which is high enough for this rapid development of animals.[39]\\r\\nThe scientific consensus is that the anthropogenic greenhouse gases currently accumulating in the atmosphere are the main cause of global warming.[40]\\r\\nAir pollution is the introduction into the atmosphere of chemicals, particulate matter or biological materials that cause harm or discomfort to organisms.[41] Stratospheric ozone depletion is caused by air pollution, chiefly from chlorofluorocarbons and other ozone-depleting substances.\\r\\nOn October 19, 2015 NASA started a website containing daily images of the full sunlit side of Earth on http://epic.gsfc.nasa.gov/. The images are taken from the Deep Space Climate Observatory (DSCOVR) and show Earth as it rotates during a day.[42]","input":"What is the percentage of o2 in air?"},{"output":"Law of the People's Republic of China, officially referred to as the Socialist legal system","context":"Current leadership\\r\\nLaw of the People's Republic of China, officially referred to as the Socialist legal system with Chinese characteristics, is the legal regime of China, with the separate legal traditions and systems of Mainland China, Hong Kong, and Macau.\\r\\nBetween 1954 and 1978, there was not very much effort within China to create a legal system.[citation needed] The Communist leadership led by Mao Zedong believed that creating a legal system would restrict the power of the Communist Party of China and create elites which would ultimately harm the socialist revolution.[citation needed]\\r\\nThis policy was changed in 1979, and China has formed an increasingly sophisticated legal system. China's legal system is largely a civil law system, reflecting the influence of Continental European legal systems, especially the German civil law system in the 19th and early 20th centuries.\\r\\nOn the other hand, Hong Kong still retains the common law system inherited as a former British colony, and Macau employs a legal system based on that of Portuguese civil law. This is part of the One Country, Two Systems theory. They have their own courts of final appeal and extradition policies. As such, respectively, they are not within the jurisdiction of the court system within China, which is only effective within mainland China, but their respective Basic Laws are subject to interpretation by the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nChina has a tradition of adopting civil law systems. During the Qing Dynasty, in order to modernise the Chinese legal system, the Chinese government hired Japanese legal experts to copy legal systems from Japan, which stemmed from the German civil law system. [1] After the establishment of the Republic of China in 1911, the Chinese government maintained the civil law system. Although the CCP abolished all legal systems of the ROC after 1949, its legal system was deeply influenced by the legal system of the Soviet Union, which could also be regarded as a civil law system.[clarification needed]\\r\\nThe development of the current legal system dates from the late 1970s, after the end of the Cultural Revolution. After more than 30 years of endeavour, the People's Republic of China has established, through enactments by the National People's Congress and its Standing Committee, a rather complete legal system with constitution, civil and commercial law, criminal law, administrative law, economic law, procedural law, etc.\\r\\nIn the 2000s, the Weiquan movement began in the PRC, seeking to advance citizens' rights partly by petitioning for enforcement of existing laws, and partly through activism. Lawyers in the movement have seen some court victories, but in other cases they and their families have been ostracized and even tortured for their activities.\\r\\nThe highest and ultimate source of legal norms in the PRC is nominally the Constitution of the People's Republic of China. It establishes the framework and principles of government, and lists the fundamental rights and duties of Chinese citizens. In practice, however, although these \\"fundamental rights\\" include \\"freedom of speech, of the press, of assembly, of association, of procession and of demonstration\\" the enforcement of these rights and other elements of the Constitution are subject to the discretion of the Communist Party's leadership.\\r\\nUnlike some civil law jurisdictions such as Germany, China does not systematically lay down general principles in its constitution which all administrative regulations and rules must follow. The principles of legislation and the validity and priority of law, rule and administrative regulations are instead listed in the Legislation Law, constitutional provisions, basic laws and laws enacted by the National People's Congress and its standing committee, regulations issued by the State Council and its departments, local laws and regulations, autonomous-zone regulations, legal explanations and treaty norms are all in theory incorporated into domestic law immediately upon promulgation.\\r\\nSigned international treaties are in practice automatically incorporated into PRC law, and they are superior to the relevant stipulations of PRC laws. However, the PRC reserves the right to make reservations regarding provisions of a treaty.\\r\\nUnlike common law jurisdictions, there is no strict precedential concept for case law and no principle of stare decisis. In addition, there is no case or controversy requirement that would require the Supreme People's Court to limit its decisions to actual cases, and the SPC does issue general interpretations of the law. In practice, lower people's court judges attempt to follow the interpretations of the laws decided by the Supreme People's Court. In addition, unlike common law jurisdictions, higher courts have the power of supervision and guidance, which means that on their own initiative they can reopen a case that has been decided at a lower level.\\r\\nCourts in the PRC do not have a general power of judicial review which enables them to strike down legislation. However under the Administrative Procedure Law of the People's Republic of China, they do have authority to invalidate specific acts of the government. In cases where there is a conflict of laws, the process to resolve this conflict is outlined in the Legislation Law of the People's Republic of China, in which an interpretation is requested by the legislative body that is responsible for the law. This process has been criticized both by Western and Chinese legal scholars for being unwieldy and for not allowing for judicial independence and separation of powers. At the same time, the counterargument has been made that resolving legal conflicts is primarily a legislative activity and not a judicial one.\\r\\nFinally, courts outside of the special autonomous regions, including the Supreme People's Court, do not have jurisdiction over the Hong Kong and Macau SAR's; although, the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress does have and has used its authority to interpret the Basic Law of Hong Kong[citation needed].\\r\\nPRC governmental directives exist in a hierarchy, which is defined by the Legislation Law of the People's Republic of China. The hierarchy of regulations are\\r\\nMajor areas of law are substantive laws and procedural laws. The former include administrative law, criminal law, civil law or business law, and economic law. These are separated into different branches. For example, contract law is considered a branch of civil law. The latter includes civil procedure law, criminal procedure law and administrative procedure law.\\r\\nIn 1986 the National People's Congress adopted the General Principles of the Civil Law of the People's Republic of China, which helped clarify the scope of the civil law. Article 2 of the document states that the civil law governs personal and property relationships between natural persons and legal persons having equal status. It covers a wide range of topics, including the General Principles, marriage law, property law, contract law, copyright law, and trademark law. From the point of view of some scholars, business law, such as corporation law, bankruptcy law, insurance law, and law on negotiable instruments, is distinguished from civil law.\\r\\nIn contrast to other civil law jurisdictions, the PRC has not yet consolidated its civil law into a single code. However, the legislative plan is to enact the branches of civil law as separate legislation in the first place and then consolidate them into an entire Civil Code. The National People's Congress has so far promulgated Marriage Law, Adoption Law, Succession Law, Patent Law, Copyright Law, Contract Law, Law of Rights in Rem, Law of Tort Liability.The latest enactment is the Law of the Peoples Republic of China on the Laws Applicable to Foreign-related Civil Relations adopted on 28 October 2010.The first part of the future Civil Code would be General Provisions which will be based on the current General Principles of Civil Law adopted in 1986.\\r\\nCivil procedural law advocates the principle of 'open trial' - a system in which the second instance is the final hearing, although a trial supervision system exists in civil litigation which will allow a limited number of cases being tried by the third instance. Enforcing judgments can prove particularly difficult.\\r\\nChina's first post-1949 substantive and procedural Criminal Code was enacted in 1979.Jerome A. Cohen, \\"Chinese Criminal Code Symposium, Foreword-China's Criminal Codes\\", 1982 72(1) Journal of Criminal Law and Criminology,The 1979 Code followed the release of a new Constitution in 1978, and the fall of the 'Gang of Four' in 1976.\\r\\nThe present Criminal Code, The Criminal Law of the People's Republic of China is the product of extensive revisions, most recently on August 29, 2015 (the 9th Amendment) which incorporated new offences pertaining to cyber crime, terrorism and false/vexatious litigation as well as the removal of the death penalty for certain smuggling, fraud and counterfeiting offences.China Law Translate, \\"\\"Its a crime, I tell ya: Major Changes in Chinas Criminal Law Amendment 9\\"\\r\\nNoteworthy features of criminal law in China include the requirement that crimes and criminal sanctions may only be governed by national laws (as opposed to provincial laws or ministerial regulations). This rule is set out in Article 8 of the Legislation Law of the People's Republic of China\\r\\nThe harshness of criminal law in China is under heavy criticism or strong support, especially the insistence on capital punishment for many crimes. China accounts for the biggest number of criminals executed in the world per year, which has raised great concern among different human rights groups and international organizations.\\r\\nThe Criminal Procedure Law of China provides for all phases of the criminal process. This is distinct from the system of administrative punishments (including detention for periods of multiple years) and procedures which are governed under a separate system of laws and regulations.\\"Punishments in the Post Re-Education Through Labour World:The criminal procedure law governs the conduct of investigations, including pre-trial detention, interrogation, surveillance, prosecution (by an institution called the \\"procuratorate\\") and the conduct of trials/the defense of the accused.\\"Criminal Law and Criminal Procedure Law in the People's Republic of China\\" (2013) However, the independence of the courts and institutions involved in the investigation, prosecution and trial of criminal offences in China remains challenged by the structure of the PRC's government and its organs. One example of the structural barriers to the independence of courts is the Chinese Communist Party political-legal committee system, by which \\"the Party has the power to instruct, monitor or scrutinize courts regarding specific decisions of individual cases or categories of cases that attract attention from the Party.\\"The Chinese Communist Party and Peoples Courts: Judicial Dependence in China\\"\\r\\nThe State Council is authorized to promulgate administrative regulations, on social and economic sectors and affairs consistent with the laws adopted by the NPC and its Standing Committee. These laws include environmental protection law, regulations on taxation and customs, product quality law, and so on. In these areas, the central government and its organs are superior to other parties, such as enterprises and individuals, for they exercise the power of regulation.\\r\\nThe Administrative Procedure Law of the People's Republic of China (1989) allows legal persons to bring legal challenges against administrative actions. The types of administrative actions that can be challenged must be \\"concrete actions\\", which include: administrative punishments (such as detentions and fines), administrative coercive measures, interference with the operations of enterprises, refusal to take action or perform an obligation, unlawful demands for performance of duties, and violations of rights of the person or property rights. The review of state action is carried out in the local people's court. Court review of agency action is not permitted for state action involving national defense or foreign affairs. Moreover, the court cannot review administrative legislation.\\r\\nAs a matter of fact, although administrative litigation involving governments is on the rise due to citizens using legal measures to protect their property from government violation, it is still quite difficult for the court to give fair judgements or efficient execution, as the court's judges are appointed by the Communist Party and finance comes from the government.\\r\\nThere are two types of organs that are empowered to make legislative enactments. The first is referred to as \\"state-power organs\\" (ģ??), which take the form of the National People's Congress, its standing committee and local peoples' congresses of provinces, municipalities, and \\"metropolitans having some degree of autonomy\\" as designated by the State Council. Certain administrative organs (kz)that is, the State Council, its departments and commissions, and local people's governments at the same level as the local people's congresses mentioned above, including the governments of provincial capitalsalso have the power to make administrative rules and regulations under certain conditions.\\r\\nIn theory, legislation issued by administrative organs is subordinate to that issued by state-power organs. Enactments of administrative organs must not conflict with the Constitution or law. In addition, local people's governments must ensure that their enactments comply with those issued by the State Council and its subordinate departments.\\r\\nThe concept of delegation of power has yet to be fully developed in the PRC legal system. For example, because it is not customary to expressly delegate power to administrative bodies to issue specific regulatory documents, they are not drafted pursuant to any specific entrustment of power in the manner of a statutory authorization of the enactment of implementing regulations.\\r\\nIn drafting the new laws, the PRC has declined to copy any other legal system wholesale, and the general pattern has been to issue laws for a specific topic or location. Often laws are drafted on a trial basis, with the law being redrafted after several years. This process of creating a legal infrastructure piecemeal has led to judicial decisions having more precedential value than in most civil law jurisdictions. In formulating laws, the PRC has been influenced by a number of sources, including traditional Chinese views toward the role of law, the PRC's socialist background, the German-based law of the Republic of China on Taiwan, and the English-based common law used in Hong Kong.\\r\\nThe law of the United States has also been very influential particularly in the area of banking and securities law. Specifically, China has copied the separation between investment banking, commercial banking, and insurance, even after those walls were abolished in the United States, and large sections of the Securities Law of the Peoples Republic of China have incorporated in legislation concepts copied from American securities law.\\r\\nThe highest legislative authority is the National People's Congress. It has the power to revise the Constitution and create major legal codes referred to as \\"basic laws\\" (rj jؐbn fҊlа). Apart from this, the NPC also enacts laws ( fҊ) and decision ( judng). Decisions may contain legal norms in the form of amendments or supplements to laws. They are often used to delegate lawmaking authority to the State Council.\\r\\nThe nature of the selection delegates to the NPC has meant that popular input into lawmaking at this level is very limited. Because the delegates range from different fields and backgrounds, only some of them are legal professionals or practitioners. Without any formal legal education or knowledge, few of the delegates can make suggestions or give opinions on legislation. Thus, a fairly wide cross-section of the party and government at both central and local levels is given the opportunity to produce input. The NPC Legislative Affairs Commission (WFH fҊzhgngzu wiyunhu) is the key organ that are responsible for the law drafting work. Since the 1990s, scholars and experts are increasingly entrusted by the NPC Legislative Affairs Commission to form drafting groups to prepare the first draft of the basic laws (this was the case for the Contract Law (1999), the Law of Rights in rem (2007), the Law of Tort Liability (2009) and the Law of the PRC on the Law Applicable to Foreign-related Civil Relations (2010)). The act of legislating is to some extent a game of interest groups.\\r\\nThe next tier of the PRC's legislative hierarchythe State Councilis also elected by the NPC and is head of the nation's executive. It is empowered under Article 89 of the Constitution to \\"adopt administrative measures ( bnfҊ), enact administrative regulations (kį xngzhng fҊguؐ) and issue decisions ( judng) and orders (w mnglng) in accordance with the Constitution and statutes.\\" The State Council Legislative Affairs Office (ו^ gu܇wyun fҊzh bn) is mainly responsible for the drafting of administrative regulations which are issued for the purpose of implementing laws.\\r\\nOf the four levels of local administration in China (province, region/prefecture, county/district, township), only the provincial level possesses real lawmaking power. The Organic Law of Local People's Congresses and Local People's Governments allows congresses at the provincial, municipal, provincial capital and \\"quite big city\\" levels to enact their own regulations, called local regulations (AԴmį dfngxng fҊgu). Nevertheless, drafts of legislation must be approved by the provincial level congress before they can become law.\\r\\nThe judge and prosecutor still are regarded as public servants. It is recognized that the quality of judges and prosecutors are lower than lawyers, but in the major cities, such as the provincial capital cities, the new recruited judges are with higher law degrees than ever before.[clarification needed] In 2002, the unified State Judicial Exam (SJE) was introduced, partly to improve the quality of the judiciary. Any person who wants to work as a judge, prosecutor, or become a practicing lawyer or a public notary, will need to pass the SJE to obtain a Certificate of Legal Profession Qualification. Like in courts of imperial times, judges are also inquisitors who question witnesses, but unlike traditional courts, only evidence given in court is taken into account. Parties are permitted to engage agents ad litem who may be lawyers or any citizen approved by the court. A major concern with the modern court system is bribery of judges resulting from low salaries and financial dependence on local government. Though a great part of disputes that reach the courts still end in mediated rather than adjudicated outcomes, Chinese judges still apply formal laws and follow rules of civil procedure.\\r\\nSince judges in China normally begin their careers as judges as opposed to first serving as lawyers, they may become judges at an unusually young age relative to most other countries.[1]\\r\\nUnder the Organic Law of the People's Courts (1983), judicial power is exercised by the courts at four levels:\\r\\nThe highest court in the judicial system is the Supreme People's Court in Beijing, directly responsible to the NPC and its Standing Committee. It supervises the administration of justice by the people's courts at various levels. There is also a Politics and Law Committee in CCP which is in charge of the direction and cooperation of court, procuratorate, police and ensure CCPs leadership over judicial issues.\\r\\nCases are decided within two instances of trial in the people's courts. This means that, from a judgement or order of first instance of a local people's court, a party may bring an appeal only once to the people's court at the next highest level, and the people's procuratorate may protest a court decision to the people's court at the next highest level. However, a limited number civil and commercial cases may, according to the Civil Procedure Law, be heard for the third time, a regime called trial supervision. Additionally, judgments or orders of first instance of the local people's courts at various levels become legally effective if, within the prescribed period for appeal, no party makes an appeal. Any judgments and orders rendered by the Supreme People's Courts as court of first instance shall become effective immediately.\\r\\nIn accordance with Article 11 of the Organic Law, \\"the people's courts at all levels shall set up judicial committees within the courts\\" in order to sum up judicial experience and to discuss important or difficult cases and other issues relating to the judicial works.\\r\\nOther special courts include military courts, maritime courts and railway courts. The military court, established within the People's Liberation Army, is the relatively closed adjudication institution in charge of hearing criminal cases involving servicemen. The maritime courts are located at the major sea and river port cities. They have jurisdiction over maritime cases and maritime trade cases of first instance. It ranks equivalent to an intermediate court in the judiciary hierarchy. The railway transport court deals with criminal cases and economic disputes relating to railway and transportation.\\r\\nUnder Article 129 of the Constitution, people's procuratories are \\"the State organs for legal supervision\\". Its functions are defined by the Organic Law of the People's Procuratorates (1983).\\r\\nThe Supreme People's Procuratorate is set up at national level. The local people's procuratorates are divided into three tiers, as with the people's courts. Procuratorial committees are created inside the people's procuratorates at different levels. According to Article 3 of the Organic Law, \\"the procuratorial committee shall apply the system of democratic centralism and, under the direction of the chief procurator, hold discussions on important cases and other major issues\\".\\r\\nThe procuratorates are responsible for indict criminal suspects as public prosecutor.\\r\\nLike in imperial times, resolving disputes in China has relied heavily on community mediation rather than litigation within a formal court system. Although a great number of disputes in China to this day are settled informally through community mediation, legal actions are increasingly resorted nowadays by ordinary people to resolve their disputes. Courts are overburdened in many parts of China (for instance, judges at the Basic People's Court in Chaoyang District and Haidian District in Beijing have an average caseload of 300-400 per year).Traditionally, the emphasis has been on compromise, maintaining social harmony, and establishing order. But unlike previous eras, there existed, notably in the first part of the Communist era, mass show trials and public criticisms to enforce the party line, establish party dominance, and make examples of certain values of society.\\r\\nAfter the Communist Party took control, it institutionalized many of the existing informal community mediation systems into the party-state structure. Mediation Committees, staffed by five to eleven community members, were made part of larger Residents Committees and charged with settling disputes through peer pressure and conciliation.\\r\\nThe Communists established a formal court system based on the Soviet model following their victory, but ideological conflict between law specialists and cadres caused the system to break down. In the 1952 \\"three anti\\" (sn fҊn) and \\"five anti\\" (wѸ fҊn) movements, mass public trials with crowds of onlookers shouting criticisms resulted in the execution and detention of hundreds of thousands of \\"counterrevolutionaries\\" without employing the formal legal system. During the Cultural Revolution, the court system was abolished entirely and laws stopped being enacted. This resulted in community mediation systems taking on more importance. The People's Liberation Army was put in control of judging cases. Red Guard brigades often forced individuals to conduct self-criticisms and sent people to reeducation camps for being \\"reactionaries.\\"\\r\\nWith the Deng Xiaoping reforms starting at the end of the 1970s, there has been a return to socialist legality. The judicial system has been resumed and a relatively complete legal system has been established through 30 years of legislation effort, despite the overall traditional impression of China in the Western countries. The practice of 1952-1976 related to court has been abandoned. China is now trying to develop a new regime of alternative dispute resolution (ADR).\\r\\nThe Ministry of Public Security is the principal police authority. It is responsible for maintaining social and public order, and also for conducting investigations and arrest of suspects in criminal cases. It maintains public order in accordance with the administrative power granted by law and through the police force. It can also settle civil disputes between citizens.\\r\\nThe People's Armed Police is a paramilitary force which is used in cases of serious disturbances.\\r\\nThe Ministry of State Security exists as a counterespionage organ and is also used to monitor and control perceived threats to the government and party.\\r\\nThe Ministry of Justice of PRC governs the prison and Laogai, and it mainly focuses on regulation of the legal profession. Historically the legal profession has been insignificant in the PRC. In the late 1970s, there were no more than a couple of hundred practicing lawyers. Since the 1980s, as Chinas leadership became cognizant of the importance of the legal system and legal profession to advance economic development, training for lawyers dramatically increased. From 1986 to 1992, the number of lawyers in the country more than doubled from 21,500 to 45,000, and by 2008 had reached 143,000.[2]\\r\\nThe foundation was laid by the Provisional Law on Lawyering in the PRC in 1980. In its early stages, law offices were called \\"legal counseling services\\" (jА^ fҊlа gwn chѸ) and lawyers were regarded as \\"state legal workers\\". In 1986, the Chinese National Lawyer's Association was established in Beijing, followed by similar organizations around the rest of China. In the same year, the Ministry of Justice administered a unified national qualification exam for lawyers. This exam was superseded by the State Judicial Exam (SJE) in 2002. Various structures have been experimented within the establishment of law offices.\\r\\nIn May 1996, the Lawyers Law was enacted by the NPC. It acknowledged the developmental needs of the legal profession. The definition of a lawyer was finally changed from \\"state legal worker\\" to \\"a professional who legally obtains a Lawyer's Certificate and who provides the society with legal services\\". The law sets forth qualifications for practicing law; outlines a lawyer's professional capacity, rights and duties; rules for pro bono.\\r\\nAt present, there are more than 11,000 law firms in China, staffed by more than 118,000 lawyers. The practice of law has also gradually progressed into new areas such as finance, real estate, and to a lesser extent, human rights. Overall however, the size of the Chinese legal profession is still too small to meet the demands of growth and modernization. Moreover, in sensitive cases, lawyers still cannot play important roles and defend clients in a free way. Some of them were even tried on accusation of perjury as punishment.\\r\\nSince the PRC's entry into the World Trade Organization, there has been progressive opening up of the legal service sector. A number of foreign law firms have entered the market, mostly specializing in cross-border business transactions, mergers and acquisitions, and copyright law.\\r\\nAs of 2012 an oath pledging loyalty to the leading role of the Communist Party of China is required of new and re-licensed Chinese lawyers:\\r\\nI swear to faithfully fulfill the sacred mission of legal workers in socialism with Chinese characteristics. I swear my loyalty to the motherland, to the people, to uphold the leadership of the Communist Party of China and the socialist system, and to protect the dignity of the Constitution and laws.[3][4]\\r\\nOver the last two decades, legal education has paralleled the growth of the legal profession. It is one of the most competitive academic disciplines in terms of university and college enrolment, and the number of judicial and legal training institutions continue to grow. The trend has been determined by a strong demand in the market for legal services, and the need to improve the professional quality of judges and prosecutors.\\r\\nChinese judicial and legal training facilities are divided into law schools, law universities and justice colleges; and specialized judicial and professional training centres.\\r\\nApproximately 70% of practicing lawyers have university degrees, and 30% only have college diplomas. In March 2002, over 360,000 university or college graduates took part in a two-day State Judicial Exam (SJE). According to a recent report, only 7% passed.\\r\\nAt present, there are at least 80 law universities or law collegesand many university-based law schools or law departments in PRC. Historially, the best-known ones are called \\"the Five Institutes and Four Departments (Simplified Chinese: )\\". But some of the new law schools established in other top Chinese universities are developing very fast and become the top law schools now.\\r\\nA feature of the Chinese legal training system is the network of specialized on-job internal training colleges and centers. The Supreme People's Court administers two training institutes: the National Judges College and the SPC Spare-time University, both located in Beijing. Its trainees are mostly judges or incoming judges. Starting from 2003, however, receiving a diploma from these institutions will no longer be sufficient. Those who want to become a judge need to have a university-level education. There is also a National Prosecutors College, whose trainees are mostly senior prosecutors. These three institutions also have local branches in all the provinces.\\r\\nA provincial bureau of justice usually manages a justice training centre in a college of justice, which provides college level training for young students or periodic training to practicing lawyers. In addition, there are provincial-level \\"schools of the administration of political and legal cadres\\", which provide a legal training program to judges, prosecutors, justice officials and practicing lawyers.\\r\\nIn addition, the national broadcaster CCTV runs a \\"Television University\\" which has a long-distance college-level law program. At the provincial level, there are post-secondary justice colleges or junior colleges, which provide legal education mostly to junior supporting staff in legal institutions.\\r\\nIn China, laws are usually broadly drafted with much discretion left to implementing authorities. Some laws in the PRC have amounted to little more than statements of principle. Real clarity exists only at the level of administrative rules, circulars or bylaws.[citation needed]\\r\\nSince 1978, the government has departed significantly from its focus on class status, and replaced it with a qualified presumption of equality. The principle of legal equality is enshrined in basic laws such as the Economic Contract Law (1982), which provides that contracting parties enjoy equal rights, the General Principles of Civil Law (1987), which ascribes various rights universally to all natural persons, and the Administrative Litigation Law (1989), which allows any citizen to file suit against administrative agencies. However, the doctrine does not extend to the right of labour to engage in collective bargaining or strike action.\\r\\nThe PRC constitution and laws provide principles for fundamental human rights, but there is general agreement, even among members of the government, that many of these rights are just in principle not fully implemented. There is, however, considerable disagreement over which rights require the most attention and how the PRC should address these deficiencies. In particular, the Chinese government tends to argue that major improvements in China's human rights record can be made within the context of leadership of the Communist Party of China, while many both in China and outside of the government argue that any real improvement is impossible without fundamental changes in the political system. (See human rights in the People's Republic of China)\\r\\nThe expansion of the legal profession has been beneficial for legal awareness. As of 2002, there have been established 2,156 legal aid centres staffed by over 7000 full-time legal professionals. According to the Ministry of Justice, this system will continue to expand, given that \\"establishing a legal aid system\\" is a priority of the Chinese government as outlined by the 10th Five-Year Plan (adopted April 2002).\\r\\nP.B. Potter suggests that personal, client and familial relationships (often called guanxi) override the concept of legal equality and justice in civil and economic relationships. His conclusion is that basic regime tenets of legality are not being assimilated. Guanxi contacts are exploited in order to surmount institutional barriers. The influence of these extra-legal norms harm the impartiality of administrative bodies as well as the judicial system. In some cases, strong feelings of localism cause local courts to refuse to cooperate in enforcing awards, even when the award has been made by an arbitration body in Beijing. However, this negative view of guanxi is not universal, Schramm and Taube argue that guanxi has personalistic systems of social relationships have positive elements in producing social capital and that personalistic norms can co-exist with impersonal legalistic ones.[citation needed]\\r\\nThe legal systems of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region and the Macau Special Administrative Region are excepted from the legal framework of Mainland China by the doctrine of \\"one country, two systems\\" established by Deng Xiaoping. The NPC of the PRC enacted the Basic Law of Hong Kong SAR (April 1990) and Basic Law of Macau SAR (March 1993) to ensure state sovereignty and at the same time the special economic position of those two regions. Since both statutes are national laws, no local laws, including ordinances, administrative regulations and other normative documents, can violate the Basic Law.\\r\\nThe Basic Law of both regions states that the existing capitalist system and the people's way of life shall remain unchanged for at least 50 years, and the laws previously in force shall be maintained. In Hong Kong, the legal system is based on English Common Law and Macau based on Portuguese civil law.","input":"What kind of legal system does china have?"},{"output":"14,454","context":"Yankton is a city in, and the county seat of, Yankton County, South Dakota, United States. The population was 14,454 at the 2010 census. Yankton is the principal city of the Yankton Micropolitan Statistical Area, which includes the entirety of Yankton County, and which had an estimated population of 22,702 as of July 1, 2015.[9]\\r\\nYankton was the first capital of Dakota Territory. It is named for the Yankton tribe of Nakota (Sioux) Native Americans; Yankton is derived from the Nakota word I-hank-ton-wan (\\"the end village\\").[10] Yankton is located on the Missouri River just downstream of the Gavins Point Dam and Lewis and Clark Lake and just upstream of the confluence with the James River. The United States National Park Service's headquarters for the Missouri National Recreational River are located in the city. The Human Services Center was established as a psychiatric hospital in 1882 and is on the National Register of Historic Places. Yankton is commonly referred to as the \\"River City\\",[11] due to its proximity to the Missouri River and the importance that the river played in the city's settlement and development. Yankton has also earned the nickname, \\"Mother City of the Dakotas\\", due to the early important role it played in the creation and development of the Dakota Territory, which later became the 39th and 40th U.S. states of North and South Dakota, respectively.[12]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nYankton is located at 425254N 972333W? / ?42.88167N 97.39250W? / 42.88167; -97.39250 (42.881647, -97.392485).[13] in southern South Dakota on the state's border with Nebraska. The city is located on one of the last free-flowing, natural stretches of the Missouri River; this segment of the river, between Gavins Point Dam four miles west of Yankton, and Ponca State Park in Nebraska, has been designated by the U.S. National Park Service as the Missouri National Recreational River. The city is located approximately six miles west of the point where the James River flows into the Missouri. The central business district of the city is located on a natural landing along the Missouri River, and city rises in the west to \\"Mount Marty\\" (actually a high bluff along the river). The city is also intersected by the Marne Creek, which also flows into the Missouri River.\\r\\nAccording to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of 8.45 square miles (21.89?km2), of which, 8.21 square miles (21.26?km2) is land and 0.24 square miles (0.62?km2) is water.[4]\\r\\nYankton has been assigned the ZIP codes 57078-57079 and the FIPS place code 73060.\\r\\nAs of the census[5] of 2010, there were 14,454 people, 5,909 households, and 3,348 families residing in the city.

This is no longer the case as of the 2005 HPCI.\\r\\nThe site of Yankton was occupied by the Yankton Sioux (Nakota) prior to the arrival of European settlers. As part of the vast Louisiana Purchase, the site of Yankton was visited by Lewis and Clark in 1804. In the journals of the expedition, the explorers write of a meeting on August 30, 1804 with members of the Yankton Sioux Tribe on a Missouri River bluff presently known as Calumet Bluff. As recently as 1857, the present day site of Yankton was occupied by a village of Yankton Sioux led by Chief Pa-le-ne-a-pa-pe (\\"Struck by the Ree\\").[16] Two years later, with the signing of the Yankton Treaty of 1858, the land was opened for settlement.[17] The city was founded where the small Rhine Creek (renamed Marne Creek in World War I) flowed into the Missouri River.[18] The city grew as a stop for steamboats to take on fresh water and supplies, especially after steamboat traffic boomed when gold was discovered in the Black Hills.\\r\\nWith two days left in his term, President James Buchanan signed a law on March 2, 1861 creating Dakota Territory. Yankton was designated as the territorial capital, and newly inaugurated President Abraham Lincoln appointed his personal physician, William A. Jayne of Springfield, Illinois, as the first territorial governor.[19] The territorial capitol building, a plain, two-story wooden structure, was located at the intersection of Fourth and Capitol Streets;[20] the original structure has been demolished, but a replica of the building has been constructed in Yankton's Riverside Park. Yankton served as the territorial capital until 1883 when the capital was moved to Bismarck (presently in North Dakota).\\r\\nIn response to the Dakota War of 1862 in western Minnesota, Governor Jayne issued a proclamation on August 30, 1862 requiring every male between the ages of 18 and 50 in every settlement in eastern Dakota, be formed into militias to protect against expected attacks from the Native Americans.[21] In response, the Yankton militia built a stockade at the corner of Third Street and Broadway Avenue of approximately 200,000 square feet. Settlers from the surrounding area, and as far away as Sioux Falls and Bon Homme County, fled to Yankton in order to seek shelter in the structure. Although roving bands of Native Americans did approach Yankton over the course of several weeks, no attack ensued, and the stockade was eventually abandoned and torn down. Although no remnants of the stockcade remain, a monument can now be found at the site of the stockade memorializing this event.\\r\\nAmong the most notable events that occurred in Yankton while capital, Jack McCall, murderer of Wild Bill Hickok in Deadwood on August 2, 1876, was tried in Yankton for Hickok's murder, found guilty, and was hanged on March 1, 1877 at the age of 24. His body is buried in a Yankton cemetery.[22]\\r\\nDue to the urging of the Reverend Joseph Ward of Yankton, the General Association of Congregational Churches in Dakota Territory voted in May 1881 to establish \\"Pilgrim College\\" in Yankton, which was to be the first private institution of higher learning in Dakota.[23] When the college was incorporated in August 1881, the name had been changed to \\"Yankton College\\". Classes commenced in October 1882, and Yankton College played a prominent role in the city for over 100 years. Then, in 1983, the small liberal arts college was forced to close due to financial insolvency. After remaining vacant for several years, the historic campus, which is listed on the National Register of Historic Places, was purchased by the United States Federal Bureau of Prisons for use as a minimum security prison. The Federal Prison Camp ÿ Yankton houses approximately 850 male inmates.\\r\\nSince its founding, Yankton enjoyed a natural advantage as a steamboat landing along the Missouri River due to the fact that its landing stretched along the entire length of the towns riverfront.[24] The first steamboat to reach Yankton from St. Louis arrived in 1859, providing goods and supplies to settlers and fur-traders in upper and central Dakota.[25] After that, the city continued to grow, particularly after gold was discovered in the Black Hills in 1874 and prospectors rushed into Dakota Territory.[26] By 1880, Yankton had become an established riverboat port on the Missouri River, but the citys status as an important port was literally crushed on March 27, 1881 when an ice dam on the Missouri River burst, sending flood waters and giant blocks of ice flowing towards the town.[27]\\r\\nThe resulting flood waters continued to accumulate behind the debris, and by March 29, the towns riverfront and downtown were covered in water, ice and rock, destroying or stranding several riverboats that were moored there. As a result of this flood, and the expansion of railroads as a preferred method of shipping goods (the railroad reached Yankton in 1872, and the rest of Dakota throughout the 1870s), Yanktons river boat traffic was reduced, and the citys role as a prominent stopping point on the way west dwindled over the next several years.[28]\\r\\nFrancis Marion Ziebach established the second newspaper in the area that became South Dakota, the Weekly Dakotan, in Yankton on June 6, 1861, bringing his outfit from Sioux Falls by team and wagon.[29] A second newspaper, started by Francis Marion Ziebach, is still published today as the Yankton Press and Dakotan.[30]\\r\\nIn 1882, the Human Services Center was established as a psychiatric hospital. On June 2, 1883, Dakota Territory Governor Nehemiah G. Ordway moved the territorial capital from Yankton to Bismarck, present-day North Dakota.\\r\\nAs evidence of its rich historical past, Yankton has 26 individual properties and 6 historic districts within the city listed on the National Register of Historic Places, maintained by the U.S. National Park Service. Each individual district contains several structures, and include:\\r\\nYankton is served by the Yankton Public School District (K-12), Sacred Heart Catholic School (pK-8), and Mount Marty College.\\r\\nYankton was once home to Yankton College; founded in 1881, it was the first liberal arts college in the Dakota Territory. The college closed in 1984. The campus was acquired by the Federal Bureau of Prisons in 1988 for use as the Federal Prison Camp - Yankton.\\r\\nThe Yankton School District has a variety of extracurricular activities including athletics and non-athletics. The athletic teams are universal on all levels of education including the Yankton Middle School and the Yankton High School. The boys' athletic teams are known as the Yankton Bucks and the girls' teams are known as the Yankton Gazelles. Yankton's debate team is the host of the annual Lewis and Clark Debate Tournament, held on the last weekend of the month of January.\\r\\nThe City of Yankton maintains fourteen municipal parks, including Fantle Memorial Park, which is the location of an outdoor public swimming pool, and Riverside Park, which is home to the citys Riverside Baseball Field. There are two golf courses in the city: the Fox Run municipal golf course, and the private golf course located at Hillcrest Golf and Country Club.[31] The City of Yankton and the Yankton School District jointly maintain and operate the Yankton High School and Summit Activities Center; this facility offers an indoor swimming pool, several gymnasiums, and a public weight lifting room.[32]\\r\\nThe double-decker Meridian Bridge over the Missouri River was decommissioned for traffic in October 2008 after the new Discovery Highway Bridge was opened. This old bridge was converted to a pedestrian bridge (photo), and is part of the citys extensive pedestrian and bicycle path system.[33] The Brokaw-Auld Trail is a linear park and recreational path along Marne Creek, and the State of South Dakota has developed trails and paths to and throughout the Lewis and Clark Recreation Area.\\r\\nFour miles west of Yankton, the Lewis and Clark Recreation Area attracts over one million visitors per year. This state park, extending approximately two miles along the north shore of Lewis and Clark Lake, offering camping, swimming,and boating facilities. The federal Corps of Engineers also maintains camping, boating, swimming and recreation facilities along the Missouri River east of Gavins Point Dam.[34]\\r\\nThe city is served by Chan Gurney Municipal Airport, although the city is not served by scheduled commercial flights. Highway transportation across the Missouri River to Nebraska is provided by US Route 81 via the Discovery Bridge, which replaced the Meridian Highway Bridge in 2008. The City of Yankton is also served by SD Route 50, a four lane, divided highway which connects the city to US Interstate Highway 29, approximately 30 miles to the east.\\r\\nBroadcasting in Yankton began in 1922 when WNAX radio went on the air. Today, two AM radio stations and two commercial FM stations are licensed to Yankton:[35]\\r\\nSeveral low-power non-commercial FM stations are licensed to Yankton.\\r\\nThere are no commercial television stations based in Yankton.

It is published in a historic building constructed in 1875 by Territorial Governor John Pennington.\\r\\nMount Marty College offers several cultural assets and venues in Yankton, including the Bede Art Gallery, which showcases artwork from regional and Native American artists, as well as Marion Auditorium, which hosts performing and fine art events. The college is also home to Great Plains Writers' Tour, which brings award-winning professional writers to campus for readings and class workshops. Previous authors include former United States poet laureate Ted Kooser, American Book Award winner Maria Mazziotti Gillan, Elizabeth Cook-Lynn, David Lee, and William Kloefkorn, among others.[38]\\r\\nYankton is also home to the Dakota Territorial Museum, which is located in West Side Park, and which contains information and artifacts about the heritage and development of the City of Yankton and the surrounding area. The museums collection includes artifacts of Dakota Territory, Native American inhabitants and early pioneers. The museum complex also contains several outbuildings, such as a restored rural school house and the Great Northern Railway Depot. The museum also displays a retired Burlington Northern Railway caboose.[39] The museum has announced plans to purchase and rehabilitate the Mead Building on the grounds of the Human Services Center, to be used as the new site of the museum and its collections.\\r\\nYankton's Riverboat Days is an annual celebration held in the third full weekend in August that attracts 135,000 people. The primarily free event hosts over 150 artists and over 50 food vendors at Riverside Park. Other activities include a rodeo, parade, golf tournament and snowmobile grass drag race.\\r\\nThe National Field Archery Association, NFAA, moved its headquarters from Redland, California to Yankton, South Dakota.[40]\\r\\nThe National Field Archery Association's Easton Yankton Archery Complex hosted nearly 600 archers from 51 countries for the 2015 World Archery Youth Championships.[41]\\r\\nYankton is mentioned numerous times as the territorial capital in the western TV series Deadwood.\\r\\nA fictional version of Yankton appears in the video game Grand Theft Auto V.\\r\\nYankton was mentioned in a 2015 episode of The Middle, Hecks on a Train.","input":"What is the population of yankton south dakota?"},{"output":"dates back to Canada's earliest history","context":"Capital punishment in Canada dates back to Canada's earliest history, including its period as a French colony and, after 1763, its time as a British colony. From 1867 to the elimination of the death penalty for murder on July 14, 1976, 1,481 people had been sentenced to death, and 710 had been executed. Of those executed, 697 were men and 13 were women. The only method used in Canada for capital punishment of civilians after the end of the French regime was hanging. The last execution in Canada was the double hanging of Arthur Lucas and Ronald Turpin on December 11, 1962, at Toronto's Don Jail.\\r\\nThe death penalty was de facto abolished in Canada in 1963, and Bill C-84 was enacted in 1976 resulting in the de jure abolition of the death penalty, except for certain military offences committed by members of the Canadian Armed Forces (cowardice, desertion, unlawful surrender, and spying for the enemy) which are prosecuted under the National Defence Act. In 1998, Canada eliminated the death penalty for these military offences as well.[1]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1749, Peter Cartcel, a sailor aboard a ship in the Halifax harbour, stabbed Abraham Goodsides to death and wounded two other men. He was brought before a Captain's Court where he was found guilty and sentenced to death. Two days later he was hanged from the yardarm of the vessel as a deterrent to others.[2] This is one of the earliest records of capital punishment in English-speaking Canada. It is difficult to accurately state numbers of capital punishment since there were no systematic efforts to accurately record names, dates, and locations of executions until after 1867, and many records have been lost because of fires, floods, or decay.[3]\\r\\nAfter Confederation, a revision of the statutes reduced the number of offences punishable by death to three: murder, rape, and treason. In 1868, Parliament also stated that the location of the execution was to be within the confines of the prison instead of public hangings.[4] By the 1870s, the jails had begun to build the gallows 5 feet (1.5?m) from the ground with a pit underneath instead of the previous high scaffold, the platform of which was level with the prison wall.[5]\\r\\nIn 1950, an attempt was made to abolish capital punishment. Ross Thatcher, at that time a Cooperative Commonwealth Federation Member of Parliament, moved Bill No. 2 in order to amend the Criminal Code to abolish the death penalty. Thatcher later withdrew it for fear of Bill No. 2 not generating positive discussion and further harming the chances of abolition. In 1956, the Joint Committee of the House and Senate recommended the retention of capital punishment as the mandatory punishment for murder, which opened the door to the possibility of abolition.[6]\\r\\nIn 1961, legislation was introduced to reclassify murder into capital or non-capital offences. A capital murder involved a planned or deliberate murder, murder during violent crimes, or the murder of a police officer or prison guard. Only capital murder carried the death sentence.[7]\\r\\nFollowing the success of Lester Pearson and the Liberal Party in the 1963 federal election, and through the successive governments of Pierre Trudeau, the federal cabinet commuted all death sentences as a matter of policy. Hence, the de facto abolition of the death penalty in Canada occurred in 1963. On November 30, 1967, Bill C-168 was passed creating a five-year moratorium on the use of the death penalty, except for murders of police and corrections officers. On January 26, 1973, after the expiration of the five-year experiment, the Solicitor General of Canada continued the partial ban on capital punishment, which would eventually lead to the abolition of capital punishment.[8] On July 14, 1976, Bill C-84 was passed by a narrow margin of 130:124 in a free vote, resulting in the de jure abolition of the death penalty, except for certain offences under the National Defence Act. These were removed in 1998.[9]\\r\\nOn June 30, 1987, a bill to restore the death penalty was defeated by the House of Commons in a 148ÿ127 vote, in which Prime Minister Brian Mulroney, Minister of Justice Ray Hnatyshyn, and Minister of External Affairs Joe Clark opposed the bill, whereas Deputy Prime Minister Donald Mazankowski and a majority of Progressive Conservative MPs supported it.[10][11][12][13]\\r\\nFirst-degree murder, which before abolition was the offence of capital murder, now carries a mandatory life sentence without eligibility for parole until the person has served 25 years of the sentence.\\r\\nThe last two people executed in Canada were Ronald Turpin, 29, and Arthur Lucas, 54, convicted for separate murders, at 12:02 am on December 11, 1962 at the Don Jail in Toronto.\\r\\nThe last woman to be hanged in Canada was Marguerite Pitre on January 9, 1953, for her part in the Albert Guay affair.\\r\\nThe last person sentenced to death was Mario Gauthier on May 14, 1976, for the murder of a prison guard in Quebec. He was reprieved as capital punishment was abolished for all common crimes on July 14 the same year.[14]\\r\\nDuring the First World War, 25 Canadian soldiers were executed. Most were shot for service offences such as desertion and cowardice, but two executions were for murder. For details of these see List of Canadian soldiers executed during World War I.\\r\\nOne Canadian soldier, Pte. Harold Pringle, was executed during the Second World War for murder.\\r\\nJohn Radclive was Canada's first professional executioner, placed on the federal payroll as a hangman by a Dominion order-in-council in 1892, on the recommendation of the justice minister Sir John Thompson:[15] Radclive is often described as having trained under British hangman William Marwood although there is no documentary proof for this. He can be shown to have hanged at least 69 people in Canada, although his life total was probably much higher. At his death, the Toronto Telegram said he had 150 executions. He died of alcohol-related illness in Toronto on February 26, 1911, at the age of 55.[16]\\r\\nArthur Ellis was the pseudonym of Arthur B. English, a British man who became Canada's official hangman in 1913, after Radclive's death. Ellis worked as a hangman in Canada until the botched execution of Thomasina Sarao in Montreal in 1935, in which she was decapitated. He died in poverty in Montreal in July, 1938, and lies buried in the Mount Royal Cemetery.\\r\\nThe Crime Writers of Canada present annual literary awards ÿ the Arthur Ellis Awards ÿ named after this pseudonym. Ellis is prominently featured in the 2009 documentary Hangman's Graveyard.\\r\\nThe executioner who worked as Camille Branchaud, a pseudonym, succeeded Ellis. Branchaud was on the Quebec government payroll as a hangman, and executed people elsewhere in the country on a piecework basis. The hangman was traditionally based in Montreal where between 1912 and 1960 the gallows at Bordeaux Prison saw more executions (85) take place than any other correctional facility in Canada.[17]\\r\\nBranchaud carried out many executions (for which he was not paid) in the postwar period in Canada, such as the double hanging of Leonard Jackson and Steven Suchan of the Boyd Gang at the Don Jail in 1952, and Robert Raymond Cook's execution in Fort Saskatchewan, Alberta, in 1960.[18]\\r\\nThe first method of hanging was \\"hoisting\\" in which a rope would be thrown over a beam and the convicted person would then be hoisted into the air by others pulling on the rope.[citation needed] The slip knot would then tightly close around the neck until strangulation. A variation of this included the person with a rope around the neck to stand on a cart and then it would be pushed from under him. This led to the development of suspension in which \\"the drop\\" caused by jerking something from underneath the offender became the main component of the execution.[19] Executioners experimented with the length of the rope for the drop. They discovered new ways of causing instant unconsciousness and quick death upon hanging. In 1872, the length of a drop extended to nearly five feet which dislocated the neck perfectly. Almost one year later, the length of the drop was extended to seven feet.[20]\\r\\nThe majority of offenders put to death by Canadian civilian authorities were executed by the \\"long drop\\" technique of hanging developed in the United Kingdom by William Marwood. This method ensured that the prisoner's neck was broken instantly at the end of the drop, resulting in the prisoner dying of asphyxia while unconscious, which was considered more humane than the slow death by strangulation which often resulted from the previous \\"short drop\\" method. The short drop sometimes gave a period of suffering before death finally took place.\\r\\nEarly in his career, John Radclive persuaded several sheriffs in Ontario and Quebec to let him use an alternative method in which the condemned person was jerked into the air. A gallows of this type was used for the execution of Robert Neil at Toronto's Don Jail on February 29, 1888:\\r\\nThe old plan of a \\"drop\\" was discarded for a more merciful machine, by which the prisoner is jerked up from a platform on the ground level by a weight of 280 lbs, which is suspended by an independent rope pending the execution  At the words \\"Forgive us our trespasses,\\" the executioner drove his chisel against the light rope that held the ponderous iron at the other end of the noose, and in an instant the heavy weight fell with a thud, and the pinioned body was jerked into the air and hung dangling between the rough posts of the scaffold.[21]\\r\\nThe hanging of Reginald Birchall in Woodstock, Ont. in November 1890 seems to be the last time a device of this kind was used.[citation needed] Radclive had first been exposed to executions as a Royal Navy seaman helping with shipboard hangings of pirates in the South China Sea, and it is possible he was trying to approximate something similar to hanging a man on a ship's yardarm. After Birchall's hanging, Radclive used the traditional long drop method, as did his successors.\\r\\nWhile hanging was a relatively humane method of execution under ideal conditions with an expert executioner, mistakes could happen. Condemned prisoners were decapitated by accident at Headingley Jail in Manitoba and Bordeaux Jail in Montreal, and a prisoner at the Don Jail in Toronto hit the floor of the room below and was strangled by the hangman.[22]\\r\\nSome Canadian jailssuch as those in Toronto and Ottawa, Ontario; Headingley, Manitoba; and Fort Saskatchewan, Albertahad permanent indoor execution facilities, but more typically offenders were hanged on a scaffold built for the occasion in the jail yard.\\r\\nMilitary prisoners sentenced to death under Canadian Military Law were shot by a firing squad[citation needed].\\r\\nAlthough reintroduction of the death penalty in Canada is extremely unlikely, support for capital punishment is similar to its support in the United States, where it is carried out regularly in some states and is on the books in most states and on the federal level. While opposition to the death penalty increased in the 1990s and early 2000s, in recent years Canadians have merged closer to America's position; in 2004 only 48 percent of Canadians favored death for murderers compared to 62 percent in 2010.[23] According to one poll, support for the death penalty in Canada is approximately the same as its support in the United States, at 63 percent in both countries as of 2013.[24] A 2011 poll by the Toronto Sun found that 66 percent of Canadians favored capital punishment, but only 41 percent would actually support its re-introduction in Canada.[25]\\r\\nSince abolition only two parties are known to have advocated to bringing it back: the Reform Party of Canada (1988-2000) and the National Advancement Party of Canada (2014-since).[citation needed]\\r\\nAmong the reasons cited for banning capital punishment in Canada were fears about wrongful convictions, concerns about the state taking people's lives, and uncertainty about the death penalty's role as a deterrent for crime.[26] The 1959 conviction of 14-year-old Steven Truscott was a significant impetus (although certainly not the only one) toward the abolition of capital punishment.[citation needed] Truscott was sentenced to death for the murder of a classmate. His sentence was later commuted to a life sentence and in 2007 he was acquitted of the charges (although the appeal court did not state that he was in fact innocent).\\r\\nIn the 1990s, Canada deported a criminal, Charles Ng to the United States, even though he appealed to the authorities, as he did not want to potentially face execution.\\r\\nThe Supreme Court of Canada, in the case United States v. Burns, (2001), determined that Canada should not extradite persons to face trial in other countries for crimes punishable by death unless Canada has received an assurance that the foreign state will not apply the death penalty, essentially overruling Kindler v. Canada (Minister of Justice), (1991). This is similar to the extradition policies of other nations such as Germany, France, the Netherlands, Spain, Italy, the United Kingdom, Israel, Mexico, Colombia and Australia, which also refuse to extradite prisoners who may be condemned to death. Extradition where the death penalty is possible was ruled a violation of the European Convention of Human Rights in the case of Soering v United Kingdom outlawing the practice in member states of the Council of Europe, of which all of the European Union member states are part.\\r\\nIn November 2007, Canada's minority Conservative government reversed a longstanding policy of automatically requesting clemency for Canadian citizens sentenced to capital punishment. The ongoing case of Alberta-born Ronald Allen Smith, who has been on death row in the United States since 1982 after being convicted of murdering two people and who continues to seek calls for clemency from the Canadian government, prompted Canadian Public Safety Minister Stockwell Day to announce the change in policy. Day has stated that each situation should be handled on a case-by-case basis. Smith's case resulted in a sharp divide between the Liberals and the Conservatives, with the Liberals passing a motion declaring that the government \\"should stand consistently against the death penalty, as a matter of principle, both in Canada and around the world\\". However, an overwhelming majority of Conservatives supported the change in policy.[27]\\r\\nIn a 2011 interview given to Canadian media, Canadian Prime Minister Stephen Harper affirmed his private support for capital punishment by saying, \\"I personally think there are times where capital punishment is appropriate.\\" According to some polls, as of 2012, 63% of surveyed Canadians believe the death penalty is sometimes appropriate, while 61% said capital punishment is warranted for murder.[28]","input":"When was the death penalty created in canada?"},{"output":"the Middle Ages","context":"Romance is a pleasurable emotional feeling of love for another person, and as well refers to a collection of courtship behaviors undertaken to express the emotions created by the feeling.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe feeling of romantic love is associated with sexual attraction, but romantic feelings can exist without expectation of physical consummation and be subsequently expressed. Historically, the term romance originates with the medieval ideal of chivalry as set out in chivalric romance literature.\\r\\n\\r\\nRomantic love is a relative term that distinguishes moments and situations within intimate relationships as contributing to a deepened relational connection.\\r\\n\\r\\nHistorians[who?] believe the word \\"romance\\" to have developed in the French vernacular meaning \\"verse narrative.\\"  The word was originally an adverb of the Latin origin \\"Romanicus,\\" meaning \\"of the Roman style.\\" The connecting notion is that European medieval vernacular tales were usually about chivalric adventure, not combining the idea of love until late into the seventeenth century.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe word romance has also developed with other meanings in other languages such as the early nineteenth century Spanish and Italian definitions of \\"adventurous\\" and \\"passionate\\", sometimes combining the idea of \\"love affair\\" or \\"idealistic quality.\\"\\r\\n\\r\\nIn primitive societies, tension existed between marriage and the erotic, but this was mostly expressed in taboo regarding the menstrual cycle and birth.[2]\\r\\n\\r\\nAnthropologists such as Claude Lvi-Strauss show that there were complex forms of courtship in ancient as well as contemporary primitive societies. There may not be evidence, however, that members of such societies formed loving relationships distinct from their established customs in a way that would parallel modern romance.[3]\\r\\n\\r\\nBefore the 18th century, many marriages were not arranged, but rather developed out of more or less spontaneous relationships. After the 18th century, illicit relationships took on a more independent role. In bourgeois marriage, illicitness may have become more formidable and likely to cause tension.[4] In Ladies of the Leisure Class, Rutgers University professor Bonnie G. Smith depicts courtship and marriage rituals that may be viewed as oppressive to modern people. She writes \\"When the young women of the Nord married, they did so without illusions of love and romance. They acted within a framework of concern for the reproduction of bloodlines according to financial, professional, and sometimes political interests.\\" Subsequent sexual revolution has lessened the conflicts arising out of liberalism, but not eliminated them.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnthony Giddens, in his book The Transformation of Intimacy: Sexuality, Love and Eroticism in Modern Society, states that romantic love introduced the idea of a narrative into an individual's life. He adds that telling a story was one of the meanings of romance. According to Giddens, the rise of romantic love more or less coincided with the emergence of the novel. It was then that romantic love, associated with freedom and therefore the ideals of romantic love, created the ties between freedom and self-realization.\\r\\n\\r\\nDavid R. Shumway, in his book Romance, Intimacy, and The Marriage Crisis, states that the discourse of intimacy emerged in the last third of the 20th century and that this discourse claimed to be able to explain how marriage and other relationships worked. For the discourse of intimacy emotional closeness was much more important than passion. This does not mean by any means that intimacy is to replace romance. On the contrary, intimacy and romance coexist.[5]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe 21st century has seen the growth of globalization and people now live in a world of transformations that affect almost every aspect of our lives, and love has not been the exception. One example of the changes experienced in relationships was explored by Giddens regarding homosexual relationships. According to Giddens since homosexuals were not able to marry they were forced to pioneer more open and negotiated relationships. These kinds of relationships then permeated the heterosexual population.\\r\\n\\r\\nShumway also states that together with the growth of capitalism the older social relations dissolved, including marriage. Marriage meaning for women changed as they had more socially acceptable alternatives and were less willing to accept unhappy relations and, therefore, divorce rates substantially increased.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe discourse of romance continues to exist today together with intimacy. Shumway states that on the one hand, romance is the part that offers adventure and intense emotions while offering the possibility to find the perfect mate. On the other hand, intimacy offers deep communication, friendship, and long lasting sharing.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe conception of romantic love was popularized in Western culture by the concept of courtly love. Chevaliers, or knights in the Middle Ages, engaged in what were usually non-physical and non-marital relationships with women of nobility whom they served. These relations were highly elaborate and ritualized in a complexity that was steeped in a framework of tradition, which stemmed from theories of etiquette derived out of chivalry as a moral code of conduct.\\r\\n\\r\\nCourtly love and the notion of domnei were often the subjects of troubadours, and could be typically found in artistic endeavors such as lyrical narratives and poetic prose of the time. Since marriage was commonly nothing more than a formal arrangement,[6] courtly love sometimes permitted expressions of emotional closeness that may have been lacking from the union between husband and wife.[7] In terms of courtly love, \\"lovers\\" did not necessarily refer to those engaging in sexual acts, but rather, to the act of caring and to emotional intimacy.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe bond between a knight and his Lady, or the woman of typically high stature of whom he served, may have escalated psychologically but seldom ever physically.[8] For knighthood during the Middle Ages, the intrinsic importance of a code of conduct was in large part as a value system of rules codified as a guide to aid a knight in his capacity as champion of the downtrodden, but especially in his service to the Lord.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the context of dutiful service to a woman of high social standing, ethics designated as a code were effectively established as an institution to provide a firm moral foundation by which to combat the idea that unfit attentions and affections were to ever be tolerated as \\"a secret game of trysts\\" behind closed doors. Therefore, a knight trained in the substance of \\"chivalry\\" was instructed, with especial emphasis, to serve a lady most honorably, with purity of heart and mind. To that end, he committed himself to the welfare of both Lord and Lady with unwavering discipline and devotion, while at the same time, presuming to uphold core principles set forth in the code by the religion by which he followed.[8]\\r\\n\\r\\nReligious meditations upon the Virgin Mary were partially responsible for the development of chivalry as an ethic and lifestyle:  the concept of the honor of a lady and knightly devotion to her, coupled with an obligatory respect for all women, factored prominently as central to the very identity of medieval knighthood. As knights were increasingly emulated, eventual changes were reflected in the inner-workings of feudal society. Members of the aristocracy were schooled in the principles of chivalry, which facilitated important changes in attitudes regarding the value of women.[9]\\r\\n\\r\\nBehaviorally, a knight was to regard himself towards a lady with a transcendence of premeditated thoughthis virtue ingrained within his character. A chevalier was to conduct himself always graciously, bestowing upon her the utmost courtesy and attentiveness. He was to echo shades of this to all women, regardless of class, age, or status.[10] Over time, the concept of chivalry and the notion of the courtly gentleman became synonymous with the ideal of how love and romance should exist between the sexes. Through the timeless popularization in art and literature of tales of knights and princesses, kings and queens, a formative and long standing (sub)consciousness helped to shape relationships between men and women.\\r\\n\\r\\nDe amore or The Art of Courtly Love, as it is known in English, was written in the 12th century. The text is widely misread as permissive of extramarital affairs. However, it is useful to differentiate the physical from without: romantic love as separate and apart from courtly love when interpreting such topics as: \\"Marriage is no real excuse for not loving\\", \\"He who is not jealous cannot love\\", \\"No one can be bound by a double love\\", and \\"When made public love rarely endures\\".[11]\\r\\n\\r\\nSome believe that romantic love evolved independently in multiple cultures. For example, in an article presented by Henry Grunebaum, he argues \\"therapists mistakenly believe that romantic love is a phenomenon unique to Western cultures and first expressed by the troubadours of the Middle Ages.\\"[12]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe more current and Western traditional terminology meaning \\"court as lover\\" or the general idea of \\"romantic love\\" is believed to have originated in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, primarily from that of the French culture. This idea is what has spurred the connection between the words \\"romantic\\" and \\"lover,\\" thus coining English phrases for romantic love such as \\"loving like the Romans do.\\" The precise origins of such a connection are unknown, however. Although the word \\"romance\\" or the equivalents thereof may not have the same connotation in other cultures, the general idea of \\"romantic love\\" appears to have crossed cultures and been accepted as a concept at one point in time or another.\\r\\n\\r\\nRomantic love is contrasted with platonic love, which in all usages, precludes sexual relations, yet only in the modern usage does it take on a fully nonsexual sense, rather than the classical sense, in which sexual drives are sublimated. Sublimation tends to be forgotten in casual thought about love aside from its emergence in psychoanalysis and Nietzsche.[citation needed]\\r\\n\\r\\nUnrequited love can be romantic in different ways: comic, tragic, or in the sense that sublimation itself is comparable to romance, where the spirituality of both art and egalitarian ideals is combined with strong character and emotions. Unrequited love is typical of the period of romanticism, but the term is distinct from any romance that might arise within it.[13]\\r\\n\\r\\nRomantic love may also be classified according to two categories, \\"popular romance\\" and \\"divine or spiritual\\" romance:\\r\\n\\r\\nGreek philosophers and authors have had many theories of love. Some of these theories are presented in Plato's Symposium. Six Athenian friends, including Socrates, drink wine and each give a speech praising the deity Eros. When his turn comes, Aristophanes says in his mythical speech that sexual partners seek each other because they are descended from beings with spherical torsos, two sets of human limbs, genitalia on each side, and two faces back to back. Their three forms included the three permutations of pairs of gender (i.e. one masculine and masculine, another feminine and feminine, and the third masculine and feminine) and they were split by the gods to thwart the creatures' assault on heaven, recapitulated, according to the comic playwright, in other myths such as the Aloadae.[15]\\r\\n\\r\\nThis story is relevant to modern romance partly because of the image of reciprocity it shows between the sexes. In the final speech before Alcibiades arrives, Socrates gives his encomium of love and desire as a lack of being, namely, the being or form of beauty.\\r\\n\\r\\nThough there are many theories of romantic lovesuch as that of Robert Sternberg, in which it is merely a mean combining liking and sexual desirethe major theories involve far more insight. For most of the 20th century, Freud's theory of the family drama dominated theories of romance and sexual relationships. This gave rise to a few counter-theories. Theorists like Deleuze counter Freud and Jacques Lacan by attempting to return to a more naturalistic philosophy:\\r\\n\\r\\nRen Girard argues that romantic attraction is a product of jealousy and rivalryparticularly in a triangular form.\\r\\n\\r\\nGirard, in any case, downplays romance's individuality in favor of jealousy and the love triangle, arguing that romantic attraction arises primarily in the observed attraction between two others. A natural objection is that this is circular reasoning, but Girard means that a small measure of attraction reaches a critical point insofar as it is caught up in mimesis. Shakespeare's A Midsummer Night's Dream, As You Like It, and The Winter's Tale are the best known examples of competitive-induced romance.[16]\\r\\n\\r\\nGirard's theory of mimetic desire is controversial because of its alleged sexism. This view has to some extent supplanted its predecessor, Freudian Oedipal theory. It may find some spurious support in the supposed attraction of women to aggressive men. As a technique of attraction, often combined with irony, it is sometimes advised that one feign toughness and disinterest, but it can be a trivial or crude idea to promulgate to men, and it is not given with much understanding of mimetic desire in mind. Instead, cultivating a spirit of self-sacrifice, coupled with an attitude of appreciation or contemplation, directed towards the other of one's attractions, constitutes the ideals of what we consider to be true romantic love. Mimesis is always the desire to possess, in renouncing it we offer ourselves as a sacrificial gift to the other.[17]\\r\\n\\r\\nMimetic desire is often challenged by feminists, such as Toril Moi,[18] who argue that it does not account for the woman as inherently desired.\\r\\n\\r\\nThough the centrality of rivalry is not itself a cynical view, it does emphasize the mechanical in love relations. In that sense, it does resonate with capitalism and cynicism native to post-modernity. Romance in this context leans more on fashion and irony, though these were important for it in less emancipated times. Sexual revolutions have brought change to these areas. Wit or irony therefore encompass an instability of romance that is not entirely new but has a more central social role, fine-tuned to certain modern peculiarities and subversion originating in various social revolutions, culminating mostly in the 1960s.[19]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe process of courtship also contributed to Arthur Schopenhauer's pessimism, despite his own romantic success,[20] and he argued that to be rid of the challenge of courtship would drive people to suicide with boredom. Schopenhauer theorized that individuals seek partners who share certain interests and tastes, while at the same time looking for a \\"complement\\" or completing of themselves in a partner, as in the clich that \\"opposites attract\\", but with the added consideration that both partners manifest this attraction for the sake of the species:\\r\\n\\r\\nBut what ultimately draws two individuals of different sex exclusively to each other with such power is the will-to-live which manifests itself in the whole species, and here anticipates, in the individual that these two can produce, an objectification of its true nature corresponding to its aims. \\r\\nWorld as Will and Representation, Volume 2, Chapter XLIV\\r\\nLater modern philosophers such as La Rochefoucauld, David Hume and Jean-Jacques Rousseau also focused on morality, but desire was central to French thought and Hume himself tended to adopt a French worldview and temperament. Desire in this milieu meant a very general idea termed \\"the passions,\\" and this general interest was distinct from the contemporary idea of \\"passionate\\" now equated with \\"romantic.\\" Love was a central topic again in the subsequent movement of Romanticism, which focused on such things as absorption in nature and the absolute, as well as platonic and unrequited love in German philosophy and literature.\\r\\n\\r\\nFrench philosopher Gilles Deleuze linked this idea of love as a lack mainly to Sigmund Freud, and Deleuze often criticized it.\\r\\n\\r\\nShakespeare and S?ren Kierkegaard share a similar viewpoint that marriage and romance are not harmoniously in tune with each other. In Shakespeare's Measure for Measure, for example, \\"...there has not been, nor is there at this point, any display of affection between Isabella and the Duke, if by affection we mean something concerned with sexual attraction. The two at the end of the play love each other as they love virtue.\\"[21] In Romeo and Juliet, in saying \\"all combined, save what thou must combine By holy marriage,\\" Romeo implies that it is not marriage with Juliet that he seeks but simply to be joined with her romantically.\\r\\n\\r\\nKierkegaard addressed these ideas in works such as Either/Or and Stages on Life's Way:\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the first place, I find it comical that all men are in love and want to be in love, and yet one never can get any illumination upon the question what the lovable, i.e., the proper object of love, really is.\\r\\n\\r\\n Stages, p. 48\\r\\n\\r\\nIn How to Make Good Decisions and Be Right All the Time, British writer Iain King tried to establish rules for romance  applicable across most cultures.  He concluded on six rules, including:\\r\\n\\r\\nThe \\"tragic\\" contradiction between romance and society is most forcibly portrayed in literature, in Tolstoy's Anna Karenina, in Flaubert's Madame Bovary, and William Shakespeare's Romeo and Juliet. The female protagonists in such stories are driven to suicide as if dying for a cause of freedom from various oppressions of marriage.\\r\\n\\r\\nEven after sexual revolutions, on the other hand, to the extent that it does not lead to procreation (or child-rearing, as it also might exist in same-sex marriage), romance remains peripheral though it may have virtues in the relief of stress, as a source of inspiration or adventure, or in development and the strengthening of certain social relations. It is difficult to imagine the tragic heroines, however, as having such practical considerations in mind.\\r\\n\\r\\nRomance can also be tragic in its conflict with society. The Tolstoy family focuses on the romantic limitations of marriage, and Anna Karenina prefers death to being married to her fianc, however this is because she is tired of waiting and being hidden away from public, when her fiance makes failed attempts to get his mother's approval of the marriage. Even being aristocrats did not make them both free, as the society was nevertheless equally binding for all. Furthermore, in the speech about marriage that is given in Kierkegaard's Either/Or, Kierkegaard attempts to show that it is because marriage is lacking in passion fundamentally, that the nature of marriage, unlike romance, is explainable by a man who has experience of neither marriage nor love.\\r\\n\\r\\nReciprocity of the sexes appears in the ancient world primarily in myth where it is in fact often[when?] the subject of tragedy, for example in the myths of Theseus and Atalanta. Noteworthy female freedom or power was an exception rather than the rule, though this is a matter of speculation and debate.\\r\\n\\r\\nMany theorists attempt to analyze the process of romantic love.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnthropologist Helen Fisher, in her book Why We Love,[23] uses brain scans to show that love is the product of a chemical reaction in the brain. Norepinephrine and dopamine, among other brain chemicals, are responsible for excitement and bliss in humans as well as non-human animals. She is famous for the use of MRI to study the brain activity of a person \\"in love\\", discovering the importance of the ventral tegmental area and the caudate nucleus in this biological drive.\\r\\n\\r\\nFisher concludes that these reactions have a genetic basis, and therefore love is a natural drive as powerful as hunger.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn his book What Women Want, What Men Want,[24] anthropologist John Townsend takes the genetic basis of love one step further by identifying how the sexes are different in their predispositions.\\r\\n\\r\\nTownsend's compilation of various research projects concludes that men are susceptible to youth and beauty, whereas women are susceptible to status and security. These differences are part of a natural selection process where males seek many healthy women of childbearing age to mother offspring, and women seek men who are willing and able to take care of them and their children.\\r\\n\\r\\nPsychologist Karen Horney in her article \\"The Problem of the Monogamous Ideal\\",[25] indicates that the overestimation of love leads to disillusionment; the desire to possess the partner results in the partner wanting to escape; and the friction against sex result in non-fulfillment. Disillusionment plus the desire to escape plus non-fulfillment result in a secret hostility, which causes the other partner to feel alienated. Secret hostility in one and secret alienation in the other cause the partners to secretly hate each other. This secret hate often leads one or the other or both to seek love objects outside the marriage or relationship.\\r\\n\\r\\nPsychologist Harold Bessell in his book The Love Test,[26] reconciles the opposing forces noted by the above researchers and shows that there are two factors that determine the quality of a relationship.\\r\\n\\r\\nBessell proposes that people are drawn together by a force he calls \\"romantic attraction,\\" which is a combination of genetic and cultural factors. This force may be weak or strong and may be felt to different degrees by each of the two love partners. The other factor is \\"emotional maturity,\\" which is the degree to which a person is capable of providing good treatment in a love relationship. It can thus be said that an immature person is more likely to overestimate love, become disillusioned, and have an affair whereas a mature person is more likely to see the relationship in realistic terms and act constructively to work out problems.\\r\\n\\r\\nRomantic love, in the abstract sense of the term, is traditionally considered to involve a mix of emotional and sexual desire for another as a person. However, Lisa M. Diamond, a University of Utah psychology professor, proposes that sexual desire and romantic love are functionally independent[27] and that romantic love is not intrinsically oriented to same-gender or other-gender partners. She also proposes that the links between love and desire are bidirectional as opposed to unilateral. Furthermore, Diamond does not state that one's sex has priority over another sex (a male or female) in romantic love because her theory suggests it is as possible for someone who is homosexual to fall in love with someone of the other gender as for someone who is heterosexual to fall in love with someone of the same gender.[28] In her 2012 review of this topic, Diamond emphasized that what is true for men may not be true for women. According to Diamond, in most men sexual orientation is fixed and most likely innate, but in many women sexual orientation may vary from 0 to 6 on the Kinsey scale and back again.[29]\\r\\n\\r\\nMartie Haselton, a psychologist at UCLA, considers romantic love a \\"commitment device\\",  or mechanism that encourages two humans to form a lasting bond. She has explored the evolutionary rationale that has shaped modern romantic love and has concluded that long-lasting relationships are helpful to ensure that children reach reproductive age and are fed and cared for by two parents. Haselton and her colleagues have found evidence in their experiments that suggest love's adaptation. The first part of the experiments consists of having people think about how much they love someone and then suppress thoughts of other attractive people. In the second part of the experiment the same people are asked to think about how much they sexually desire those same partners and then try to suppress thoughts about others. The results showed that love is more efficient in pushing out those rivals than sex.[30]\\r\\n\\r\\nResearch by the University of Pavia suggests that romantic love lasts for about a year (similar with limerence) before being replaced by a more stable form of love called companionate love.[31] In companionate love, changes occur from the early stage of love to when the relationship becomes more established and romantic feelings seem to end. However, research from Stony Brook University in New York suggests that some couples keep romantic feelings alive for much longer.[32]\\r\\n\\r\\nThese are the major theories[citation needed] associated with current research on romantic relationships, especially in the context of positive psychology[citation needed].\\r\\n\\r\\nAttachment styles that people develop as children can influence the way that they interact with partners in adult relationships, with secure attachment styles being associated with healthier and more trusting relationships than avoidant or anxious attachment styles.[33][34] Hazen and Shaver found that adult romantic attachment styles were similar to the categories of secure, avoidant, and anxious that had previously been studied in childrens attachments to their caregivers, demonstrating that attachment styles are stable across the lifespan.[35] Later on, researchers distinguished between dismissive avoidant attachment and fearful avoidant attachment.[36] Others have found that secure adult attachment, leading to the ability for intimacy and confidence in relationship stability, is characterized by low attachment-related anxiety and avoidance, while the fearful style is high on both dimensions, the dismissing style is low on anxiety and high on avoidance, and the preoccupied style is high on anxiety and low on avoidance.[37]\\r\\n\\r\\nSinger (1984a,[38] 1984b,[39] 1987[40]) first defined love based on four Greek terms: eros, meaning the search for beauty; philia, the feelings of affection in close friendships, nomos, the submission of and obedience to higher or divine powers, and agape, the bestowal of love and affection for the divine powers. While Singer did believe that love was important to world culture, he did not believe that romantic love played a major role (Singer, 1987[40]). However, Susan Hendrick and Clyde Hendrick at Texas Tech University (1992,[41] 2009[42]) have theorized that romantic love will play an increasingly important cultural role in the future, as it is considered an important part of living a fulfilling life. They also theorized that love in long-term romantic relationships has only been the product of cultural forces that came to fruition within the past 300 years. By cultural forces, they mean the increasing prevalence of individualistic ideologies, which are the result of an inward shift of many cultural worldviews.\\r\\n\\r\\nResearchers have determined that romantic love is a complex emotion that can be divided into either passionate or companionate forms.[43] Berscheid and Walster (1978[44]) and Hatfield (1988[45]) found that these two forms can co-exist, either simultaneously or intermittently. Passionate love is an arousal-driven emotion that often gives people extreme feelings of happiness, and can also give people feelings of anguish.[citation needed] Companionate love is a form that creates a steadfast bond between two people, and gives people feelings of peace. Researchers have described the stage of passionate love as \\"being on cocaine,\\" since during that stage the brain releases the same neurotransmitter, dopamine, as when cocaine is being used.[46] It is also estimated that passionate love (as with limerence) lasts for about twelve to eighteen months.[47]\\r\\n\\r\\nRobert Firestone, a psychologist, has a theory of the fantasy bond, which is what is mostly created after the passionate love has faded. A couple may start to feel really comfortable with each other to the point that they see each other as simply companions or protectors, but yet think that they are still in love with each other.[48] The results to the fantasy bond is the leading to companionate love. \\r\\nHendrick and Hendrick (1995[49]) studied college students who were in the early stages of a relationship and found that almost half reported that their significant other was their closest friend, providing evidence that both passionate and companionate love exist in new relationships. Conversely, in a study of long-term marriages, researchers (Contreras, Hendrick, and Hendrick, 1996[50]) found that couples endorsed measures of both companionate love and passionate love and that passionate love was the strongest predictor of marital satisfaction, showing that both types of love can endure throughout the years.\\r\\n\\r\\nPsychologist Robert Sternberg (1986[51]) developed the triangular theory of love. He theorized that love is a combination of three main components: passion (physical arousal); intimacy (psychological feelings of closeness); and commitment (the sustaining of a relationship). He also theorized that the different combinations of these three components could yield up to seven different forms of love. These include popularized forms such as romantic love (intimacy and passion) and consummate love (passion, intimacy, and commitment). The other forms are liking (intimacy), companionate love (intimacy and commitment), empty love (commitment), fatuous love (passion and commitment), and infatuation (passion).\\r\\nStudies on Sternbergs theory love found that intimacy most strongly predicted marital satisfaction in married couples, with passion also being an important predictor (Silberman, 1995[52]). On the other hand, Acker and Davis (1992[53]) found that commitment was the strongest predictor of relationship satisfaction, especially for long-term relationships.\\r\\n\\r\\nResearchers Arthur and Elaine Aron (1986[54]) theorized that humans have a basic drive to expand their self-concepts. Further, their experience with Eastern concepts of love caused them to believe that positive emotions, cognitions, and relationships in romantic behaviors all drive the expansion of a persons self-concept. A study following college students for 10 weeks showed that those students who fell in love over the course of the investigation reported higher feelings of self-esteem and self efficacy than those who did not (Aron, Paris, and Aron, 1995[55]).\\r\\n\\r\\nHarvey and Ormarzu (1997[56]) developed a model of minding relationships with five key components: seeking to know and be known by the other; using knowledge learned in a relationship to enhance the relationship; accepting the other person; being motivated to continue this process of learning, enhancing, and accepting; and developing a sense of appreciation in the relationship. Each of these components is considered adaptive, however, nonadaptive steps to minding a relationship were also theorized by the research team. The five nonadaptive components include: one or both partners out of step in seeking to know and be known by the other; not using the knowledge learned in a relationship to enhance the relationship (or using that knowledge to hurt the other); low acceptance and respect for the other person; not being motivated to continue the process of learning, enhancing, and accepting; and failing to develop a sense of appreciation in a relationship. Gottman studies the components of a flourishing romantic relationship have been studied in the lab (1994;[57] Gottman & Silver, 1999[58]). He used physiological and behavioral measures during couples interactions to predict relationship success and found that five positive interactions to one negative interaction are needed to maintain a healthy relationship. He established a therapy intervention for couples that focused on civil forms of disapproval, a culture of appreciation, acceptance of responsibility for problems, and self-soothing (Gottman, Driver, & Tabares, 2002[59]).\\r\\n\\r\\nThe most recent[citation needed] research on romantic love and relationships focuses on behaviors that either sustain a relationship or aid in its dissolution. These behaviors can be considered either appetitive or aversive. Appetitive relationship processes are considered the promotion of positive relationship behaviors, as determined by psychologists Gable and Reis (2001,[60] 2003[61]). Aversive relationship processes are described as eliminating behaviors that have a negative effect on relationships (Gable and Reis 2001,[60] 2003[61]). This new research has also allowed relationship success to be predicted as a function of these appetitive and aversive processes. This is all related to research that shows that sharing positive life events with ones partner is related to greater relationship satisfaction and intimacy (Gable et al., 2004[62]). In research by Gable et al. (2003) appetitive (promotion of positive relationship behaviors) and aversive (elimination of negative relationship behaviors) processes are independent constructs. A specific type of appetitive processing, capitalization, leads to increased relationship satisfaction and intimacy when one member of the relationship tells the other about positive life events and receive quality reactions and feedback from the partner (Gable, Reis, Impett, & Asher, 2004[62]).\\r\\n\\r\\nAwareness of major theories on positive romantic relationships and knowledge of proven findings that support them gives couples the tools to strengthen their relationships and allows single individuals to have the resources to build a flourishing relationship in the future. Access to information like this could contribute to the reduction of divorce rates, as well as producing happier and healthier home lives for many families. For example, though there appears to be a correlation between an increased divorce rate and premarital cohabitation, living with a person of romantic interest before marriage still appears to be a common and growing trend.[63] Knowledge of this is one way positive psych could help aid flourishing relationships.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn addition to the aforementioned factors, awareness would also provide the opportunity for people to better understand or empathize with those who may not illustrate the level of positivity found in these major theories. Knowing this information can help with coming to terms with someone that is particularly difficult in a given romantic relationship, and could help one aid them to a better outlook through this gain of knowledge. The attachment style of individuals has a strong influence on the way future relationships are created and harnessed. While those with a secure attachment style fare better, one may be prone to more bumps in the road if having a disorganized style of attachment.\\r\\n\\r\\nWith a heightened awareness comes an upward spiral of positive relationships in general. Having younger individuals modeled by positive interactions would, in turn, greatly influence the probability of these individuals implementing such behaviors in their own social relationships.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt can be said that romantic love creates pair bonding between two individuals. It also increases the amount of available resources by combining those of two separate individuals thus leading to an increase in the reproductive fitness of potential offspring. This can be seen in the animal kingdom as well. For example, researchers observed the survival rate of mice offspring in father present and father absent environments and discovered that while both groups had approximately the same birth rate, with the father absent group even being a little bit higher, ultimately only 26% of the offspring in father absent group survived to emergence as opposed to the 81% of offspring that survived in the father present group.[64]\\r\\n\\r\\nResearchers such as Feeney and Noller question the stability of attachment style across the life span since studies that measured attachment styles at time points ranging from 2 weeks to 8 months found that 1 out of 4 adults' attachment style changed.[65] Furthermore, a study by Lopez and Gormley found that attachment styles could change during the first year of college and that changes to more secure attachment styles were associated with adjustments in self-confidence ratings and coping styles.[66] On the other hand, attachment styles in childhood mirror the ones found in adult romantic relationships.[67] In addition, research has shown that building interpersonal connections strengthens neural regulatory systems that are involved in emotions of empathy, enjoyment of positive social events, and stress management,[68][69] providing evidence that early social interactions affect adult relationships.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnother topic of controversy in the field of romantic relationships is that of domestic abuse. Following the theory that romantic love evolved as a byproduct of survival, it can be said that in some instances, it has turned into a maladaptation. Oxytocin is a neurophysical hormone produced in the brain. It is known to cause a decrease in stress response. It also can cause an increase in feelings of attachment. In the beginning stages of a romantic relationship, OT levels surge and then remain relatively stable over the duration of the relationship. The higher the surge of OT, the greater the likelihood is of partners staying together.[70] It plays an important role in increasing positive interpersonal behaviors such as trust, altruism, empathy, etc.[71] This response is not universal and can in fact, cause the opposite to occur depending on environment and individual. Individuals ranked high in rejection sensitivity exhibited aggressive tendencies and decreased willingness for cooperation, indicating a link between oxytocin and relationship maintenance.[72]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe feelings associated with romantic love function to ensure the greater reproductive fitness of individuals. The obligations of individuals in romantic relationships to preserve these bonds are based in kin selection theory, where by exhibiting aggressive behavior, a mate can use intimidation and dominance to ward off other potential predators, thus protecting the pair bond and their actual or potential offspring. This has however evolved to the point where it has become detrimental to the fitness of individuals; what is causing attachment to occur in a relationship, is now causing one partner to harm the other.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the search for the root of intimate partner violence, intranasal oxytocin was administered to a control group and a group of participants with aggressive tendencies. Participants were then surveyed on how willing they were to engage in 5 behaviors towards their romantic partner. What they found was that oxytocin increased IPV inclinations only among the participants with a predisposition towards aggressive tendencies.[73] Oxytocin decreases trust and prosocial behavior in individuals with interpersonal difficulties. This, coupled with its role in relationship maintenance, illustrates that oxytocin serves to instill a sense of territoriality and protectiveness towards a mate.","input":"When did the concept of romantic love begin?"},{"output":"on 25 June 1950","context":"","input":"When did the north and south korea war start?"},{"output":"one British shilling was worth 24 US cents","context":"The shilling is a unit of currency formerly used in Austria, the United Kingdom, Australia, New Zealand, United States, and other British Commonwealth countries. Currently the shilling is used as a currency in four east African countries of Kenya (Kenyan shilling) Tanzania (Tanzanian shilling) Uganda (Ugandan shilling) and Somalia (Somali shilling) (autonomous region of Somalia Somaliland (Somaliland Shilling). It is also the proposed currency of the east African community plans to introduce (east African shilling). The word shilling comes from scilling, an accounting term that dates back to Anglo-Saxon times, and from there back to Old Norse, where it means \\"division\\".\\r\\nSlang terms for the old shilling coins include \\"bob\\" and \\"hog\\". While the derivation of \\"bob\\" is uncertain, John Camden Hotten in his 1864 Slang Dictionary says the original version was \\"bobstick\\" and wonders if it is connected with Sir Robert Walpole.[1]\\r\\nOne abbreviation for shilling is s (for solidus, see Ssd). Often it was represented by a solidus symbol (\\"/\\"), which may have originally stood for a long s or ?,[2] thus 1/9 would be one shilling and ninepence (and equivalent to 21d; the shilling itself was equal to 12d). A price with no pence was sometimes written with a solidus and a dash: 11/ÿ.\\r\\nThe solidus symbol is still used for the shilling currency unit in former British East Africa, rather than sh.\\r\\nDuring the Great Recoinage of 1816, the mint was instructed to coin one troy pound (weighing 5760 grains or 373?g) of standard (0.925 fine) silver into 66 shillings, or its equivalent in other denominations. This set the weight of the shilling, and its subsequent decimal replacement 5 new pence coin, at 87.2727 grains or 5.655?grams from 1816 until 1990, when a new smaller 5p coin was introduced.\\r\\nIn the past, the English world[clarification needed] has had various myths about the shilling. One myth was that it was deemed to be the value of a cow in Kent or a sheep elsewhere.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nA shilling was a coin used in England from the reign of Henry VII[3] (or Edward VI around 1550). The shilling continued in use after the Acts of Union of 1707 created a new United Kingdom from the Kingdoms of England and Scotland, and under Article 16 of the Articles of Union, a common currency for the new United Kingdom was created.\\r\\nThe term shilling (Scots: schilling) was in use in Scotland from early medieval times.\\r\\nThe common currency created in 1707 by Article 16 of the Articles of Union continued in use until decimalisation in 1971. In the traditional pounds, shillings and pence system, there were 20 shillings per pound and 12 pence per shilling, and thus there were 240 pence in a pound.\\r\\nThree coins denominated in multiple shillings were also in circulation at this time. They were:\\r\\nAt decimalisation in 1971, the shilling coin was superseded by the new five-pence piece, which initially was of identical size and weight and had the same value, and inherited the shilling's slang name of a bob. Shillings remained in circulation until the five pence coin was reduced in size in 1991.\\r\\nBetween 1701 and the unification of the currencies in 1825, the Irish shilling was valued at 13 pence and known as the \\"black hog\\", as opposed to the 12-pence English shillings which were known as \\"white hogs\\".\\r\\nIn the Irish Free State and Republic of Ireland the shilling was issued as scilling in Irish. It was worth 1/20th of an Irish pound, and was interchangeable at the same value to the British coin, which continued to be used in Northern Ireland. The coin featured a bull on the reverse side. The first minting, from 1928 until 1941, contained 75% silver, more than the equivalent British coin. The original Irish shilling coin (retained after decimalisation)) was withdrawn from circulation on 1 January 1993, when a smaller five pence coin was introduced.\\r\\nAustralian shillings, twenty of which made up one Australian pound, were first issued in 1910, with the Australian coat of arms on the reverse and King Edward VII on the face. The coat of arms design was retained through the reign of King George V until a new ram's head design was introduced for the coins of King George VI. This design continued until the last year of issue in 1963. In 1966, Australia's currency was decimalised and the shilling was replaced by a ten?cent coin (Australian), where 10 shillings made up one Australian dollar.\\r\\nThe slang term for a shilling coin in Australia was \\"deener\\". The slang term for a shilling as currency unit was \\"bob\\", the same as in the United Kingdom.\\r\\nAfter 1966, shillings continued to circulate, as they were replaced by 10-cent coins of the same size and weight.\\r\\nNew Zealand shillings, twenty of which made up one New Zealand pound, were first issued in 1933 and featured the image of a Maori warrior carrying a taiaha \\"in a warlike attitude\\" on the reverse.[4] In 1967, New Zealand's currency was decimalised and the shilling was replaced by a ten cent coin of the same size and weight. Smaller 10-cent coins were introduced in 2006.\\r\\nShillings were used in Malta, prior to decimalisation in 1972, and had a face value of five Maltese cents.\\r\\nIn British Ceylon, a shilling (Sinhalese: Silima, Tamil: Silin) was equivalent to eight fanams. With the replacement of the rixdollar by the rupee in 1852, a shilling was deemed to be equivalent to half a rupee. On the decimalisation of the currency in 1869, a shilling was deemed to be equivalent to 50 Ceylon cents. The term continued to be used colloquially until the late 20th century.[5]\\r\\nThe East African shilling was in use in the British colonies and protectorates of British Somaliland, Kenya, Tanganyika, Uganda and Zanzibar from 1920, when it replaced the rupee, until after those countries became independent, and in Tanzania after that country was formed by the merger of Tanganyika and Zanzibar in 1964. Upon independence in 1960, the East African shilling in the State of Somaliland (former British Somaliland) and the Somali somalo in the Trust Territory of Somalia (former Italian Somaliland) were replaced by the Somali shilling.[6]\\r\\nIn 1966, the East African Monetary Union broke up, and the member countries replaced their currencies with the Kenyan shilling, the Ugandan shilling and the Tanzanian shilling, respectively.[7] Though all these currencies have different values at present, there were plans to reintroduce the East African shilling as a new common currency by 2009,[8] although this has not come about.\\r\\nIn the thirteen British colonies that became the United States in 1776, British money was often in circulation. Each colony issued its own paper money, with pounds, shillings, and pence used as the standard units of account. Some coins were minted in the colonies, such as the 1652 pine-tree shilling in the Massachusetts Bay Colony. After the United States adopted the dollar as its unit of currency and accepted the gold standard, one British shilling was worth 24 US cents. Due to ongoing shortages of US coins in some regions, shillings continued to circulate well into the 19th century. Shillings are described as the standard monetary unit throughout the autobiography of Solomon Northup (1853)[9] and mentioned several times in the Horatio Alger, Jr. story, Ragged Dick (1868).[10][11]\\r\\nThe Somali shilling is the official currency of Somalia. It is subdivided into 100 cents (English), senti (Somali, also ???) or centesimi (Italian).\\r\\nThe Somali shilling has been the currency of parts of Somalia since 1921, when the East African shilling was introduced to the former British Somaliland protectorate. Following independence in 1960, the somalo of Italian Somaliland and the East African shilling (which were equal in value) were replaced at par in 1962 by the Somali shilling. Names used for the denominations were cent, centesimo (plural: centesimi) and ??? (plurals: ??????? and ??????) together with shilling, scellino (plural: scellini) and ???.\\r\\nThat same year, the Banca Nazionale Somala issued notes for 5, 10, 20 and 100 scellini/shillings. In 1975, the Bankiga Qaranka Soomaaliyeed (Somali National Bank) introduced notes for 5, 10, 20 and 100 shilin/shillings. These were followed in 1978 by notes of the same denominations issued by the Bankiga Dhexe Ee Soomaaliya (Central Bank of Somalia). 50 shilin/shillings notes were introduced in 1983, followed by 500 shilin/shillings in 1989 and 1000 shilin/shillings in 1990. Also in 1990 there was an attempt to reform the currency at 100 to 1, with new banknotes of 20 and 50 new shilin prepared for the redenomination.[12]\\r\\nFollowing the breakdown in central authority that accompanied the civil war, which began in the early 1990s, the value of the Somali shilling was disrupted. The Central Bank of Somalia, the nation's monetary authority, also shut down operations. Rival producers of the local currency, including autonomous regional entities such as the Somaliland territory, subsequently emerged.\\r\\nSomalia's newly established Transitional Federal Government revived the defunct Central Bank of Somalia in the late 2000s. In terms of financial management, the monetary authority is in the process of assuming the task of both formulating and implementing monetary policy.[13] Owing to a lack of confidence in the Somali shilling, the US dollar is widely accepted as a medium of exchange alongside the Somali shilling. Dollarization notwithstanding, the large issuance of the Somali shilling has increasingly fueled price hikes, especially for low value transactions. This inflationary environment, however, is expected to come to an end as soon as the Central Bank assumes full control of monetary policy and replaces the presently circulating currency introduced by the private sector.[13]\\r\\nThe Somaliland shilling is the official currency of Somaliland, a self-declared republic that is internationally recognised as an autonomous region of Somalia.[14] The currency is not recognised as legal tender by the international community, and it currently has no official exchange rate. It is regulated by the Bank of Somaliland, the territory's central bank. Although the authorities in Somaliland have attempted to bar usage of the Somali shilling, Somalia's official currency is still the preferred means of exchange for many peoples in the region.[15]\\r\\nElsewhere in the former British Empire, forms of the word shilling remain in informal use. In Vanuatu and Solomon Islands, selen is used in Bislama and Pijin to mean \\"money\\"; in Malaysia, syiling (pronounced like shilling) means \\"coin\\". In Egypt and Jordan the shillin (Arabic: ????) is equal to 1/20th (five qirshes  Arabic: ????, English: piastres) of the Egyptian pound or the Jordanian dinar. In Belize, the term shilling is commonly used to refer to twenty-five cents.\\r\\nThe Austrian schilling was the currency of Austria between 1924 and 1938 and again between 1945 and 2002. It was replaced by the euro at a fixed parity of ?1 = 13.7603 schilling. The schilling was divided into 100 groschen.\\r\\nShillings were issued in the Scandinavian countries (skilling) until the Scandinavian Monetary Union of 1873, and in the city of Hamburg, Germany.\\r\\nIn Poland szel?g was used.[16]\\r\\nIn the principalities covering present Netherlands, Belgium and Luxemburg, the cognate term schelling was used as an equivalent 'arithmetic' currency, a 'solidus' representing 12 'denarii' or 1/20 'pound', while actual coins were rarely physical multiples of it, but still expressed in these terms.\\r\\nThe sol, later the sou, both also derived from the Roman solidus, were the equivalent coins in France, while the (nuevo) sol (PEN) remains the currency of Peru.\\r\\nAs in France, the Peruvian sol was originally named after the Roman solidus, but the name of the Peruvian currency is now much more closely linked to the Spanish word for the sun (sol). This helps explain the name of its temporary replacement, the inti, named for the Incan sun god.","input":"How much is a shilling in american money?"},{"output":"Shape of You","context":"This list of most-streamed songs on Spotify contains the top 100 songs with the most streams of all time, as derived from Spotify charts.

The three races were inaugurated in different years, the last being the Kentucky Derby in 1875. These races are now run annually in May and early June of each year. The Triple Crown Trophy, commissioned in 1950 but awarded to all previous winners as well as those after 1950, is awarded to a Triple Crown winner.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe first winner of all three Triple Crown races was Sir Barton in 1919. Some journalists began using the term Triple Crown to refer to the three races as early as 1923, but it was not until Gallant Fox won the three events in 1930 that Charles Hatton of the Daily Racing Form put the term into common use.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the history of the Triple Crown, 13 horses have won all three races: Sir Barton (1919), Gallant Fox (1930), Omaha (1935), War Admiral (1937), Whirlaway (1941), Count Fleet (1943), Assault (1946), Citation (1948), Secretariat (1973), Seattle Slew (1977), Affirmed (1978), American Pharoah (2015), and Justify (2018). As of 2018, American Pharoah and Justify are the only living Triple Crown winners.\\r\\n\\r\\nJames E. \\"Sunny Jim\\" Fitzsimmons was the first trainer to win the Triple Crown more than once; he trained both Gallant Fox and his son Omaha for the Belair Stud breeding farm. Gallant Fox and Omaha are the only father-son duo to win the Triple Crown. Bob Baffert became the second trainer to win the Triple Crown twice, training American Pharoah and Justify. Belair Stud and Calumet Farm are tied as the owners with the most Triple Crown victories with two apiece. Calumet Farms won with Whirlaway and Citation. Eddie Arcaro rode both of Calumet Farms' Triple Crown champions and is the only jockey to win more than one Triple Crown.\\r\\n\\r\\nSecretariat holds the stakes record time for each of the three races. His time of 2:24 for ?1?1?2 miles in the 1973 Belmont Stakes also set a world record that still stands.[1]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe three Triple Crown races had been run for decades before the series received its name; the Belmont Stakes was first run in 1867; the Preakness, in 1873;[2] and the Kentucky Derby, in 1875. The term was in use at least by 1923, although Daily Racing Form writer Charles Hatton is commonly credited with originating the term in 1930.[3]\\r\\n\\r\\nTheir order has varied. Before 1931, the Preakness was run before the Kentucky Derby eleven times. On May 12, 1917, and May 13, 1922, the Kentucky Derby and Preakness were run on the same day. Since 1931, the Kentucky Derby has been run first, followed by the Preakness, and then the Belmont.[4]\\r\\n\\r\\nEach Triple Crown race is open to both colts and fillies. Although fillies have won each of the individual Triple Crown races, none has won the Triple Crown itself.[5]  Despite attempts to develop a \\"Filly Triple Crown\\" or a \\"Triple Tiara\\" for fillies only, no set series of three races has consistently remained in the public eye, and at least four different configurations of races have been used.  Two fillies won the series of the Kentucky Oaks, the Pimlico Oaks (now the Black-Eyed Susan Stakes), and the Coaching Club American Oaks, in 1949 and 1952, but the racing press did not designate either accomplishment as a \\"triple crown\\".  In 1961, the New York Racing Association created a filly triple crown of in-state races only, but the races changed over the years.  Eight fillies won the NYRA Triple Tiara between 1968 and 1993.[6]\\r\\n\\r\\nGelded colts may run in any of the three races today, but they were prohibited from entering the Belmont between 1919 and 1957. Geldings have won each of the individual races,[7][8] but like fillies, no gelding has ever won the Triple Crown. The closest was Funny Cide, who won the Derby and the Preakness in 2003.[9]\\r\\n\\r\\nAll the races are held on dirt tracks, rather than the turf commonly used for important races in Europe.[citation needed]\\r\\n\\r\\nAt completion of the 2016 season, the three Triple Crown races have attracted 4,224 entrants. Of these, 292 horses have won a single leg of the Triple Crown, 52 horses have won two of the races (23 the Kentucky Derby and Preakness Stakes, 18 the Preakness Stakes and Belmont Stakes, and 11 the Kentucky Derby and Belmont Stakes), and 13 horses have won all three races. Pillory won both the Preakness Stakes and Belmont Stakes in 1922, a year when it was impossible to win the Triple Crown because the Kentucky Derby and Preakness Stakes were run on the same day.\\r\\n\\r\\n10 of the 13 winners have been \\"homebreds\\", owned at the time of their win by their breeders.[17]\\r\\n\\r\\nJim Fitzsimmons and Bob Baffert are the only two trainers to have two horses win the Triple Crown, with Fitzsimmons training the sire/son combination of 1930 winner Gallant Fox and 1935 winner Omaha and Baffert training 2015 winner American Pharoah and 2018 winner Justify. The wins by Fitzsimmons were also the first time that an owner and the first time that a breeder, Belair Stud holding both duties, had a repeat win of the Triple Crown. Calumet Farm is the only other owner with two Triple Crown horses, 1941 winner Whirlaway and 1948 winner Citation. Eddie Arcaro is the only jockey to ride two horses to the Triple Crown, both for Calumet, Whirlaway and Citation. Those two horses' trainers, Ben Jones and Jimmy Jones, were father and son.\\r\\n\\r\\nAll 13 horses, and most owners, trainers, and jockeys were born in the United States. The exceptions were jockey Johnny Longden, born in England and raised in Canada; French-born jockey Jean Cruguet; trainer Laz Barrera, from Cuba; and jockey Victor Espinoza, from Mexico. Secretariat's trainer, Lucien Laurin and jockey, Ron Turcotte were both Canadians. Owner Fannie Hertz was married to John D. Hertz, who was born in Slovakia; owner Ahmed Zayat was born in Egypt. Jockey Willie Saunders is considered a Canadian jockey because he grew up and established his career there, but was born in Montana. The horse Sir Barton was foaled in the United States but had a Canadian owner,  J. K. L. Ross, at the time of his Triple Crown win, while Justify's owners were from both the United States and China.\\r\\n\\r\\nSecretariat holds the stakes record for each of the Triple Crown races, the Kentucky Derby (1:59 2/5), the Preakness Stakes (1:53), and the Belmont Stakes (2:24).[18][19]\\r\\n\\r\\nAt 18, Steve Cauthen became the youngest jockey to win the Triple Crown, riding Affirmed in 1978. At 52, Mike Smith became the oldest jockey to win the Triple Crown, riding Justify in 2018.\\r\\n\\r\\nOnly one horse, Alydar, has placed (finished second) in all three races. He was defeated by Affirmed in all three races in 1978 by a combined margin of two lengths. His trainer John Veitch is the only trainer to have done this with one horse. In 1995, D. Wayne Lukas became the first and only major figure (owner, jockey, or trainer) to win all three Triple Crown races with different horses, Thunder Gulch in the Derby and Belmont, Timber Country in the Preakness.  Lukas also is the only trainer to have won six straight Triple Crown races, adding his 1995 wins, having won the 1994 Preakness and Belmont with Tabasco Cat and the 1996 Derby with Grindstone.[20]\\r\\n\\r\\nLike Veitch, only with two different horses, Bob Baffert also had second-place finishes in all three legs of the Triple Crown, both owned by Ahmed Zayat: in 2012, Bodemeister finished second in the Kentucky Derby and Preakness stakes to I'll Have Another, then Paynter was entered and finished second to Union Rags.[21]  Baffert and Zayat teamed up again for the 2015 Triple Crown victory of American Pharoah.\\r\\n\\r\\nGallant Fox is the only Triple Crown winner to sire another U.S. Triple Crown winner, Omaha. Affirmed sired Peteski, winner of the 1993 Canadian Triple Crown.[22]\\r\\n\\r\\nWhirlaway, in addition to winning the 1941 Triple Crown, also won the Travers Stakes that year, becoming the first and only horse to date to accomplish that feat.\\r\\n\\r\\nAmerican Pharoah, in addition to winning the 2015 Triple Crown, also won the Breeders' Cup Classic that year. As the Breeders' Cup was not established until 1984, American Pharoah was the first (and, as of 2018, only) horse to sweep all four races, a feat that came to be known as the Grand Slam.[23][24]\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter the first Triple Crown winner, Sir Barton, in 1919, there was not another winner until Gallant Fox in 1930, a gap of 11 years. Between 1930 and 1948, seven horses won the Triple Crown, with five years being the longest gap between winners. However, following the 1948 win of Citation, there was a considerable gap of 25 years before Secretariat ended the drought of Triple Crown champions in 1973. Between 1973 and 1978, there were three Triple Crown winners.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter Affirmed's Triple Crown in 1978, the longest drought in Triple Crown history began in 1979 with Spectacular Bid's failed Triple Crown attempt at the Belmont Stakes, and lasted until American Pharoah won in 2015. Between 1979 and 2014 thirteen horses won both the Kentucky Derby and Preakness Stakes, but either failed to win the Belmont Stakes or could not start in the race. Of those, Real Quiet came the closest to winning the Triple Crown, losing the Belmont Stakes by a nose in 1998. \\r\\nSpectacular Bid finished 3rd in 1979.\\r\\nPleasant Colony finished 3rd in 1981.\\r\\nAlysheba finished 4th in 1987.\\r\\nSunday Silence finished 2nd in 1989.\\r\\nReal Quiet finished 2nd in 1998.\\r\\nCharismatic finished 3rd in 1999.\\r\\nWar Emblem finished 8th in 2002.\\r\\nFunny Cide finished 3rd in 2003.\\r\\nSmarty Jones finished 2nd in 2004.\\r\\nBig Brown did not finish in 2008.\\r\\nI'll Have Another did not start (injury) 2012.\\r\\nCalifornia Chrome finished 4th in 2014.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the 1979-2015 period, horses who contested all three races, losing the Kentucky Derby but winning the Preakness and the Belmont were Risen Star in 1988, Hansel in 1991, Tabasco Cat in 1994, Point Given in 2001, and Afleet Alex in 2005. In 1984, Swale and in 1995, Thunder Gulch ran all three races, winning the Derby and the Belmont, but not the Preakness.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe 37-year gap between the Triple Crown wins of Affirmed and American Pharoah drew criticism of the system. As far back as 1986, reporters noted that horses who were fresh for the Belmont had an advantage.[25]  In 2003, Gary Stevens stated in an interview with Charlie Rose that he did not believe there would be another Triple Crown winner because of the tendency for owners to put fresh horses in the Preakness and Belmont Stakes.[26] California Chrome co-owner Steve Coburn was particularly critical of the Triple Crown system in post-Belmont remarks in 2014; he considered the system to be unfair, arguing that there would never be another Triple Crown winner in his lifetime unless only horses that competed in the Kentucky Derby and Preakness competed at the Belmont. By 2014, six of the previous eight Belmont winners had not competed in either of the first two legs of the Triple Crown.[27]  Additionally, from 2006 to 2014, the Belmont winner was a horse who had not competed in the Preakness.[28] American Pharoah was the first Belmont winner since Afleet Alex in 2005 to have run all three Triple Crown races.[29]\\r\\n\\r\\nSince all three races were inaugurated, as of  2017[update], 23 horses have won the Derby and Preakness but not the Belmont:\\r\\n\\r\\nOriginally, the three races largely organized their own nominations procedure, marketing and television broadcast rights. In 1985, Triple Crown Productions was created when the owner of Spend a Buck chose not to run in the other two Triple Crown races because of a financial incentive offered to any Kentucky Derby winner who could win a set of competing races in New Jersey. The organizers of the three races realized that they needed to work together.[45]\\r\\n\\r\\nEfforts to unify the sponsorship and marketing of all three Triple Crown races began in 1987 when ABC Sports negotiated a deal with Chrysler to pay $5 million to any horse that swept all three races, and $1 million each year there was no Triple Crown sweep to the horse with the highest combined Triple Crown finish.[46]  This sponsorship lasted until 1993. The end of the $1 million participation bonus was linked to the breakdown of Prairie Bayou at the Belmont Stakes that year and the uncomfortable situation that arose when the Kentucky Derby winner, Sea Hero, was given the bonus following a seventh-place finish.[45]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1995, Visa USA took over the sponsorship with a 10-year contract, naming the series the Visa Triple Crown and offering only the $5 million bonus to a horse that could sweep the Triple Crown.[47] Along with sponsorship by VISA, NBC Sports paid $51.5 million for broadcast rights to all three races, with the revenue split giving 50% of the total to Churchill Downs and 25% each to Pimlico and to the New York Racing Association (NYRA).[45]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Visa dealand the cooperative effortended after 2005. The NYRA felt that they did not get a fair share of the revenue, particularly when the Belmont had the highest ratings of all three races in the years where a Triple Crown was on the line.[45]  From 2001 through 2013, average viewership for the Belmont was 7 million when the Triple Crown was not at stake, whereas viewership averaged 13 million when it was.[a][48]  With the contract term ending, the NYRA went to ESPN on ABC for the 2006 Belmont, while the broadcasts of the Derby and Preakness remained with NBC.[45] Visa chose to remain as a sponsor of only Kentucky Derby for the next five years.[47] As a result of the divided broadcast, Triple Crown Productions was unable to obtain a new sponsor.[45]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn February 2011, ABC/ESPN dropped out of the negotiations to renew broadcast rights to the Belmont Stakes. NBC obtained the contract through 2015, once again uniting all three races on the same network.[49][50][51]  In 2014, NBC extended their contract for the Kentucky Derby through 2025.[52] As of  August 2015[update], NBC obtained a broadcast contract for the Belmont through 2020 and the Preakness through 2022.[53]","input":"What is the last horse to win the triple crown?"},{"output":"1863ÿ1864","context":"Coordinates: 130341N 801540E? / ?13.061262N 80.261103E? / 13.061262; 80.261103\\r\\nSpencer Plaza(Tamil: ????????? ??????) is a shopping mall located on Anna Salai in Chennai, Tamil Nadu, India, and is one of the modern landmarks of the city. Originally built during the period of the British Raj and reconstructed in 1985 on the site of the original Spencer's departmental store, it is the oldest shopping mall in India[1] and one of the biggest shopping malls in South Asia when it was built.[2] It is one of the earliest Grade A commercial projects of the city, which were developed in the second half of the 1990s.[3] As of March 2010, it is the 11th largest mall in the country with a gross lettable area of 530,000 sq ft.[4]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nSpencer Plaza was built in 1863ÿ1864, established by Charles Durant and J. W. Spencer in Anna Salai, then known as Mount Road, in the Madras Presidency. The property originally belonged to Spencer & Co Ltd. Spencer & Co opened the first Departmental store in the Indian subcontinent in 1895 and the store had over 80 individual departments. After a few years, Eugene Oakshott, owner of Spencer's, shifted the department store to a new building, which was an example of Indo-Saracenic style of architecture. The building was designed by W. N. Pogson. In 1983, the original building was destroyed in a fire. The present Spencer Plaza was constructed on the same site measuring about 10 acres and was opened in 1991.[1] Spread across a million square feet built in three phases with parking space for 800 cars, the plaza is one of the major hangout for the people of Chennai. The mall was developed by Mangal Tirth Estate Limited in January 1993.[5]\\r\\nThe plaza is an eight-storey shopping-cum-office complex of approximately 1.068 million sq ft, consisting of nearly 600,000 sq ft of air-conditioned shopping units and 400,000 square feet (37,000?m2) of office units. The shopping arcade is located on the ground, first and second floors in all the three phases and the office units are spread between the fourth and the seventh floors. The car parks are spread over the basement, ground, second and third floors, in addition to double basement parking lots in the third phase of the building.[6]\\r\\nThe first phase of the building consists of about 300,000 sq ft, including about 125,000 sq ft of centrally air-conditioned shopping space and 100,000 sq ft of office units together with about 75,000 sq ft of service areas. The second phase consists of about 400,000 sq ft, with a provision for about 600 cars at the basement, with shops with various sizes ranging from 300 square feet (28?m2) to 2,000 sq ft. The third phase covers another 300,000 sq ft.[7] The theme of the third phase is based on colonnaded structure recreating the old Spencers around a full-height atrium.[8]\\r\\nThere are over 700 shops in the plaza, and over 22,000 people visit the plaza every day, with the number increasing to 40,000 on weekends and to 60,000 on festival days. The complex has three counters to keep track of footfalls. Over 20,000 two-wheelers check into the parking lot on weekends.[7]\\r\\nBeing a high-rise building, the complex has wet riser system and electronic fire alarm system installed. The underground sump has a storage capacity of 100,000 litres (22,000?imp?gal; 26,000?US?gal). A ring main surrounds the building from the pump room, and there are five wet risers running from basement to the second floor and three wet risers running from the fourth floor to the seventh floor. These risers are located at strategic points in each floor. The pump room has three pumps, one jockey pump, one main pump with electrical driven motor and one main pump connected with diesel engine. The electronic fire detection system comprises smoke detectors and manual call points located in various points in common areas in all floors, sub-stations, electrical rooms, A/C plant and so forth, which are connected to a centralized computer located at the enclosures of the chief security officer. Tere are also many portable fire extinguishers to fight different types of fires, installed at each floor in different locations. The rear periphery of the building has fire escape stairs, with the fire escape routes displayed with signboards at various points of the building. The car ramps can also be used as fire escape routes. The building has two entrances, one from Binny Road and another from Anna Salai, for fire engines.[9]\\r\\nFire safety include water capacity of 1.2 million litres, fire sprinklers, smoke and heat detection systems and fire extinguishers. The in-house fire department has six firemen per shift.[7]\\r\\nThe mall hosts major anchor stores such as Westside (spread across 20,000 sq ft) and Landmark (40,000 sq ft), and several local and international brands such as Nike, Adidas, Bata, Regal, Health & Glow, Vummidiars, Van Heusen, Proline, Allen Solly, Florshaim shoes, Lipton, Louis Philippe, Titan, Levis, Casio, V.I.P. Luggage, Spencer & Co (40,000 sq ft on the ground, first and second floors), Timex Watch Showroom, Swatch, Cookie Man, BPL (Profx), Color Plus, Navigator, Witco, Pantaloons (26,000 sq ft), Arrow, Lee, Music World(now closed), Food World, HSBC, ABN AMRO, American Express, Citibank (65,000 sq ft in second and third phases), First Flight[2] and Du Bowl (16,000 sq ft).[10]McDonald's, world's largest fast food chain has established an outlet .\\r\\nOn 26 February 2004, the Sri Lanka Export Development Board (SLEDB) established a trade centre at the complex at a cost of ? 17 million. The Sri Lanka Trade Centre is spread over 20,000 sq ft on the first floor at the third phase of the building.[11][12] Seventeen frontline Sri Lankan companies are displaying apparel, artificial flowers, confectionaries, footwear and leather products, gems and jewellery, herbal products, light engineering products, porcelain, tableware, Ceylon tea, toys, transportation and airlines.[13][14]\\r\\nOn 4 September 2008, a fire erupted on the first floor of the building's first phase around 10:20?p.m. local time, perhaps due to a short circuit. A garment shop was burnt in the incident. However, with the help of 12 water tenders and 9 fire tenders, the fire was extinguished within 30 minutes, and no casualty was reported. The fire men had easy access to the spot, mainly due to the setback space available inside the building.[15][16]","input":"When was the first mall built in india?"},{"output":"Aurangzeb","context":"\\r\\n\\r\\nJharokha Darshan was a daily practice of addressing the public audience (darshan) at the balcony (jharokha) at the forts and palaces of medieval kings in India. It was an essential and direct way of communicating face-to-face with the public, and was a practice which was adopted by the Mughal emperors.[1] The balcony appearance in the name of Jharokha Darshan also spelled jharokha-i darshan was adopted by the 16th-century Mughal Emperor Akbar,[2][3][4] even though it was contrary to Islamic injunctions.[5] Earlier, Akbar's father Emperor Humayun had also adopted this Hindu practice of appearing before his subjects at the jharokha to hear their public grievances.[2]\\r\\n\\r\\nDarshan is a Sanskrit word which means \\"sight\\" and \\"beholding\\" (also means: \\"the viewing of an idol or a saint\\"[6]) which was adopted by Mughals for their daily appearance before their subjects. This also showed a Hindu influence,[7][8] It was first practiced by Humayun before Akbar adopted it as a practice at sunrise.[9][2] Jharokha is an easterly facing \\"ornate bay-window\\", canopied, throne-balcony, the \\"balcony for viewing\\" (an oriel window projecting out of the wall[10]) provided in every palace or fort where the kings or emperors resided during their reign. Its architecture served not only the basic need for lighting and ventilation but also attained a divine concept during the reign of Mughals. The jharokha appearances by the Mughals have been depicted by many paintings.[8]\\r\\n\\r\\nGiving Jharokha Darshan from this jharokha was a daily feature. This tradition was also continued by rulers who followed Akbar (r. 1556ÿ1605 CE). Jahangir (r. 1605ÿ27 CE) and Shah Jahan (r. 1628ÿ58 CE) also appeared before their subjects punctiliously. However, this ancient practice was discontinued by Aurangzeb during his 11th year of reign as he considered it a non-Islamic practice, a form of idol worship.[9] In Agra Fort and Red Fort, the jharokha faces the Yamuna and the emperor would stand alone on the jharokha to greet his subjects.[11]\\r\\n\\r\\nMughal emperors during their visits outside their capital used  to give Jharokha Darshan from their portable wooden house known as Do-Ashiayana Manzil.\\r\\n\\r\\nDuring the Delhi Durbar held in Delhi on 12 December 1911, King George V and his consort, Queen Mary, made a grand appearance at the jharokha of the Red Fort to give a \\"darshan\\" to 500,000 common people.[12]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Hindu practice of appearing before the people at the jharokha was started by Humayun, though the practice is generally credited to Akbar. Humayun had fixed a drum beneath the wall so that the petitioners assembled below the jharokha could beat it to draw his attention.[2]\\r\\n\\r\\nAkbar's daily practice of worshiping the sun in the early morning at his residence in Agra Fort led him to initiate the Jharokha Darshan. Hindus, who used to bathe in the river at that hour greeted Akbar when he appeared on the jharokha window for sun worship. It was also the period when Akbar was promoting his liberal religious policy, and in pursuance of this liberal approach he started the Jharokha Darshan.[13] Thereafter, Akbar  would religiously start his morning with prayers and then attend the Jharokha Darshan and greet the large audience gathered every day below the jharokha. He would spend about an hour at the jharokha \\"seeking acceptance of imperial authority as part of popular faith\\", and after this he would attend the court at the Diwan-i-Aam for two hours attending to administrative duties.[14]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe crowd of people assembled below the balcony generally consisted of soldiers, merchants, craft persons, peasants, women and sick children.[15] As the balcony was set high, the king would stand on a platform so that people gathered below could reassure themselves that he was alive and that the empire was stable; even when the sovereign was ill. He felt that it was necessary to see them publicly at least once a day in order to maintain his control, and guard against immediate anarchy. It also had a symbolic purpose. During this time people might make personal requests directly to Akbar, or present him with petitions for some cause. Akbar, therefore, began appearing at the jharokha twice a day and would hear the complaints of the people who wished to speak to him.[2][16] Sometimes, while the emperor gave his Jharokha Darshan, he would let out a thread down the jharokha so that people could tie their complaints and petitions seeking his attention and justice.[17] It was an effective way of communication and information exchange process, which Badauni, a contemporary of Akbar noted Jharokha Darshan worked effectively under Akbar who spent about four and half hours regularly in such darshan.[18] Akbar's paintings giving Jharokha Darshan are also popular.[4]\\r\\n\\r\\nAkbar's son, Emperor Jahangir, also continued the practice of Jharokha Darshan. In Agra Fort, the jharokha window is part of the structure which represents the Shah Burj, the Royal Tower. The tower is in the shape of an octagon and has a white marble pavilion. During Jahangir's time and even more frequently under Shah Jahan's rule this jharokha was used for giving darshan.[8][19] During Jahangir's Jharokha Darshan, hanging a string to tie petitions, was also practiced. This was also a Persian system under naushrwan. Jahangir elaborated on this system by adopting a golden chain to tie the petitions but Aurangzeb stopped it.[20] Nur Jahan, Jahangir's wife, was also known to have sat for the Jharokha Darshan and conducted administrative duty with the common people and hearing their pleas.[21] Jahangir was fully dedicated to the practice and made it a point to conduct the Jharokha Darshan even if he was sick; he had said \\"even in the time of weakness I have gone every day to the jharokha, though in great pain and sorrow, according to my fixed custom.\\"[9]\\r\\n\\r\\nJahangir's painting giving Jharokha Darshan shows him sitting at the jharokha in a side profile, bedecked with jewelry and wearing a red turban in the background of a pale purple coloured cushion.[8]\\r\\n\\r\\nEmperor Shah Jahan maintained a rigorous schedule during his entire thirty years rule and used to get up at 4 AM and, after ablutions and prayers, religiously appeared at the jharokha window to show himself to his subjects. During his stay in Agra or Delhi, huge crowds used to assemble to receive his darshan below the balcony. He would appear before the public 45 minutes after sunrise. His subjects would bow before him which he would reciprocate with his imperial salute. There was one particular group of people known as darshaniyas (akin to the guilds of Augustales of the Roman Empire) who were \\"servile\\" to the king and who would take their food only after they had a look at the face of the emperor which they considered as auspicious. More than half an hour had to be spent by the King at the balcony as it was the only time people could submit petitions to the king directly through the chain let down for the purpose (which was drawn up by attendants) of receiving such petitions by passing the nobles of the court.[6] At one time in 1657 when Shah Jahan was sick he could not appear for the Jharokha Darshan which spread speculations of his death.[8]\\r\\n\\r\\nThere were times when people used to gather below the jharokha window to hold protest demonstrations to place their grievances before the emperor. One such incident occurred in 1641 in Lahore when people who were affected by famine and were starving pleaded before Shah Jahan to provide famine relief.[9]\\r\\n\\r\\nIt is also said of Shah Jehan that his Islamic orthodoxy was more than that of his father or his grandfather and that he was skeptical to carry out the function of Jharokha Darshan as it could be misconstrued as worship of the sun. However, this practice was so deep-rooted with in the \\"Mughal Kingship and State\\" that he was compelled to continue this practice.[22]\\r\\n\\r\\nThere is a proof that Aurangzeb continued the Mughal practice of Jharokha Darshan in a painting dated 1710 in which he is shown at the jharokha with two noblemen in attendance in the foreground. In this painting, the emperor is painted in a side profile and has a white jama (upper garment) attire adorned with a turban in a background of blue colour.[8] In 1670, Hindus had assembled at the jharokha to protest against the jizya tax imposed on them by Aurangzeb.[9] However, Aurangzeb who was a \\"puritanical\\" and practiced strict Islamic codes of conduct in his  personal life, stopped this practice on the basis that it was idolization of human beings.[23]\\r\\n[24] He stopped this practice during the 11th year of his rule.[7] He also felt that it was \\"savouring of the Hindu ceremony of darshan\\".[25]\\r\\n\\r\\nDo-Ashiayana Manzil was a portable wooden house used by the Mughal emperors during their visits outside their capital. This was a double storied house built with a platform supported over 16 pillars, of 6 yards height. Pillars were 4 cubits in height joined with nuts and bolts which formed the upper floor. This functioned as a sleeping quarter for the king and also for worship and holding Jharokha Darshan,[19] and considered it an emulation of Hindu practice.[26]\\r\\n\\r\\nOn the occasion of the Delhi Durbar that was held on 12 December 1911, King George V and his consort, Queen Mary, made a grand appearance at the jharokha of the Red Fort to give a \\"darshan\\" to 500,000 common people who had assembled there to greet them.[12]","input":"Which ruler stopped the practice of jharokha darshan?"},{"output":"chromosome 4","context":"","input":"What chromosome has the genetic mutation for huntington's disease?"},{"output":"Antonio Tajani","context":"\\r\\n\\r\\nEuropean Commission\\r\\n\\r\\nCouncil of the EU\\r\\n\\r\\nThe President of the European Parliament presides over the debates and activities of the European Parliament. They also represent the Parliament within the EU and internationally. The president's signature is required for enacting most EU laws and the EU budget.\\r\\n\\r\\nPresidents serve two-and-a-half-year terms, normally divided between the two major political parties. Until 2018, there have been thirty presidents since the Parliament was created in 1952, fifteen of whom have served since the first Parliamentary election in 1979. Two presidents have been women and most have come from the older member states. The current president is Antonio Tajani from Italy.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe president chairs debates and oversees all the activities of the Parliament and its constituent bodies (ensuring the Parliament's rules of procedure are applied), in this the role is similar to that of a speaker in a national parliament. Below the president, there are 14 vice-presidents who chair debates when the president is not in the chamber. The president also chairs the meetings of the Bureau, which is responsible for budgetary and administration issues, and the Conference of Presidents, which is a governing body composed of the presidents of each of the parliament's political groups.[2][3]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe president represents Parliament in all legal matters and external relations, particularly international relations. When the European Council meets, the president addresses it to give the Parliament's position on subjects on the Council's agenda. The president also takes part in Intergovernmental Conferences on new treaties. The president's signature is also required for the budget of the European Union and Union acts adopted under codecision procedure to be adopted. The president also chairs conciliation committees with the Council under these areas.[2][3]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn most countries, the protocol of the head of state comes before all others. However, in the EU the Parliament is listed as the first institution, and hence the protocol of its president comes before any other European, or national, protocol. The gifts given to numerous visiting dignitaries depends upon the president. President Josep Borrell MEP of Spain gave his counterparts a crystal cup created by an artist from Barcelona which had engraved upon it parts of the Charter of Fundamental Rights among other things.[4]\\r\\n\\r\\nWith the reorganisation of leading EU posts under the Lisbon Treaty, there was some criticism of each post's vague responsibilities. Ukrainian ambassador to the EU Andriy Veselovsky praised the framework and clarified it in his own terms: The President of the European Commission speaks as the EU's \\"government\\" while the President of the European Council is a \\"strategist\\". The High Representative specialises in \\"bilateral relations\\" while the European Commissioner for Enlargement and European Neighbourhood Policy deals in technical matters such as the free trade agreement with Ukraine. The Parliament's president meanwhile articulates the EU's values such as democratic elections in other countries.[5]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe president is elected by the members of Parliament for a two-and-a-half-year term, meaning two elections per parliamentary term, hence two presidents may serve during any one Parliamentary term. Since the European People's Party and Party of European Socialists began co-operating in the 1980s, they have had a tradition of splitting the two posts between them. In practice this means, in 2004ÿ2009 for example, that the People's Party supported the Socialist candidate for president and, when his term expired in 2007, the Socialists supported the People's Party candidate for president. This results in large majorities for presidents, although there are some exceptions: for example from 1999ÿ2004, under a People's PartyÿLiberal deal, the president for the second half of the term was a Liberal, rather than a Socialist.[6]\\r\\n\\r\\nStarting from the 2009ÿ2014 session of the Parliament the outgoing president presides over the election of the new president, provided that the outgoing president is re-elected as an MEP.  If the outgoing president is not re-elected as an MEP then one of the 14 vice-presidents takes up the role.  While the outgoing president or vice president is in the chair, they hold all the powers of the president, but the only business that may be addressed is the election of the new president.[7]\\r\\n\\r\\nBefore the ballot nominations are handed to the chair who announces them to Parliament. If no member holds an absolute majority after three ballots, a fourth is held with only the two members holding the highest number of votes on the previous ballot. If there is still a tie following this, the eldest candidate is declared elected.[8]\\r\\n\\r\\nA number of notable figures have been President of the Parliament and its predecessors. The first president was Paul-Henri Spaak MEP, one of the founding fathers of the Union. Other founding fathers include Alcide de Gasperi MEP and Robert Schuman MEP. The two female presidents were Simone Veil MEP in 1979 (first president of the elected Parliament) and Nicole Fontaine MEP in 1999, both Frenchwomen.[9] Jerzy Buzek, former Prime Minister of Poland and member of Solidarity Electoral Action, was elected as the first president from the central and eastern European countries which joined in the 2000s (more precisely, he is the first person from a country that joined the EU after 1986 to hold the post).\\r\\n\\r\\nThe two major factions of the European Parliament, the EPP and the S&D, have reached a formal agreement to share the presidency under the 2009ÿ2014 term. Under the agreement, Jerzy Buzek will be president in the first half of the term and a S&D member would be elected in the second half (2012ÿ2014) of the term.[10] Martin Schulz (SPD, Germany), leader of the S&D group, was speculated as the likely nominee, and in the event he was elected on 17 January 2012.\\r\\n\\r\\nBuzek's presidency is part of the usual People's Party ÿ Socialist agreement to have one presidency each of the two during each parliament. For the 2009ÿ2014 term Buzek gets the post for the first term of office of two and a half years, and someone from the Socialists will get it for the second.[11] The 2004-2009 parliamentary term saw a great amount of co-operation between the two groups following on from the 1999ÿ2004 term which saw an EPP-ELDR alliance. The Socialist candidate will be Martin Schulz who was unanimously nominated by the group.[12] Diana Wallis (Liberal) and Nirj Deva (Conservative) have also announced candidacies.[13][14]\\r\\n\\r\\nMeanwhile, Graham Watson, the leader of ALDE, stated he wished to challenge this system of carving up the post, and presented himself as a candidate. He made a point of running a public campaign, to contrast against the closed-doors agreement of Peoples Party-Socialists, which he claimed was the first such campaign to be run. Through this, he also stated he hoped to open up a debate on the role of the president and make the figure more dynamic, to counterbalance the growing power of the Presidency of the Council of the European Union.[15] However, on 8 July 2009 Watson announced that he withdrew his candidacy thus leaving Buzek with only one opponent. The other official candidate was Eva-Britt Svensson, nominated from EUL-NGL.[16] She campaigned with the slogan \\"a different voice\\". She was the first MEP from Sweden to candidate to the position.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the first vote of the new Parliament Jerzy Buzek (EPP, Poland) was elected Parliament president, winning with 555 votes to 89 votes over his opponent Eva-Britt Svensson (EUL-NGL, Sweden).[17]\\r\\n\\r\\nAt the end of Martin Schulz's term, the presidency for the remainder of the eighth European Parliament (2014ÿ2019) would have been due by convention to pass to an EPP member. However, the EPPÿS&D agreement appeared broken, making it less certain that Antonio Tajani (EPP, Italy) would be elected president. The other contenders were Gianni Pittella (S&D, Italy), Guy Verhofstadt (ALDE, Belgium), Helga Stevens (ECR, Belgium), Eleonora Forenza (GUE/NGL, Italy) and Jean Lambert (Greens/EFA, UK).[18][19] On 17 January 2017, Tajani was elected after four rounds of voting, following the withdrawal of Verhofstadt and declaration of support for the EPP candidate by the ALDE.\\r\\n\\r\\nPrior to 2009, the \\"oldest member\\", the eldest MEP (similar to the Father of the House), presided over the chamber during the election of the president rather than the previous president. The member had all the duties of president but the only business that could be addressed was the election of the president.[7]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 2009, the Parliament's rules were changed so that the outgoing president (if re-elected as an MEP) or one of the outgoing vice-presidents would chair the first session of Parliament until a new president was elected.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe list below includes all presidents as far back as 1952. However official Parliamentary history does not see continuity between the Common Assembly and the post-1958 European Communities Parliamentary Assembly (the 50th anniversary of the European Parliament was celebrated in 2008, not 2002) so Jerzy Buzek would be the 24th president, not the 28th.","input":"Who is the president of the european parliament?"},{"output":"March 1862","context":"The United States two-dollar bill ($2) is a current denomination of U.S. currency.

When U.S. currency was changed to its current size, the $2 bill was issued only as a United States Note. Production went on until 1966, when the series was discontinued. Ten years passed before the $2 bill was reissued as a Federal Reserve Note with a new reverse design. Two-dollar bills are seldom seen in circulation as a result of banking policies with businesses which has resulted in low production numbers due to lack of demand. This comparative scarcity in circulation, coupled with a lack of public knowledge that the bill is still in production and circulation, has also inspired urban legends and occasionally has created problems for people trying to use the bill to make purchases.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe denomination of two dollars was authorized under a congressional act, and first used in March 1862.[2] The denomination was continuously used until the 1960s; by this time the United States Note was the only remaining class of U.S. currency the two-dollar bill was assigned to. In 1966 it was decided to discontinue production of all United States Notes, which included the two-dollar bill.[3] The two-dollar denomination was not immediately reassigned to the Federal Reserve Note class of United States currency and was thus fully discontinued; the Treasury Department cited the two-dollar bill's low use and unpopularity as the reason for not immediately resuming use of the denomination. In 1976, production of the two-dollar denomination was resumed and the two-dollar bill was finally assigned as a Federal Reserve Note, with a new reverse design featuring John Trumbull's depiction of the drafting of the United States Declaration of Independence replacing the previous design of Monticello. It has remained a current denomination since then.[4] It was estimated that if the two-dollar bill replaced approximately half of the one-dollar bills in circulation, the federal government would be able to save about $26 million in 1976 dollars ($112?million adjusted for inflation)[5] over the period from 1976 to 1981, due to reduced production, storage, and shipping costs.[6]\\r\\nHowever, due to their limited use, two-dollar bills are not printed as frequently in a new series like other denominations, which are produced according to demand.[7] Some bill acceptors found in vending machines, self checkout lanes, and other automated kiosks are configured to accommodate two-dollar bills, even if the fact is not stated on the label.[8] Although they are generally available at most banks, two-dollar bills are usually not handed out except upon specific request by the customer, and may cause a delay with a trip to the vault.[9]\\r\\nThe seeming rarity of a $2 bill can be attributed to its low printing numbers as a Federal Reserve Note. Hoarding of the series due to lack of public knowledge of the $2 bill has resulted in very few bills seen in circulation. After its initial release, supplies of the Series 1976 two-dollar bill were allowed to dwindle until August 1996 when a new series dated 1995 began to be printed. This series was only printed for the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta.[10]\\r\\nToday, there is a common misconception by the general public that the $2 bill is no longer being produced. According to the Treasury, it \\"receives many letters asking why the $2 bill is no longer in circulation\\".[11] In response, the Treasury stated: \\"The $2 bill remains one of our circulating currency denominations... As of April 30, 2007 there were $1,549,052,714 worth of $2 bills in circulation worldwide.\\"\\r\\nThings such as unusual serial numbers (example: A11111111A), and replacement notes designated by a star in the serial number can raise the collector value. \\"Collectible\\" two-dollar bills have been made and sold by coin dealers and others in recent years merely by adding colors and special graphics to regular issue bills by using computer printers. However, these bills are not authorized by the Bureau of Engraving and Printing (BEP) and are not worth anything more than face value on the collectors' market.[12]\\r\\nCertain conventions and tourism/convention bureaus capitalize on the scarcity of $2 bills in circulation, encouraging convention attendees and tourists to spend $2 bills in order to illustrate to the host communities the economic impact that the conventions and tourism bring. Sometimes known as \\"SpendTom\\" campaigns, the $2 bills linger in the community as a constant reminder. Some campaigns encourage people to participate in a hunt for the bills in order to win prizes.[13]\\r\\n(approximately 7.4218 G 3.125 in ? 189 G 79?mm)\\r\\nIn March 1862, the first $2 bill was issued as a Legal Tender Note (United States Note) with a portrait of Alexander Hamilton; the portrait of Hamilton used was a profile view and is not the same portrait used currently for the $10 bill. The continental congress based on defending the United States, released on June 25, 1776, began to authorize $2 credit, the circulation of 49,000 copies. Pass two-dollar bill was first used in March 1862. Between 1966 and 1976, two-dollar notes were not printed.\\r\\nBy 1869, the $2 United States Note was redesigned with the now familiar portrait of Thomas Jefferson to the left and a vignette of the United States Capitol in the center of the obverse. This note also featured green tinting on the top and left side of the obverse. Although this note is technically a United States Note, TREASURY NOTE appeared on it instead of UNITED STATES NOTE. The reverse was completely redesigned. This series was again revised in 1874, changes on the obverse included removing the green tinting, adding a red floral design around WASHINGTON D.C., and changing the term TREASURY NOTE to UNITED STATES NOTE. The 1874 design was also issued as Series of 1875 and 1878 and by 1880 the red floral design around WASHINGTON D.C. on the United States Note was removed and the serial numbers were changed to blue. This note with the red floral design was also issued as Series of 1917 but with red serial numbers by that time.[14]\\r\\nNational Bank Notes were issued in 1875 and feature a woman unfurling a flag and a big 2 (Lazy Duce) on the obverse, the reverse has the king of England smoking tobacco and an eagle with a shield.[15]\\r\\nIn 1886, the first $2 silver certificate with a portrait of United States Civil War General Winfield Scott Hancock on the left of the obverse was issued. This design went on until 1891 when a new $2 Silver Certificate was issued with a portrait of U.S. Treasury Secretary William Windom in the center of the obverse.[16]\\r\\nTwo-dollar Treasury, or \\"Coin\\", Notes were first issued for government purchases of silver bullion in 1890 from the silver mining industry. The reverse featured large wording of TWO in the center and a numeral 2 to the right surrounded by an ornate design that occupied almost the entire note. In 1891 the reverse of the Series of 1890 Treasury Note was redesigned because the treasury felt that it was too \\"busy\\" which would make it too easy to counterfeit. More open space was incorporated into the new design.[17]\\r\\nIn 1896, the \\"Educational Series\\" Silver Certificate was issued. The entire obverse of the note was covered in artwork with an allegorical figure of science presenting steam and electricity to commerce and manufacture. The reverse of the note featured portraits of Robert Fulton and Samuel F. B. Morse surrounded by an ornate design that occupied almost the entire note. By 1899, however, The $2 Silver Certificate was redesigned with a small portrait of George Washington surrounded by allegorical figures representing agriculture and mechanics.[18]\\r\\nThe only large-sized, Federal Reserve Note-like $2 bill was issued in 1918 as a Federal Reserve Bank Note. Each note was an obligation of the issuing Federal Reserve Bank and could only be redeemed at the corresponding bank. The obverse of the note featured a borderless portrait of Thomas Jefferson to left and wording in the entire center. The reverse featured a World War I battleship.[19]\\r\\nBeginning in the 1950s, production of $2 bills began to decrease. The relative scarcity of the bills lead some to start saving any they found, with the inevitable result that the notes became rarer in circulation. Currently, the circulation of $2 bills accounts for around 1% of the U.S. currency in circulation.\\r\\n(6.14 G 2.61 in ? 156 G 66?mm)\\r\\nIn 1928, when all U.S. currency was changed to its current size, the $2 bill was issued only as a United States Note. The obverse featured a cropped version of Thomas Jefferson's portrait that had been on previous $2 bills. The reverse featured Jefferson's home, Monticello. The note's seal and serial numbers were red. The Series of 1928 $2 bill featured the treasury seal superimposed by the United States Note obligation to the left and a large gray TWO to the right.[20]\\r\\nIn 1953 the $2 bill received minor design changes analogous to the $5 United States Note. The treasury seal was made smaller and moved to the right side of the bill; it was superimposed over the gray word TWO. The United States Note obligation now became superimposed over a gray numeral 2. The reverse remained unchanged.[21]\\r\\nThe final change to $2 United States Notes came in 1963 when the motto IN GOD WE TRUST was added to the reverse over the Monticello.[22] And, because dollar bills were soon to no longer be redeemable in silver, WILL PAY TO THE BEARER ON DEMAND was removed from the obverse. Two-dollar bills, along with $5 and $100 United States Notes, were officially discontinued in August 1966, although they all remain legal tender.\\r\\nOn April 13, 1976, the Treasury Department reintroduced the $2 bill as a cost-saving measure.[23] Series 1976 $2 bills were redesigned and issued as a Federal Reserve Note. The obverse design remains basically unchanged since 1928 and features the same portrait of Jefferson. A green treasury seal and serial numbers replace the red used on the previous United States Notes. Since the reissue of the bill coincided with the United States Bicentennial, it was decided to use a bicentennial themed design on the reverse. An engraved rendition (not an exact reproduction) of John Trumbull's The Declaration of Independence replaced Monticello on the reverse. First day issues of the new $2 bills could be taken to a post office and stamped with the date \\"APR 13 1976\\". In all, 590,720,000 notes from Series 1976 were printed.\\r\\nCurrently, stamped series 1976 $2 bills typically trade for about twice their face value.?If the bills were stamped in a city with an unusual name, the value may be slightly higher.?However, no first-day-issued 1976 $2 bills?with stamps are especially rare or valuable.?\\r\\nDespite their age, crisp, uncirculated series 1976 $2 bills are not uncommon and are not particularly valuable. More than half a billion of these notes were printed and a large amount were saved and hoarded upon their original issue. A typical?single uncirculated 1976 $2 bill is worth only slightly above face value. If the note is circulated, then it is only?worth its $2 face value.?\\r\\nIn 1996 and 1997, 153,600,000 bills were printed[24] as Series 1995 for the Federal Reserve District of Atlanta. In 2004, 121,600,000 of the Series 2003 bills were printed for the Minneapolis Federal Reserve Bank. An issue of Series 2003A $2 bills was printed from July to September 2006 for all twelve Federal Reserve Banks. In all, 220,800,000 notes were printed.[10]\\r\\nIn February 2012, the B.E.P. printed 512,000 Series 2009 $2 Star Notes, in anticipation of more regular runs being printed later in 2012. Series 2009 $2 bills were issued to banks during the summer of 2012.[25][26]\\r\\nIn November 2013, the B.E.P. began printing series 2013 $2 bills for the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta; these notes entered circulation in early 2014. A total of 44,800,000 notes were ordered for fiscal year 2014, which ran from October 2013 through September 2014.[27]\\r\\nA chronological display of the American two-dollar bill.?\\r\\nOver five million $2 bills are entered into the database of the American currency-tracking website Where's George?.[32] Because $2 bills are uncommon in daily use, their use can make a particular group of spenders visible. A documented case of using two-dollar bills to send a message to a community is the case of Geneva Steel and the communities in surrounding Utah County. In 1989, Geneva Steel paid its employee bonuses in $2 bills. When the bills began to appear in different places, people recognized the importance of the company to the local economy.[33]\\r\\nUse of the two-dollar bill is also being suggested by some gun rights activists to show support for Second Amendment rights, particularly at stores that allow Open Carry or Concealed carry of weapons on their premises.[34][35] Two-dollar notes have also seen increased usage in situations where tipping is encouraged, especially in strip clubs. This is due to the idea that tips will increase because of the ease of use of a single, higher-denomination bill as the lowest common note in use.[36]\\r\\nThe use of the two-dollar bill is popular among fans and alumni of Clemson University who often bring notes with them when traveling to university athletic events in other localities as a demonstration of their economic impact in an area. The idea was first popularized in 1977 when Georgia Tech had threatened to no longer play the Tigers in football and has since caught on as a token of fandom when traveling to other locations. Fans will often stamp an orange tiger paw (Clemson's logo) on the note as a sign of its origin.[37]\\r\\nDuring the 1930s, the $2 bill was often used at East Coast horse race tracks to make a bet. Because of the German and Jewish influence, the bill was locally known in parts of New Jersey as a \\"zwei-buck\\", and the upper right corner \\"2\\" was sometimes torn off to increase the luck.[citation needed]\\r\\nThe relative scarcity of the $2 bill in everyday circulation has led to confusion at points of sale, as well as overreaction and prosecution of the individual attempting to tender the bill.\\r\\nIn 2005, a man in Baltimore, Maryland was jailed for attempting to use $2 bills to pay a car stereo installation fee that Best Buy originally agreed to waive in the first place.[38]\\r\\nIn 2016, a 13-year-old girl in Texas was detained by police at Fort Bend Independent School District's Christa McAuliffe Middle School, and prevented from eating lunch that day, for attempting to use a $2 bill to pay for chicken nuggets in the school cafeteria.[39][40]\\r\\nUncut currency sheets are available from the Bureau of Engraving and Printing. Some of the recent $2 uncut sheets from Series 1995 and Series 2003 have been collectibles as they come from special non-circulation printings. Most of the Series 1995 $2 uncut sheets had a higher suffix letter in the serial number than regular circulation $2 bills. Uncut $2 sheets from Series 2003 were printed for the Boston (A), New York (B), Atlanta (F), Chicago (G), Minneapolis (I), and Dallas (K) Federal Reserve Districts despite the fact that notes from the Minneapolis district were the only ones released for circulation. Uncut sheets of Series 2003A have also been produced, although in this case circulating currency for all districts has also been made. All two-dollar bills beginning with Series 1995 have been printed in the BEP facility in Fort Worth, Texas (indicated by \\"FW\\" preceding the face plate number on the obverse of the note).[10][41][42]\\r\\nUncut sheets of $2 bills are available in various sizes. A 32-subject sheet, which is the original-size sheet on which the notes are printed, is available. Other sheet sizes available have been cut from the original 32-subject sheet. These include half (16-note), quarter (8-note), and eighth (4-note) sheets for $2 bills. Uncut sheets are sold for more than their respective face values.[43] Uncut sheets of large size notes (issued before 1928) also exist, but are extremely rare.[44]\\r\\nSteve Wozniak, a co-founder of Apple Inc., has been using $2 banknotes separated from 4-bill uncut sheets (glued together into pads), to surprise merchants and waiters; also, because of the notes' unusual appearance, he has been interviewed by a Secret Service agent.[45][46]\\r\\nIt has become common and trendy for patrons of Wolfgang's Steakhouse located on Park Ave in Manhattan to leave a full sheet of $2 (or portion thereof) as a tip for service.[47]","input":"When was the first 2 dollar bill printed?"},{"output":"about 3,500 K","context":"VY Canis Majoris (VY CMa) is a red hypergiant star located in the constellation Canis Major. It is one of the largest stars (at one time it was the largest known) and also one of the most luminous of its type. It has a radius of approximately 1,420 solar radii (990,000,000?km; 6.6?au), and is 17 I 8 times as massive as the Sun. Located about 1.2 kiloparsecs (3,900 light-years) from Earth, it is too faint to be seen with the naked eye.\\r\\nVY Canis Majoris is a single star categorized as a semiregular variable with an estimated period of 2,000?days. It has an average density of 5 to 10?mg/m3. If placed at the center of the Solar System, VY Canis Majoris's surface would extend beyond the orbit of Jupiter, although there is still considerable variation in estimates of the radius.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe first known recorded observation of VY Canis Majoris is in the star catalogue of Jr?me Lalande, on 7 March 1801, which lists it as a 7th magnitude star. Further 19th-century studies of its apparent magnitude demonstrate that the star has been fading since 1850.[8] Since 1847, VY Canis Majoris has been described as a crimson star.[8] During the 19th century, observers measured at least six discrete components, suggesting that it might be a multiple star. These discrete components are now known to be bright areas in the surrounding nebula. Visual observations in 1957 and high-resolution imaging in 1998 showed that there are no companion stars.[8][9]\\r\\nThe varying brightness of VY Cma was not described until 1931 when it was listed (in German) as a long period variable with a photographic magnitude range of 9.5 - 11.5.[10] It was given the variable star designation VY CMa in 1939.[11]\\r\\nThe spectrum of VY CMa is that of a luminous class M star. The hydrogen lines have P Cygni profiles. The spectrum is dominated by TiO bands whose strength suggests a classification of M5. The Hϫ line is not seen and there are unusual emission lines of neutral sodium and calcium. The luminosity class as determined from different spectral features varies from bright giant (II) to bright supergiant (Ia), with a compromise being given as M5eIbp. Early attempts at classification were confused by the interpretation of surrounding nebulosity as companion stars.[12]\\r\\nThe derived spectral class varies depending on the features examined. The spectral features also vary over time. It is considered to be unambiguously cooler than M2 and is usually classified between M3 and M4. Classes as extreme as M2.5 and M5 have been given.[3] The luminosity class is likewise confused and often given only as I.[13]\\r\\nVY Canis Majoris is a high-luminosity M star with an effective temperature of about 3,500 K, placing it at the upper-right hand corner of the HertzsprungÿRussell diagram and meaning it is a highly evolved star. During its main sequence, it would have been an O-type star[14] with a mass of 15 to 35?M?.[4]\\r\\nIn 2006, University of Minnesota Professor Roberta M. Humphreys used the spectral energy distribution distance of VY Canis Majoris to calculate its luminosity. Since most of the radiation coming from the star is reprocessed by the dust in the surrounding cloud, she integrated the total fluxes over the entire nebula and showed that VY Canis Majoris has a luminosity of 7005560000000000000?5.6G105?L?.[15]\\r\\nMore recent estimates of the luminosity using a variety of methods give lower values of around 7005300000000000000?3G105?L?.[4]\\r\\nHumphreys originally estimated the radius of VY CMa at 1,800-2,100 solar radii.[15] A more recent and accurate VLTI measurement gives the star a radius of 1,420 I 120 solar radii.[4] Earlier direct measurements of the radius at infrared wavelengths gave values above 2,800?R?, but this is probably larger than size of the underlying star.[16]\\r\\nIn 1976, Charles J. Lada and Mark J. Reid published the discovery of a bright-rimmed molecular cloud 15 minutes of arc east of VY Canis Majoris. At the edge of the cloud bordered by the bright rim, an abrupt decrease in the CO emission and an increase in brightness of the 12CO emission were observed, indicating possible destruction of molecular material and enhanced heating at the cloud-rim interface, respectively. Lada and Reid assumed the distance of the molecular cloud is approximately equal to that of the stars, which are members of the open cluster NGC 2362, that ionize the rim. NGC 2362 has a distance of 1.5 I 0.5 kiloparsecs as determined from its color-magnitude diagram.[14] VY CMa is projected onto the tip of the cloud rim, suggesting its association with the molecular cloud. In addition to that, the velocity of the molecular cloud is very close to the velocity of the star. This further indicates the association of the star with the molecular cloud, and consequently with NGC 2362, which means VY Canis Majoris is at the same distance.[17] A more recent measurement of the distance to NGC 2362 gives 1.2 kiloparsecs.[18]\\r\\nStellar distances can be calculated by measuring parallaxes as Earth orbits around the Sun. However, VY Canis Majoris has a tiny parallax due to its great distance, and standard visual observations such as by Hipparcos have too great a margin of error to be useful. VLBI measurements of the parallax of VY Canis Majoris using H2O masers are much more accurate and give a distance of 7000113999999999999?1.14+0.11\\r\\n?0.09 kiloparsecs (kpc).[19] VLBI measurements using SiO masers give a distance of 7000120000000000000?1.20+0.13\\r\\n?0.10 kpc.[7] The Gaia mission should provide visual parallaxes with even better accuracy.\\r\\nVY Canis Majoris is surrounded by an extensive nebula, which contains condensations that were once regarded as companion stars.[9] The nebula has been extensively studied with the aid of the Hubble Space Telescope. It has a complex structure that includes filaments and arcs, which were caused by past eruptions; this structure is similar to that of the nebula surrounding the yellow hypergiant IRC+10420. The similarity has led astronomers to propose that VY CMa will itself become a yellow hypergiant, then a luminous blue variable, and finally a WolfÿRayet star, if it does not explode as a supernova first.[20] Multiple asymmetric mass loss events are deduced to have occurred within the last 1,000 years. The mass loss is due to strong convection in the tenuous outer layers of the star, associated with magnetic fields. This is similar to the sunspots and coronal ejections of the Sun but on a much larger scale.[6]\\r\\nThere have been conflicting opinions of the properties of VY CMa. In one view,[15] the star is a very large and very luminous red hypergiant. The various larger estimates of the size and luminosity fall outside the bounds of current stellar theory, both beyond the maximum predicted size of any star and far cooler than a star of its luminosity can become. In another opinion (such as Massey, Levesque, and Plez's study),[3] the star is a normal red supergiant, with a radius around 600 solar radii and falling comfortably inside models of stellar structure and evolution. More recent papers[4][7] produce intermediate values for radius and luminosity, falling at the very extreme for the expected size and luminosity of red supergiants (or hypergiant based on its emission spectrum and high mass loss rate).\\r\\nVY Canis Majoris also illustrates the problem of defining the \\"surface\\" (and so the radius) of very large stars. With an average density of 0.000005 to 0.000010?kg/m3, the star is a hundred thousand times less dense than the atmosphere of Earth at sea level. It is also undergoing strong mass loss with the outer layers of the star no longer gravitationally bound. The definition of the boundary of such stars is based on the Rosseland Radius, the location at which the optical depth is one (or sometimes a different value such as 2/3).[21] In cases such as VY CMa, the radius may be defined on a different opacity value or on an opacity at a particular wavelength.[4]\\r\\nCoordinates:  07h 22m 58.33s, ?25 46 03.17","input":"What is the temperature of vy canis majoris?"},{"output":"Santa Anna, the President of Mexico","context":"Decisive Texian victory;\\r\\nThe Battle of San Jacinto, fought on April 21, 1836, in present-day Harris County, Texas, was the decisive battle of the Texas Revolution. Led by General Sam Houston, the Texian Army engaged and defeated General Antonio L܇pez de Santa Anna's Mexican army in a fight that lasted just 18 minutes.\\r\\nSanta Anna, the President of Mexico, was captured the following day and held as a prisoner of war. Three weeks later, he signed the peace treaty that dictated that the Mexican army leave the region, paving the way for the Republic of Texas to become an independent country. These treaties did not specifically recognize Texas as a sovereign nation, but stipulated that Santa Anna was to lobby for such recognition in Mexico City. Sam Houston became a national celebrity, and the Texans' rallying cries from events of the war, \\"Remember the Alamo!\\" and \\"Remember Goliad!,\\" became etched into Texan history and legend.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nGeneral Antonio L܇pez de Santa Anna was a proponent of governmental federalism when he helped oust Mexican president Anastasio Bustamante in December 1832. Upon his election as president in April 1833,[3] Santa Anna switched his political ideology and began implementing centralist policies that increased the authoritarian powers of his office.[4] His abrogation of the Constitution of 1824, correlating with his abolishing local-level authority over Mexico's state of Coahuila y Tejas (Coahuila and Texas), became a flashpoint in the growing tensions between the central government and its Tejano and Anglo citizens in Texas. While in Mexico City awaiting a meeting with Santa Anna, Texian empresario Stephen F. Austin wrote to the Bxar ayuntamiento (city council) urging a break-away state. In response, the Mexican government kept him imprisoned for most of 1834.[5][6]\\r\\nColonel Juan Almonte was appointed Director of Colonization in Texas,[7] ostensibly to ease relations with the colonists and mitigate their anxieties about Austin's imprisonment.[8] He delivered promises of self-governance, and conveyed regrets that the Mexican congress deemed it constitutionally impossible for Texas to be a separate state. Behind the rhetoric, his covert mission was to identify the local power brokers, obstruct any plans for rebellion, and supply the Mexican government with data that would be of use in a military conflict. For nine months in 1834, under the guise of serving as a government liaison, Almonte traveled through Texas and compiled an all-encompassing intelligence report on the population and its environs, including an assessment of their resources and defense capabilities.[9]\\r\\nIn consolidating his power base, Santa Anna installed General Martn Perfecto de Cos as the governing military authority over Texas in 1835.[10][11] Cos established headquarters in San Antonio on October 9, triggering what became known as the Siege of Bxar.[12] After two months of trying to repel the Texian forces, Cos raised a white flag on December 9, and signed surrender terms two days later.[13] The surrender of Cos effectively removed the occupying Mexican army from Texas. Many believed the war was over, and volunteers began returning home.[14]\\r\\nIn compliance with orders from Santa Anna, Mexico's Minister of War Jos Mara Tornel issued his December 30 \\"Circular No. 5\\", often referred to as the Tornel Decree, aimed at dealing with United States intervention in the uprising in Texas. It declared that foreigners who entered Mexico for the purpose of joining the rebellion were to be treated as \\"pirates\\", to be put to death if captured. In adding \\"since they are not subjects of any nation at war with the republic nor do they militate under any recognized flag,\\" Tornel avoided declaring war on the United States.[15][16]\\r\\nThe Mexican Army of Operations numbered 6,019 soldiers[17] and was spread out over 300 miles (480?km) on its march to Bxar. General Joaqun Ramrez y Sesma was put in command of the Vanguard of the Advance that crossed into Texas.[18] Santa Anna and his aide-de-camp Almonte[19] forded the Rio Grande at Guerrero, Coahuila on February 16, 1836,[20] with General Jos de Urrea and 500 more troops following the next day at Matamoros.[21] Bxar was captured on February 23 and when the assault commenced, attempts at negotiation for surrender were initiated from inside the fortress. Travis sent Albert Martin to request a meeting with Almonte, who replied that he did not have the authority to speak for Santa Anna.[22] Bowie dispatched Green B. Jameson with a letter, translated into Spanish by Juan Segun, requesting a meeting with Santa Anna, who immediately refused. Santa Anna did, however, extend an offer of amnesty to Tejanos inside the fortress. Alamo non-combatant survivor Enrique Esparza said that most Tejanos left when Bowie advised them to take the offer.[23]\\r\\nCos, in violation of his surrender terms, forded into Texas at Guerrero on February 26 to join with the main army at Bxar.[24] Urrea proceeded to secure the Gulf Coast, and was victorious in two skirmishes with Texian detachments serving under Fannin at Goliad. On February 27 a foraging detachment under Frank W. Johnson at San Patricio was attacked by Urrea. Sixteen were killed, and 21 taken prisoner, but Johnson and 4 others escaped.[25][26] Urrea sent a company to Agua Dulce searching for James Grant and Plcido Benavides who were leading a company of Anglos and Tejanos towards an invasion of Matamoros. The Mexicans set a trap, killing Grant and most of the company. Benavides and 4 others escaped, and 6 were taken prisoner.[27][28]\\r\\nThe Convention of 1836 met at Washington-on-the-Brazos on March 1.[29] The following day, Sam Houston's 42nd birthday, the 59 delegates signed the Texas Declaration of Independence, and chose an ad interim government.[29][30] When news of the declaration reached Goliad, Benavides informed Fannin that in spite of his opposition to Santa Anna, he was still loyal to Mexico and did not wish to help Texas break away. Fannin discharged him from his duties and sent him home.[31] On March 4 Houston's military authority was expanded to include \\"the land forces of the Texian army both Regular, Volunteer, and Militia.\\"[32]\\r\\nAt 5 a.m. on March 6, the Mexican troops launched their final assault on the Alamo. The guns fell silent 90 minutes later; the Alamo had fallen.[33] Survivors Susannah Dickinson, her daughter Angelina, Travis' slave Joe, and Almonte's cook Ben were spared by Santa Anna and sent to Gonzales, where Texian volunteers had been assembling.[34]\\r\\nThe same day that Mexican troops departed Bxar, Houston arrived in Gonzales and informed the 374 volunteers (some without weapons) gathered there that Texas was now an independent republic.[35] Just after 11 p.m. on March 13, Susanna Dickinson and Joe brought news that the Alamo garrison had been defeated and the Mexican army was marching towards Texian settlements. A hastily convened council of war voted to evacuate the area and retreat. The evacuation commenced at midnight and happened so quickly that many Texian scouts were unaware the army had moved on. Everything that could not be carried was burned, and the army's only two cannons were thrown into the Guadalupe River.[36] When Ramrez y Sesma reached Gonzales the morning of March 14, he found the buildings still smoldering.[37]\\r\\nMost citizens fled on foot, many carrying their small children. A cavalry company led by Segun and Salvador Flores were assigned as rear guard to evacuate the more isolated ranches and protect the civilians from attacks by Mexican troops or Indians.[38] The further the army retreated, the more civilians joined the flight.[39] For both armies and the civilians, the pace was slow; torrential rains had flooded the rivers and turned the roads into mud pits.[40]\\r\\nAs news of the Alamo's fall spread, volunteer ranks swelled, reaching about 1,400 men on March 19.[40] Houston learned of Fannin's defeat on March 20 and realized his army was the last hope for an independent Texas. Concerned that his ill-trained and ill-disciplined force would only be good for one battle and aware that his men could easily be outflanked by Urrea's forces, Houston continued to avoid engagement, to the immense displeasure of his troops.[41] By March 28, the Texian army had retreated 120 miles (190?km) across the Navidad and Colorado Rivers.[42] Many troops deserted; those who remained grumbled that their commander was a coward.[41]\\r\\nOn March 31, Houston paused his men at Groce's Landing, roughly 15 miles (24?km) north of San Felipe.[Note 1] Two companies that refused to retreat further than San Felipe were assigned to guard the crossings on the Brazos River.[43] For the next two weeks, the Texians rested, recovered from illness, and, for the first time, began practicing military drills. While there, two cannons, known as the Twin Sisters, arrived from Cincinnati, Ohio.[44] Interim Secretary of War Thomas Rusk joined the camp, with orders from President David G. Burnet to replace Houston if he refused to fight. Houston quickly persuaded Rusk that his plans were sound.[44] Secretary of State Samuel P. Carson advised Houston to continue retreating all the way to the Sabine River, where more volunteers would likely flock from the United States and allow the army to counterattack.[Note 2][45] Unhappy with everyone involved, Burnet wrote to Houston: \\"The enemy are laughing you to scorn. You must fight them. You must retreat no further. The country expects you to fight. The salvation of the country depends on your doing so.\\"[44] Complaints within the camp became so strong that Houston posted notices that anyone attempting to usurp his position would be court-martialed and shot.[46]\\r\\nSanta Anna and a smaller force had remained in Bxar. After receiving word that the acting president, Miguel Barragn, had died, Santa Anna seriously considered returning to Mexico City to solidify his position. Fear that Urrea's victories would position him as a political rival convinced Santa Anna to remain in Texas to personally oversee the final phase of the campaign.[47] He left on March 29 to join Ramrez y Sesma, leaving only a small force to hold Bxar.[48] At dawn on April 7, their combined force marched into San Felipe and captured a Texian soldier, who informed Santa Anna that the Texians planned to retreat further if the Mexican army crossed the Brazos River.[49] Unable to cross the Brazos due to the small company of Texians barricaded at the river crossing, on April 14 a frustrated Santa Anna led a force of about 700 troops to capture the interim Texas government.[50][51] Government officials fled mere hours before Mexican troops arrived in Harrisburgh (now Harrisburg, Houston) and Santa Anna sent Colonel Juan Almonte with 50 cavalry to intercept them in New Washington. Almonte arrived just as Burnet shoved off in a rowboat, bound for Galveston Island. Although the boat was still within range of their weapons, Almonte ordered his men to hold their fire so as not to endanger Burnet's family.[52]\\r\\nAt this point, Santa Anna believed the rebellion was in its final death throes. The Texian government had been forced off the mainland, with no way to communicate with its army, which had shown no interest in fighting. He determined to block the Texian army's retreat and put a decisive end to the war.[52] Almonte's scouts incorrectly reported that Houston's army was going to Lynchburg Crossing, on Buffalo Bayou, in preparation for joining the government in Galveston, so Santa Anna ordered Harrisburg burned and pressed on towards Lynchburg.[52]\\r\\nThe Texian army had resumed their march eastward. On April 16, they came to a crossroads; one road led north towards Nacogdoches, the other went to Harrisburg. Without orders from Houston and with no discussion amongst themselves, the troops in the lead took the road to Harrisburg. They arrived on April 18, not long after the Mexican army's departure.[53] That same day, Deaf Smith and Henry Karnes captured a Mexican courier carrying intelligence on the locations and future plans of all of the Mexican troops in Texas. Realizing that Santa Anna had only a small force and was not far away, Houston gave a rousing speech to his men, exhorting them to \\"Remember the Alamo\\" and \\"Remember Goliad\\". His army then raced towards Lynchburg.[54] Out of concern that his men might not differentiate between Mexican soldiers and the Tejanos in Segun's company, Houston originally ordered Segun and his men to remain in Harrisburg to guard those who were too ill to travel quickly. After loud protests from Segun and Antonio Menchaca, the order was rescinded, provided the Tejanos wear a piece of cardboard in their hats to identify them as Texian soldiers.[55]\\r\\nThe area along Buffalo Bayou had many thick oak groves, separated by marshes. This type of terrain was familiar to the Texians and quite alien to the Mexican soldiers.[56] Houston's army, comprising 900 men, reached Lynch's Ferry mid-morning on April 20; Santa Anna's 700-man force arrived a few hours later. The Texians made camp in a wooded area along the bank of Buffalo Bayou; while the location provided good cover and helped hide their full strength, it also left the Texians no room for retreat.[57][58] Over the protests of several of his officers, Santa Anna chose to make camp in a vulnerable location, a plain near the San Jacinto River, bordered by woods on one side, marsh and lake on another.[56][59] The two camps were approximately 500 yards (460?m) apart, separated by a grassy area with a slight rise in the middle.[60] Colonel Pedro Delgado later wrote that \\"the camping ground of His Excellency's selection was in all respects, against military rules. Any youngster would have done better.\\"[61]\\r\\nOver the next several hours, two brief skirmishes occurred. Texians won the first, forcing a small group of dragoons and the Mexican artillery to withdraw.[56][62] Mexican dragoons then forced the Texian cavalry to withdraw. In the melee, Rusk, on foot to reload his rifle, was almost captured by Mexican soldiers, but was rescued by newly arrived Texian volunteer Mirabeau B. Lamar.[62] Over Houston's objections, many infantrymen rushed onto the field. As the Texian cavalry fell back, Lamar remained behind to rescue another Texian who had been thrown from his horse; Mexican officers \\"reportedly applauded\\" his bravery.[63] Houston was irate that the infantry had disobeyed his orders and given Santa Anna a better estimate of their strength; the men were equally upset that Houston had not allowed a full battle.[64]\\r\\nThroughout the night, Mexican troops worked to fortify their camp, creating breastworks out of everything they could find, including saddles and brush.[65] At 9 a.m. on April 21, Cos arrived with 540 reinforcements, bringing the Mexican force to 1,200 men, which outnumbered the Texians.[66] Cos' men were raw recruits rather than experienced soldiers, and they had marched steadily for more than 24 hours, with no rest and no food.[67] As the morning wore on with no Texian attack, Mexican officers lowered their guard. By afternoon, Santa Anna had given permission for Cos' men to sleep; his own tired troops also took advantage of the time to rest, eat, and bathe.[68]\\r\\nNot long after the Mexican reinforcements arrived, Houston ordered Smith to destroy Vince's Bridge, 5?mi (8?km) away, to slow down any further Mexican reinforcements.[69] At 4 p.m. the Texians began creeping quietly through the tall grass, pulling the cannon behind them.[70] The Texian cannon fired at 4:30, beginning the battle of San Jacinto.[71] After a single volley, Texians broke ranks and swarmed over the Mexican breastworks to engage in hand-to-hand combat. Mexican soldiers were taken by surprise. Santa Anna, Castrill܇n, and Almonte yelled often conflicting orders, attempting to organize their men into some form of defense.[72] Within 18 minutes, Mexican soldiers abandoned their campsite and fled for their lives.[73] The killing lasted for hours.[74]\\r\\nMany Mexican soldiers retreated through the marsh to Peggy Lake.[Note 3] Texian riflemen stationed themselves on the banks and shot at anything that moved. Many Texian officers, including Houston and Rusk, attempted to stop the slaughter, but they were unable to gain control of the men. Texians continued to chant \\"Remember the Alamo! Remember Goliad!\\" while frightened Mexican infantry yelled \\"Me no Alamo!\\" and begged for mercy to no avail.[75] In what historian Davis called \\"one of the most one-sided victories in history\\",[76] 650 Mexican soldiers were killed and 300 captured.[77] Eleven Texians died, with 30 others, including Houston, wounded.[78]\\r\\nAlthough Santa Anna's troops had been thoroughly vanquished, they did not represent the bulk of the Mexican army in Texas. An additional 4,000 troops remained under the commands of Urrea and General Vicente Filisola.[79] Texians had won the battle due to mistakes made by Santa Anna, and Houston was well aware that his troops would have little hope of repeating their victory against Urrea or Filisola.[80] As darkness fell, a large group of prisoners was led into camp. Houston initially mistook the group for Mexican reinforcements and shouted out that all was lost.[81]\\r\\nSanta Anna had escaped towards Vince's Bridge.[82] Finding the bridge destroyed, he hid in the marsh and was captured the following day.[77] He was brought before Houston, who had been shot in the ankle and badly wounded.[79][Note 4] Texian soldiers gathered around, calling for the Mexican general's immediate execution. Bargaining for his life, Santa Anna suggested that he order the remaining Mexican troops to stay away.[83] In a letter to Filisola, who was now the senior Mexican official in Texas, Santa Anna wrote that \\"yesterday evening [we] had an unfortunate encounter\\" and ordered his troops to retreat to Bxar and await further instructions.[80]\\r\\nUrrea urged Filisola to continue the campaign. He was confident that he could challenge the Texian troops. According to Hardin, \\"Santa Anna had presented Mexico with one military disaster; Filisola did not wish to risk another.\\"[84] Spring rains had ruined the ammunition and rendered the roads nearly impassable, with troops sinking to their knees in mud. The Mexican troops were soon out of food and began to fall ill from dysentery and other diseases.[85] Their supply lines had broken down, leaving no hope of further reinforcements.[86] Filisola later wrote that \\"Had the enemy met us under these cruel circumstances, on the only road that was left, no alternative remained but to die or surrender at discretion\\".[85]\\r\\nFor several weeks after San Jacinto, Santa Anna continued to negotiate with Houston, Rusk, and then Burnet.[87] Santa Anna suggested two treaties, a public version of promises made between the two countries, and a private version that included Santa Anna's personal agreements. The Treaties of Velasco required that all Mexican troops withdraw south of the Rio Grande and that all private property be respected and restored. Prisoners of war would be released unharmed and Santa Anna would be given immediate passage to Veracruz. He secretly promised to persuade the Mexican Congress to acknowledge the Republic of Texas and to recognize the Rio Grande as the border between the two countries.[88]\\r\\nWhen Urrea began marching south in mid-May, many families from San Patricio who had supported the Mexican army went with him. When Texian troops arrived in early June, they found only 20 families remaining. The area around San Patricio and Refugio suffered a \\"noticeable depopulation\\" in the Republic of Texas years.[89] Although the treaty had specified that Urrea and Filisola would return any slaves their armies had sheltered, Urrea refused to comply. Many former slaves followed the army to Mexico, where they could be free.[90] By late May, the Mexican troops had crossed the Nueces.[85] Filisola fully expected that the defeat was temporary and that a second campaign would be launched to retake Texas.[86]\\r\\nWhen Mexican authorities received word of Santa Anna's defeat at San Jacinto, flags across the country were lowered to half staff and draped in mourning.[92] Denouncing any agreements signed by a prisoner, Mexican authorities refused to recognize the Republic of Texas.[93] Filisola was derided for leading the retreat and quickly replaced by Urrea. Within months, Urrea gathered 6,000 troops in Matamoros, poised to reconquer Texas. His army was redirected to address continued federalist rebellions in other regions.[94]\\r\\nMost in Texas assumed the Mexican army would return quickly.[95] So many American volunteers flocked to the Texian army in the months after the victory at San Jacinto that the Texian government was unable to maintain an accurate list of enlistments.[96] Out of caution, Bxar remained under martial law throughout 1836. Rusk ordered that all Tejanos in the area between the Guadalupe and Nueces Rivers migrate either to east Texas or to Mexico.[95] Some residents who refused to comply were forcibly removed. New Anglo settlers moved in and used threats and legal maneuvering to take over the land once owned by Tejanos.[93][97] Over the next several years, hundreds of Tejano families resettled in Mexico.[93]\\r\\nFor years, Mexican authorities used the reconquering of Texas as an excuse for implementing new taxes and making the army the budgetary priority of the impoverished nation.[98] Only sporadic skirmishes resulted.[99] Larger expeditions were postponed as military funding was consistently diverted to other rebellions, out of fear that those regions would ally with Texas and further fragment the country.[98][Note 5] The northern Mexican states, the focus of the Matamoros Expedition, briefly launched an independent Republic of the Rio Grande in 1839.[100] The same year, the Mexican Congress considered a law to declare it treasonous to speak positively of Texas.[101] In June 1843, leaders of the two nations declared an armistice.[102]\\r\\nOn June 1, Santa Anna boarded a ship to travel back to Mexico. For the next two days, crowds of soldiers, many of whom had arrived that week from the United States, gathered to demand his execution. Lamar, by now promoted to Secretary of War, gave a speech insisting that \\"Mobs must not intimidate the government. We want no French Revolution in Texas!\\", but on June 4 soldiers seized Santa Anna and put him under military arrest.[103] Burnet called for elections to ratify the constitution and elect a Congress,[104] the sixth set of leaders for Texas in a twelve-month period.[105] Voters overwhelmingly chose Houston the first president, ratified the constitution drawn up by the Convention of 1836, and approved a resolution to request annexation to the United States.[106] Houston issued an executive order sending Santa Anna to Washington, D.C., and from there he was soon sent home.[107]\\r\\nDuring his absence, Santa Anna had been deposed. Upon his arrival, the Mexican press wasted no time in attacking him for his cruelty towards those executed at Goliad. In May 1837, Santa Anna requested an inquiry into the event.[108] The judge determined the inquiry was only for fact-finding and took no action; press attacks in both Mexico and the United States continued.[109] Santa Anna was disgraced until the following year, when he became a hero of the Pastry War.[110]\\r\\nAlthough the Texian interim governments had vowed to eventually compensate citizens for goods that were impressed during the war efforts, for the most part livestock and horses were not returned.[111] Veterans were guaranteed land bounties; in 1879, surviving Texian veterans who served more than three months from October 1, 1835, through January 1, 1837, were guaranteed an additional 1,280 acres (520?ha) in public lands.[112] Over 1.3 million acres (559 thousand ha) of land were granted; some of this was in Greer County, which was later determined to be part of Oklahoma.[113]\\r\\nWhen Republic President Burnet unknowingly escaped death at New Washington, Almonte had found him by following courier Mike McCormick,[114] whose widowed mother Peggy was the owner of the land on which the battle was subsequently fought.[58] Although she sought financial restitution from the Republic of Texas for loss of livestock and other goods during the battle, McCormick died without recompense. Decades after her death, the state of Texas purchased part of her acreage for a commemoration site.[115]\\r\\nThe San Jacinto Battleground State Historic Site was designated a National Historic Landmark in 1960.[116] The site includes the 570?ft (170?m)[117] San Jacinto Monument, which was erected by the Public Works Administration. Authorized April 21, 1936, and dedicated April 21, 1939, the monument cost $1.5 million (equivalent to $26.39 million in 2015).[118][119] The site hosts a San Jacinto Day festival and battle re-enactment each year in April.[120]\\r\\nBoth the Texas Navy and the United States Navy have commissioned ships named after the Battle of San Jacinto: the Texan schooner San Jacinto and three ships named USS?San Jacinto. There has been one civilian passenger ship named SS San Jacinto.\\r\\nWhen the veteran battleship USS Texas was decommissioned in 1948 and made into a museum ship, it was decided to give her a permanent new anchorage near the San Jacinto Monument, at San Jacinto State Park. Her arrival from Baltimore, where she was decommissioned, was timed for April 21, 1948 ÿ the anniversary of the Battle of San Jacinto.","input":"Who was captured at the battle of san jacinto?"},{"output":"Thursday, May 20, 1993","context":"\\"One for the Road\\" is the final episode of the American television series Cheers. It was the 271st episode of the series and the 25th episode of the eleventh season of the show. It first aired on NBC on Thursday, May 20, 1993, to an audience of approximately 42.4 million households in a 98-minute version, making it the second-highest-rated series finale of all time behind the series finale of M*A*S*H and the highest-rated episode of the 1992ÿ1993 television season in the United States.[1][2] The 98-minute version was re-broadcast on Sunday, May 23, 1993, and an edited 90-minute version aired on Thursday, August 19, 1993.\\r\\nIn this episode, Shelley Long reprised the role of Diane Chambers, a character who is reunited with her former on-off love interest Sam Malone after six years of separation. Rebecca Howe continues her relationship with plumber Don Santry. Frasier Crane helps Woody Boyd write Woody's political speech. A semi-unemployed Norm Peterson wants a job. Cliff Clavin wants to be promoted by the Post Office.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe television series Cheers follows the fortunes and inter-relationships of a group of Bostonians who meet regularly at \\"Cheers\\", their local bar. Sam Malone (Ted Danson), a ladies' man, former baseball player, and bartender, and Diane Chambers (Shelley Long), a college graduate student, and cocktail waitress, had on-and-off relationships throughout first five seasons of the program (1982ÿ1987) until Diane left Boston to pursue a writing career in the season five finale, \\"I Do, Adieu\\" (1987). This was Shelley Long's last contracted appearance as Diane Chambers. Six years after the season five finale, the Sam and Diane storyline is resurrected with a special guest appearance by Shelley Long and then concluded during the third part of this final episode.\\r\\nDuring season eleven there are many transformations before the finale. Woody Boyd (Woody Harrelson), another bartender at Cheers, is married to socialite Kelly Gaines (Jackie Swanson), expecting a child with her, and has been running to be a councilmember of the Boston City Council. Carla Tortelli (Rhea Perlman) has gone through husbands and flings and is currently a single mother. Norm Peterson (George Wendt) is still semi-unemployed. Cliff Clavin (John Ratzenberger) is still a postal carrier living with his mother. Frasier Crane (Kelsey Grammer) and Lilith Sternin (Bebe Neuwirth) face marital problems, including Lilith's affair with another man. After her failed relationships with rich men in the past, the bar manager Rebecca Howe (Kirstie Alley) and the plumber Don Santry (Tom Berenger) start dating each other in the preceding episode, \\"The Guy Can't Help It\\" (1993). Meanwhile, Sam faces up to his sexual addiction and begins to attend group therapy.\\r\\nThe episode ran for 98 minutes, including commercials, when it was originally broadcast.[3] This episode was rebroadcast on August 19, 1993, but was trimmed to 90-minutes.[4] In syndicated and online reruns, this episode was split into three parts, but the DVD release has the original, uncut version.\\r\\nThe episode begins with Frasier writing a political speech for Woody, who has trouble doing it himself. Rebecca rejects plumber Don Santry's (Tom Berenger)[note a] proposal accidentally because she is too excited to accept it, causing him to break up with her. Sam struggles with his sex addiction and wants to avoid watching Kim Alexis on television. Diane Chambers, making her first appearance on the series after six years, appears on television, accepting an award for outstanding writing of a television movie, surprising Sam. Diane calls Sam at the bar to thank him for the congratulatory telegram he sent earlier. Diane accepts Sam's invitation to return to Boston, but Sam reveals to Norm that he doubts her confirmation.\\r\\nThe following day, Cliff wants to be promoted by the head of the postal department, Marty Feldman, who often hires his own relatives rather than hard-working employees by merit, like Cliff. Frasier fails to correct Woody's grammar. Norm begs Woody to hire him as a city accountant. Rebecca arrives an emotional mess in the same dress she wore the previous day. Then Diane arrives with her \\"husband\\" Reed (Mark Harelik), surprising Sam. Sam uses Rebecca, who is grieving her love loss, as his pretend wife. At Melville's restaurant, when Don enters and re-proposes, Rebecca finally accepts in front of the others, ruining Sam's charade. After Rebecca and Don leave, Reed's partner Kevin (Anthony Heald) arrives to confront him for \\"cheating\\" with Diane, who clearly was not married. Now alone at the table, after Kevin and Don leave, Sam and Diane both come to terms with the fact they have no family of their own. Diane admits to Sam that she broke her promise to return to him after six months in the episode \\"I Do, Adieu\\" (1987). In fact, her manuscript was rejected by publishers but then became a television movie prompting her to stay in Los Angeles for six years looking for greater success. When Diane bids Sam farewell and is about to leave, he stops her and convinces her they should rekindle their relationship for old times' sake.\\r\\nThe next day Woody gives Norm a job with the city. Rebecca marries Don but secretly regrets it, feeling he is too good for her. Cliff is promoted to postal assistant supervisor after giving Marty gifts. Sam and Diane walk in and announce their engagement. His friends disapprove. Having enough of their disapproval, and going years without a family, Sam leaves the bar with Diane. On the plane, they begin to reconsider their decision to be together again. As the flight is delayed, they return to the airport terminal and amicably agree to part ways. Diane goes to Los Angeles, and Sam returns to Cheers to see his friends again. While Sam and his gang celebrate the reunion, Rebecca announces happily that Don has a job with the sewer department and leaves excitedly with the tickets for their honeymoon trip. After the rest of the gang head home, Norm stays behind and tells Sam that he knew he would return to Boston for his \\"one true love\\", saying: \\"You'll always come back to her.\\"[note b] After Norm leaves, someone (Bob Broder[note c]) knocks on the door. Sam replies, \\"Sorry, we're closed,\\" then walks over and straightens a picture of Geronimo in honor to Coach Ernie Pantusso[note d] hanging on the back wall, and then exits into the corridor toward the pool room. (In the original broadcast, after the closing credits, the text reads \\"Thanks for having us over on all those Thursday nights.\\" with the show's logo appearing.)\\r\\nThree hundred people attended the filming of the finale at Paramount Studios' Stage 25 in Los Angeles on Wednesday, March 31, 1993, from 7:20?p.m. to 2:15?a.m.[8] Because of Shelley Long's commitment to the CBS sitcom Good Advice, the finale's bar scene ending, where the series main cast gather as their own respective characters, was shot without her on Wednesday, April 7, 1993,[9] after the penultimate episode, \\"The Guy Can't Help It\\", was filmed completely on the same day.[8][note 1] However, the ending was concealed from the general public and the studio audience until the episode was first broadcast.[8] Before her special guest appearance in this episode, Shelley Long's reprise as Diane Chambers was rumored in 1989 when she appeared with Ted Danson at the premiere of one of his movies, Cousins. A spokesperson for Paramount Television denied these rumors.[10] Long appeared as herself for the 200th episode special in 1990, hosted by John McLaughlin, along with other surviving cast members at the time.[11]\\r\\nUnited States President Bill Clinton was invited to be part of the finale, but declined the offer.[12] Brandon Tartikoff, former executive of NBC and former chief of Paramount Studios, and Doonesbury cartoonist Garry Trudeau appeared in the finale as uncredited bar extras.[9] Bob Broder, agent for the show's creators, also made an uncredited appearance in the final moments of the show as the \\"man\\" who is told by Sam that the bar is closed.[7]\\r\\nThe final episode was promoted massively, including in the media, before its initial airing. NBC executives expected a rating of 65? percent of total television households.[14] Sources on Madison Avenue estimated a Nielsen rating of 33ÿ40s and a share of 50ÿ70; one expected a rating of 37ÿ38 and a share of 60.[15] Each 30-second commercial for the original broadcast cost $650,000; the total number of commercials that aired on the initial broadcast was 25 to 30.[16][17][note 2]\\r\\nNBC and its affiliates, such as KNBC, promoted the finale's broadcast for a few weeks up to the day of the original airing on the network's news programs, such as Dateline NBC and Today. KTLA, a Los Angeles station that reran Cheers in syndication, played a variation of the show's theme song, \\"Where Everybody Knows Your Name\\", during the week before the finale. Entertainment Tonight showed blooper reels of Cheers in the same week.[18] Ratings of Season 11 episodes (1992ÿ1993) were growing in the weeks prior to the finale.[15]\\r\\nBetween April 1ÿ4, 1993, the Times Mirror Center for the People and the Press (now the Pew Research Center) surveyed 1,011 people by telephone. Sam Malone was voted a favorite by 26?% and had a 15?% chance of a spin-off. Answering a question as to who he should marry, 21?% voted Diane Chambers, 19?% voted Rebecca Howe, 48?% voted for Sam to remain single, and 12?% had no opinion on this matter. Woody Boyd was voted a favorite by 18?% and had 12?% chance of a spin-off, and Norm Peterson was voted by 14?% and had 10?% chance of a spin-off.[19][20][note 3]\\r\\nNewspapers counted down to the Cheers finale in different ways. The Washington Post covered the show's background.[21] The Star Tribune published stories related to Cheers, including one about local residents playing trivia games that that paid tribute to the show and characters such as Cliff and Norm;[22] the future of the fictional Sam Malone was addressed.[23] The Deseret News asked its readers to send in their own fantasy finale endings before it was broadcast.[24]\\r\\nReviews of this episode at the time of its initial broadcast were mixed. John J. O'Connor from The New York Times called the episode \\"overly long and uncharacteristically labored\\" and considered its length \\"a miscalculation.\\" Nevertheless, O'Connor wrote, \\"Things didn't turn absolutely soppy, but nearly.\\"[16][26] Tony Scott of Daily Variety praised the writing, yet he found the finale \\"overly long\\" and described the last 30 minutes as \\"limping.\\"[27] John Carman of the San Francisco Chronicle \\"liked the finale\\" and \\"was choked up at the end\\"; nevertheless, he found Shelley Long's special guest performance \\"disappointing\\" ÿ her \\"cute pills\\" were past \\"their expiration date.\\" Ann Hodges of The Houston Chronicle \\"found the conclusion fitting\\" but was not sad about the series' cancellation.[28] One reader's letter in The Post-Standard pointed out the episode omitted mention of Coach Ernie Pantusso, one of original Cheers characters who died in 1985, and expressed disdain over this, even though the Geronimo picture was shown at the end to commemorate Coach.[29]\\r\\nThe reviews in later years were mostly positive. In 1998, A. J. Jacobs of Entertainment Weekly graded this finale a B+, calling it \\"a satisfying nightcap\\" and \\"sharply written by the [Charles brothers]\\", with its final moments \\"classy as a flute of chilled Cristal.\\"[30] In 2006, Ron Geraci, author of the book The Bachelor Chronicles: A Dating Memoir, called it \\"raw and moving\\" and \\"significant.\\"[31] In 2007, Dalton Ross of Entertainment Weekly called it one of his \\"Five Best (pre-Sopranos) Series Finales.\\"[32] In 2007, Douglas Durden of The Richmond Times-Dispatch named it his fifth most favorite television finale of all-time.[33] In 2009, the A.V. Club ranked it No. 3 in \\"10 American TV Series with Satisfying Endings\\" in the book Inventory.[34] In 2010, Sharon Knolle of The Huffington Post was relieved to see the final onscreen romance between Sam and Diane end rather than conclude with their marriage.[35] In the same year, Oliver Miller of The Huffington Post was heartbroken by Sam and Diane's on-screen \\"absurd protracted double-gut-punch break-up\\" in the episode.[36] Claire Suddath from Time magazine called it one of top ten \\"anticipated\\" finales ever.[5] In 2011, the finale was ranked fifth on the TV Guide Network special, TV's Most Unforgettable Finales.[37] In 2014, IGN ranked it number six of the top ten Cheers episodes.[38]\\r\\nThe episode aired on NBC on May 20, 1993, at 9:22?p.m. instead of 9:30?p.m., the regular time for Cheers, as the episode was scheduled to run 98-minutes.[note 4] The overall Nielsen rating was 45.5 (approximately 42.4 million households), 64 or 62 share,[3][39][40] and the number of American viewers was either 80 million[41] or 93 million.[3][39][42] The broadcast in 29 major markets resulted an overnight 46.7 Nielsen rating (22 million households) and 62 share.[43] In the Los Angeles area, the finale scored a 44.5 rating for (KNBC);[2] in the MinneapolisÿSt. Paul market (KARE), a 54.8 rating and 72 share;[44] in New York City (WNBC), a 45.6 rating;[45] in the HartfordÿNew Haven (WVIT) area, a 48 rating and 63 share;[46] and in Boston (WBZ-TV), the series' setting, a 54.1 rating.[47]\\r\\nThe retrospective program, Cheers: Last Call!, hosted by Bob Costas, paid tribute to 11 years of Cheers and aired at 9:00?p.m. before the 9:22?p.m. finale.[3][48] It received an overall 39.6 rating (36.9 million households); the Los Angeles rating was 40.0.[2]\\r\\nThe finale reran on Sunday, May 23, 1993, from 7:22?p.m. to 9:00?p.m. ET with a Nielsen rating of 10.0. Cheers: Last Call!, which ran from 7:00?p.m. to 7:22?p.m. ET had a 7.4 rating.[2][39] The finale reran again on Thursday, August 19, 1993, in a 90-minute format from 8:00?p.m. to 9:30?p.m. and received a 9.4 rating.[4][49][50]\\r\\nAt the 45th Primetime Emmy Awards (1993), Robert Bramwell won Outstanding Achievement in Editing for a Series (Multi-Camera Production).[51][52] Shelley Long lost the Outstanding Guest Actress in a Comedy Series to Tracey Ullman (Love and War).[52][53] Tom Berenger lost the Outstanding Guest Actor in a Comedy Series to David Clennon (Dream On).[52][54] James Burrows lost the Outstanding Individual Achievement in Directing in a Comedy Series to Betty Thomas (Dream On)[52][55]\\r\\nBefore and after the production of Cheers had ended, the cast had moved on to other stages in their careers. Shelley Long appeared on the CBS show Good Advice before this episode, and resumed her work there. Ted Danson appeared in Made in America, which opened in theatres soon after the episode aired. Kirstie Alley participated in the film Look Who's Talking Now.[56]\\r\\nWoody Harrelson appeared in Indecent Proposal, with Demi Moore and Robert Redford already showing in theaters, and appeared in Oliver Stone's Natural Born Killers. George Wendt appeared in an off-Broadway play. John Ratzenberger appeared in Fox's Locals. Rhea Perlman took \\"a break\\" from acting for a while. Kelsey Grammer soon reappeared as Frasier Crane in the spinoff Frasier, set in Seattle, as the host of a new radio show[56] with only occasional appearances of Lilith Sternin or their son Frederick during its 11-year run. However, Frasier would eventually return to Boston for a visit, along with his brother Niles and father Martin (played by David Hyde Pierce and John Mahoney, respectively).\\r\\nBefore the first airing of this series finale, more than five hundred people, including the cast of Cheers (except Shelley Long, Kirstie Alley, and Bebe Neuwirth)[57]) and politicians such as William M. Bulger and past State Governor William Weld, participated at an afternoon celebration on Beacon Street near the Bull & Finch Pub in Boston, to celebrate the series' ending.[57] After the episode aired, the remaining cast appeared live on The Tonight Show with Jay Leno in the Bull & Finch Pub. According to host Jay Leno, the cast was so intoxicated they were unaware that they were being interviewed live.[58]\\r\\nIn 1997, one copy of this episode's script was donated by George Wendt to the Handel and Haydn Society, a Boston music institution. It contained the autographs of eight cast members, including of Shelley Long, Woody Harrelson, and George Wendt. On February 15, 1997, it was stolen from the Boston Four Seasons Hotel. The high bid for it at the benefit auction was $1,000 before it was stolen. About one week later, the stolen script, in a manila envelope, was left at a church; the Society then retrieved it. In March 1997, the autographed copy of the episode's script was sold to the Bull and Finch Pub (now Cheers Beacon Hill) for $10,000.[59][60]","input":"When did the last episode of cheers air?"},{"output":"the plural of the Arabic word for \\"desert\\"","context":"The Sahara (Arabic: ??????? ???????, al-?a?r? al-kubr, 'the Greatest Desert') is the largest hot desert and the third largest desert in the world after Antarctica and the Arctic.[1] Its area of 9,200,000 square kilometres (3,600,000?sq?mi)[2] is comparable to the area of China or the United States.\\r\\nThe desert comprises much of North Africa, excluding the fertile region on the Mediterranean Sea coast, the Atlas Mountains of the Maghreb, and the Nile Valley in Egypt and Sudan. It stretches from the Red Sea in the east and the Mediterranean in the north to the Atlantic Ocean in the west, where the landscape gradually changes from desert to coastal plains. To the south, it is bounded by the Sahel, a belt of semi-arid tropical savanna around the Niger River valley and the Sudan Region of Sub-Saharan Africa.\\r\\nThe Sahara can be divided into several regions including: the western Sahara, the central Ahaggar Mountains, the Tibesti Mountains, the A?r Mountains, the Tnr desert, and the Libyan Desert.\\r\\nThe name 'Sahara' is derived from ?a?r (???????, pronounced /?s?a?a?ra?/), the plural of the Arabic word for \\"desert\\".[3][4][5][6]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Sahara covers large parts of Algeria, Chad, Egypt, Libya, Mali, Mauritania, Niger, Western Sahara, Sudan and Tunisia. It covers 9?million square kilometres (3,500,000?sq?mi), amounting to 31% of Africa. If all areas with a mean annual precipitation of less than 250?mm were included, the Sahara would be 11?million square kilometres (4,200,000?sq?mi). It is one of three distinct physiographic provinces of the African massive physiographic division.\\r\\nThe Sahara is mainly rocky hamada (stone plateaus), Ergs (sand seas - large areas covered with sand dunes) form only a minor part, but many of the sand dunes are over 180 metres (590?ft) high.[7] Wind or rare rainfall shape the desert features: sand dunes, dune fields, sand seas, stone plateaus, gravel plains (reg), dry valleys (wadi), dry lakes (oued), and salt flats (shatt or chott).[8] Unusual landforms include the Richat Structure in Mauritania.\\r\\nSeveral deeply dissected mountains, many volcanic, rise from the desert, including the A?r Mountains, Ahaggar Mountains, Saharan Atlas, Tibesti Mountains, Adrar des Iforas, and the Red Sea hills. The highest peak in the Sahara is Emi Koussi, a shield volcano in the Tibesti range of northern Chad.\\r\\nThe central Sahara is hyperarid, with sparse vegetation. The northern and southern reaches of the desert, along with the highlands, have areas of sparse grassland and desert shrub, with trees and taller shrubs in wadis, where moisture collects. In the central, hyperarid region, there are many subdivisions of the great desert: Tanezrouft, the Tnr, the Libyan Desert, the Eastern Desert, the Nubian Desert and others. These extremely arid areas often receive no rain for years.\\r\\nTo the north, the Sahara skirts the Mediterranean Sea in Egypt and portions of Libya, but in Cyrenaica and the Maghreb, the Sahara borders the Mediterranean forest, woodland, and scrub eco-regions of northern Africa, all of which have a Mediterranean climate characterized by hot summers and cool and rainy winters. According to the botanical criteria of Frank White[9] and geographer Robert Capot-Rey,[10][11] the northern limit of the Sahara corresponds to the northern limit of date palm cultivation and the southern limit of the range of esparto, a grass typical of the Mediterranean climate portion of the Maghreb and Iberia. The northern limit also corresponds to the 100?mm (3.9?in) isohyet of annual precipitation.[12]\\r\\nTo the south, the Sahara is bounded by the Sahel, a belt of dry tropical savanna with a summer rainy season that extends across Africa from east to west. The southern limit of the Sahara is indicated botanically by the southern limit of Cornulaca monacantha (a drought-tolerant member of the Chenopodiaceae), or northern limit of Cenchrus biflorus, a grass typical of the Sahel.[10][11] According to climatic criteria, the southern limit of the Sahara corresponds to the 150?mm (5.9?in) isohyet of annual precipitation (this is a long-term average, since precipitation varies annually).[12]\\r\\nImportant cities located in the Sahara include Nouakchott, the capital of Mauritania; Tamanrasset, Ouargla, Bchar, Hassi Messaoud, Gharda?a, and El Oued in Algeria; Timbuktu in Mali; Agadez in Niger; Ghat in Libya; and Faya-Largeau in Chad.\\r\\nThe Sahara is the world's largest low-latitude hot desert. The area is located in the horse latitudes under the subtropical ridge, a significant belt of semi-permanent subtropical warm-core high pressure where the air from upper levels of the troposphere tends to sink towards the ground. This steady descending airflow causes a warming and a drying effect in the upper troposphere. The sinking air prevents evaporating water from rising and, therefore, prevents the adiabatic cooling, which makes cloud formation extremely difficult to nearly impossible.[13]\\r\\nThe permanent dissolution of clouds allows unhindered light and thermal radiation. The stability of the atmosphere above the desert prevents any convective overturning, thus making rainfall virtually non-existent. As a consequence, the weather tends to be sunny, dry and stable with a minimal risk of rainfall. Subsiding, diverging, dry air masses associated with subtropical high-pressure systems are extremely unfavorable for the development of convectional showers. The subtropical ridge is the predominate factor that explains the hot desert climate (K?ppen climate classification BWh) of this vast region. The lowering of air is the strongest and the most effective over the eastern part of the Great Desert, in the Libyan Desert which is the sunniest, driest and the most nearly \\"rain-less\\" place on the planet rivaling the Atacama Desert, lying in Chile and Peru.\\r\\nThe rainfall inhibition and the dissipation of cloud cover are most accentuated over the eastern section of the Sahara rather than the western. The prevailing air mass lying above the Sahara is the continental tropical (cT) air mass, which is hot and dry. Hot, dry air masses primarily form over the North-African desert from the heating of the vast continental land area, and it affects the whole desert during most of the year. Because of this extreme heating process, a thermal low is usually noticed near the surface, and is the strongest and the most developed during the summertime. The Sahara High represents the eastern continental extension of the Azores High,[citation needed] centered over the North Atlantic Ocean. The subsidence of the Sahara High nearly reaches the ground during the coolest part of the year while it is confined to the upper troposphere during the hottest periods.\\r\\nThe effects of local surface low pressure are extremely limited because upper-level subsidence still continues to block any form of air ascent. Also, to be protected against rain-bearing weather systems by the atmospheric circulation itself, the desert is made even drier by his geographical configuration and location. Indeed, the extreme aridity of the Sahara can not be only explained by the subtropical high pressure. The Atlas Mountains, found in Algeria, Morocco and Tunisia also help to enhance the aridity of the northern part of the desert. These major mountain ranges act as a barrier causing a strong rain shadow effect on the leeward side by dropping much of the humidity brought by atmospheric disturbances along the polar front which affects the surrounding Mediterranean climates.\\r\\nThe primary source of rain in the Sahara is the Intertropical Convergence Zone, a continuous belt of low-pressure systems near the equator which bring the brief, short and irregular rainy season to the Sahel and southern Sahara. Rainfall in this giant desert has to overcome the physical and atmospheric barriers that normally prevent the production of precipitation. The harsh climate of the Sahara is characterized by: extremely low, unreliable, highly erratic rainfall; extremely high sunshine duration values; high temperatures year-round; negligible rates of relative humidity; a significant diurnal temperature variation; and extremely high levels of potential evaporation which are the highest recorded worldwide.[14]\\r\\nThe sky is usually clear above the desert and the sunshine duration is extremely high everywhere in the Sahara. Most of the desert enjoys more than 3,600 h of bright sunshine annually or over 82% of the time, and a wide area in the eastern part experiences in excess of 4,000 h of bright sunshine a year or over 91% of the time. The highest values are very close to the theoretical maximum value. A value of 4,300 h or 98% of the time would be recorded in Upper Egypt (Aswan, Luxor) and in the Nubian Desert (Wadi Halfa).[15] The annual average direct solar irradiation is around 2,800 kWh/(m2 year) in the Great Desert. The Sahara has a huge potential for solar energy production.\\r\\nThe constantly high position of the sun, the extremely low relative humidity, and the lack of vegetation and rainfall make the Great Desert the hottest continuously large area worldwide, and the hottest place on Earth during summer in some spots. The average high temperature exceeds 38 to 40?C or 100.4 to 104.0?F during the hottest month nearly everywhere in the desert except at very high altitudes. The highest officially recorded average high temperature[clarification needed] was 47?C or 116.6?F in a remote desert town in the Algerian Desert called Bou Bernous with an elevation of 378 metres (1,240?ft) meters above sea level.[15] It is the worlds highest recorded average high temperature[clarification needed] and only Death Valley, California rivals it.[16] Other hot spots in Algeria such as Adrar, Timimoun, In Salah, Ouallene, Aoulef, Reggane with an elevation between 200 and 400 metres (660 and 1,310?ft) above sea level get slightly lower summer average highs around 46?C or 114.8?F during the hottest months of the year. Salah, well known in Algeria for its extreme heat, has average high temperatures of 43.8?C or 110.8?F, 46.4?C or 115.5?F, 45.5?C or 113.9?F and 41.9?C or 107.4?F in June, July, August and September respectively. There are even hotter spots in the Sahara, but they are located in extremely remote areas, especially in the Azalai, lying in northern Mali. The major part of the desert experiences around three to five months when the average high strictly exceeds 40?C or 104?F. The southern central part of the desert experiences up to six or seven months when the average high temperature strictly exceeds 40?C or 104?F which shows the constancy and the length of the really hot season in the Sahara. Some examples of this are: Bilma, Niger and Faya-Largeau, Chad. The annual average daily temperature exceeds 20?C or 68?F everywhere and can approach 30?C or 86?F in the hottest regions year-round. However, most of the desert has a value in excess of 25?C or 77?F.\\r\\nSand and ground temperatures are even more extreme. During daytime, the sand temperature is extremely high as it can easily reach 80?C or 176?F or more.[17] A sand temperature of 83.5?C (182.3?F) has been recorded in Port Sudan.[17] Ground temperatures of 72?C or 161.6?F have been recorded in the Adrar of Mauritania and a value of 75?C (167?F) has been measured in Borkou, northern Chad.[17]\\r\\nDue to lack of cloud cover and very low humidity, the desert usually features high diurnal temperature variations between days and nights. However, it is a myth that the nights are cold after extremely hot days in the Sahara. The average diurnal temperature range is typically between 13 and 20?C or 23.4 and 36.0?F. The lowest values are found along the coastal regions due to high humidity and are often even lower than 10?C or 18?F, while the highest values are found in inland desert areas where the humidity is the lowest, mainly in the southern Sahara. Still, it is true that winter nights can be cold as it can drop to the freezing point and even below, especially in high-elevation areas. The frequency of subfreezing winter nights in the Sahara is strongly influenced by the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO), with warmer winter temperatures during negative NAO events and cooler winters with more frosts when the NAO is positive.[18] This is because the weaker clockwise flow around the eastern side of the subtropical anticyclone during negative NAO winters, although too dry to produce more than negligible precipitation, does reduce the flow of dry, cold air from higher latitudes of Eurasia into the Sahara significantly.[19]\\r\\nThe average annual rainfall ranges from very low in the northern and southern fringes of the desert to nearly non-existent over the central and the eastern part. The thin northern fringe of the desert receives more winter cloudiness and rainfall due to the arrival of low pressure systems over the Mediterranean Sea along the polar front, although very attenuated by the rain shadow effects of the mountains and the annual average rainfall ranges from 100 millimetres (4?in) to 250 millimetres (10?in). For example, Biskra, Algeria and Ouarzazate, Morocco are found in this zone. The southern fringe of the desert along the border with the Sahel receives summer cloudiness and rainfall due to the arrival of the Intertropical Convergence Zone from the south and the annual average rainfall ranges from 100 millimetres (4?in) to 250 millimetres (10?in). For example, Timbuktu, Mali and Agadez, Niger are found in this zone. The vast central hyper-arid core of the desert is virtually never affected by northerly or southerly atmospheric disturbances and permanently remains under the influence of the strongest anticyclonic weather regime, and the annual average rainfall can drop to less than 1 millimetre (0.04?in). In fact, most of the Sahara receives less than 20 millimetres (0.8?in). Of the 9,000,000 square kilometres (3,500,000?sq?mi) of desert land in the Sahara, an area of about 2,800,000 square kilometres (1,100,000?sq?mi) (about 31% of the total area) receives an annual average rainfall amount of 10 millimetres (0.4?in) or less, while some 1,500,000 square kilometres (580,000?sq?mi) (about 17% of the total area) receives an average of 5 millimetres (0.2?in) or less.[20] The annual average rainfall is virtually zero over a wide area of some 1,000,000 square kilometres (390,000?sq?mi) in the eastern Sahara comprising deserts of: Libya, Egypt and Sudan (Tazirbu, Kufra, Dakhla, Kharga, Farafra, Siwa, Asyut, Sohag, Luxor, Aswan, Abu Simbel, Wadi Halfa) where the long-term mean approximates 0.5 millimetres (0.02?in) per year.[20] Rainfall is very unreliable and erratic in the Sahara as it may vary considerably year by year. In full contrast to the negligible annual rainfall amounts, the annual rates of potential evaporation are extraordinarily high, roughly ranging from 2,500 millimetres (100?in) per year to more than 6,000 millimetres (240?in) per year in the whole desert.[21] Nowhere else on Earth has air been found as dry and evaporative as in the Sahara region. However, at least two instances of snowfall have been recorded in Sahara, in February 1979 and December 2016, both in the town of Ain Sefra.[22]\\r\\nThe Sahara comprises several distinct ecoregions. With their variations in temperature, rainfall, elevation, and soil, these regions harbor distinct communities of plants and animals.\\r\\nThe Atlantic coastal desert is a narrow strip along the Atlantic coast where fog generated offshore by the cool Canary Current provides sufficient moisture to sustain a variety of lichens, succulents, and shrubs. It covers an area of 39,900 square kilometers (15,400?sq?mi) in the south of Morocco and Mauritania.[23]\\r\\nThe North Saharan steppe and woodlands is along the northern desert, next to the Mediterranean forests, woodlands, and scrub ecoregions of the northern Maghreb and Cyrenaica. Winter rains sustain shrublands and dry woodlands that form a transition between the Mediterranean climate regions to the north and the hyper-arid Sahara proper to the south. It covers 1,675,300 square kilometers (646,840?sq?mi) in Algeria, Egypt, Libya, Mauritania, Morocco, and Tunisia.[24]\\r\\nThe Sahara Desert ecoregion covers the hyper-arid central portion of the Sahara where rainfall is minimal and sporadic. Vegetation is rare, and this ecoregion consists mostly of sand dunes (erg, chech, raoui), stone plateaus (hamadas), gravel plains (reg), dry valleys (wadis), and salt flats. It covers 4,639,900 square kilometres (1,791,500?sq?mi) of: Algeria, Chad, Egypt, Libya, Mali, Mauritania, Niger, and Sudan.[8]\\r\\nThe South Saharan steppe and woodlands ecoregion is a narrow band running east and west between the hyper-arid Sahara and the Sahel savannas to the south. Movements of the equatorial Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ) bring summer rains during July and August which average 100 to 200?mm (4 to 8?in) but vary greatly from year to year. These rains sustain summer pastures of grasses and herbs, with dry woodlands and shrublands along seasonal watercourses. This ecoregion covers 1,101,700 square kilometres (425,400?sq?mi) in Algeria, Chad, Mali, Mauritania, and Sudan.[25]\\r\\nIn the West Saharan montane xeric woodlands, several volcanic highlands provide a cooler, moister environment that supports Saharo-Mediterranean woodlands and shrublands. The ecoregion covers 258,100 square kilometres (99,650?sq?mi), mostly in the Tassili n'Ajjer of Algeria, with smaller enclaves in the A?r of Niger, the Dhar Adrar of Mauritania, and the Adrar des Iforas of Mali and Algeria.[26]\\r\\nThe Tibesti-Jebel Uweinat montane xeric woodlands ecoregion consists of the Tibesti and Jebel Uweinat highlands. Higher and more regular rainfall and cooler temperatures support woodlands and shrublands of Date palm, acacias, myrtle, oleander, tamarix, and several rare and endemic plants. The ecoregion covers 82,200 square kilometres (31,700?sq?mi) in the Tibesti of Chad and Libya, and Jebel Uweinat on the border of Egypt, Libya, and Sudan.[27]\\r\\nThe Saharan halophytics is an area of seasonally flooded saline depressions which is home to halophytic (salt-adapted) plant communities. The Saharan halophytics cover 54,000 square kilometres (21,000?sq?mi) including: the Qattara and Siwa depressions in northern Egypt, the Tunisian salt lakes of central Tunisia, Chott Melghir in Algeria, and smaller areas of Algeria, Mauritania, and the southern part of Morocco.[28]\\r\\nThe Tanezrouft is one of the harshest regions on Earth as well as one of the hottest and driest parts of the Sahara, with no vegetation and very little life. It is along the borders of Algeria, Niger]] and Mali, west of the Hoggar mountains.\\r\\nThe flora of the Sahara is highly diversified based on the bio-geographical characteristics of this vast desert. Floristically, the Sahara has three zones based on the amount of rainfall received ÿ the Northern (Mediterranean), Central and Southern Zones. There are two transitional zones ÿ the Mediterranean-Sahara transition and the Sahel transition zone.[29]\\r\\nThe Saharan flora comprises around 2800 species of vascular plants. Approximately a quarter of these are endemic. About half of these species are common to the flora of the Arabian deserts.[30]\\r\\nThe central Sahara is estimated to include five hundred species of plants, which is extremely low considering the huge extent of the area. Plants such as acacia trees, palms, succulents, spiny shrubs, and grasses have adapted to the arid conditions, by growing lower to avoid water loss by strong winds, by storing water in their thick stems to use it in dry periods, by having long roots that travel horizontally to reach the maximum area of water and to find any surface moisture, and by having small thick leaves or needles to prevent water loss by evapotranspiration. Plant leaves may dry out totally and then recover.\\r\\nSeveral species of fox live in the Sahara including: the fennec fox, pale fox and Rppell's fox. The addax, a large white antelope, can go nearly a year in the desert without drinking. The dorcas gazelle is a north African gazelle that can also go for a long time without water. Other notable gazelles include the rhim gazelle and dama gazelle.\\r\\nThe Saharan cheetah (northwest African cheetah) lives in Algeria, Togo, Niger, Mali, Benin, and Burkina Faso. There remain fewer than 250 mature cheetahs, which are very cautious, fleeing any human presence. The cheetah avoids the sun from April to October, seeking the shelter of shrubs such as balanites and acacias. They are unusually pale.[31][32] The other cheetah subspecies (northeast African cheetah) lives in Chad, Sudan and the eastern region of Niger. However, it is currently extinct in the wild in Egypt and Libya. There are approximately 2000 mature individuals left in the wild.\\r\\nOther animals include the monitor lizards, hyrax, sand vipers, and small populations of African wild dog,[33] in perhaps only 14 countries[34] and red-necked ostrich. Other animals exist in the Sahara (birds in particular) such as African silverbill and black-faced firefinch, among others. There are also small desert crocodiles in Mauritania and the Ennedi Plateau of Chad.[35]\\r\\nThe deathstalker scorpion can be 10?cm (3.9?in) long. Its venom contains large amounts of agitoxin and scyllatoxin and is very dangerous; however, a sting from this scorpion rarely kills a healthy adult. The Saharan silver ant is unique in that due to the extreme high temperatures of their habitat, and the threat of predators, the ants are active outside their nest for only about ten minutes per day.[36]\\r\\nDromedary camels and goats are the domesticated animals most commonly found in the Sahara. Because of its qualities of endurance and speed, the dromedary is the favourite animal used by nomads.\\r\\nHuman activities are more likely to affect the habitat in areas of permanent water (oases) or where water comes close to the surface. Here, the local pressure on natural resources can be intense. The remaining populations of large mammals have been greatly reduced by hunting for food and recreation. In recent years development projects have started in the deserts of Algeria and Tunisia using irrigated water pumped from underground aquifers. These schemes often lead to soil degradation and salinization.\\r\\nResearchers from Hacettepe University (Ycekutlu, N. et al., 2011) have reported that Saharan soil may have bio-available iron and also some essential macro and micro nutrient elements suitable for use as fertilizer for growing wheat.[37]\\r\\nPeople lived on the edge of the desert thousands of years ago[38] since the end of the last glacial period. The Sahara was then a much wetter place than it is today. Over 30,000 petroglyphs of river animals such as crocodiles[39] survive, with half found in the Tassili n'Ajjer in southeast Algeria. Fossils of dinosaurs, including Afrovenator, Jobaria and Ouranosaurus, have also been found here. The modern Sahara, though, is not lush in vegetation, except in the Nile Valley, at a few oases, and in the northern highlands, where Mediterranean plants such as the olive tree are found to grow. It was long believed that the region had been this way since about 1600 BCE, after shifts in the Earth's axis increased temperatures and decreased precipitation, which led to the abrupt desertification of North Africa about 5,400 years ago.[40] However, this theory has recently been called into dispute, when samples taken from several 7 million year old sand deposits led scientists to reconsider the timeline for desertification.[41]\\r\\nThe Kiffian culture is a prehistoric industry, or domain, that existed between 10,000 and 8,000 years ago in the Sahara, during the Neolithic Subpluvial. Human remains from this culture were found in 2000 at a site known as Gobero, located in Niger in the Tnr Desert.[42] The site is known as the largest and earliest grave of Stone Age people in the Sahara desert.[43] The Kiffians were skilled hunters. Bones of many large savannah animals that were discovered in the same area suggest that they lived on the shores of a lake that was present during the Holocene Wet Phase, a period when the Sahara was verdant and wet.[43] The Kiffian people were tall, standing over six feet in height.[42] Craniometric analysis indicates that this early Holocene population was closely related to the Late Pleistocene Iberomaurusians and early Holocene Capsians of the Maghreb, as well as mid-Holocene Mechta groups.[44] Traces of the Kiffian culture do not exist after 8,000 years ago, as the Sahara went through a dry period for the next thousand years.[45] After this time, the Tenerian culture colonized the area.\\r\\nGobero was discovered in 2000 during an archaeological expedition led by Paul Sereno, which sought dinosaur remains. Two distinct prehistoric cultures were discovered at the site: the early Holocene Kiffian culture, and the middle Holocene Tenerian culture. The Kiffians were a prehistoric people who preceded the Tenerians and vanished approximately 8000 years ago, when the desert became very dry. The desiccation lasted until around 4600 BC, when the earliest artefacts associated with the Tenerians have been dated to. Some 200 skeletons have been discovered at Gobero. The Tenerians were considerably shorter in height and less robust than the earlier Kiffians. Craniometric analysis also indicates that they were osteologically distinct. The Kiffian skulls are akin to those of the Late Pleistocene Iberomaurusians, early Holocene Capsians, and mid-Holocene Mechta groups, whereas the Tenerian crania are more like those of Mediterranean groups.[46][47] Graves show that the Tenerians observed spiritual traditions, as they were buried with artifacts such as jewelry made of hippo tusks and clay pots. The most interesting find is a triple burial, dated to 5300 years ago, of an adult female and two children, estimated through their teeth as being five and eight years old, hugging each other. Pollen residue indicates they were buried on a bed of flowers. The three are assumed to have died within 24 hours of each other, but as their skeletons hold no apparent trauma (they did not die violently) and they have been buried so elaborately - unlikely if they had died of a plague - the cause of their deaths is a mystery.\\r\\nUan Muhuggiag appears to have been inhabited from at least the 6th millennium BC to about 2700 BC, although not necessarily continuously.[48] The most noteworthy find at Uan Muhuggiag is the well-preserved mummy of a young boy of approximately 2 1/2 years old. The child was in a fetal position, then embalmed, then placed in a sack made of antelope skin, which was insulated by a layer of leaves.[49] The boy's organs were removed, as evidenced by incisions in his stomach and thorax, and an organic preservative was inserted to stop his body from decomposing.[50] An ostrich eggshell necklace was also found around his neck.[48] Radiocarbon dating determined the age of the mummy to be approximately 5600 years old, which makes it about 1000 years older than the earliest previously recorded mummy in ancient Egypt.[51] In 1958-1959, an archaeological expedition led by Antonio Ascenzi conducted anthropological, radiological, histological and chemical analyses on the Uan Muhuggiag mummy. The specimen was determined to be that of a 30-month old child of uncertain sex, who possessed Negroid features. A long incision on the specimen's abdominal wall also indicated that the body had been initially mummified by evisceration and later underwent natural desiccation.[52] One other individual, an adult, was found at Uan Muhuggiag, buried in a crouched position.[48] However, the body showed no evidence of evisceration or any other method of preservation. The body was estimated to date from about 7500 BP.[53]\\r\\nDuring the Neolithic Era, before the onset of desertification around 9500 BCE, the central Sudan had been a rich environment supporting a large population ranging across what is now barren desert, like the Wadi el-Qa'ab. By the 5th millennium BCE, the people who inhabited what is now called Nubia, were full participants in the \\"agricultural revolution\\", living a settled lifestyle with domesticated plants and animals. Saharan rock art of cattle and herdsmen suggests the presence of a cattle cult like those found in Sudan and other pastoral societies in Africa today.[54] Megaliths found at Nabta Playa are overt examples of probably the world's first known archaeoastronomy devices, predating Stonehenge by some 2,000 years.[55] This complexity, as observed at Nabta Playa, and as expressed by different levels of authority within the society there, likely formed the basis for the structure of both the Neolithic society at Nabta and the Old Kingdom of Egypt.[56]\\r\\nBy 6000 BCE predynastic Egyptians in the southwestern corner of Egypt were herding cattle and constructing large buildings. Subsistence in organized and permanent settlements in predynastic Egypt by the middle of the 6th millennium BCE centered predominantly on cereal and animal agriculture: cattle, goats, pigs and sheep. Metal objects replaced prior ones of stone. Tanning of animal skins, pottery and weaving were commonplace in this era also. There are indications of seasonal or only temporary occupation of the Al Fayyum in the 6th millennium BCE, with food activities centering on fishing, hunting and food-gathering. Stone arrowheads, knives and scrapers from the era are commonly found.[57] Burial items included pottery, jewelry, farming and hunting equipment, and assorted foods including dried meat and fruit. Burial in desert environments appears to enhance Egyptian preservation rites, and the dead were buried facing due west.[58]\\r\\nBy 3400 BCE, the Sahara was as dry as it is today, due to reduced precipitation and higher temperatures resulting from a shift in the Earth's orbit.[40] As a result of this aridification, it became a largely impenetrable barrier to humans, with the remaining settlements mainly being concentrated around the numerous oases that dot the landscape. Little trade or commerce is known to have passed through the interior in subsequent periods, the only major exception being the Nile Valley. The Nile, however, was impassable at several cataracts, making trade and contact by boat difficult.\\r\\nThe people of Phoenicia, who flourished from 1200ÿ800 BCE, created a confederation of kingdoms across the entire Sahara to Egypt. They generally settled along the Mediterranean coast, as well as the Sahara, among the people of ancient Libya, who were the ancestors of people who speak Berber languages in North Africa and the Sahara today, including the Tuareg of the central Sahara.\\r\\nThe Phoenician alphabet seems to have been adopted by the ancient Libyans of north Africa, and Tifinagh is still used today by Berber-speaking Tuareg camel herders of the central Sahara.\\r\\nSometime between 633 BCE and 530 BCE, Hanno the Navigator either established or reinforced Phoenician colonies in Western Sahara, but all ancient remains have vanished with virtually no trace.\\r\\nBy 500 BCE, Greeks arrived in the desert. Greek traders spread along the eastern coast of the desert, establishing trading colonies along the Red Sea. The Carthaginians explored the Atlantic coast of the desert, but the turbulence of the waters and the lack of markets caused a lack of presence further south than modern Morocco. Centralized states thus surrounded the desert on the north and east; it remained outside the control of these states. Raids from the nomadic Berber people of the desert were of constant concern to those living on the edge of the desert.\\r\\nAn urban civilization, the Garamantes, arose around 500 BCE in the heart of the Sahara, in a valley that is now called the Wadi al-Ajal in Fezzan, Libya.[59] The Garamantes achieved this development by digging tunnels far into the mountains flanking the valley to tap fossil water and bring it to their fields. The Garamantes grew populous and strong, conquering their neighbors and capturing many slaves (who were put to work extending the tunnels). The ancient Greeks and the Romans knew of the Garamantes and regarded them as uncivilized nomads. However, they traded with them, and a Roman bath has been found in the Garamantes' capital of Garama. Archaeologists have found eight major towns and many other important settlements in the Garamantes' territory. The Garamantes' civilization eventually collapsed after they had depleted available water in the aquifers and could no longer sustain the effort to extend the tunnels further into the mountains.[60]\\r\\nThe Berber people occupied (and still occupy) much of the Sahara. The Garamantes Berbers built a prosperous empire in the heart of the desert.[61] The Tuareg nomads continue to inhabit and move across wide Sahara surfaces to the present day.\\r\\nThe Byzantine Empire ruled the northern shores of the Sahara from the 5th to the 7th centuries. After the Muslim conquest of Arabia, specifically the Arabian peninsula, the Muslim conquest of North Africa began in the mid-7th to early 8th centuries and Islamic influence expanded rapidly on the Sahara. By the end of 641 all of Egypt was in Muslim hands. Trade across the desert intensified, and a significant slave trade crossed the desert. It has been estimated that from the 10th to 19th centuries some 6,000 to 7,000 slaves were transported north each year.[62]\\r\\nIn the 16th century the northern fringe of the Sahara, such as coastal regencies in present-day Algeria and Tunisia, as well as some parts of present-day Libya, together with the semi-autonomous kingdom of Egypt, were occupied by the Ottoman Empire. From 1517 Egypt was a valued part of the Ottoman Empire, ownership of which provided the Ottomans with control over the Nile Valley, the east Mediterranean and North Africa. The benefit of the Ottoman Empire was the freedom of movement for citizens and goods. Traders exploited the Ottoman land routes to handle the spices, gold and silk from the East, manufactured goods from Europe, and the slave and gold traffic from Africa. Arabic continued as the local language and Islamic culture was much reinforced. The Sahel and southern Sahara regions were home to several independent states or to roaming Tuareg clans.\\r\\nEuropean colonialism in the Sahara began in the 19th century. France conquered the regency of Algiers from the Ottomans in 1830, and French rule spread south from Algeria and eastwards from Senegal into the upper Niger to include present-day Algeria, Chad, Mali then French Sudan including Timbuktu, Mauritania, Morocco (1912), Niger, and Tunisia (1881). By the beginning of the 20th century, the trans-Saharan trade had clearly declined because goods were moved through more modern and efficient means, such as airplanes, rather than across the desert.[63]\\r\\nThe French Colonial Empire was the dominant presence in the Sahara. It established regular air links from Toulouse (HQ of famed Aropostale), to Oran and over the Hoggar to Timbuktu and West to Bamako and Dakar, as well as trans-Sahara bus services run by La Companie Transsaharienne (est. 1927).[64] A remarkable film shot by famous aviator Captain Ren Wauthier documents the first crossing by a large truck convoy from Algiers to Tchad, across the Sahara.[65]\\r\\nEgypt, under Muhammad Ali and his successors, conquered Nubia in 1820ÿ22, founded Khartoum in 1823, and conquered Darfur in 1874. Egypt, including the Sudan, became a British protectorate in 1882. Egypt and Britain lost control of the Sudan from 1882 to 1898 as a result of the Mahdist War. After its capture by British troops in 1898, the Sudan became an Anglo-Egyptian condominium.\\r\\nSpain captured present-day Western Sahara after 1874, although Rio del Oro remained largely under Sahrawi influence. In 1912, Italy captured parts of what was to be named Libya from the Ottomans. To promote the Roman Catholic religion in the desert, Pope Pius IX appointed a delegate Apostolic of the Sahara and the Sudan in 1868; later in the 19th century his jurisdiction was reorganized into the Vicariate Apostolic of Sahara.\\r\\nEgypt became independent of Britain in 1936, although the Anglo-Egyptian treaty of 1936 allowed Britain to keep troops in Egypt and to maintain the British-Egyptian condominium in the Sudan. British military forces were withdrawn in 1954.\\r\\nMost of the Saharan states achieved independence after World War II: Libya in 1951; Morocco, Sudan, and Tunisia in 1956; Chad, Mali, Mauritania, and Niger in 1960; and Algeria in 1962. Spain withdrew from Western Sahara in 1975, and it was partitioned between Mauritania and Morocco. Mauritania withdrew in 1979; Morocco continues to hold the territory.\\r\\nIn the post-World War II era, several mines and communities have developed to utilize the desert's natural resources. These include large deposits of oil and natural gas in Algeria and Libya, and large deposits of phosphates in Morocco and Western Sahara.\\r\\nA number of Trans-African highways have been proposed across the Sahara, including the CairoÿDakar Highway along the Atlantic coast, the Trans-Sahara Highway from Algiers on the Mediterranean to Kano in Nigeria, the Tripoli ÿ Cape Town Highway from Tripoli in Libya to N'Djamena in Chad, and the Cairo ÿ Cape Town Highway which follows the Nile. Each of these highways is partially complete, with significant gaps and unpaved sections.\\r\\nThe people of the Sahara are of various origins. Among them the Amazi? including the Turq, various Arabized Amazi? groups such as the Hassaniya-speaking Sahrawis, whose populations include the Znaga, a tribe whose name is a remnant of the pre-historic Zenaga language. Other major groups of people include the: Toubou, Nubians, Zaghawa, Kanuri, Hausa, Songhai, Beja, and Fula/Fulani (French: Peul; Fula: Ful?e).\\r\\nArabic dialects are the most widely spoken languages in the Sahara. Arabic, Berber and its variants now regrouped under the term Amazigh (which includes the Guanche language spoken by the original Berber inhabitants of the Canary Islands) and Beja languages are part of the Afro-Asiatic or Hamito-Semitic family.[citation needed] Unlike neighboring West Africa and the central governments of the states that comprise the Sahara, the French language bears little relevance to inter-personal discourse and commerce within the region, its people retaining staunch ethnic and political affiliations with Tuareg and Berber leaders and culture.[66] The legacy of the French colonial era administration is primarily manifested in the territorial reorganization enacted by the Third and Fourth republics, which engendered artificial political divisions within a hitherto isolated and porous region.[67] Diplomacy with local clients was conducted primarily in Arabic, which was the traditional language of bureaucratic affairs. Mediation of disputes and inter-agency communication was served by interpreters contracted by the French government, who, according to Keenan, \\"documented a space of intercultural mediation,\\" contributing much to preserving the indigenous cultural identities in the region.[68]\\r\\nCoordinates: 23N 13E? / ?23N 13E? / 23; 13","input":"What does the word sahara mean in arabic?"},{"output":"Dogue de Bordeaux","context":"The Dogue de Bordeaux, Bordeaux Mastiff, French Mastiff or Bordeauxdog is a large French Mastiff breedand one of the most ancient French dog breeds. A typical brachycephalic molossoid type breed, the Bordeaux is a very powerful dog, with a very muscular body. This brawny breed has been put to work in many different capacities, from pulling carts and hauling heavy objects, to guarding flocks and, historically, the castles of the European elite.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Dogue de Bordeaux was known in France as early as the fourteenth century, particularly in southern France in the region around Bordeaux. Hence, the city lent its name to this large dog. A uniform breed type of the Bordeaux Dog did not exist before about 1920.[1]\\r\\nThe French placed emphasis on keeping the old breeding line pure. Black masks were considered an indication of the crossing in of the English Mastiff. As an important indication of purity of the breed, attention was paid to the self colored (pink) nose, lighter eye color (dark amber), and red mask. They were originally bred with huge heads; a pioneer for the breed in Germany, Werner Preugschat once wrote:\\r\\nWhat am I supposed to do with a dog that has a monstrous skull and is at most able to carry it from the food dish to its bed?\\r\\nThe Dogue de Bordeaux was at one time known to come in two varieties, Dogues and Doguins, the Dogue being considerably larger than the Doguin. The smaller Doguin has withered away to nothing more than a mention in breed history books, as it is no longer in existence.\\r\\nThe history of the breed is believed to predate the Bullmastiff and the Bulldog. It is said that the Dogue can be found in the background of the Bullmastiff, and others claim that the Dogue and Mastiff breeds were both being accomplished at the same time. Another theory is the Dogue de Bordeaux originates from the Tibetan Mastiff and it is also said that the Dogue is related to the Greco Roman molossoids used for war.[citation needed]\\r\\nAs there was a breed similar to the Dogue de Bordeaux in Rome at the time of Julius Caesar's reign, possibly a cousin of the Neapolitan Mastiff. Others suggest that the Dogue de Bordeaux is a descendent of a breed which existed in ancient France, the Dogues de Bordeaux of Aquitaine. Whichever theory is true, it is obvious that the Dogue de Bordeaux shares the same common links as all modern molossers.\\r\\nThe Dogue de Bordeaux was once classified into three varieties, the Parisian, the Toulouse and the Bordeaux, types which were bred depending on the region of France and the jobs it was required to do. The ancestral Dogue de Bordeaux had various coat colors, such as brindle and a majority of white markings that carried fully up the legs. It had scissor bites in some regions, undershot in others; a big head or a small head, a large body or a small body; very inconsistent in type. Another controversial aspect was the mask, red (brown), none or black. The Dogue de Bordeaux of Bordeaux of the time also sported cropped ears. Regardless, it had a general type similar to today's Dogue de Bordeaux.\\r\\nIn 1863, the first canine exhibition was held at the \\"Jardin d'Acclimatation\\" in Paris, France. The winner of the Dogue de Bordeaux was a female named Magentas. The Dogue de Bordeaux was then given the name of the capital of its region of origin, today's Dogue de Bordeaux.\\r\\nDuring the 1960s, a group of breeders of the Dogue de Bordeaux in France, headed by Raymond Triquet, worked on the rebuilding of the foundation of the breed. In 1970, a new standard was written for the breed, with the most recent update in 1995. This standard is the basis of the standard written for the AKC in 2005.\\r\\nAlthough the Dogue de Bordeaux first arrived in the USA in the 1890s for the show ring, the first documented Dogues de Bordeaux of modern times appeared in 1959[clarification needed], Fidelle de Fenelon; and in 1968, Rugby de la Maison des Arbres. Between 1969 and 1980, imported Dogues de Bordeaux in the USA were scarce, limited to a few breeders who worked closely with the French Dogue de Bordeaux Club, the SADB. The breed was first \\"officially\\" introduced to American purebred enthusiasts in an article written in 1982 and by the American anthropologist, Dr. Carl Semencic for \\"Dog World\\" magazine. That article, entitled \\"Introducing the Dogue de Bordeaux\\", was followed by chapters dedicated to the Dogue in Semencic's books on dogs, published by T.F.H. Publications of Neptune, New Jersey. When Semencic's first article on the breed was published, there were no Bordeaux Dogues in the United States. There were 600 examples left in the world, mostly in France, the Netherlands and East Berlin, and the breed's numbers were on the decline. Much later, in 1989, the typical American family saw the Dogue de Bordeaux for the first time on the big screen in Touchstone's movie Turner & Hooch about a policeman and his canine partner, although many people[who?] did not know that the massive slobbering animal was a Dogue de Bordeaux.\\r\\nSince then, the Dogue de Bordeaux has taken hold in the United States and can be found in greatly increasing numbers across the country. The Dogue de Bordeaux has been supported by multiple breed clubs throughout the years, and has finally found its way to full AKC recognition through the assistance of the Dogue de Bordeaux Society of America. Since 1997, the DDBSA has helped bring the breed to the point in which full AKC recognition could be achieved.\\r\\nThe Dogue de Bordeaux has begun to flourish is recent years, with its introduction into more movies and even television, as well as its full recognition status by the American Kennel Club, also known as the AKC (full AKC recognition began July 2008). Its numbers are climbing, but careful attention must be paid to health in the breed if its increase in popularity is to show a positive forward motion.\\r\\nThe breed was first exhibited in France in 1863 after which time it gained in popularity not only in their home country but in other parts of the world. The first record of Dogue de Bordeaux in the UK can be seen in the Kennel Club Gazette in 1897.[2] The breed was officially recognised by the Kennel Club (UK) in 1997[3] but it was not until 2001[4] that the Kennel Club (UK) accepted an interim breed standard.\\r\\nThe Dogue de Bordeaux is a well balanced, muscular and massive dog with a powerful build. The Dogue's size should come mostly from width and muscles, rather than height.[citation needed] The breed is set somewhat low to the ground and is not tall like the English Mastiff. The body of the Dogue de Bordeaux is thick-set, with a top-line that has a slight dip (topline is never completely straight) and a gentle rounded croup. The front legs should be straight and heavy-boned, well up on pasterns, down to tight cat-like feet. The straight tail, beginning thickly at the base and then tapering to a point at the end, should not reach lower than the hocks, and is set and carried low. The breed is to be presented in a completely natural condition with intact ears, tail, and natural dewclaws. It should be evaluated equally for correctness in conformation, temperament, movement, and overall structural soundness.[citation needed]\\r\\nThe breed standards by European FCI and the American Kennel Club specify a minimum weight of 99 pounds (45?kg) for a female and 110 pounds (50?kg) for a male.[5] There is no formally stated maximum weight, but dogs must be balanced with regard to their overall type and the conformation standards of the breed.[citation needed]\\r\\nThe standard states that the desirable height, at maturity, should range between 24 to 27 inches (61 to 69?cm) for male dogs and from 23 to 26 inches (58 to 66?cm) for females.[5] Deviation from these margins is considered a fault.[citation needed]\\r\\nThe massive head is a crucial breed characteristic. The Dogue de Bordeaux is claimed to have the largest head in the canine world, in proportion to the rest of the body. For males, the circumference of the head, measured at the widest point of the skull, is roughly equal to the dog's height at the withers (shoulders). For females, the circumference may be slightly less. When viewed from the front or from above, the head of the Dogue forms a trapezoid shape with the longer top-line of the skull, and the shorter line of the underjaw, forming the parallel sides of the trapezoid. The jaw is undershot and powerful. The Dogue should always have a black or red mask that can be distinguished from the rest of the coat around and under the nose, including the lips and eye rims. The nose colour in red-masked dogs should be brown, in black-masked dogs, it must be black. The muzzle should be at most a third of the total length of the head and no shorter than a quarter of the length of the head, the ideal being between the two extremes. The upper lip hangs thickly down over the lower jaw. The upper lips of the Dogue de Bordeaux hangs over the lower lips. The skin on the neck is loose, forming a noticeable dewlap, but should not resemble that of a Neapolitan Mastiff. Small pendant ears top the head, but should not be long and hound like.[citation needed]\\r\\nThe standard specifies the coat to be 'short, fine, and soft to the touch'. Color varies from shades of fawn (light, coppery red) to mahogany (dark, brownish red) with a black, brown, or red mask, although the red mask is true to the breed. White markings are permitted on the tips of the toes and on the chest, but white on any other part of the body is considered a fault, and a disqualifying one if the pigmentation goes beyond the neck.[citation needed]\\r\\nWhile larger breeds of canines tend to have shorter life expectancy, the life expectancy of the Dogue is still shorter than even breeds of comparable or larger size.[6] According to data collected by the Dogue De Bordeaux Society of America, the average lifespan of the breed is 5 to 6 years.[7] A veterinary database in the UK showed similar figures.[8] In the American survey, the oldest dog in the record was 12 years old.[7] The Society is actively recording dogs that are 7 years old or older to celebrate the longer-lived dogs.[9]\\r\\nBecause of its brachycephalic head, the Dogue can be affected by breathing problems. (see Brachycephalic syndrome) Some may be heat- and exercise-intolerant as a result.[10] The FCI standard considers excessive shortness of breath and raspy breathing in the Dogue a severe fault.[11] The brachycephalic head shape can also encourage ectropionan outward rolling of the lower eyelid which can lead to conjunctivitis (eye inflammation) and bacterial infections.[12] Under the UK Kennel Club's Breed Watch system, the Dogue is classed as a Category 3 breed (formerly High Profile Breed), meaning it is a breed \\"where some dogs have visible conditions or exaggerations that can cause pain or discomfort.\\"[13]\\r\\nAortic stenosis is a disease of the heart valve in which the opening of the aortic valve is narrowed. Symptoms include exercise intolerance, exertional syncope (fainting from physical exertion) and sudden death. One study suggests a high predisposition in the breed. No severe cases were found in adult dogs, and most moderate to severely affected dogs died before one year of age, leading the authors to speculate that the disease is more severe in the Dogue than in other breeds.[14]\\r\\nAnother heart problem in the breed is dilated cardiomyopathy, a condition in which the heart becomes weakened and enlarged and cannot pump blood efficiently. Some affected dogs may die suddenly without showing any signs of problems. Others may die from congestive heart failure after several weeks or months. Affected dogs are often euthanized at an early stage to avoid suffering.[15]\\r\\nAn estimated 5% of dogs may be affected by footpad hyperkeratosis, a thickening of the footpad and sometimes nose.[16][17] X-rays submitted voluntarily to the Orthopedic Foundation for Animals shows that more than 50% of Dogues in the database are affected by hip dysplasia.[18]\\r\\nData from the Norwegian Kennel Club indicates a mean litter size of 8.1 puppies (ranging from 2-17) for the breed.[19] The breed has a high stillborn and early neonatal mortality rate, with a stillborn rate of 14.2% and early neonatal mortality (death within 1 week from birth) of 10.4%. The average across all breeds in the study was 4.3% stillbirth and 3.7% early neonatal mortality. Excluding stillborn and early deaths, the mean litter size is 6.1.[20] UK Kennel Club data shows that 27.8% (5 of 18) of Dogue litters were delivered by caesarean section.[21]","input":"What breed was the turner and hooch dog?"},{"output":"Darwin","context":"Darwin (/?d?rw?n/?(?listen) DAR-win)[7] is the capital city of the Northern Territory of Australia. Situated on the Timor Sea, Darwin is the largest city in the sparsely populated Northern Territory, with a population of 142,300.[1] It is the smallest and most northerly of the Australian capital cities, and acts as the Top End's regional centre.\\r\\nDarwin's proximity to South East Asia makes it a link between Australia and countries such as Indonesia and East Timor. The Stuart Highway begins in Darwin, ending at Port Augusta in South Australia. The city itself is built on a low bluff overlooking the harbour. Its suburbs spread out over some area, beginning at Lee Point in the north and stretching to Berrimah in the east. Past Berrimah, the Stuart Highway goes on to Darwin's satellite city, Palmerston, and its suburbs. The Darwin region, like the rest of the Top End, has a tropical climate, with a wet and a dry season. Prone to cyclone activity during the wet season, Darwin experiences heavy monsoonal downpours and spectacular lightning shows.[8] During the dry season, the city is met with blue skies and gentle sea breezes from the harbour.\\r\\nThe greater Darwin area is the ancestral home of the Larrakia people. On 9 September 1839, HMS?Beagle sailed into Darwin harbour during its surveying of the area. John Clements Wickham named the region \\"Port Darwin\\" in honour of their former shipmate Charles Darwin, who had sailed with them on the ship's previous voyage which had ended in October 1836. The settlement there became the town of Palmerston in 1869, and was renamed Darwin in 1911.[9] The city has been almost entirely rebuilt four times, following devastation caused by the 1897 cyclone, the 1937 cyclone, Japanese air raids during World War II, and Cyclone Tracy in 1974.[10][11]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Aboriginal people of the Larrakia language group are the traditional custodians and the first inhabitants of the greater Darwin area.[12] They had trading routes with Southeast Asia (see Macassan contact with Australia), and imported goods from as far afield as South and Western Australia. Established songlines penetrated throughout the country, allowing stories and histories to be told and retold along the routes. The extent of shared songlines and history of multiple clan groups within this area is still contestable.\\r\\nThe Dutch visited Australia's northern coastline in the 1600s and landed on the Tiwi Islands only to be repelled by the Tiwi peoples.[13] The Dutch created the first European maps of the area. This accounts for the Dutch names in the area, such as Arnhem Land and Groote Eylandt. The first British person to see Darwin harbour appears to have been Lieutenant John Lort Stokes of HMS?Beagle on 9 September 1839. The ship's captain, Commander John Clements Wickham, named the port after Charles Darwin, the British naturalist who had sailed with them both on the earlier second expedition of the Beagle.\\r\\nIn 1863, the Northern Territory was transferred from New South Wales to South Australia. In 1864 South Australia sent B. T. Finniss north as Government Resident to survey and found a capital for its new territory. Finniss chose a site at Escape Cliffs, near the entrance to Adelaide River, about 60?km northeast of the modern city. This attempt was short-lived, however, and the settlement abandoned by 1865.[14] On 5 February 1869, George Goyder, the Surveyor-General of South Australia, established a small settlement of 135 people at Port Darwin between Fort Hill and the escarpment. Goyder named the settlement Palmerston, after the British Prime Minister Lord Palmerston. In 1870, the first poles for the Overland Telegraph were erected in Darwin, connecting Australia to the rest of the world. The discovery of gold by employees of the Australian Overland Telegraph Line digging holes for telegraph poles at Pine Creek in the 1880s spawned a gold rush which further boosted the young colony's development.[a][b][c]\\r\\nIn February 1872 the brigatine Alexandra was the first private vessel to set sail from an English port directly to Darwin many of whom were people coming to recently gold finds.[16]\\r\\nIn early 1875 Darwin's white population had grown to approximately 300 because of the gold rush. On 17 February 1875 the SS?Gothenburg left Darwin en route for Adelaide. The approximately 88 passengers and 34 crew (surviving records vary) included government officials, circuit-court judges, Darwin residents taking their first furlough, and miners. While travelling south along the north Queensland coast, the Gothenburg encountered a cyclone-strength storm and was wrecked on a section of the Great Barrier Reef. Only 22 men survived, while between 98 and 112 people perished. Many passengers who perished were Darwin residents and news of the tragedy severely affected the small community, which reportedly took several years to recover.[17]\\r\\nDarwin became the city's official name in 1911.\\r\\nThe period between 1911 and 1919 was filled with political turmoil, particularly with trade union unrest, which culminated on 17 December 1918. Led by Harold Nelson, some 1000 demonstrators marched to Government House at Liberty Square in Darwin where they burnt an effigy of the Administrator of the Northern Territory John Gilruth and demanded his resignation. The incident became known as the 'Darwin Rebellion'. Their grievances were against the two main Northern Territory employers: Vestey's Meatworks and the federal government. Both Gilruth and the Vestey company left Darwin soon afterwards.\\r\\nAround 10,000 Australian and other Allied troops arrived in Darwin at the outset of World War II, in order to defend Australia's northern coastline. On 19 February 1942 at 0957, 188 Japanese warplanes attacked Darwin in two waves. It was the same fleet that had bombed Pearl Harbor, though a considerably larger number of bombs were dropped on Darwin than on Pearl Harbor. The attack killed at least 243 people and caused immense damage to the town, airfields and aircraft. These were by far the most serious attacks on Australia in time of war, in terms of fatalities and damage. They were the first of many raids on Darwin.\\r\\nDarwin was further developed after the war, with sealed roads constructed connecting the region to Alice Springs in the south and Mount Isa in the south-east, and Manton Dam built in the south to provide the city with water. On Australia Day (26 January) 1959, Darwin was granted city status.[18]\\r\\nOn 25 December 1974, Darwin was struck by Cyclone Tracy, which killed 71 people and destroyed over 70% of the town's buildings, including many old stone buildings such as the Palmerston Town Hall, which could not withstand the lateral forces generated by the strong winds. After the disaster, 30,000 people of a then population of 46,000 were evacuated, in what turned out to be the biggest airlift in Australia's history.[10] The town was subsequently rebuilt with newer materials and techniques during the late 1970s by the Darwin Reconstruction Commission, led by former Brisbane Lord Mayor Clem Jones. A satellite city of Palmerston was built 20?km (12?mi) south of Darwin in the early 1980s.\\r\\nOn 17 September 2003 the AdelaideÿDarwin railway was completed, with the opening of the Alice Springs-Darwin standard gauge line.\\r\\nDarwin lies in the Northern Territory, on the Timor Sea. The city proper occupies a low bluff overlooking Darwin Harbour, flanked by Frances Bay to the east and Cullen Bay to the west. The remainder of the city is flat and low-lying, and coastal areas are home to recreational reserves, extensive beaches, and excellent fishing.\\r\\nDarwin is closer to the capitals of five other countries than to the capital of Australia: Darwin is 3,137 kilometres (1,949?mi) away from Canberra. Dili (East Timor) is 656?km (408?mi), Port Moresby (Papua New Guinea) is 1,818?km (1,130?mi), Jakarta (Indonesia) is 2,700?km (1,678?mi), Bandar Seri Begawan (Brunei) is 2,607?km (1,620?mi), and Ngerulmud (Palau) is 2,247?km (1,396?mi) from Darwin.\\r\\nEven Malaysia and Singapore are only slightly farther away at 3,350?km (2,082?mi), as is Manila (Philippines) at 3,206?km (1,992?mi), and Honiara (Solomon Islands) at 3,198?km (1,987?mi).[19] Ambon, Indonesia, is only 881?km (547?mi) away from Darwin.\\r\\nAlong with its importance as a gateway to Asia, Darwin also acts as an access point for the Kakadu National Park, Arnhem Land, and northerly islands such as Groote Eylandt and the Tiwi Islands. As the largest city in the area, it provides services for these remote settlements.\\r\\nDarwin and its suburbs spread in an approximately triangular shape, with the older south-western suburbsand the city itselfforming one corner, the newer northern suburbs in another, and the eastern suburbs, progressing towards Palmerston, forming the third.\\r\\nThe older part of Darwin is separated from the newer northern suburbs by Darwin International Airport and Royal Australian Air Force Base. Palmerston is a satellite city 20?km (12?mi) south of Darwin that was established in the 1980s and is one of the fastest growing municipalities in Australia.[20] The rural areas of Darwin including Howard Springs, Humpty Doo and Berry Springs are experiencing strong growth.[21]\\r\\nDarwin's central business district is bounded by Daly Street in the north-west, McMinn Street in the north-east, Mitchell Street on the south-west and Bennett Street on the south-east. The CBD has been the focus of a number of major projects, including the billion dollar redevelopment of the Stokes Hill wharf waterfront area including a convention centre with seating for 1500 people and approximately 4,000 square metres (43,000?sq?ft) of exhibition space. The development will also include hotels, residential apartments and public space.[22] The city's main industrial areas are along the Stuart Highway going towards Palmerston, centred on Winnellie. The largest shopping precinct in the area is Casuarina Square.\\r\\nThe most expensive residential areas stand along the coast in suburbs such as Larrakeyah and Brinkin,[23] despite the slight risk these low-lying regions face during cyclones and higher tides.[24] The inner northern suburbs of Millner and Coconut Grove and the eastern suburb of Karama are home to lower-income households, although low-income Territory Housing units are scattered throughout the metropolitan area.[25] The suburb of Lyon was an addition to the Northern Suburbs. Development and construction took place in 2009 and 2010 and became home for a number of affluent Darwin residents and local/recently posted military families above the rank of Sergeant or Flying Officer.\\r\\nDarwin has a tropical savanna climate (K?ppen Aw)[26][27] with distinct wet and dry seasons and the average maximum temperature is remarkably similar all year round. The dry season runs from about May to September, during which nearly every day is sunny, and afternoon humidity averages around 30%.[28]\\r\\nThe driest period of the year, seeing only approximately 5?mm (0.20?in) of monthly rainfall on average, is between May and September. In the coolest months of June and July, the daily minimum temperature may dip as low as 14?C (57?F), but very rarely lower, and a temperature lower than 10?C (50?F) has never been recorded in the city centre. Outer suburbs away from the coast, however, can occasionally record temperatures as low as 5?C (41?F) in the dry season. For an exceedingly lengthy 147?day period during the 2012 dry season, from 5 May to 29 September, Darwin recorded no precipitation whatsoever. Prolonged periods of no precipitation are common in the dry season in Northern Australia (particularly in the Northern Territory and northern regions of Western Australia) although a no-rainfall event of this extent is rare. The 3pm dewpoint average in the wet season is at around 24.0?C (75.2?F).[28]\\r\\nExtreme temperatures at the Darwin Post Office Station have ranged from 40.4?C (104.7?F) on 17 October 1892 to 13.4?C (56.1?F) on 25 June 1891; while extreme temperatures at the Darwin Airport station (which is further from the coast and routinely records cooler temperatures than the post office station which is located in Darwin's CBD) have ranged from 38.9?C (102.0?F) on 18 October 1982 to 10.4?C (50.7?F) on 29 July 1942. The highest minimum temperature on record is 30.7?C (87.3?F) on 18 January 1928 for the post office station and 29.7?C (85.5?F) on both 25 November 1987 and 17 December 2014 for the airport station; while the lowest maximum temperature on record is 18.4?C (65.1?F) on 3 June 1904 for the post office station and 21.1?C (70.0?F) on 14 July 1968 for the airport station.[28][29]\\r\\nThe wet season is associated with tropical cyclones and monsoon rains.[30] The majority of rainfall occurs between December and March (the southern hemisphere summer), when thunderstorms are common and afternoon relative humidity averages over 70 percent during the wettest months.[28] It does not rain every day during the wet season, but most days have plentiful cloud cover; January averages under 6 hours of bright sunshine daily. Darwin's highest Bureau of Meteorology verified daily rainfall total is 367.6 millimetres (14.47?in), which fell when Cyclone Carlos bore down on the Darwin area on 16 February 2011.[31] February 2011 was also Darwin's wettest month ever recorded, with 1,110.2 millimetres (43.71?in) recorded for the month at the airport.[28]\\r\\nThe hottest month is November, just before the onset of the main rain season. The heat index sometimes rises above 45?C (113?F), while the actual temperature is usually below 35?C (95?F), because of humidity levels that most would find uncomfortable. Because of its long dry season, Darwin has the second most daily average sunshine hours (8.4) of any Australian capital with the most sunshine from April to November; only Perth, Western Australia averages more (8.8). The sun passes directly overhead in mid October and mid February.[32]\\r\\nThe average temperature of the sea ranges from 25.8?C (78.4?F) in July to 31.5?C (88.7?F) in December.[33]\\r\\nDarwin occupies one of the most lightning-prone areas in Australia. On 31 January 2002 an early-morning squall line produced over 5,000 cloud-to-ground lightning strikes within a 60-kilometre (37?mi) radius of Darwin alone ÿ about three times the amount of lightning that Perth, Western Australia, experiences on average in an entire year.[8][34]\\r\\nIn 2006, the largest ancestry groups in Darwin were Australian (42,221 or 36.9%), English (29,766 or 26%), Indigenous Australians (10,259 or 9.7%), Irish (9,561 or 8.3%), Scottish (7,815 or 6.8%), Chinese (3,502 or 3%), Greek (2,828 or 2.4%), and Italian (2,367 or 2%)[39]\\r\\nDarwin's population is notable for the highest proportional population of Indigenous Australians of any Australian capital city. In the 2006 census 10,259 (9.7 per cent) of Darwin's population was Aboriginal.[40]\\r\\nDarwin's population changed after the Second World War. Darwin, like many other Australian cities, experienced influxes from Europe, with significant numbers of Italians and Greeks during the 1960s and 1970s. Darwin also started to experience an influx from other European countries, which included the Dutch, Germans, and many others.[41] A significant percentage of Darwin's residents are recent immigrants from South East Asia (Asian Australians were 9.3% of Darwin's population in 2001).\\r\\nDarwin's population comprises people from many ethnic backgrounds. The 2006 Census revealed that the most common places of birth for overseas migrants were the United Kingdom (3.4 per cent), New Zealand (2.1 per cent), the Philippines (1.4 per cent) and East Timor (0.9 per cent). 18.3 percent of the city's population was born overseas, which is less than the Australian average of 22%.[40]\\r\\nDarwin has a youthful population with an average age of 33 years (compared to the national average of around 37 years)[42] assisted to a large extent by the military presence and the fact that many people opt to retire elsewhere.[43]\\r\\nThe most common languages spoken in Darwin after English are Greek, Australian Aboriginal languages, Italian, Indonesian, Vietnamese and Cantonese.[40]\\r\\nChristianity has the most adherents in Darwin, with 56,613 followers accounting for 49.5 per cent of the population of the city.[44] The largest denominations of Christianity are Roman Catholicism (24,538 or 21.5 per cent), Anglicanism (14,028 or 12.3 per cent) and Greek Orthodoxy (2,964 or 2.6 per cent).[45] Buddhists, Muslims, Hindus and Jews account for 3.2 per cent of Darwin's population. There were 26,695 or 23.3 per cent of people professing no religion.\\r\\nDarwin is one of the fastest growing capital cities in Australia, with an annual growth rate of 2.6 per cent since the 2006 census. In recent years, the Palmerston and Litchfield parts of the Darwin statistical division have recorded the highest growth in population of any Northern Territory local government area and by 2016 Litchfield could overtake Palmerston as the second largest municipality in metropolitan Darwin.[46] It is predicted by 2021 that the combined population of both Palmerston and Litchfield would be 101,546 people.[47]\\r\\nThe Darwin City Council (Incorporated under the Northern Territory Local Government Act 1993) governs the City of Darwin which takes in the CBD and the suburbs. The Darwin City Council has governed the City of Darwin since 1957. The Darwin City Council consists of 13 elected members, the Lord Mayor and 12 aldermen.\\r\\nThe City of Darwin electorate is organised into four electoral units or wards. The names of the wards are Chan, Lyons, Richardson, and Waters. The constituents of each ward are directly responsible for electing three aldermen. Constituents of all wards are directly responsible for electing the Lord Mayor of Darwin.[48] The mayor is Kon Vatskalis after council elections in August 2017.[49]\\r\\nThe rest of the Darwin area is divided into 2 local government areasthe Palmerston City Council and the Shire of Coomalie. These areas have elected councils which are responsible for functions delegated to them by the Northern Territory Government, such as planning and garbage collection.\\r\\nThe Legislative Assembly of the Northern Territory convenes in Darwin in the Northern Territory Parliament House. Government House, the official residence of the Administrator of the Northern Territory, is located on The Esplanade.\\r\\nAlso located on the Esplanade is the Supreme Court of the Northern Territory. Darwin has a Magistrate's Court also which is located on the corner of Cavenagh and Bennett Streets quite close to the Darwin City Council Chambers. Darwin's police force are members of the Northern Territory Police Force. Darwin's Mitchell Street, with its numerous pubs, clubs and other entertainment venues, is policed by the CitySafe Unit. The CitySafe unit was recently credited with reducing violent crime in and around Darwin City.[50] Darwin has a long record of alcohol abuse and violent crime with 6,000 assaults in 2009,[51] of which 350 resulted in broken jaws and noses ÿ more than anywhere else in the world, according to the Royal Darwin Hospital.[51]\\r\\nDarwin is split between nine electoral divisions in the Legislative AssemblyPort Darwin, Fannie Bay, Fong Lim, Nightcliff, Sanderson, Johnston, Casuarina, Wanguri, and Karama. Historically, Darwin was a stronghold for the Country Liberal Party. However, since the turn of the century, Labor has been much more competitive, particularly in the more diverse northern section.\\r\\nThe two largest economic sectors are mining and tourism. Mining and energy industry production exceeds $2.5?billion per annum.[52] The most important mineral resources are gold, zinc and bauxite, along with manganese and many others. The energy production is mostly off shore with oil and natural gas from the Timor Sea, although there are significant uranium deposits near Darwin. Tourism employs 8% of Darwin residents, and is expected to grow as domestic and international tourists are now spending time in Darwin during the Wet and Dry seasons. Federal spending is a major contributor to the local economy as well.\\r\\nThe military presence that is maintained both within Darwin, and the wider Northern Territory, is a substantial source of employment.\\r\\nDarwin's importance as a port is expected to grow, due to the increased exploitation of petroleum in the nearby Timor Sea, and to the completion of the railway link and continued expansion in trade with Asia. During 2005, a number of major construction projects started in Darwin. One is the redevelopment of the Wharf Precinct, which includes a large convention and exhibition centre, apartment housing including Outrigger Pandanas and Evolution on Gardiner, retail and entertainment outlets including a large wave pool and safe swimming lagoon. The Chinatown project has also started with plans to construct multi-level carparks and Chinese-themed retail and dining outlets.[53]\\r\\nEducation is overseen territory-wide by the Department of Education and Training (DET), whose role is to continually improve education outcomes for all students, with a focus on Indigenous students.[54]\\r\\nDarwin is served by a number of public and private schools that cater to local and overseas students. Over 16,500 primary and secondary students are enrolled in schools in Darwin, with 10,524 students attending primary education, and 5,932 students attending secondary education.[55] There are over 12,089 students enrolled in government schools and 2,124 students enrolled in independent schools.[55]\\r\\nThere were 9,764 students attending schools in the City of Darwin area. 6,045 students attended primary schools and 3,719 students attended secondary schools.

Most schools in the city are secular, but there are a small number of Christian, Catholic and Lutheran institutions. Students intending to complete their secondary education can work towards either the Northern Territory Certificate of Education or the International Baccalaureate (only offered at Kormilda College). Schools have been restructured into Primary, Middle and High schools since the beginning of 2007.\\r\\nDarwin's largest University is the Charles Darwin University, which is the central provider of tertiary education in the Northern Territory. It covers both vocational and academic courses, acting as both a university and an Institute of TAFE.

The official name of the race was the MacRobertson Air Race. Winners of the great race were Tom Campbell Black and C. W. A. Scott.\\r\\nThe following is an excerpt from Time magazine, 29 October 1934, Volume XXIV, Number 18.\\r\\nThird Day. Biggest sensation of the race came just before dawn on the third day, when burly Lieutenant Scott and dapper Captain Black flew their scarlet Comet into Darwin. They had covered the last 300 miles over water on one motor, risked death landing on a field made soggy by the first rain in seven months.

The country is the largest producer of corn in the world, with 96,000,000 acres (39,000,000?ha) of land reserved for corn production. Corn growth is dominated by west/north central Iowa and east central Illinois. Approximately 13% of its annual yield is exported.[1]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCorn spread across North America a few thousand years ago.[2] The original corn plant known as teosinte is still grown in Mexico and its size (ears of corn) has substantially increased due to efforts of Native Americans and scientific research. It is now the third leading grain crop in the world.[3]\\r\\nBy the time scientific assessment of conduciveness to grow corn in the United States was undertaken by Meriwether Lewis in 1804, the immigrant settlers had already spread its growth in many parts of the country due to its suitability to grow in varying climatic and soil conditions. Once the suitability of land in the central part of the country, the Midwestern United States, was scientifically established as fertile and rich by Lewis and Clark, the settlers moved to the area in large numbers and started growing corn in a big way, reaping large benefits. Over the centuries, the crop varieties underwent changes to get better yields while farming methods were improved. As a result, the fertile belt soon came to be known as \\"the Corn Belt\\". Hybrid cropping techniques were widely practiced from the late 1880s, and the hybrid varieties developed with cross and re-cross breeding techniques developed by university research. This ushered a new age of agriculture. The 1% area devoted to hybrid varieties in 1934 rose to 78% in the 1940s and continued to rise thereafter. In the 1950s, Henry A. Wallace, former Vice President and former Secretary of Agriculture, and an early developer of hybrid seeds, observed that \\"the Corn Belt had developed into the most productive agricultural civilization the world has ever seen.\\" This trend has continued and now the corn production level in American farms is a significant 20% higher per acre than in the rest of the world.[4]\\r\\nAs the growth of corn has spread to extensive production in 14 states (though it is grown to a lesser extent in all the other US states), a coalition of farmers associations in all these states has been established. This association is known as the Corn Farmers Coalition, which is a union of the National Corn Growers Association and 14 state corn associations (including Iowa Corn).[5]\\r\\nThe total production of corn in the US for the year 2013-14 is reported to be 13.016 billion bushels of which the major use is for manufacture of ethanol and its co-product (Distillers' Dried Grains with Solubles) accounting for 37% (27% + 10%) or 4,845 million bushels (3,552 + 1,293). The other uses are given in the table.[6]\\r\\ncereals.\\r\\nThe final estimate of corn production for the years 1950 to 1959 in the United States is given as some three billion bushels and in recent years, some nine billion bushels are produced each year.[2] Corn growth is dominated by west north central Iowa and east central Illinois.[7] In 2011, the national average production was 147 bushels per acre, and reported to be 20 bushels per acre more than the yield in 2002. Based on a national contest in 2011 when an average of 300 bushels per acre was achieved others are sure to follow suit which result in a yield of 300 bushels per acre by 2030 from the same extent land holdings under corn.[4][6]\\r\\nTwo types of ethanol are produced from corn and other plants such as sugar cane. The residual product (DDGS) is about 33% of the input stream and is used as livestock feed. Ethanol is blended with gasoline to produce E10 and E85 fuels for automobile vehicles. Its manufacture has created 400,000 jobs in the US and its environmental friendliness is recorded in the form of reduced gas emissions of 25.3 million metric tons.[citation needed] One bushel of corn can produce 2.8 gallons of ethanol, 17.5?lbs of livestock feed and 18?lbs of carbon dioxide.[8]\\r\\nIt is also reported that every acre of corn ultimately results in reducing 8 tonnes (7.9 long tons; 8.8 short tons) of greenhouse gas emission.[citation needed] On account of great demand for ethanol corn is fetching higher prices. This has resulted in farmers increasing acreage under corn by adopting crop rotations between corn and soybeans; the latter crop's production has thus declined. Further more acreage under corn has also been allowed to be increased under the Federal Agriculture Improvement and Reform Act of 1996 overriding the act of 1983, which had been fixed at 60,200,000 hectares (149,000,000 acres).[9]\\r\\nThere are 80,000,000 acres (32,000,000?ha) of land dedicated exclusively to corn cultivation in the United States. The United States is the world's leading producer of corn,[10] having produced 333,010,910 tonnes (327,751,510 long tons; 367,081,690 short tons) of the crop in the year 2009.[11]\\r\\nOut of 316,000 corn farms about 300,000 farms (95% of them) are owned by families. More than 30% of corn farms are operated by women.[12][13]\\r\\nHighest yield of over 12 billion bushels have been recorded up to 2011 with 12.4 billion bushels reported in 2011 with yields of more than 140 bushels per acre. A milestone in production in the US is that the farmers take out 20% more corn per acre than in any other part of the world.[14] Farming practice is based on irrigation only in about 11% area while the balance area is under un-irrigated conditions. The farm practices have also resulted in implementing conservation measures which have reduced soil erosion to the extent of 44%.\\r\\nSee also US Agricultural subsidies\\r\\nCorn in the United states has been subsidized since the 1930s, when a drop in demand from post-war Europe caused a food glut and prices crashed. In the 1980s, subsidies increased substantially.[15]\\r\\nUS subsidies for corn have averaged 4.7 billion dollars per year over the twenty years from 1995-2014 inclusive.[16] 2014 projections were that the US would spend $97.29 billion/year on farm and food programs over the next decade.[17]\\r\\nIn 2014, the \\"direct payments\\" portion of subsidies was abolished, and subsidies were mostly replaced with two programs. Farmers may pick Price Loss Coverage (a guarantee that the farmer will get a certain price for their crop) and Agricultural Risk Coverage (which guarantees a certain amount of revenue).[16][15]\\r\\nThe subsidies have been criticized for:\\r\\nUS$267 is spent by the average American annually on purchasing corn.[19] In 2015, one bushel of corn costs $3.50.[20] The value of individual corn farms varies from location to location, depending on the amount of bushels produced and the quality of corn.[21] Other factors such as the weather or economic crises may cause corn prices to fluctuate or to rise.[22][23][24] The value of corn is increasing, due to the country's greater demand and reliance for corn.[24]\\r\\nIowa, the largest producer of corn in the US, grows three times as much corn as Mexico. Iowa harvested 3,548 acres (1,436?ha) of sweet corn in 2007. In 2011, the state had 92,300 corn farms on 30,700,000 acres (12,400,000?ha), the average size being 333 acres (135?ha), and the average dollar value per acre being US$6,708. In the same year, there were 13.7 million harvested acres of corn for grain, producing 2.36 billion bushels, which yielded 172.0 bu/acre, with US$14.5 billion of corn value of production.[25] Almost 1.88 billion bushels of corn were grown in the state in 2012 on 13.7 million acres of land, while the 2013 projections are 2.45 billion bushels of corn on 13.97 million acres of land.[26]\\r\\nNebraska is known as the \\"Cornhusker State\\" ÿ and is the third largest corn-producing state in the United States.[27]\\r\\nCorn is Minnesota's largest crop. In 1922-31, production averaged 30.4 bushels per acre; in 1947-56, it average 46.6 bushels per acre; in 1973, it averaged 91.4 bushels per acre; and in 1994, the average was 142 bushels per acre. In 1935-46, a shift to hybrid varieties occurred.[28] In 2010, the state produced 1.29 billion bushels.[29] In 2012, Minnesota's farmers produced the largest corn crop in the state's history, at 1.37 billion bushels harvested, equaling 165 bushels per acre, on 250,000 acres.[30]\\r\\nThe first corn varieties grown in Illinois were those obtained from local Indians or varieties brought to Illinois from the New England states. After the Civil War, varieties were developed which were adapted to the state's soils and climate, such as Reid's Yellow Dent. During the period of 1900-05, there were 10,500,000 acres planted, with a decline to 8,862,000 acres in 1925-30.[31] In 2012, Illinois sowed 12.8 million acres of corn in 2012, ranking fourth in corn production, behind Iowa, Minnesota, and Nebraska. The state averaged 105 bushels per acre in 2012, down from 157-bushel per acre in 2010 and 2011.[32]\\r\\nAlthough the state of Alaska has a cold temperate, some Alaskan farmers still manage to grow corn, through means such as greenhouse farming. Corn is popular among Alaskans.[33]\\r\\nCorn is a popular crop in the state of Indiana; it is mostly grown as animal feed.[34] Indiana is located in the United States' Corn Belt.[35]\\r\\nThe state of Texas is a great producer of corn; the final estimate of corn produced in 2010 was some 301 million bushels on 2,300,000 acres (930,000?ha) of land, totaling to $1.2 billion of crop.[36]\\r\\nCorn was introduced to Alabama in around the eighteenth century; there have been traces of corn found in Nuyuka's Upper Creek village which dates back to the period.[37]","input":"Where is most of the world's corn grown?"},{"output":"Directly underneath the State Apartments","context":"Coordinates: 51303N 0831W? / ?51.50083N 0.14194W? / 51.50083; -0.14194\\r\\nBuckingham Palace (UK: /?b?k???m ?p?l?s/[1][2]) is the London residence and administrative headquarters of the reigning monarch of the United Kingdom.[3][4] Located in the City of Westminster, the palace is often at the centre of state occasions and royal hospitality. It has been a focal point for the British people at times of national rejoicing and mourning.\\r\\nOriginally known as Buckingham House, the building at the core of today's palace was a large townhouse built for the Duke of Buckingham in 1703 on a site that had been in private ownership for at least 150 years. It was acquired by King George?III in 1761[5] as a private residence for Queen Charlotte and became known as The Queen's House. During the 19th?century it was enlarged, principally by architects John Nash and Edward Blore, who constructed three wings around a central courtyard. Buckingham Palace became the London residence of the British monarch on the accession of Queen Victoria in 1837.\\r\\nThe last major structural additions were made in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, including the East front, which contains the well-known balcony on which the royal family traditionally congregates to greet crowds. The palace chapel was destroyed by a German bomb during World War?II; the Queen's Gallery was built on the site and opened to the public in 1962 to exhibit works of art from the Royal Collection.\\r\\nThe original early 19th-century interior designs, many of which survive, include widespread use of brightly coloured scagliola and blue and pink lapis, on the advice of Sir?Charles Long. King Edward?VII oversaw a partial redecoration in a Belle poque cream and gold colour scheme. Many smaller reception rooms are furnished in the Chinese regency style with furniture and fittings brought from the Royal Pavilion at Brighton and from Carlton House. The palace has 775 rooms, and the garden is the largest private garden in London. The state rooms, used for official and state entertaining, are open to the public each year for most of August and September and on some days in winter and spring.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the Middle Ages, the site of the future palace formed part of the Manor of Ebury (also called Eia). The marshy ground was watered by the river Tyburn, which still flows below the courtyard and south wing of the palace.[6] Where the river was fordable (at Cow Ford), the village of Eye Cross grew. Ownership of the site changed hands many times; owners included Edward the Confessor and his queen consort Edith of Wessex in late Saxon times, and, after the Norman Conquest, William the Conqueror. William gave the site to Geoffrey de Mandeville, who bequeathed it to the monks of Westminster Abbey.[7]\\r\\nIn 1531, King Henry?VIII acquired the Hospital of St?James (later St?James's Palace)[8] from Eton College, and in 1536 he took the Manor of Ebury from Westminster Abbey.[9] These transfers brought the site of Buckingham Palace back into royal hands for the first time since William the Conqueror had given it away almost 500 years earlier.[10]\\r\\nVarious owners leased it from royal landlords and the freehold was the subject of frenzied speculation during the 17th?century. By then, the old village of Eye Cross had long since fallen into decay, and the area was mostly wasteland.[11] Needing money, James?I sold off part of the Crown freehold but retained part of the site on which he established a 4-acre (16,000?m2) mulberry garden for the production of silk. (This is at the northwest corner of today's palace.)[12] Clement Walker in Anarchia Anglicana (1649) refers to \\"new-erected sodoms and spintries at the Mulberry Garden at S. James's\\"; this suggests it may have been a place of debauchery. Eventually, in the late 17th?century, the freehold was inherited from the property tycoon Sir?Hugh Audley by the great heiress Mary Davies.[13]\\r\\nPossibly the first house erected within the site was that of a Sir?William Blake, around 1624.[14] The next owner was Lord Goring, who from 1633 extended Blake's house and developed much of today's garden, then known as Goring Great Garden.[15][16] He did not, however, obtain the freehold interest in the mulberry garden. Unbeknown to Goring, in 1640 the document \\"failed to pass the Great Seal before King Charles?I fled London, which it needed to do for legal execution\\".[17] It was this critical omission that helped the British royal family regain the freehold under King George?III.[18]\\r\\nThe improvident Goring defaulted on his rents;[19] Henry Bennet, 1st Earl of Arlington obtained the mansion and was occupying it, now known as Goring House, when it burned down in 1674.[16] Arlington House rose on the sitethe location of the southern wing of today's palacethe next year.[16] In 1698, John Sheffield, later the first Duke of Buckingham and Normanby, acquired the lease.[20]\\r\\nThe house which forms the architectural core of the palace was built for the first Duke of Buckingham and Normanby in 1703 to the design of William Winde. The style chosen was of a large, three-floored central block with two smaller flanking service wings.[21] Buckingham House was eventually sold by Buckingham's natural son, Sir Charles Sheffield, in 1761[5] to George?III for S21,000.[22] Sheffield's leasehold on the mulberry garden site, the freehold of which was still owned by the royal family, was due to expire in 1774.[23]\\r\\n Under the new crown ownership, the building was originally intended as a private retreat for King George?III's wife, Queen Charlotte, and was accordingly known as The Queen's House. Remodelling of the structure began in 1762.[24] In 1775, an Act of Parliament settled the property on Queen Charlotte, in exchange for her rights to Somerset House,[25] and 14 of their 15 children were born there. Some furnishings were transferred from Carlton House, and others had been bought in France after the French Revolution[26] of 1789. While St?James's Palace remained the official and ceremonial royal residence,[25] the name \\"Buckingham-palace\\" began from at least 1791.[27]\\r\\nAfter his accession to the throne in 1820, King George?IV continued the renovation with the idea in mind of a small, comfortable home. While the work was in progress, in 1826, the King decided to modify the house into a palace with the help of his architect John Nash.[28] The external fa?ade was designed keeping in mind the French neo-classical influence preferred by George?IV. The cost of the renovations grew dramatically, and by 1829 the extravagance of Nash's designs resulted in his removal as architect. On the death of George?IV in 1830, his younger brother King William?IV hired Edward Blore to finish the work.[29][30] After the destruction of the Palace of Westminster by fire in 1834, William considered converting the palace into the new Houses of Parliament.[31]\\r\\nBuckingham Palace finally became the principal royal residence in 1837, on the accession of Queen Victoria,[32] who was the first monarch to reside there; her predecessor William?IV had died before its completion.[33] While the state rooms were a riot of gilt and colour, the necessities of the new palace were somewhat less luxurious. For one thing, it was reported the chimneys smoked so much that the fires had to be allowed to die down, and consequently the court shivered in icy magnificence.[34] Ventilation was so bad that the interior smelled, and when it was decided to install gas lamps, there was a serious worry about the build-up of gas on the lower floors. It was also said that staff were lax and lazy and the palace was dirty.[34] Following the Queen's marriage in 1840, her husband, Prince Albert, concerned himself with a reorganisation of the household offices and staff, and with the design faults of the palace.[35] The problems were all rectified by the close of 1840. However, the builders were to return within the decade.\\r\\nBy 1847, the couple had found the palace too small for court life and their growing family,[36] and consequently the new wing, designed by Edward Blore, was built by Thomas Cubitt,[37] enclosing the central quadrangle. The large East Front, facing The Mall, is today the \\"public face\\" of Buckingham Palace, and contains the balcony from which the royal family acknowledge the crowds on momentous occasions and after the annual Trooping the Colour.[38] The ballroom wing and a further suite of state rooms were also built in this period, designed by Nash's student Sir?James Pennethorne.[39]\\r\\nBefore Prince Albert's death, the palace was frequently the scene of musical entertainments,[40] and the greatest contemporary musicians entertained at Buckingham Palace. The composer Felix Mendelssohn is known to have played there on three occasions.[41] Johann Strauss?II and his orchestra played there when in England.[42] Strauss's \\"Alice Polka\\" was first performed at the palace in 1849 in honour of the queen's daughter, Princess Alice.[43] Under Victoria, Buckingham Palace was frequently the scene of lavish costume balls, in addition to the usual royal ceremonies, investitures and presentations.[44]\\r\\nWidowed in 1861, the grief-stricken Queen withdrew from public life and left Buckingham Palace to live at Windsor Castle, Balmoral Castle and Osborne House. For many years the palace was seldom used, even neglected. In 1864, a note was found pinned to the fence of Buckingham Palace, saying: \\"These commanding premises to be let or sold, in consequence of the late occupant's declining business.\\"[45] Eventually, public opinion persuaded the Queen to return to London, though even then she preferred to live elsewhere whenever possible. Court functions were still held at Windsor Castle, presided over by the sombre Queen habitually dressed in mourning black, while Buckingham Palace remained shuttered for most of the year.[46]\\r\\nThe palace measures 108 metres (354?ft) by 120 metres (390?ft), is 24 metres (79?ft) high and contains over 77,000?m2 (830,000?sq?ft) of floorspace.[47] The floor area is smaller than the Royal Palace of Madrid, the Papal Palace and Quirinal Palace in Rome, the Louvre in Paris, the Hofburg Palace in Vienna, and the Forbidden City.[48] There are 775 rooms, including 19 state rooms, 52 principal bedrooms, 188 staff bedrooms, 92 offices, and 78 bathrooms. The palace also has its own post office, cinema, swimming pool, doctor's surgery, and jeweller's workshop.[47][49]\\r\\nThe principal rooms are contained on the piano nobile behind the west-facing garden fa?ade at the rear of the palace. The centre of this ornate suite of state rooms is the Music Room, its large bow the dominant feature of the fa?ade. Flanking the Music Room are the Blue and the White Drawing Rooms. At the centre of the suite, serving as a corridor to link the state rooms, is the Picture Gallery, which is top-lit and 55 yards (50?m) long.[50] The Gallery is hung with numerous works including some by Rembrandt, van Dyck, Rubens and Vermeer;[51][52] other rooms leading from the Picture Gallery are the Throne Room and the Green Drawing Room. The Green Drawing Room serves as a huge anteroom to the Throne Room, and is part of the ceremonial route to the throne from the Guard Room at the top of the Grand Staircase.[50] The Guard Room contains white marble statues of Queen Victoria and Prince Albert, in Roman costume, set in a tribune lined with tapestries. These very formal rooms are used only for ceremonial and official entertaining, but are open to the public every summer.[53]\\r\\nDirectly underneath the State Apartments is a suite of slightly less grand rooms known as the semi-state apartments. Opening from the Marble Hall, these rooms are used for less formal entertaining, such as luncheon parties and private audiences. Some of the rooms are named and decorated for particular visitors, such as the 1844 Room, decorated in that year for the State visit of Tsar Nicholas?I of Russia, and, on the other side of the Bow Room, the 1855 Room, in honour of the visit of Emperor Napoleon?III of France.[56] At the centre of this suite is the Bow Room, through which thousands of guests pass annually to the Queen's Garden Parties in the Gardens.[57] The Queen and Prince Philip use a smaller suite of rooms in the north wing.[58]\\r\\nBetween 1847 and 1850, when Blore was building the new east wing, the Brighton Pavilion was once again plundered of its fittings. As a result, many of the rooms in the new wing have a distinctly oriental atmosphere. The red and blue Chinese Luncheon Room is made up from parts of the Brighton Banqueting and Music Rooms with a large oriental chimney piece sculpted by Richard Westmacott.[54] The Yellow Drawing Room has wallpaper supplied in 1817 for the Brighton Saloon, and a chimney piece which is a European vision of how the Chinese chimney piece may appear. It has nodding mandarins in niches and fearsome winged dragons, designed by Robert Jones.[59]\\r\\nAt the centre of this wing is the famous balcony with the Centre Room behind its glass doors. This is a Chinese-style saloon enhanced by Queen Mary, who, working with the designer Sir?Charles Allom, created a more \\"binding\\"[60] Chinese theme in the late 1920s, although the lacquer doors were brought from Brighton in 1873. Running the length of the piano nobile of the east wing is the great gallery, modestly known as the Principal Corridor, which runs the length of the eastern side of the quadrangle.[61] It has mirrored doors, and mirrored cross walls reflecting porcelain pagodas and other oriental furniture from Brighton. The Chinese Luncheon Room and Yellow Drawing Room are situated at each end of this gallery, with the Centre Room obviously placed in the centre.[62]\\r\\nThe original early 19th-century interior designs, many of which still survive, included widespread use of brightly coloured scagliola and blue and pink lapis, on the advice of Sir?Charles Long. King Edward?VII oversaw a partial redecoration in a Belle poque cream and gold colour scheme.[63]\\r\\nWhen paying a state visit to Britain, foreign heads of state are usually entertained by the Queen at Buckingham Palace. They are allocated a large suite of rooms known as the Belgian Suite, situated at the foot of the Minister's Staircase, on the ground floor of the north-facing Garden Wing. The rooms of the suite are linked by narrow corridors, one of them is given extra height and perspective by saucer domes designed by Nash in the style of Soane.[64] A second corridor in the suite has Gothic-influenced cross-over vaulting.[64] The Belgian Rooms themselves were decorated in their present style and named after Prince Albert's uncle Lopold?I, first King of the Belgians. In 1936, the suite briefly became the private apartments of the palace when they were occupied by King Edward?VIII.[47]\\r\\nInvestitures, which include the conferring of knighthoods by dubbing with a sword, and other awards take place in the palace's Ballroom, built in 1854. At 36.6?m (120?ft) long, 18?m (59?ft) wide and 13.5?m (44?ft) high,[47] it is the largest room in the palace. It has replaced the throne room in importance and use. During investitures, the Queen stands on the throne dais beneath a giant, domed velvet canopy, known as a shamiana or a baldachin, that was used at the Delhi Durbar in 1911.[65] A military band plays in the musicians' gallery as award recipients approach the Queen and receive their honours, watched by their families and friends.[66]\\r\\nState banquets also take place in the Ballroom; these formal dinners are held on the first evening of a state visit by a foreign head of state.[66] On these occasions, for up to 170 guests in formal \\"white tie and decorations\\", including tiaras, the dining table is laid with the Grand Service, a collection of silver-gilt plate made in 1811 for the Prince of Wales, later George?IV.[67] The largest and most formal reception at Buckingham Palace takes place every November when the Queen entertains members of the diplomatic corps.[68] On this grand occasion, all the state rooms are in use, as the royal family proceed through them,[69] beginning at the great north doors of the Picture Gallery. As Nash had envisaged, all the large, double-mirrored doors stand open, reflecting the numerous crystal chandeliers and sconces, creating a deliberate optical illusion of space and light.[70]\\r\\nSmaller ceremonies such as the reception of new ambassadors take place in the \\"1844 Room\\". Here too, the Queen holds small lunch parties, and often meetings of the Privy Council. Larger lunch parties often take place in the curved and domed Music Room, or the State Dining Room.[71] Since the bombing of the palace chapel in World War?II, royal christenings have sometimes taken place in the Music Room. The Queen's first three children were all baptised there.[72] On all formal occasions, the ceremonies are attended by the Yeomen of the Guard in their historic uniforms, and other officers of the court such as the Lord Chamberlain.[73]\\r\\nFormerly, men not wearing military uniform wore knee breeches of an 18th-century design. Women's evening dress included trains and tiaras or feathers in their hair (or both). The dress code governing formal court uniform and dress has progressively relaxed. After World War?I, when Queen Mary wished to follow fashion by raising her skirts a few inches from the ground, she requested a lady-in-waiting to shorten her own skirt first to gauge the king's reaction. King George?V was horrified, so the queen kept her hemline unfashionably low.[74] Following their accession in 1936, King George?VI and his consort, Queen Elizabeth, allowed the hemline of daytime skirts to rise. Today, there is no official dress code.[47] Most men invited to Buckingham Palace in the daytime choose to wear service uniform or lounge suits;[47] a minority wear morning coats, and in the evening, depending on the formality of the occasion, black tie or white tie.[75]\\r\\nDbutantes were aristocratic young ladies making their first entre into society through presentation to the monarch at court. These occasions, known as \\"coming out\\", took place at the palace from the reign of Edward?VII. Wearing full court dress, with three ostrich feathers in their hair, dbutantes entered, curtsied, and performed a backwards walk and a further curtsey, while manoeuvring a dress train of prescribed length. The ceremony, known as an evening court, corresponded to the \\"court drawing rooms\\" of Victoria's reign.[76] After World War?II, the ceremony was replaced by less formal afternoon receptions, usually omitting curtsies and court dress.[77] In 1958, the Queen abolished the presentation parties for dbutantes,[78] replacing them with Garden Parties,[79] for up to 8,000 invitees in the Garden. They are the largest functions of the year.[80]\\r\\nThe boy Jones was an intruder who gained entry to the palace on three occasions between 1838 and 1841.[81][82] At least 12 people have managed to gain unauthorised entry into the palace or its grounds since 1914,[83] including Michael Fagan, who broke into the palace twice in 1982 and entered the Queen's bedroom on the second occasion. At the time, news media reported that he had a long conversation with the Queen while she waited for security officers to arrive, but in a 2012 interview with The Independent, Fagan said the Queen ran out of the room and no conversation took place.[84] It was only in 2007 that trespassing on the palace grounds became a criminal offence.[85][88]\\r\\nAt the rear of the palace is the large and park-like garden, which together with its lake is the largest private garden in London.[89] There, the Queen hosts her annual garden parties each summer, and also holds large functions to celebrate royal milestones, such as jubilees. It covers 40 acres (16?ha), and includes a helicopter landing area, a lake, and a tennis court.[47]\\r\\nAdjacent to the palace is the Royal Mews, also designed by Nash, where the royal carriages, including the Gold State Coach, are housed. This rococo gilt coach, designed by Sir?William Chambers in 1760, has painted panels by G. B. Cipriani. It was first used for the State Opening of Parliament by George?III in 1762 and has been used by the monarch for every coronation since George?IV. It was last used for the Golden Jubilee of Elizabeth?II.[90] Also housed in the mews are the coach horses used at royal ceremonial processions.[91]\\r\\nThe Mall, a ceremonial approach route to the palace, was designed by Sir?Aston Webb and completed in 1911 as part of a grand memorial to Queen Victoria. It extends from Admiralty Arch, across St?James's Park to the Victoria Memorial. This route is used by the cavalcades and motorcades of visiting heads of state, and by the royal family on state occasions such as the annual Trooping the Colour.[92]\\r\\nIn 1901 the accession of Edward?VII saw new life breathed into the palace. The new King and his wife Queen Alexandra had always been at the forefront of London high society, and their friends, known as \\"the Marlborough House Set\\", were considered to be the most eminent and fashionable of the age. Buckingham Palacethe Ballroom, Grand Entrance, Marble Hall, Grand Staircase, vestibules and galleries redecorated in the Belle poque cream and gold colour scheme they retain todayonce again became a setting for entertaining on a majestic scale but leaving some to feel King Edward's heavy redecorations were at odds with Nash's original work.[93]\\r\\nThe last major building work took place during the reign of King George?V when, in 1913, Sir?Aston Webb redesigned Blore's 1850 East Front to resemble in part Giacomo Leoni's Lyme Park in Cheshire. This new, refaced principal fa?ade (of Portland stone) was designed to be the backdrop to the Victoria Memorial, a large memorial statue of Queen Victoria, placed outside the main gates.[94] George?V, who had succeeded Edward?VII in 1910, had a more serious personality than his father; greater emphasis was now placed on official entertaining and royal duties than on lavish parties.[95] He arranged a series of command performances featuring jazz musicians such as the Original Dixieland Jazz Band (1919)?ÿ the first jazz performance for a head of state, Sidney Bechet, and Louis Armstrong (1932), which earned the palace a nomination in 2009 for a (Kind of) Blue Plaque by the Brecon Jazz Festival as one of the venues making the greatest contribution to jazz music in the United Kingdom.[96][97] George?V's wife Queen Mary was a connoisseur of the arts, and took a keen interest in the Royal Collection of furniture and art, both restoring and adding to it. Queen Mary also had many new fixtures and fittings installed, such as the pair of marble Empire-style chimneypieces by Benjamin Vulliamy, dating from 1810, which the Queen had installed in the ground floor Bow Room, the huge low room at the centre of the garden fa?ade. Queen Mary was also responsible for the decoration of the Blue Drawing Room.[98] This room, 69 feet (21 metres) long, previously known as the South Drawing Room, has a ceiling designed specially by Nash, coffered with huge gilt console brackets.[99]\\r\\nDuring World War?I, the palace, then the home of King George?V and Queen Mary, escaped unscathed. Its more valuable contents were evacuated to Windsor but the royal family remained in situ. The King imposed rationing at the palace, much to the dismay of his guests and household.[100] To the King's later regret, David Lloyd George persuaded him to go further by ostentatiously locking the wine cellars and refraining from alcohol, to set a good example to the supposedly inebriated working class. The workers continued to imbibe and the King was left unhappy at his enforced abstinence.[101] In 1938, the north-west pavilion, designed by Nash as a conservatory, was converted into a swimming pool.[102]\\r\\nDuring World War?II, the palace was bombed nine times,[103] the most serious and publicised of which resulted in the destruction of the palace chapel in 1940. Coverage of this event was played in cinemas all over the UK to show the common suffering of rich and poor. One bomb fell in the palace quadrangle while King George?VI and Queen Elizabeth were in residence, and many windows were blown in and the chapel destroyed.[104] War-time coverage of such incidents was severely restricted, however. The King and Queen were filmed inspecting their bombed home, the smiling Queen, as always, immaculately dressed in a hat and matching coat seemingly unbothered by the damage around her. It was at this time the Queen famously declared: \\"I'm glad we have been bombed. Now I can look the East End in the face\\". The royal family were seen as sharing their subjects' hardship, as The Sunday Graphic reported:\\r\\nBy the Editor: The King and Queen have endured the ordeal which has come to their subjects. For the second time a German bomber has tried to bring death and destruction to the home of Their Majesties  When this war is over the common danger which King George and Queen Elizabeth have shared with their people will be a cherished memory and an inspiration through the years.[105]\\r\\nOn 15 September 1940, known as the Battle of Britain Day, an RAF pilot, Ray Holmes of No. 504 Squadron RAF rammed a German bomber he believed was going to bomb the Palace. Holmes had run out of ammunition and made the quick decision to ram it. Holmes bailed out. Both aircraft crashed. In fact the Dornier Do 17 bomber was empty. It had already been damaged, two of its crew had been killed and the remainder bailed out. Its pilot, Feldwebel Robert Zehbe, landed, only to die later of wounds suffered during the attack. During the Dornier's descent, it somehow unloaded its bombs, one of which hit the Palace. It then crashed into the forecourt of London Victoria station.[106] The bomber's engine was later exhibited at the Imperial War Museum in London. The British pilot became a King's Messenger after the war, and died at the age of 90 in 2005.[107]\\r\\nOn VE Day8 May 1945the palace was the centre of British celebrations. The King, Queen, Princess Elizabeth (the future Queen), and Princess Margaret appeared on the balcony, with the palace's blacked-out windows behind them, to the cheers from a vast crowd in the Mall.[108] The damaged Palace was carefully restored after the War by John Mowlem & Co.[109] It was designated a Grade I listed building in 1970.[110]\\r\\nEvery year, some 50,000 invited guests are entertained at garden parties, receptions, audiences, and banquets. Three Garden Parties are held in the summer, usually in July.[111] The Forecourt of Buckingham Palace is used for Changing of the Guard, a major ceremony and tourist attraction (daily from April to July; every other day in other months).[112]\\r\\nThe palace, like Windsor Castle, is owned by the reigning monarch in right of the Crown. It is not the monarch's personal property, unlike Sandringham House and Balmoral Castle.[113] Many of the contents from Buckingham Palace, Windsor Castle, Kensington Palace, and St?James's Palace are part of the Royal Collection, held in trust by the Sovereign; they can, on occasion, be viewed by the public at the Queen's Gallery, near the Royal Mews. Unlike the palace and the castle, the purpose-built gallery is open continually and displays a changing selection of items from the collection.[114] It occupies the site of the chapel destroyed by an air raid in World War?II.[20] The palace's state rooms have been open to the public during August and September and on selected dates throughout the year since 1993. The money raised in entry fees was originally put towards the rebuilding of Windsor Castle after the 1992 fire devastated many of its state rooms.[115] In the year to 31 March 2016, 519,000 people visited the palace, and 194,000 visited the gallery.[116]\\r\\nHer Majesty's Government is responsible for maintaining the palace in exchange for the profits made by the Crown Estate.[117] In November 2015, the State Dining Room was closed for six months because its ceiling had become potentially dangerous.[118] A 10-year schedule of maintenance work, including new plumbing, wiring, boilers, and radiators, and the installation of solar panels on the roof, has been estimated to cost S369?million and was approved by the prime minister in November 2016. It will be funded by a temporary increase in the Sovereign Grant paid from the income of the Crown Estate and is intended to extend the building's working life by at least 50 years.[119][120] In March 2017, the House of Commons backed funding for the project by 464 votes to 56.[121]\\r\\nThus, Buckingham Palace is a symbol and home of the British monarchy, an art gallery, and a tourist attraction. Behind the gilded railings and gates that were completed by the Bromsgrove Guild in 1911[46] and Webb's famous fa?ade, which has been described in a book published by the Royal Collection Trust as looking \\"like everybody's idea of a palace\\",[46] is not only a weekday home of the Queen and Prince Philip but also the London residence of the Duke of York and the Earl and Countess of Wessex. The palace also houses their offices, as well as those of the Princess Royal and Princess Alexandra, and is the workplace of more than 800 people.[47]","input":"What is the bow room in buckingham palace?"},{"output":"November 9, 2010","context":"Call of Duty: Black Ops is a first-person shooter video game,[5] developed by Treyarch and published by Activision. It was released worldwide on November 9, 2010 for Microsoft Windows, the PlayStation 3, Xbox 360,[6] and Wii,[7] with a separate version for Nintendo DS developed by n-Space.[8] It is the seventh title in the Call of Duty series and the third to be developed by Treyarch. It serves as the sequel to Call of Duty: World at War.[9]\\r\\nSet in the 1960s during the Cold War, the game's campaign follows CIA operative Alex Mason as he attempts to recall certain memories in combat in order to locate a numbers station, which is due to transmit broadcasts to sleeper agents who are bound to use chemical weapons across the United States. Mason and CIA operative Jason Hudson are the game's main playable characters, as well as Red Army soldier Viktor Reznov in only one mission. Locations featured in the game include Cuba, Russia, United States, Kazakhstan, Hong Kong, Laos, Vietnam, and the Arctic Circle. The multiplayer of Black Ops features multiple objective-based game modes that are playable on 14 different maps included with the game. Improvements to loadout options and killstreak rewards are made. A form of virtual currency, COD Points, allows players to purchase weapons and customization options for their in-game character, as well as attachments and customization options for their weapon.\\r\\nDevelopment for the game began in 2009. It runs an enhanced version of the IW 3.0 engine used in Treyarch's past title, World at War. The improvements made allowed for bigger campaign levels to be made as well as enhanced lighting. Treyarch focused specifically on Black Ops during development; they were developing two games at once while making World at War. Different teams within the company focused on a certain game mode. Music was composed by Sean Murray, with music by the Rolling Stones and Creedence Clearwater Revival appearing in the campaign. Marketing of the game began in April 2010. Multiple trailers promoting the game and its modes were released from May until October.\\r\\nThe game received generally positive reviews from critics. Within 24 hours of going on sale, the game had sold more than 5.6 million copies, 4.2 million in the U.S. and 1.4 million in the UK, breaking the record set by its predecessor Modern Warfare 2 by some 2.3 million copies.[10][11] After six weeks on release, Activision reported that Black Ops had exceeded $1 billion in sales.[12] On August 3, 2011, Activision confirmed that the game had sold over 25 million copies worldwide, making it one of the best-selling games of all time in the US, UK and Europe.[13][14][15] A sequel, Call of Duty: Black Ops II, was released on November 13, 2012.[16][17] Call of Duty: Black Ops III was released on November 6, 2015 as the sequel to Black Ops II. Call of Duty: Black Ops 4 is scheduled to be released worldwide on October 12, 2018, as a sequel to Black Ops III.[18]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nBlack Ops is a first-person shooter, retaining the same gameplay mechanics as previous Call of Duty titles. The player assumes the role of a foot soldier who can wield various firearms (only two of which can be carried at once), throw grenades and other explosives, and use other equipment as weapons. A player close enough to an enemy can kill with one knife blow. A character can take three stances: standing, crouching or prone. Each affects rate of movement, accuracy, and stealth. The player can drop to the prone stance from the standing stance while running (colloquially known as \\"dolphin diving\\"), and can momentarily sprint before having to stop. The screen glows red to indicate damage to a player's health, which regenerates over time. When the character is within the blast radius of a live grenade, an on-screen marker indicates where it is in relation to the player, helping the player to move away or to throw it back. Among the weapons new to the series in Black Ops are crossbows with bolts and explosive ammunition, Dragon's Breath rounds and ballistic knives.\\r\\nThe player assumes the role of various characters during the single-player campaign, changing perspectives throughout the story. The playable characters are special forces operatives conducting black operations behind enemy lines. In this way, the player's characters have their own traits such as voices and shadows.[9] Each mission features a series of objectives that are displayed on the heads-up display, which marks the direction and distance towards and from such objectives as it has been in the earlier versions. The player is accompanied by friendly troops throughout the game. Although primarily a first-person shooter, certain levels feature sequences where the player pilots a Hind helicopter and guides friendly troops from a SR-71 Blackbird reconnaissance aircraft.[19][20][21] The campaign features several scripted cinematic moments. One of them is a bullet time effect during the \\"Victor Charlie\\" level, activated when the player fires toward the last enemy of a Viet Cong squad.[citation needed]\\r\\nAs a first in the Call of Duty main series, player characters can now speak during gameplay, whereas in previous installments, primarily those made by Infinity Ward, characters would be silent during gameplay, even if they could speak during cutscenes.\\r\\nThe online multiplayer mode of Black Ops usually revolves around two teams on a specific mission. For example, in Team Deathmatch the team with the most kills wins, while in Capture the Flag, players take the other team's flags and return it to their own base. Additionally, there is Free For All in which players aren't separated into teams. Not including Downloadable maps, there are 14 different maps.\\r\\nBlack Ops retains the experience points and unlockable reward system that has been kept since Call of Duty 4. The game's multiplayer focuses on socialization and customization.[9] \\"Create-a-Class 2.0\\" allows enhanced personalization with appearance items as well as upgradable perks;[20] weapons are extensively customizable with writing, emblems, attachments and camouflage painting. Even reticles can be modified. There are more than one style for an attachment, which allows for a lot more personalized weaponry; for example, the player can choose between a red dot sight or a reflex sight, both of which share many of the same traits, although the red dot fills up less of the screen (something desired by many players). Character models depend on the first tier perk instead of the weapon's type. Furthermore, face paints can be unlocked.[22] New custom killstreak rewards include explosive R/C cars, guided missiles and controllable attack helicopters.[23]\\r\\nA currency system has been implemented allowing players to buy weapons, accessories and clothes. Players can gamble with their \\"COD Points\\" in a free-for-all based playlist called \\"Wager Match\\", which is composed of four game modes.[24] Time limited objectives known as \\"Contracts\\" can be purchased to gain more currency and experience points.[22] The progression system is not featured in local split-screen multiplayer. In local split-screen play, all character customization options are already unlocked. Players can no longer define game rules such as win conditions.\\r\\nPlayers can play alone or with friends against AI opponents in \\"Combat Training\\" with a separate progression system.[25] Online split-screen is re-introduced on Xbox 360 and PS3. The guest account can rank up but is reset after each sign out. Only on Xbox 360, a second Gold Xbox Live account can be used to keep the second player's progression.[26] Aside from the Combat Training mode, Xbox users can also have up to four players in split-screen mode play against AI opponents even without having an Xbox Live account. This is done by configuring the Local Split Screen settings and setting the number of enemies to a value greater than zero.[27]\\r\\nFor the first time in the series, clips from online gameplay can be recorded. Some specific features that have been removed from the PC version of Infinity Ward's Modern Warfare 2 return, such as lean,[28] mod tools, the developer console[29] and dedicated servers.[30] Dedicated servers are exclusively provided by Game Servers.[31] Steam is the exclusive platform for Black Ops on PC, and the game is protected by Valve Anti-Cheat.[32]\\r\\nThe Wii version of the game includes in-game voice chat. This is the first Call of Duty title to include the voice chat feature for the Wii. Nintendo and PDP have partnered to release the first headset to be used with the Wii known as PDP's Headbanger Headset.[33]\\r\\nA zombie cooperation mode, titled \\"Zombies\\", is included in the game. Originally featured in World at War, it was revamped to be included in Black Ops.[34] It is a four-player online and two-player split screen co-op mode (which can also be unlocked online). Based on the original game, in the map \\"Five\\", players take the roles of John F. Kennedy, Richard Nixon, Robert McNamara, and Fidel Castro as they fight zombies at The Pentagon.[35][36] Another map, called \\"Kino der Toten\\" (\\"Cinema of the Dead\\" in German), features the characters from World at War ÿ Edward Richtofen the German, Tank Dempsey the American, Takeo Masaki the Japanese, and Nikolai Belinski the Russian. Limited editions of the game offer graphically-enhanced versions of the four zombies maps from World at War, featuring the newer weapons from the rest of the game.[37] There is an unlockable top-down, two-stick arcade-shooter version of Zombies known as Dead Ops Arcade.[38]\\r\\nCall of Duty: Black Ops takes place between 1961 and 1968 during the Cold War, 20 years after the events of World at War. It portrays a secret history of CIA clandestine black operations carried out behind enemy lines. Missions take place in various locations around the globe such as the Ural Mountains, Kazakhstan, Cuba, Hong Kong, Laos, South Vietnam, the Arctic circle and Siberia. The single-player campaign revolves around an experimental chemical weapon codenamed \\"Nova-6\\". This weapon is bound to be used by sleeper agents in the United States, who are infused with sequences of numbers, once broadcasts are transmitted from an unknown numbers station.\\r\\nThe player controls the protagonist, SAD/SOG special forces operative Cpt. Alex Mason (Sam Worthington). Occasionally, CIA paramilitary operations officer Jason Hudson (Ed Harris) and some other characters are playable to progress the story. Alex is often joined by fellow operatives Sgt. Frank Woods (James C. Burns) and Joseph Bowman (Ice Cube), while Jason teams up with Grigori Weaver (Gene Farber), a Russian-born field operative. Viktor Reznov (Gary Oldman), a key character from the Soviet campaign in World at War, returns along with that game's Russian protagonist Dimitri Petrenko (Boris Kievsky) also making an appearance. Oldman also voices Daniel Clarke, a British scientist assisting in the development of Project Nova. Opposing the CIA are the leaders of Project Nova: former Red Army General Nikita Dragovich (Eamon Hunt), Colonel Lev Kravchenko (Andrew Divoff), and former Nazi scientist Doctor Friedrich Steiner (Mark Bramhall). Black Ops also features several historical figures: during the story Mason meets John F. Kennedy, Robert McNamara, and Fidel Castro.\\r\\nOn February 25, 1968, SAD operative Alex Mason is strapped to a chair in an interrogation room, bombarded with questions by his unseen captors about the location of a numbers station. Mason then recalls several events, as an attempt to answer their questions.\\r\\nOn April 17, 1961, Mason, Woods, and Bowman take part in Operation 40 to assassinate Fidel Castro in Cuba during the Bay of Pigs Invasion. Mason apparently succeeds and stays behind to protect the extraction plane from an oncoming blockade, before being captured by the real Castro, having shot a double. Handed over to Major General Nikita Dragovich to be held captive at Vorkuta Gulag, Mason befriends inmate and former Red Army soldier Viktor Reznov. Reznov recounts to Mason the identities of their enemies: Dragovich, his right-hand man Lev Kravchenko, and ex-Nazi scientist Friedrich Steiner, who defected to the Soviet Union. In October 29, 1945, Reznov and Dimitri Petrenko were sent to extract Steiner from a Nazi base in the Arctic. However, they were betrayed by Dragovich, who tested Steiner's nerve gas known as \\"Nova-6\\" on Petrenko, killing him. Reznov was spared the same fate when British Commandos, also interested in acquiring Nova-6, attacked the Soviets. Reznov destroyed the Nova-6 and escaped, only to be captured by the Soviets and sent to Vorkuta. The Soviets later recreated Nova-6 with the help of a British scientist, Daniel Clarke.\\r\\nHaving spent over a year imprisoned, Mason and Reznov spark an uprising to flee the gulag, but only Mason manages to escape. On November 10, 1963, Mason meets with President John F. Kennedy, who authorizes a mission to assassinate Dragovich; Mason briefly envisions aiming a handgun at Kennedy. Mason, Woods, Bowman, and Weaver are dispatched to the Baikonur Cosmodrome to disrupt the Soviet space program and eliminate members of \\"Ascension\\", a Soviet program giving sanctuary to Nazi scientists in exchange for their knowledge. The team destroys the Soyuz spacecraft, while Woods apparently kills Dragovich in a car explosion with a commandeered BTR.\\r\\nOn January 21, 1968, Mason's team is sent to Vietnam. After defending Khe Sanh, they recover a dossier on Dragovich from a Russian defector in Hue City during the Tet Offensive. The defector turns out to be none other than Reznov, who joins them as they penetrate Laos to recover a Nova-6 shipment from a downed Soviet plane. They are captured by Viet Cong and Spetznaz infiltrators at the crash site. Bowman is executed, but Woods and Mason hijack an Mi-24 Hind in the confusion and escape, moving on to rescue Reznov from Kravchenko's base. They confront Kravchenko and Woods stabs him, but Kravchenko pulls the pins off of four grenades strapped to himself, forcing Woods to sacrifice himself by pushing both himself and Kravchenko out of a window. In a huge explosion, Mason presumes the two dead.\\r\\nMeanwhile, Hudson and Weaver interrogate Clarke in Kowloon City. Clarke reveals the location of a hidden facility in Mount Yamantau before being killed by Dragovich's men. Hudson and Weaver move to destroy the facility and receive a transmission from Steiner requesting to meet at Rebirth Island, as Dragovich has begun killing loose ends. Mason and Reznov head there to assassinate Steiner at the same time, succeeding just as Hudson and Weaver arrive. Mason is adamant that Reznov executed Steiner, but Hudson had witnessed Mason carrying out the act alone.\\r\\nHudson and Weaver are revealed to be Mason's interrogators. Dragovich has communist sleeper cells placed all over the United States which, when ordered by the numbers broadcast, will release the Nova-6 gas. As a result, the U.S. is preparing a pre-emptive nuclear strike on the Soviet Union, which would result in the inevitable Mutual Assured Destruction of World War III. Hudson needed Steiner to abort the gas launch, but after his death, only Mason has any knowledge of the numbers station. Hudson reveals that Dragovich brainwashed Mason to understand the numbers broadcasts and assassinate Kennedy, effectively making him a Soviet sleeper agent. The real Reznov never escaped, but died during the Vorkuta breakout attempt, and the Soviet defector in Hue was actually killed before Mason reached him. Masons visions of Reznov are a result of a dissociative disorder caused by the traumatic brainwashing program. Prior to the Vorkuta uprising, Reznov reprogrammed Mason to assassinate Dragovich, Kravchenko, and Steiner instead. Mason finally remembers the location of the broadcast station: a Russian cargo ship called Rusalka off the coast of Cuba. An assault on the Rusalka begins, with Mason and Hudson infiltrating the underwater submarine base protecting the ship. Hudson calls in the United States Navy to destroy the Rusalka. Mason and Hudson finally confront Dragovich in the lower levels of the facility, and Mason strangles and drowns him to death before escaping with Hudson. They regroup with Weaver, who declares victory.\\r\\nArchive footage of President Kennedy prior to his assassination on November 22, 1963 is shown, revealing Mason was among onlookers who watched Kennedy disembark from Air Force One at Love Field. His presence, and Dragovich's taunt before his death, suggest that Mason may have carried out his initial programming. A hidden message that can be accessed in the game's main menu reveals that Woods survived the confrontation with Kravchenko and is currently incarcerated in the Hanoi Hilton.\\r\\nThe Zombies story takes place over various eras of time, mostly during the final year of World War II, and the 1960s. The story mainly follows four soldiers: Corporal \\"Tank\\" Dempsey (Steven Blum) of the United States Marine Corps, Sergeant Nikolai Belinski (Fred Tatasciore) of the Red Army, Captain Takeo Masaki (Tom Kane) of the Imperial Japanese Army, and Doctor Edward Richtofen (Nolan North) of the Wehrmacht. Other characters include Doctor Ludvig Maxis (Fred Tatasciore) and his daughter Samantha (Julie Nathanson). The map \\"Five\\" features historical figures: John F. Kennedy (Jim Meskimen), Robert McNamara (Robert Picardo), Richard Nixon (Dave Mallow), and Fidel Castro (Marlon Correa). \\"Call of the Dead\\" features the appearance of celebrities: Sarah Michelle Gellar, Robert Englund, Danny Trejo, Michael Rooker, and George A. Romero, all playing themselves.\\r\\nDuring World War II, Doctor Ludvig Maxis formed Group 935, a group of scientists that was intended to improve the human condition. Lacking funds, they soon turned to creating superweapons to aid the Nazis. Their discovery of Element 115 from a meteorite in Japan lead to the creation of zombies. Maxis and his assistant, Dr. Edward Richtofen, also work on other projects, leading to the creation of teleportation devices and 115-powered weapons. Attempting to use himself as a test subject, Richtofen accidentally teleports to a catacomb within the Moon, where he comes into contact with a mysterious pyramid device that causes him to hear mysterious voices, slowly taking away his sanity. He is later teleported to an exotic jungle known as Shangri-La, where he spends three weeks studying the Vril energy force. Upon returning to Germany, Richtofen secretly forms a plan to kill Maxis, and gathers many members of Group 935 to build a moon base, known as Griffin Station. While maintaining his cover with Maxis and the rest of Group 935, Richtofen manages to capture three soldiers: Tank Dempsey, Nikolai Belinski, and Takeo Masaki; he begins to conduct experiments with Element 115, causing memory loss for all three soldiers.\\r\\nMaxis continues his work on other experiments, attempting to use his daughter's dog, Fluffy, as a test subject for his own teleportation device. However, the experiment fails, and Fluffy is transformed into an undead Hellhound. Richtofen takes the opportunity and traps Maxis and his daughter Samantha inside the teleporter with Fluffy, believing that they would die. Richtofen escapes with his three captured soldiers, and arrives at the Rising Sun research facility in Japan, where Element 115 was first discovered. After gathering a sample of 115 at the site, and recovering a weapon known as the Wunderwaffe DG-2, they return to the Der Riese factory in Germany. In an attempt to escape the zombie horde, the group accidentally overloads a teleporter with the DG-2, sending them forward in time. They arrive at an abandoned Nazi theater in the 1960s, where Richtofen discovers several recordings left behind by Dr. Maxis. Samantha, having survived and managing to control the zombies, continues raising the undead in order to hunt down Richtofen.\\r\\nSome time in 1963, the United States government manages to grab hold of several of Group 935's inventions, keeping them hidden in the Pentagon. Due to the presence of the undead-raising Element 115, zombies breach the Pentagon. John F. Kennedy, Richard Nixon, Robert McNamara, and Fidel Castro are trapped within the Pentagon, forced to fight their way out. Meanwhile, Richtofen's crew arrive at a Soviet Cosmodrome site, where Richtofen intends to travel to Group 935's moon base, Griffin Station. The crew is contacted by Gersh, a member of the Ascension Group who requests to be freed from Samantha's grip. After freeing Gersh, the four of them are teleported further in time, and arrive at a Siberian lighthouse sometime in 2011, once used by Richtofen as a secret lab. However, they are trapped within a locked room, and forced to rely on four movie actors: Sarah Michelle Gellar, Danny Trejo, Robert Englund, and Michael Rooker, who are filming a zombie movie on-site along with director George A. Romero, who had been infected as well. Richtofen requests the four celebrities to find a golden rod, which is a Vril generator device, which he then uses to fix the teleporter. He transports himself and the other three soldiers back to Shangri-La, leaving the celebrities behind to continue fighting Romero and the horde. At Shangri-La, the group discovers two explorers, Gary and Brock, who died trapped within a time loop while trying to discover the secrets of the mythical Agartha realm. The group saves the explorers' lives by traveling back and forth in time, altering the environments of the temple in the process. They discover an altar within the temple with Richtofen's name written on it, as well as a piece of a meteorite containing Element 115. However, the explorers remain stuck in the never-ending loop.\\r\\nWith the Vril generator and the meteorite piece, Richtofen now believes he can control the zombies, and returns to Griffin Station. Here, they attempt to activate the MPD, a machine that controls the Aether energy, which opens to reveal Samantha inside; instead of dying by Richtofen's trap, Samantha was teleported to the moon while Maxis was sent somewhere else. Samantha accidentally triggered the MPD and was trapped within the device, but this also allowed her to enter the Aether realm. Maxis, who was retrieved by Group 935 scientists, apologized to his daughter and committed suicide in front of her, prompting her to assume control of the zombies and seek vengeance on Richtofen. Richtofen fuses the golden rod and the meteorite piece, and using it to switch souls with Samantha, takes over as the new zombie controller. This causes his former allies to feel betrayed, and they ally themselves with Samantha (who now resides in Richtofen's body). Maxis is revealed to have become a sentient artificial intelligence living within the systems of Griffin Station, and he guides his daughter and the three soldiers to launch three missiles at the Earth. This severs Richtofen's link with the Aether, but the launch results in the catastrophic destruction of the Earth, while still leaving Richtofen in control of the undead.\\r\\nIn May 2009, publisher Activision was rumored to be looking for licensing regarding Vietnam War-era music which led to speculation that Call of Duty 7 would be set in Vietnam.[39] In May 2009, Treyarch employee David Kim revealed on his LinkedIn profile that he would work as a senior animator on Call of Duty 7.[40] In November 2009, only a few days before Modern Warfare 2's release, Activision officially announced a new Call of Duty title for 2010 through their third quarter financial call.[41] In February 2010, a casting call for Call of Duty 7 led to speculation that the game would be taking place during the Cold War era with some battles taking place in South Vietnam.[42] On April 30, 2010, Black Ops was officially announced.[6]\\r\\nThe game runs on an enhanced World at War engine (which itself was improved from Call of Duty 4's) at 60 frames per second across all platforms, excluding the Wii.[43] It features a streaming texture technology (also seen in Modern Warfare 2), making bigger levels possible such as \\"Payback\\" where the player controls a helicopter. Lighting effects have been improved as well.[44] Call of Duty: Black Ops supports 3-D imaging rendered by the engine itself.[45] This feature is available on the PC, PlayStation 3, and Xbox 360 versions.[46]\\r\\nFor Black Ops, Treyarch focused only on this game unlike past practice. However, it had different teams, each working on separate game modes.[47] Treyarch used a motion capture technology similar to the one used in James Cameron's film Avatar, which allows accurate facial expressions, capturing the whole performance of the actor.[48] The studio also consulted special forces veterans from both belligerents of the Cold War: Major John Plaster (US Army-Ret.) who served in the MACV-SOG during the Vietnam War, and former Soviet special forces operative Sonny Puzikas.[49] The latter taught Treyarch how Spetsnaz soldiers would react in combat, such as rolling out of the line of fire. Spetsnaz AIs in the game have been modeled after him, from his tactics and his movements to his face.[50][51] Although having a historical background, the classified aspect of these Cold War black operations allowed the studio to create its own fictional story.[52] The game also allows players to turn down the blood and turn off the profanity.[53]\\r\\nIt was announced on November 9, 2015 that Black Ops would become backwards compatible with the Xbox One.[54] It was originally meant to be available for backwards compatibility in December 2015, but the date was later changed to some time in 2016.[55] Black Ops was originally the sixth-most requested Xbox 360 title to become backwards compatible with the Xbox One.[56] On May 17, 2016, the game was made available through Xbox One's backward compatibility.[57] Shortly after, it was reported that sales of the Xbox 360 version had increased by 13,000 percent.[58]\\r\\nBlack Ops features the voices of Sam Worthington as Alex Mason,[59] Ed Harris as Jason Hudson,[60] Gary Oldman reprises his role as Viktor Reznov from World at War and also voices Dr. Clarke,[59] James C. Burns voices and provides performance capture for Frank Woods[61] and Ice Cube voices Joseph Bowman, who is also the multiplayer announcer for the SOG faction.[62][63] Gene Farber voices Grigori Weaver, Emmanuelle Chriqui plays a live-action character called Numbers,[64][65] Eamon Hunt voices Nikita Dragovich, Andrew Divoff voices Lev Kravchenko and Robert Picardo voices Secretary Robert McNamara. Dimitri Diatchenko, an American born actor and musician voices the Spetsnaz faction and several other characters due to his strong Russian accent.\\r\\nCall of Duty: Black Ops features Vietnam War era music including \\"Sympathy for the Devil\\" by The Rolling Stones[66] (played during a gameplay sequence, the credits, and as an easter egg in the multiplayer map Nuketown) and Creedence Clearwater Revival's \\"Fortunate Son\\".[67] Eminem's \\"Won't Back Down\\" (featuring Pink) is used for the credits as well, and additionally appears as an Easter Egg in the Zombie map \\"Five\\". In the Call of the Dead zombie map the song \\"Not Ready to Die\\" by American heavy metal band Avenged Sevenfold is featured as an easter egg.[68] The original music was composed by Sean Murray, who also composed Call of Duty: World at War while Kevin Sherwood composed music for the Zombies mode. The soundtrack was released on November 9. The use of The Rolling Stones' music in the game has seen a significant increase in the band's music sales since launch. \\"Gimme Shelter\\" sold 2,000 copies in the week before the launch trailer was revealed, 5,000 the week after, and 11,000 the week after the game's release. \\"Sympathy for the Devil\\" experienced a similar boost as gamers discovered the band's music.[citation needed]\\r\\nThe game's score was composed by Sean Murray, and the official soundtrack was released on November 9, 2010.[citation needed] In addition, a soundtrack for the popular Zombies mode was released on January 25, 2011.[citation needed]\\r\\nBlack Ops was first officially unveiled when the website for the game went live on April 30, 2010[6] prior to the release of its debut teaser trailer on GameTrailers TV Episode 310.[69] In early April 2010, an unmarked envelope was sent to various gaming news publications as well as high-profile Call of Duty fans via mail. It contained a USB flash drive with sound and text files. These files were codes to be decrypted, only to find a mysterious teaser site for an unknown game. Other codes were updated periodically.\\r\\nSimilarly to Modern Warfare 2's marketing, the first full-length trailer of Black Ops was aired after the 3rd quarter on ESPN during the NBA Eastern Conference Finals on May 18, 2010.[70] During E3 2010, studio head Mark Lamia opened the Microsoft conference by playing Black Ops on stage.[71] It was also announced that the timed Xbox 360 exclusivity for additional content of Call of Duty titles, which began with Modern Warfare 2, extends until 2012.[72] A remixed version of the ESPN trailer with Eminem's \\"Won't Back Down\\" was released on June 14,[73] prior to the E3 Activision conference for which he also performed.[74] A multiplayer teaser trailer was released on August 9, 2010 revealing killstreaks, weapons, and other in-game multiplayer features. A full multiplayer reveal took place on September 1, 2010, and revealed many multiplayer features from the game.[75]\\r\\nChrysler produced a limited-edition Call of Duty Jeep as the Wrangler is featured in Black Ops.[76] In late September, viral site GKNOVA6 was updated revealing fuzzy footages of zombies.[77] On October 11, a single player trailer aired on ESPN during the New York Jets versus Minnesota Vikings NFL Monday Night Football game.[78] The same trailer was aired the next day in the United Kingdom at half time of the England versus Montenegro 2012 European Football Championship qualifying game. On October 29, the official launch trailer was released online. The same trailer aired on October 31 during the New Orleans Saints versus Pittsburgh Steelers NFL Sunday Night Football game. The trailer features the song \\"Gimme Shelter\\" by The Rolling Stones.[79]\\r\\nLike Modern Warfare 2, \\"Hardened\\" and \\"Prestige\\" limited editions are available: the Hardened Edition includes a SteelBook case, a medal with its display case, four exclusive co-op levels and an Xbox Live or PlayStation Home avatar outfit. The Prestige Edition offers, in addition to the Hardened Edition's content, a real RC-XD remote-control vehicle modeled after the in-game killstreak reward, which gives video and audio feedback to its controller.[80] In Japan, the game is distributed by Square Enix. Two versions are available: subtitled or dubbed,[81] released respectively on November 18, 2010 and December 16, 2010. Both have dismemberment censored.[82] Gore is censored as well in Germany in addition to the removal of \\"Sympathy for the Devil\\" and Nazi symbols considered \\"anti-constitutional\\" in the country.[66]\\r\\nTreyarch released the \\"First Strike\\" Map Pack on February 1, 2011 for the Xbox 360. The PlayStation 3 received the map pack on March 3, 2011 and the PC version was released on March 25, 2011 through Steam.[83] The Map Pack includes additional maps that can be played in the Multiplayer. These maps include \\"Berlin Wall\\", \\"Discovery\\", \\"Kowloon\\" and \\"Stadium\\" and a map for the Zombies mode titled \\"Ascension\\" which takes place in a Soviet launch site.[84]\\r\\nOn April 11, 2011, a second map pack called \\"Escalation\\" was announced by Activison and Microsoft. It features 4 new multiplayer maps named \\"Zoo\\", \\"Hotel\\", \\"Convoy\\", \\"Stockpile\\" and one new zombies map named 'Call of the Dead'. This map is based on the movies by George A. Romero, the revolutionary epic-zombie-horror director. The trailer for this map shows the four playable characters: Danny Trejo, Sarah Michelle Gellar, Robert Englund and Michael Rooker. The name is a reference to the immensely popular Dead Series created and directed by Romero. The trailer also offers a sneak peek of a zombiefied version of George A. Romero himself, lurking out of water. The map is set on a ship, with instead of Nazi zombies, shipcrew zombies. It was released on May 3, 2011 for the Xbox 360, June 2 on the PC and June 10 for the PlayStation 3.[85]\\r\\nA third map pack called \\"Annihilation\\" was released for the Xbox 360 on June 28, 2011, and on July 28, 2011 for the PlayStation 3 and PC. It contains four new multiplayer maps named \\"Hangar 18\\", \\"Hazard\\", \\"Drive-In\\", \\"Silo\\", and a new zombies map named \\"Shangri La\\", which takes place in a legendary shrine lost in an exotic jungle.[86][87]\\r\\nThe fourth map pack, \\"Rezurrection\\" was released on August 23, 2011 for the Xbox 360 and September 22, 2011 on PlayStation 3 and PC. The Rezurrection Map Pack is made up of 5 Zombies mode only maps. It includes the first 4 maps from Call of Duty: World at War (\\"Shi No Numa\\"/\\"Swamp\\", \\"Nacht Der Untoten\\"/\\"Night\\", \\"Verruckt\\"/\\"Asylum\\", \\"Der Riese\\"/\\"Factory\\") and a new map called \\"Moon\\". \\"Moon\\" allows players to fight zombies in zero gravity with both the player and the zombies under zero gravity influence.[88]\\r\\nCall of Duty: Black Ops has received generally positive reviews from critics. GameSpot awarded it 9.0 out of ten and wrote \\"Call of Duty: Black Ops bears the series' standard superbly, delivering an engrossing campaign and exciting competitive multiplayer.\\"[107] Edge magazine was less positive, giving it a 7/10, writing that \\"As polished and pretty and fun as Black Ops often is, it feels more like a yearly update than a sequel [which] isn't distinct from its predecessors in any important way\\".[123] Several reviewers also complained that the game felt too much like a rail shooter, with PC Gamer branding it \\"barely interactive\\".[124][125][126][127]\\r\\nReviewers also noted that the PC version of the game was buggy and had \\"a number of frustrating problems\\", including a lag in multiplayer modes which for some players rendered the game almost \\"unplayable\\".[128][129][130] Players have also reported serious bugs with the PlayStation 3 version, including compatibility issues with 3D televisions.[131] PC World magazine noted that user reviews of the game were much less positive than those of critics.[132] As of November 12, 2010, three days after the release, PC, PS3, and Xbox 360 versions of the game held average user ratings of 3.1, 3.1, and 1.8 stars on Amazon.com, respectively (on a 1 to 5 scale),[133] with many PC users complaining about lag, stuttering and bugs.\\r\\nIn January 2011, to a player complaining about the remaining connection problems for the game on PlayStation 3, an Activision customer service representative threatened that they could shut down the servers for the game for the PlayStation Network at any time.[134][135][136] After some days and following some game media heat,[137] Dan Amrich, Activision Social Media Manager, declared that even if they could kill the servers, they did not plan currently to do it.[138] The Daily Telegraph praised Black Ops as a superb experience of gameplay, \\"the meaty kick of the guns, the blistering pace of the action and the sterling soundtrack of explosions, gunshots and whistling bullets all serve to quicken the player's pulse and tighten their grip on the controller\\",[121] and mentioned, it is beyond the overwhelming, chaotic action in the game's major gun battles, offers among other things, a stealthy infiltration of a substation in the snow-capped steppes, in which the slow down in action is compensated for by nail-shredding tension and creepy atmosphere.[121]\\r\\nOfficial Nintendo Magazine awarded the Wii version 90% and said \\"Black Ops on Wii is a fantastic shooter packed with all the features of its HD brothers, with the only exception being split-screen multiplayer.\\"[139] Martin Gaston at VideoGamer.com gave the Wii version 6 out of 10, complaining of Treyarch's reworking of in-game sequences as movies, poor AI, and gameplay problems from lower-resolution graphics.[118]\\r\\nIn February 2011, the Xbox 360 version was named the Xbox Live's top title of 2010 by GameSpot.[140]\\r\\nWithin 24 hours of its release, Black Ops had sold a combined total of 5.6 million units in the U.S. and UK market, surpassing that of Modern Warfare 2 and establishing a new record for largest entertainment launch.[141] Compared to the much anticipated opening of Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows ÿ Part 1, the game earned more than twice as much as the film, earning $360?million.[142] Only five days after its release, sales from the game worldwide reached US$650?million, surpassing the previous record achieved by Modern Warfare 2 which earned $550?million in five days.[143] By November 22, the game remained the bestselling title in the United Kingdom, despite sales dropping by 85%.[144] Some estimates had placed sales of the game as reaching 18?million units sold, earning a revenue of $818?million. This would fall about 2?million copies and $182?million short of Modern Warfare 2.[145] By December 22, worldwide revenue of Black Ops exceeded $1?billion.[146][147] Sales remained strong months after the game's release, remaining at the top-seller list in February 2011.[148] On March 3, 2011 the news magazine The Hollywood Reporter also reported on the best selling video games ever. It announced that Call of Duty: Black Ops was the best-selling game ever in the United States of America.[149] Black Ops was the best-selling game of all time in the UK until Grand Theft Auto V overtook it in November 2014.[150] By November 2013, the game had sold 26.2 million copies.[151]\\r\\nCuba has condemned the release of the game as it has special forces trying but failing to kill a young Fidel Castro, killing instead a body-double.[152][153] The Cuba-based pro-Fidel Castro website Cubadebate said the game \\"encourages sociopathic attitudes of American children and adolescents, the main consumers of these virtual games\\".[152][154][155]\\r\\nBlack Ops was also released for both mobile phones and smartphones.[156] This version is a side-scrolling shooter. It features a different storyline, a different set of characters, and is set in the Vietnam War in 1967. The game was developed by Glu Mobile and published by Activision.[156][157]","input":"When did the first black ops come out?"},{"output":"right to counsel during police interrogations","context":"Escobedo v. Illinois, 378 U.S. 478 (1964),[1] was a United States Supreme Court case holding that criminal suspects have a right to counsel during police interrogations under the Sixth Amendment. The case was decided a year after the court held in Gideon v. Wainwright, 372 U.S. 335 (1963) that indigent criminal defendants had a right to be provided counsel at trial.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nDanny Escobedo's brother-in-law, Manuel Valtierra, was shot and killed on the night of January 19, 1960. Escobedo was arrested without a warrant early the next morning and interrogated. However, Escobedo made no statement to the police and was released that afternoon. Subsequently, Benedict DiGerlando, who was in custody and considered another suspect, told the police that indeed Escobedo fired the fatal shots because the victim had mistreated Escobedo's sister. On January 30, again, the police arrested Escobedo and his sister, Grace. While transporting them to the police station, the police explained that DiGerlando had implicated Escobedo, and urged him and Grace to confess. Escobedo again declined. Escobedo asked to speak to his attorney, but the police refused, explaining that although he was not formally charged yet, he was in custody and could not leave. His attorney went to the police station and repeatedly asked to see his client, but was repeatedly refused access. Police and prosecutors proceeded to interrogate Escobedo for fourteen and a half hours and repeatedly refused his request to speak with his attorney. While being interrogated, Escobedo made statements indicating his knowledge of the crime. After conviction for murder, Escobedo appealed on the basis of being denied the right to counsel.\\r\\nEscobedo appealed to the Illinois Supreme Court, which initially held the confession inadmissible and reversed the conviction.[2] Illinois petitioned for rehearing and the court then affirmed the conviction. Escobedo appealed to the U.S. Supreme Court.[3] The ACLU argued before the Court as amicus curiae favoring Escobedo in a 5-4 decision.[4][5]\\r\\nThis holding was later implicitly overruled by Miranda v. Arizona in 1966, and the Supreme Court held that pre-indictment interrogations violate the Fifth Amendment, not the Sixth Amendment. As Escobedo was questioned during a custodial interrogation, the result for the appellant would have been the same.[6][7][8]","input":"What was the effect of the decision in escobedo v. illinois?"},{"output":"one-third of the country's population","context":"The demographics of New Zealand encompass the gender, ethnic, religious, geographic, and economic backgrounds of the 4.8 million people living in New Zealand. New Zealanders, informally known as \\"Kiwis\\", predominantly live in urban areas on the North Island. The five largest cities are Auckland (with one-third of the country's population), Christchurch (in the South Island, the largest island of the New Zealand archipelago), Wellington, Hamilton and Tauranga. Few New Zealanders live on New Zealand's smaller islands. Waiheke Island (near Auckland) is easily the most populated smaller island with 9,520 residents, while Great Barrier Island, the Chatham and Pitt Islands and Stewart Island each have populations below 1,000. New Zealand is part of a realm and most people born in the realm's external territories of Tokelau, the Ross Dependency, the Cook Islands and Niue are entitled to New Zealand passports. In 2006, more people who identified themselves with these islands lived in New Zealand than on the Islands themselves.\\r\\nThe majority of New Zealand's population is of European descent (74 percent), with the indigenous Mori being the largest minority (14.9 percent), followed by Asians (11.8 percent) and non-Mori Pacific Islanders (7.4 percent).[n 1] This is reflected in immigration, with most new migrants coming from Britain and Ireland, although the numbers from Asia are increasing. The largest Mori tribe (iwi) is Ngpuhi with 125,601 people or 18.8 percent of the Mori population. Auckland is the most ethnically diverse region in New Zealand with 59.3 percent identifying as Europeans, 23.1 percent as Asian, 10.7 percent as Mori and 14.6 percent as Pacific Islanders. The ethnicity of the population aged under 18 years is considerably more diverse than the population aged 65 years or older. Recent increases in interracial marriages have resulted in more people identifying with more than one ethnic group.\\r\\nEnglish, Mori and New Zealand Sign Language are the official languages, with English predominant. New Zealand English is mostly non-rhotic and sounds similar to Australian English, with a common exception being the centralisation of the short i. The Mori language has undergone a process of revitalisation and is spoken by 3.7?percent of the population. New Zealand has an adult literacy rate of 99?percent and over half of the population aged 15 to 29 hold a tertiary qualification. In the adult population 14.2 percent have a bachelor's degree or higher, 30.4 percent have some form of secondary qualification as their highest qualification and 22.4 percent have no formal qualification. As of the 2013 census, just under half the population identify as Christians, with Hinduism and Buddhism being the most significant minority religions. New Zealand has no state religion and just over 40?percent of the population does not have a religion.\\r\\nFarming is a major occupation in New Zealand, although more people are employed as sales assistants. Most New Zealanders earn wage or salary income, with a median personal income in 2013 of NZ$28,500.[6]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nWhile the demonym for a New Zealand citizen is New Zealander, the informal \\"Kiwi\\" is commonly used both internationally[7] and by locals.[8] The name derives from the kiwi, a native flightless bird, which is the national symbol of New Zealand. The Mori loanword \\"Pkeh\\" usually refers to New Zealanders of European descent, although some reject this appellation,[9][10] and some Mori use it to refer to all non-Polynesian New Zealanders.[11] Most people born in New Zealand or one of the realm's external territories (Tokelau, the Ross Dependency, the Cook Islands and Niue) before 2006 are New Zealand citizens. Further conditions apply for those born from 2006 onwards.[12]\\r\\nIn June 2017, New Zealand has an estimated population of 4,793,700,[13] up from the 4,027,947 recorded in the 2006 census.[14] The median child birthing age was 30 and the total fertility rate is 2.1?births per woman in 2010. In Mori populations the median age is 26 and fertility rate 2.8.[15] In 2010 the age-standardised mortality rate was 3.8?deaths per 1000 (down from 4.8 in 2000) and the infant mortality rate for the total population was 5.1?deaths per 1000 live births.[15] The life expectancy of a New Zealand child born in 2014-16 was 83.4?years for females, and 79.9?years for males.[3] Life expectancy at birth is forecast to increase from 80?years to 85?years in 2050 and infant mortality is expected to decline.[16] In 2050 the population is forecast to reach 5.3?million, the median age to rise from 36?years to 43?years and the percentage of people 60?years of age and older rising from 18?percent to 29?percent.[16] (The number of people aged 65 and over increased by 22?percent between the 2006 and 2013 censuses.[17]) During early migration in 1858, New Zealand had 131 males for every 100 females, but following changes in migration patterns and the modern longevity advantage of women, females came to outnumber males in 1971.[18] As of 2012 there are 0.99 males per female, with males dominating under 15 years and females dominating in the 65 years and older range.[19]\\r\\nNew Zealand has a growing population, as measured:[21]\\r\\nNew Zealand's population density is relatively low, at 17.9 per square kilometre (46.4 per square mile)  (June 2017 estimate).[13] The vast majority of the population live on the main North and South Islands, with New Zealand's major inhabited smaller islands being Waiheke Island (9,520), the Chatham and Pitt Islands (640), and Stewart Island (381).[13] Over three-quarters of the population live in the North Island (76.7 percent), with one-third of the total population living in the Auckland Region. This region is also the fastest growing, accounting for 46?percent of New Zealand's total population growth. Most Mori live in the North Island (86.0?percent), although less than a quarter (23.8?percent) live in Auckland.[22] New Zealand is a predominantly urban country, with 86.5?percent of the population living in an urban area. About 73.0?percent of the population live in the 17 main urban areas (population of 30,000 or more) and 53.8?percent live in the four largest cities of Auckland, Christchurch, Wellington, and Hamilton.[13]\\r\\nApproximately 14?percent of the population live in four different categories of rural areas as defined by Statistics New Zealand. About 18?percent of the rural population live in areas that have a high urban influence (roughly 12.9 people per square kilometre), many working in the main urban area. Rural areas with moderate urban influence and a population density of about 6.5?people per square kilometre account for 26?percent of the rural population. Areas with low urban influence where the majority of the residents work in the rural area house approximately 42?percent of the rural population. Remote rural areas with a density of less than 1 person per square kilometre account for about 14?percent of the rural population.[23]\\r\\nBefore local government reforms in the late 1980s, a borough council with more than 20,000 people could be proclaimed a city.[24][25] The boundaries of councils tended to follow the edge of the built-up area, so there was little difference between the urban area and the local government area. In 1989, all councils were consolidated into regional councils (top tier) and territorial authorities (second tier) which cover a much wider area and population than the old city councils.[26] Today a territorial authority must have a predominantly urban population of at least 50,000 before it can be officially recognised as a city.[27] The 20 largest urban areas are listed below:\\r\\nEast Polynesians were the first people to reach New Zealand about 1280, followed by the early European explorers, notably James Cook in 1769 who explored New Zealand three times and mapped the coastline. Following the Treaty of Waitangi in 1840 when the country became a British colony, immigrants were predominantly from Britain, Ireland and Australia. Due to restrictive policies, limitations were placed on non-European immigrants.[29] During the gold rush period (1858ÿ1880s) large number of young men came from California and Victoria to New Zealand goldfields. Apart from British, there were Irish, Germans, Scandinavians, Italians and many Chinese. The Chinese were sent special invitations by the Otago Chamber of Commerce in 1866. By 1873 they made up 40 percent of the diggers in Otago and 25 percent of the diggers in Westland.[30] From 1900 there was also significant Dutch, Dalmatian,[31] and Italian immigration together with indirect European immigration through Australia, North America, South America and South Africa.[32] Following the Great Depression policies were relaxed and migrant diversity increased. In 2008ÿ09, a target of 45,000 migrants was set by the New Zealand Immigration Service (plus a 5,000 tolerance).[33]\\r\\nJust over 25 percent of New Zealand's population at the 2013 census was born overseas, up from 23 percent in 2006 and 20 percent in 2001. Over half (51.6 percent) of New Zealand's overseas-born population lives in the Auckland Region, including 72 percent of the country's Pacific Island-born population, 64 percent of its Asian-born population, and 56 percent of its Middle Eastern and African- born population.[34] In the late 2000s, Asia overtook the British Isles as the largest source of overseas migrants; today around 32 percent of overseas-born New Zealand residents were born in Asia (mainly China, India, the Philippines and South Korea) compared to 26 percent born in the UK and Ireland.[35] The number of fee-paying international students increased sharply in the late 1990s, with more than 20,000 studying in public tertiary institutions in 2002.[36]\\r\\nTo be eligible for entry under the skilled migrant plan applicants are assessed by an approved doctor for good health, provide a police certificate to prove good character and speak sufficient English. Migrants working in some occupations (mainly health) must be registered with the appropriate profession body before they can work within that area.[37] Skilled migrants are assessed by Immigration New Zealand and applicants that they believe will contribute are issued with a residential visa, while those with potential are issued with a work to resident visa.[38] Under the work to residency process applicants are given a temporary work permit for two years and are then eligible to apply for residency.[39] Applicants with a job offer from an accredited New Zealand employer, cultural or sporting talent, looking for work where there has been a long-term skill shortage or to establish a business can apply for work to residency.[39][40]\\r\\nWhile most New Zealanders live in New Zealand, there is also a significant diaspora abroad, estimated as of 2001 at over 460,000 or 14?percent of the international total of New Zealand-born. Of these, 360,000, over three-quarters of the New Zealand-born population residing outside of New Zealand, live in Australia. Other communities of New Zealanders abroad are concentrated in other English-speaking countries, specifically the United Kingdom, the United States and Canada, with smaller numbers located elsewhere.[41] Nearly one quarter of New Zealand's highly skilled workers live overseas, mostly in Australia and Britain, more than any other developed nation.[42] However many educated professionals from Europe and lesser developed countries have recently migrated to New Zealand.[43][44] A common pathway for New Zealanders to move to the UK is through a job offer via the Tier 2 (General) visa, which grants a 3-year initial stay in the country and can later be extended with three more years. After 5 years the person can apply for permanent residency. Another popular option is the UK Working Holiday visa, also known as \\"Youth Mobility Scheme\\" (YMS), which grants New Zealanders 2-year rights to live and work in the UK.[45]\\r\\nNew Zealand is a multiethnic society, and home to people of many different national origins. Originally composed solely of the Mori who arrived in the thirteenth century, the ethnic makeup of the population later became dominated by New Zealanders of European descent.[46] In the nineteenth century, European settlers brought diseases for which the Mori had no immunity. By the 1890s, the Mori population was approximately 40 percent of its size pre-contact.[46] The Mori population increased during the twentieth century,[47] though it remains a minority.\\r\\nAt the latest census in 2013, 74.0?percent identified as European, 14.9?percent, as Mori, 11.8?percent as Asian, 7.4?percent as Pacific peoples, and 1.2?percent as Middle-Eastern, Latin American, and African (MELAA).[n 2][4] Most New Zealanders are of English,[48] Scottish,[49] and Irish ancestry,[50] with smaller percentages of other European ancestries, such as Dutch, Dalmatian, French, German and Scandinavian.[51] Auckland was the most diverse region with 59.3?percent identifying as European, 23.1?percent as Asian, 10.7?percent as Mori, and 14.6?percent as Pacific Islanders.[52]\\r\\nAll major ethnic groups increased when compared with the 2006 census,[53] in which 67.6?percent identified as European, 14.6?percent as Mori, 9.2?percent as Asian, and 6.9?percent of Pacific Islander origin. An additional 11.1?percent identified themselves simply as a \\"New Zealander\\" (or similar), and 1.0?percent identified with other ethnicities.[54] There was significant public discussion about usage of the term \\"New Zealander\\" during the months leading up to the 2006 census.[55] The number of people identifying with this term increased from approximately 80,000 (2.4?percent) in 2001 to just under 430,000 people (11.1?percent) in 2006.[56] The European grouping significantly decreased from 80.0 percent of the population in 2001 to 67.6 percent in 2006, however, this is broadly proportional to the large increase in \\"New Zealanders\\".[56] The number of people identifying as a \\"New Zealander\\" dropped back to under 66,000 in 2013.[56]\\r\\nAs recorded in the 2013 census, the largest Mori iwi is Ngpuhi with 125,601 people (or 18.8 percent of people of Mori descent).[22] Since 2006, the number of people of Mori descent stating Ngpuhi as their iwi increased by 3,390 people (2.8?percent). The second-largest was Ngti Porou, with 71,049 people (down 1.2?percent from 2006). Ngi Tahu was the largest in the South Island and the third-largest overall, with a count of 54,819 people (an increase of 11.4?percent from 2006). A total of 110,928 people (or 18.5?percent) of Mori descent did not know their iwi (an increase of 8.4?percent compared with 2006).[22] A group of Mori migrated to Rkohu, now known as the Chatham Islands, where they developed their distinct Moriori culture.[57][58] The Moriori population was decimated, first, by disease brought by European sealers and whalers and, second, by Taranaki Mori, with only 101 surviving in 1862 and the last known full-blooded Moriori dying in 1933.[58] The number of people identifying as having Moriori descents increased from 105 in 1991 to 945 in 2006,[59] but decreased to 738 in 2013.[60]\\r\\nRecent increases in interracial marriages has resulted in the New Zealand population of Mori, Asian and Pacific Islander descent growing at a higher rate than those of European descent.[61] In 2013, 11.2?percent of people identified with more than one ethnic group,[56] compared with 10.4?percent in 2006.[62] The ethnic diversity of New Zealand is projected to increase. Europeans (including \\"New Zealanders\\") will remain the largest group, although it is predicted to fall to 70?percent in 2026. The Asian, Pacific and Mori groups are the fastest growing and will increase to 3.4?percent, 10?percent and 16?percent, respectively.[63] In 2013, the ethnicity of the population aged under 18 years was 71 percent European, 25 percent Mori, 13 percent Pacific, 12 percent Asian, and 1 percent MELAA.[4][64] The population aged 65?years or older consisted of 87.8 percent European, 5.6 percent Mori, 4.7 percent Asian and 2.4 percent Pacific.[17]\\r\\nThe maps below (taken from 2013 census data[4]) show the percentages of people in each census area unit identifying themselves as European, Mori, Asian, or Pacific Islander (as defined by Statistics New Zealand). As people could identify themselves with multiple groups, percentages are not cumulative.\\r\\nEnglish has long been entrenched as a de facto national language due to its widespread use.[65] In the 2013 census, 96.1?percent of respondents spoke English.[5] The New Zealand English dialect is mostly non-rhotic with an exception being the Southern Burr found principally in Southland and parts of Otago.[66] It is similar to Australian English and many speakers from the Northern Hemisphere are unable to tell the accents apart.[67] In New Zealand English the short i (as in kit) has become centralised, leading to the phrase fish and chips sounding like \\"fush and chups\\" to the Australian ear.[68] The words rarely and really, reel and real, doll and dole, pull and pool, witch and which, and full and fill can sometimes be pronounced as homophones.[69][70][66] Some New Zealanders pronounce the past participles grown, thrown and mown using two syllables, whereas groan, throne and moan are pronounced as one syllable.[71] New Zealanders often reply to a question or emphasise a point by adding a rising intonation at the end of the sentence.[72]\\r\\nInitially, the Mori language (te reo Mori) was permitted in native schools to facilitate English instruction, but as time went on official attitudes hardened against any use of the language. Mori were discouraged from speaking their own language in schools and work places and it existed as a community language only in a few remote areas.[73] The language underwent a revival beginning in the 1970s, and now more people speak Mori.[74][75] The future of the language was the subject of a claim before the Waitangi Tribunal in 1985. As a result, Mori was declared an official language in 1987.[76] In the 2013 census, 21.3?percent of Mori peopleand 3.7?percent of all respondents, including some non-Mori peoplereported conversational fluency in the language.[77][n 3] There are now Mori language immersion schools and two Mori Television channels, the only nationwide television channels to have the majority of their prime-time content delivered in Mori.[79] Many places have officially been given dual Mori and English names in recent years.\\r\\nIn the 2013 census, 20,235 people reported the ability to use New Zealand Sign Language. This is down 16?percent on the 2006 census.[5] NZSL was declared one of New Zealand's official languages in 2006.[80]\\r\\nSamoan is the most widely spoken non-official language (2.2?percent),[n 4] followed by Hindi (1.7?percent), \\"Northern Chinese\\" (including Mandarin, 1.3?percent) and French (1.2?percent).[5] A considerable proportion of first- and second-generation migrants are multilingual.\\r\\nEducation follows the three-tier model, which includes primary schools, followed by secondary schools (high schools) and tertiary education at universities or polytechnics. The Programme for International Student Assessment ranked New Zealand's education as the seventh highest in 2009.[81] The Education Index, published with the UN's 2014 Human Development Index and based on data from 2013, listed New Zealand at 0.917, ranked second after Australia.[82]\\r\\nPrimary and secondary schooling is compulsory for children aged 6 to 16[83] with most children starting at 5. Early leaving exemptions may be granted to 15-year-old students that have been experiencing some ongoing difficulties at school or are unlikely to benefit from continued attendance.[84] Parents and caregivers can home school their children if they obtain approval from the Ministry of Education and prove that their child will be taught \\"as regularly and as well as in a registered school\\".[85] There are 13 school years and attending state (public) schools is nominally free from a person's fifth birthday until the end of the calendar year following their 19th birthday.[85][86]\\r\\nThe academic year in New Zealand varies between institutions, but generally runs from late January until mid-December for primary and secondary schools and polytechnics, and from late February until mid-November for universities. New Zealand has an adult literacy rate of 99?percent,[87] and over half of the population aged 15 to 29 hold a tertiary qualification.[83][n 5] In the adult population 14.2?percent have a bachelor's degree or higher, 30.4?percent have some form of secondary qualification as their highest qualification and 22.4?percent have no formal qualification.[88]\\r\\nNew Zealand does not have a state religion,[90] but the principal religion is Christianity. As recorded in the 2013 census, about 49?percent of the population identified themselves as Christians,[n 7] although regular church attendance is estimated at 15?percent.[91] Another 41.9?percent indicated that they had no religion (up from 34.7?percent in 2006[92]) and around 6?percent affiliated with other religions.[89]\\r\\nThe indigenous religion of the Mori population was animistic, but with the arrival of missionaries from the early nineteenth century most of the Mori population converted to Christianity.[93] In the 2013 census, 2,595 Mori still identify themselves as adhering to traditional Mori beliefs.[89] The largest Christian denominations are Roman Catholicism, Anglicanism, Presbyterianism. There are also significant numbers of Christians who identify themselves with Methodist, Pentecostal, Baptist and Latter-day Saint churches, and the New Zealand-based Rtana church has adherents among Mori.[89] Immigration and associated demographic change in recent decades has contributed to the growth of minority religions,[94] especially Hinduism, Buddhism and Islam.[95][96]\\r\\nNew Zealand's early economy was based on sealing, whaling, flax, gold, kauri gum, and native timber.[97] During the 1880s agricultural products became the highest export earner and farming was a major occupation within New Zealand.[98] Farming is still a major employer, with 75 000 people indicating farming as their occupation during the 2006 census,[99] although dairy farming has recently taken over from sheep as the largest sector.[98] The largest occupation recorded during the census was sales assistant with 93,840 people.[99] Most people are on wages or salaries (59.9 percent), with the other sources of income being interest and investments (24.1 percent) and self-employment (16.6 percent).[100]\\r\\nIn 1982 New Zealand had the lowest per-capita income of all the developed nations surveyed by the World Bank.[101] In 2010 the estimated gross domestic product (GDP) at purchasing power parity (PPP) per capita was roughly US$28,250, between the thirty-first and fifty-first highest for all countries.[n 8] The median personal income in 2006 was $24,400. This was up from $15,600 in 1996, with the largest increases in the $50,000 to $70,000 bracket.[105] The median income for men was $31,500, $12,400 more than women.[106] The highest median personal income were for people identifying with the European or \\"other\\" ethnic group, while the lowest was from the Asian ethnic group. The median income for people identifying as Mori was $20,900.[107] In 2013, the median personal income had risen slightly to $28,500.[6]\\r\\nUnemployment peaked above 10?percent in 1991 and 1992,[108] before falling to a record low of 3.7?percent in 2007 (ranking third from twenty-seven comparable OECD nations).[109] Unemployment rose back to 7?percent in late 2009.[110] In the June 2017 quarter, unemployment had fallen to 4.8?percent. This is the lowest unemployment rate since December 2008, after the start of the global financial crisis, when it was 4.4 percent.[111] Most New Zealanders do some form of voluntary work, more women volunteer (92 percent) than males (86 percent).[112] Home ownership has declined since 1991, from 73.8?percent to 66.9?percent in 2006.[113]","input":"What percent of new zealand's population live in auckland?"},{"output":"506,837","context":"Greenville County is a county located in the state of South Carolina, in the United States.

The Garden's creation followed a fund-raising campaign led by the Torrey Botanical Club and Columbia University botanist Nathaniel Lord Britton and his wife Elizabeth Gertrude Britton who were inspired to emulate the Royal Botanic Gardens in London.

Synthetic diamond is also widely known as HPHT diamond or CVD diamond after the two common production methods (referring to the high-pressure high-temperature and chemical vapor deposition crystal formation methods, respectively). While the term synthetic is associated by consumers with imitation products, artificial diamonds are made of the same material (pure carbon, crystallized in isotropic 3D form).[1] In the U.S., the Federal Trade Commission has indicated that the alternative terms laboratory-grown, laboratory-created, and [manufacturer-name]-created \\"would more clearly communicate the nature of the stone\\".\\r\\nNumerous claims of diamond synthesis were documented between 1879 and 1928; most of those attempts were carefully analyzed but none were confirmed. In the 1940s, systematic research began in the United States, Sweden and the Soviet Union to grow diamonds using CVD and HPHT processes. The first reproducible synthesis was reported around 1953. Those two processes still dominate the production of synthetic diamond. A third method, known as detonation synthesis, entered the diamond market in the late 1990s. In this process, nanometer-sized diamond grains are created in a detonation of carbon-containing explosives. A fourth method, treating graphite with high-power ultrasound, has been demonstrated in the laboratory, but currently has no commercial application.\\r\\nThe properties of synthetic diamond depend on the details of the manufacturing processes; however, some synthetic diamonds (whether formed by HPHT or CVD) have properties such as hardness, thermal conductivity and electron mobility that are superior to those of most naturally formed diamonds. Synthetic diamond is widely used in abrasives, in cutting and polishing tools and in heat sinks. Electronic applications of synthetic diamond are being developed, including high-power switches at power stations, high-frequency field-effect transistors and light-emitting diodes. Synthetic diamond detectors of ultraviolet (UV) light or high-energy particles are used at high-energy research facilities and are available commercially. Because of its unique combination of thermal and chemical stability, low thermal expansion and high optical transparency in a wide spectral range, synthetic diamond is becoming the most popular material for optical windows in high-power CO2 lasers and gyrotrons. It is estimated that 98% of industrial grade diamond demand is supplied with synthetic diamonds.[2]\\r\\nBoth CVD and HPHT diamonds can be cut into gems and various colors can be produced: clear white, yellow, brown, blue, green and orange. The appearance of synthetic gems on the market created major concerns in the diamond trading business, as a result of which special spectroscopic devices and techniques have been developed to distinguish synthetic and natural diamonds.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter the 1797 discovery that diamond was pure carbon,[3] many attempts were made to convert various cheap forms of carbon into diamond.[4] The earliest successes were reported by James Ballantyne Hannay in 1879[5] and by Ferdinand Frdric Henri Moissan in 1893. Their method involved heating charcoal at up to 3500?C with iron inside a carbon crucible in a furnace. Whereas Hannay used a flame-heated tube, Moissan applied his newly developed electric arc furnace, in which an electric arc was struck between carbon rods inside blocks of lime.[6] The molten iron was then rapidly cooled by immersion in water. The contraction generated by the cooling supposedly produced the high pressure required to transform graphite into diamond. Moissan published his work in a series of articles in the 1890s.[7]\\r\\nMany other scientists tried to replicate his experiments. Sir William Crookes claimed success in 1909.[8] Otto Ruff claimed in 1917 to have produced diamonds up to 7?mm in diameter,[9] but later retracted his statement.[10] In 1926, Dr. J Willard Hershey of McPherson College replicated Moissan's and Ruff's experiments,[11][12] producing a synthetic diamond; that specimen is on display at the McPherson Museum in Kansas.[13] Despite the claims of Moissan, Ruff, and Hershey, other experimenters were unable to reproduce their synthesis.[14][15]\\r\\nThe most definitive replication attempts were performed by Sir Charles Algernon Parsons. A prominent scientist and engineer known for his invention of the steam turbine, he spent about 40 years (1882ÿ1922) and a considerable part of his fortune trying to reproduce the experiments of Moissan and Hannay, but also adapted processes of his own.[16] Parsons was known for his painstakingly accurate approach and methodical record keeping; all his resulting samples were preserved for further analysis by an independent party.[17] He wrote a number of articlessome of the earliest on HPHT diamondin which he claimed to have produced small diamonds.[18] However, in 1928, he authorized Dr. C.H. Desch to publish an article[19] in which he stated his belief that no synthetic diamonds (including those of Moissan and others) had been produced up to that date. He suggested that most diamonds that had been produced up to that point were likely synthetic spinel.[14]\\r\\nIn 1941, an agreement was made between the General Electric (GE), Norton and Carborundum companies to further develop diamond synthesis. They were able to heat carbon to about 3,000?C (5,430?F) under a pressure of 3.5 gigapascals (510,000?psi) for a few seconds. Soon thereafter, the Second World War interrupted the project. It was resumed in 1951 at the Schenectady Laboratories of GE, and a high-pressure diamond group was formed with Francis P. Bundy and H.M. Strong. Tracy Hall and others joined this project shortly thereafter.[20]\\r\\nThe Schenectady group improved on the anvils designed by Percy Bridgman, who received a Nobel Prize for his work in 1946. Bundy and Strong made the first improvements, then more were made by Hall. The GE team used tungsten carbide anvils within a hydraulic press to squeeze the carbonaceous sample held in a catlinite container, the finished grit being squeezed out of the container into a gasket. The team recorded diamond synthesis on one occasion, but the experiment could not be reproduced because of uncertain synthesis conditions,[21] and the diamond was later shown to have been a natural diamond used as a seed.[22]\\r\\nHall achieved the first commercially successful synthesis of diamond on December 16, 1954, and this was announced on February 15, 1955. His breakthrough was using a \\"belt\\" press, which was capable of producing pressures above 10?GPa (1,500,000?psi) and temperatures above 2,000?C (3,630?F).[23] The press used a pyrophyllite container in which graphite was dissolved within molten nickel, cobalt or iron. Those metals acted as a \\"solvent-catalyst\\", which both dissolved carbon and accelerated its conversion into diamond. The largest diamond he produced was 0.15?mm (0.0059?in) across; it was too small and visually imperfect for jewelry, but usable in industrial abrasives. Hall's co-workers were able to replicate his work, and the discovery was published in the major journal Nature.[24][25] He was the first person to grow a synthetic diamond with a reproducible, verifiable and well-documented process. He left GE in 1955, and three years later developed a new apparatus for the synthesis of diamonda tetrahedral press with four anvilsto avoid violating a U.S. Department of Commerce secrecy order on the GE patent applications.[22][26] Hall received the American Chemical Society Award for Creative Invention for his work in diamond synthesis.[27]\\r\\nAn independent diamond synthesis was achieved on February 16, 1953 in Stockholm by ASEA (Allm?nna Svenska Elektriska Aktiebolaget), one of Sweden's major electrical manufacturing companies. Starting in 1949, ASEA employed a team of five scientists and engineers as part of a top-secret diamond-making project code-named QUINTUS. The team used a bulky split-sphere apparatus designed by Baltzar von Platen and Anders K?mpe.[20][28] Pressure was maintained within the device at an estimated 8.4?GPa for an hour. A few small diamonds were produced, but not of gem quality or size. The work was not reported until the 1980s.[29] During the 1980s, a new competitor emerged in Korea, a company named Iljin Diamond; it was followed by hundreds of Chinese enterprises. Iljin Diamond allegedly accomplished diamond synthesis in 1988 by misappropriating trade secrets from GE via a Korean former GE employee.[30][31]\\r\\nSynthetic gem-quality diamond crystals were first produced in 1970 by GE, then reported in 1971. The first successes used a pyrophyllite tube seeded at each end with thin pieces of diamond. The graphite feed material was placed in the center and the metal solvent (nickel) between the graphite and the seeds. The container was heated and the pressure was raised to about 5.5?GPa. The crystals grow as they flow from the center to the ends of the tube, and extending the length of the process produces larger crystals. Initially, a week-long growth process produced gem-quality stones of around 5?mm (1 carat or 0.2 g), and the process conditions had to be as stable as possible. The graphite feed was soon replaced by diamond grit because that allowed much better control of the shape of the final crystal.[25]\\r\\nThe first gem-quality stones were always yellow to brown in color because of contamination with nitrogen. Inclusions were common, especially \\"plate-like\\" ones from the nickel. Removing all nitrogen from the process by adding aluminium or titanium produced colorless \\"white\\" stones, and removing the nitrogen and adding boron produced blue ones.[32] Removing nitrogen also slowed the growth process and reduced the crystalline quality, so the process was normally run with nitrogen present.\\r\\nAlthough the GE stones and natural diamonds were chemically identical, their physical properties were not the same. The colorless stones produced strong fluorescence and phosphorescence under short-wavelength ultraviolet light, but were inert under long-wave UV. Among natural diamonds, only the rarer blue gems exhibit these properties. Unlike natural diamonds, all the GE stones showed strong yellow fluorescence under X-rays.[33] The De Beers Diamond Research Laboratory has grown stones of up to 25 carats (5.0?g) for research purposes. Stable HPHT conditions were kept for six weeks to grow high-quality diamonds of this size. For economic reasons, the growth of most synthetic diamonds is terminated when they reach a mass of 1 carat (200?mg) to 1.5 carats (300?mg).[34]\\r\\nIn the 1950s, research started in the Soviet Union and the US on the growth of diamond by pyrolysis of hydrocarbon gases at the relatively low temperature of 800?C. This low-pressure process is known as chemical vapor deposition (CVD). William G. Eversole reportedly achieved vapor deposition of diamond over diamond substrate in 1953, but it was not reported until 1962.[35] Diamond film deposition was independently reproduced by Angus and coworkers in 1968[36] and by Deryagin and Fedoseev in 1970.[37] Whereas Eversole and Angus used large, expensive, single-crystal diamonds as substrates, Deryagin and Fedoseev succeeded in making diamond films on non-diamond materials (silicon and metals), which led to massive research on inexpensive diamond coatings in the 1980s.[38]\\r\\nFrom 2013 reports emerged of a rise in undisclosed synthetic diamond melee being found in set jewelry and within diamond parcels sold in the trade.[39] Due to the relatively inexpensive cost of diamond melee, as well as relative lack of universal knowledge for identifying large quantities of melee[40] efficiently, not all dealers have made an effort to test diamond melee to correctly identify whether it is of natural or man-made origin. However, international laboratories are now beginning to tackle the issue head-on, with significant improvements in synthetic melee identification being made.[41]\\r\\nThere are several methods used to produce synthetic diamonds. The original method uses high pressure and high temperature (HPHT) and is still widely used because of its relatively low cost. The process involves large presses that can weigh hundreds of tons to produce a pressure of 5?GPa at 1500?C. The second method, using chemical vapor deposition (CVD), creates a carbon plasma over a substrate onto which the carbon atoms deposit to form diamond. Other methods include explosive formation (forming detonation nanodiamonds) and sonication of graphite solutions.[42][43][44]\\r\\nIn the HPHT method, there are three main press designs used to supply the pressure and temperature necessary to produce synthetic diamond: the belt press, the cubic press and the split-sphere (BARS) press. Diamond seeds are placed at the bottom of the press. The internal part of press is heated above 1400?C and melts the solvent metal. The molten metal dissolves the high purity carbon source, which is then transported to the small diamond seeds and precipitates, forming a large synthetic diamond.[45]\\r\\nThe original GE invention by Tracy Hall uses the belt press wherein the upper and lower anvils supply the pressure load to a cylindrical inner cell. This internal pressure is confined radially by a belt of pre-stressed steel bands. The anvils also serve as electrodes providing electric current to the compressed cell. A variation of the belt press uses hydraulic pressure, rather than steel belts, to confine the internal pressure.[45] Belt presses are still used today, but they are built on a much larger scale than those of the original design.[46]\\r\\nThe second type of press design is the cubic press. A cubic press has six anvils which provide pressure simultaneously onto all faces of a cube-shaped volume.[47] The first multi-anvil press design was a tetrahedral press, using four anvils to converge upon a tetrahedron-shaped volume.[48] The cubic press was created shortly thereafter to increase the volume to which pressure could be applied. A cubic press is typically smaller than a belt press and can more rapidly achieve the pressure and temperature necessary to create synthetic diamond. However, cubic presses cannot be easily scaled up to larger volumes: the pressurized volume can be increased by using larger anvils, but this also increases the amount of force needed on the anvils to achieve the same pressure. An alternative is to decrease the surface area to volume ratio of the pressurized volume, by using more anvils to converge upon a higher-order platonic solid, such as a dodecahedron. However, such a press would be complex and difficult to manufacture.[47]\\r\\nThe BARS apparatus is claimed to be the most compact, efficient, and economical of all the diamond-producing presses. In the center of a BARS device, there is a ceramic cylindrical \\"synthesis capsule\\" of about 2?cm3 in size. The cell is placed into a cube of pressure-transmitting material, such as pyrophyllite ceramics, which is pressed by inner anvils made from cemented carbide (e.g., tungsten carbide or VK10 hard alloy).[49] The outer octahedral cavity is pressed by 8 steel outer anvils. After mounting, the whole assembly is locked in a disc-type barrel with a diameter about 1 meter. The barrel is filled with oil, which pressurizes upon heating, and the oil pressure is transferred to the central cell. The synthesis capsule is heated up by a coaxial graphite heater and the temperature is measured with a thermocouple.[50]\\r\\nChemical vapor deposition is a method by which diamond can be grown from a hydrocarbon gas mixture. Since the early 1980s, this method has been the subject of intensive worldwide research. Whereas the mass-production of high-quality diamond crystals make the HPHT process the more suitable choice for industrial applications, the flexibility and simplicity of CVD setups explain the popularity of CVD growth in laboratory research. The advantages of CVD diamond growth include the ability to grow diamond over large areas and on various substrates, and the fine control over the chemical impurities and thus properties of the diamond produced. Unlike HPHT, CVD process does not require high pressures, as the growth typically occurs at pressures under 27 kPa.[42][51]\\r\\nThe CVD growth involves substrate preparation, feeding varying amounts of gases into a chamber and energizing them. The substrate preparation includes choosing an appropriate material and its crystallographic orientation; cleaning it, often with a diamond powder to abrade a non-diamond substrate; and optimizing the substrate temperature (about 800 C) during the growth through a series of test runs. The gases always include a carbon source, typically methane, and hydrogen with a typical ratio of 1:99. Hydrogen is essential because it selectively etches off non-diamond carbon. The gases are ionized into chemically active radicals in the growth chamber using microwave power, a hot filament, an arc discharge, a welding torch, a laser, an electron beam, or other means.\\r\\nDuring the growth, the chamber materials are etched off by the plasma and can incorporate into the growing diamond. In particular, CVD diamond is often contaminated by silicon originating from the silica windows of the growth chamber or from the silicon substrate.[52] Therefore, silica windows are either avoided or moved away from the substrate. Boron-containing species in the chamber, even at very low trace levels, also make it unsuitable for the growth of pure diamond.[42][51][53]\\r\\nDiamond nanocrystals (5?nm in diameter) can be formed by detonating certain carbon-containing explosives in a metal chamber. These nanocrystals are called \\"detonation nanodiamond\\". During the explosion, the pressure and temperature in the chamber become high enough to convert the carbon of the explosives into diamond. Being immersed in water, the chamber cools rapidly after the explosion, suppressing conversion of newly produced diamond into more stable graphite.[54] In a variation of this technique, a metal tube filled with graphite powder is placed in the detonation chamber. The explosion heats and compresses the graphite to an extent sufficient for its conversion into diamond.[55] The product is always rich in graphite and other non-diamond carbon forms and requires prolonged boiling in hot nitric acid (about 1 day at 250?C) to dissolve them.[43] The recovered nanodiamond powder is used primarily in polishing applications. It is mainly produced in China, Russia and Belarus and started reaching the market in bulk quantities by the early 2000s.[56]\\r\\nMicron-sized diamond crystals can be synthesized from a suspension of graphite in organic liquid at atmospheric pressure and room temperature using ultrasonic cavitation. The diamond yield is about 10% of the initial graphite weight. The estimated cost of diamond produced by this method is comparable to that of the HPHT method; the crystalline perfection of the product is significantly worse for the ultrasonic synthesis. This technique requires relatively simple equipment and procedures, but it has only been reported by two research groups, and has no industrial use as of 2012[update]. Numerous process parameters, such as preparation of the initial graphite powder, the choice of ultrasonic power, synthesis time and the solvent, are not yet optimized, leaving a window for potential improvement of the efficiency and reduction of the cost of the ultrasonic synthesis.[44][57]\\r\\nTraditionally, the absence of crystal flaws is considered to be the most important quality of a diamond. Purity and high crystalline perfection make diamonds transparent and clear, whereas its hardness, optical dispersion (luster) and chemical stability (combined with marketing), make it a popular gemstone. High thermal conductivity is also important for technical applications. Whereas high optical dispersion is an intrinsic property of all diamonds, their other properties vary depending on how the diamond was created.[58]\\r\\nDiamond can be one single, continuous crystal or it can be made up of many smaller crystals (polycrystal). Large, clear and transparent single-crystal diamonds are typically used in gemstones. Polycrystalline diamond (PCD) consists of numerous small grains, which are easily seen by the naked eye through strong light absorption and scattering; it is unsuitable for gems and is used for industrial applications such as mining and cutting tools. Polycrystalline diamond is often described by the average size (or grain size) of the crystals that make it up. Grain sizes range from nanometers to hundreds of micrometers, usually referred to as \\"nanocrystalline\\" and \\"microcrystalline\\" diamond, respectively.[59]\\r\\nSynthetic diamond is the hardest known material,[60] where hardness is defined as resistance to indentation. The hardness of synthetic diamond depends on its purity, crystalline perfection and orientation: hardness is higher for flawless, pure crystals oriented to the [111] direction (along the longest diagonal of the cubic diamond lattice).[61] Nanocrystalline diamond produced through CVD diamond growth can have a hardness ranging from 30% to 75% of that of single crystal diamond, and the hardness can be controlled for specific applications. Some synthetic single-crystal diamonds and HPHT nanocrystalline diamonds (see hyperdiamond) are harder than any known natural diamond.[60][62][63]\\r\\nEvery diamond contains atoms other than carbon in concentrations detectable by analytical techniques. Those atoms can aggregate into macroscopic phases called inclusions. Impurities are generally avoided, but can be introduced intentionally as a way to control certain properties of the diamond. Growth processes of synthetic diamond, using solvent-catalysts, generally lead to formation of a number of impurity-related complex centers, involving transition metal atoms (such as nickel, cobalt or iron), which affect the electronic properties of the material.[64][65]\\r\\nFor instance, pure diamond is an electrical insulator, but diamond with boron added is an electrical conductor (and, in some cases, a superconductor),[66] allowing it to be used in electronic applications. Nitrogen impurities hinder movement of lattice dislocations (defects within the crystal structure) and put the lattice under compressive stress, thereby increasing hardness and toughness.[67]\\r\\nUnlike most electrical insulators, pure diamond is a good conductor of heat because of the strong covalent bonding within the crystal. The thermal conductivity of pure diamond is the highest of any known solid. Single crystals of synthetic diamond enriched in 12C (99.9%), isotopically pure diamond, have the highest thermal conductivity of any material, 30 W/cm{K at room temperature, 7.5 times higher than copper. Natural diamond's conductivity is reduced by 1.1% by the 13C naturally present, which acts as an inhomogeneity in the lattice.[68]\\r\\nDiamond's thermal conductivity is made use of by jewelers and gemologists who may employ an electronic thermal probe to separate diamonds from their imitations. These probes consist of a pair of battery-powered thermistors mounted in a fine copper tip. One thermistor functions as a heating device while the other measures the temperature of the copper tip: if the stone being tested is a diamond, it will conduct the tip's thermal energy rapidly enough to produce a measurable temperature drop. This test takes about 2ÿ3 seconds.[69]\\r\\nMost industrial applications of synthetic diamond have long been associated with their hardness; this property makes diamond the ideal material for machine tools and cutting tools. As the hardest known naturally occurring material, diamond can be used to polish, cut, or wear away any material, including other diamonds. Common industrial applications of this ability include diamond-tipped drill bits and saws, and the use of diamond powder as an abrasive.[70] These are by far the largest industrial applications of synthetic diamond. While natural diamond is also used for these purposes, synthetic HPHT diamond is more popular, mostly because of better reproducibility of its mechanical properties. Diamond is not suitable for machining ferrous alloys at high speeds, as carbon is soluble in iron at the high temperatures created by high-speed machining, leading to greatly increased wear on diamond tools compared to alternatives.[71]\\r\\nThe usual form of diamond in cutting tools is micrometer-sized grains dispersed in a metal matrix (usually cobalt) sintered onto the tool. This is typically referred to in industry as polycrystalline diamond (PCD). PCD-tipped tools can be found in mining and cutting applications. For the past fifteen years, work has been done to coat metallic tools with CVD diamond, and though the work still shows promise it has not significantly replaced traditional PCD tools.[72]\\r\\nMost materials with high thermal conductivity are also electrically conductive, such as metals. In contrast, pure synthetic diamond has high thermal conductivity, but negligible electrical conductivity. This combination is invaluable for electronics where diamond is used as a heat sink for high-power laser diodes, laser arrays and high-power transistors. Efficient heat dissipation prolongs the lifetime of those electronic devices, and the devices' high replacement costs justify the use of efficient, though relatively expensive, diamond heat sinks.[73] In semiconductor technology, synthetic diamond heat spreaders prevent silicon and other semiconducting materials from overheating.[74]\\r\\nDiamond is hard, chemically inert, and has high thermal conductivity and a low coefficient of thermal expansion. These properties make diamond superior to any other existing window material used for transmitting infrared and microwave radiation. Therefore, synthetic diamond is starting to replace zinc selenide as the output window of high-power CO2 lasers[75] and gyrotrons. Those synthetic polycrystalline diamond windows are shaped as disks of large diameters (about 10?cm for gyrotrons) and small thicknesses (to reduce absorption) and can only be produced with the CVD technique.[76][77] Single crystal slabs of dimensions of length up to approximately 10?mm are becoming increasingly important in several areas of optics including heatspreaders inside laser cavities, diffractive optics and as the optical gain medium in Raman lasers.[78] Recent advances in the HPHT and CVD synthesis techniques have improved the purity and crystallographic structure perfection of single-crystalline diamond enough to replace silicon as a diffraction grating and window material in high-power radiation sources, such as synchrotrons.[79][80] Both the CVD and HPHT processes are also used to create designer optically transparent diamond anvils as a tool for measuring electric and magnetic properties of materials at ultra high pressures using a diamond anvil cell.[81]\\r\\nSynthetic diamond has potential uses as a semiconductor,[82] because it can be doped with impurities like boron and phosphorus. Since these elements contain one more or one less valence electron than carbon, they turn synthetic diamond into p-type or n-type semiconductor. Making a pÿn junction by sequential doping of synthetic diamond with boron and phosphorus produces light-emitting diodes (LEDs) producing UV light of 235?nm.[83] Another useful property of synthetic diamond for electronics is high carrier mobility, which reaches 4500?cm2/(V{s) for electrons in single-crystal CVD diamond.[84] High mobility is favourable for high-frequency operation and field-effect transistors made from diamond have already demonstrated promising high-frequency performance above 50?GHz.[85][86] The wide band gap of diamond (5.5 eV) gives it excellent dielectric properties. Combined with the high mechanical stability of diamond, those properties are being used in prototype high-power switches for power stations.[87]\\r\\nSynthetic diamond transistors have been produced in the laboratory. They are functional at much higher temperatures than silicon devices, and are resistant to chemical and radiation damage. While no diamond transistors have yet been successfully integrated into commercial electronics, they are promising for use in exceptionally high-power situations and hostile non-oxidizing environments.[88][89]\\r\\nSynthetic diamond is already used as radiation detection device. It is radiation hard and has a wide bandgap of 5.5 eV (at room temperature). Diamond is also distinguished from most other semiconductors by the lack of a stable native oxide. This makes it difficult to fabricate surface MOS devices, but it does create the potential for UV radiation to gain access to the active semiconductor without absorption in a surface layer. Because of these properties, it is employed in applications such as the BaBar detector at the Stanford Linear Accelerator[90] and BOLD (Blind to the Optical Light Detectors for VUV solar observations).[91][92] A diamond VUV detector recently was used in the European LYRA program.\\r\\nConductive CVD diamond is a useful electrode under many circumstances.[93] Photochemical methods have been developed for covalently linking DNA to the surface of polycrystalline diamond films produced through CVD. Such DNA modified films can be used for detecting various biomolecules, which would interact with DNA thereby changing electrical conductivity of the diamond film.[94] In addition, diamonds can be used to detect redox reactions that cannot ordinarily be studied and in some cases degrade redox-reactive organic contaminants in water supplies. Because diamond is mechanically and chemically stable, it can be used as an electrode under conditions that would destroy traditional materials. As an electrode, synthetic diamond can be used in waste water treatment of organic effluents[95] and the production of strong oxidants.[96]\\r\\nSynthetic diamonds for use as gemstones are grown by HPHT[34] or CVD[97] methods, and currently represent approximately 2% of the gem-quality diamond market.[98] However, there are indications that the market share of synthetic jewelry-quality diamonds may grow as advances in technology allows for larger higher-quality synthetic production on a more economic scale.[99] They are available in yellow and blue, and to a lesser extent colorless (or white). The yellow color comes from nitrogen impurities in the manufacturing process, while the blue color comes from boron.[32] Other colors, such as pink or green, are achievable after synthesis using irradiation.[100][101] Several companies also offer memorial diamonds grown using cremated remains.[102]\\r\\nGem-quality diamonds grown in a lab can be chemically, physically and optically identical to naturally occurring ones. The mined diamond industry has undertaken legal, marketing and distribution countermeasures to protect its market from the emerging presence of synthetic diamonds.[103][104] Synthetic diamonds can be distinguished by spectroscopy in the infrared, ultraviolet, or X-ray wavelengths. The DiamondView tester from De Beers uses UV fluorescence to detect trace impurities of nitrogen, nickel or other metals in HPHT or CVD diamonds.[105]\\r\\nAt least one maker of laboratory-grown diamonds has made public statements about being \\"committed to disclosure\\" of the nature of its diamonds, and laser-inscribes serial numbers on all of its gemstones.[97] The company web site shows an example of the lettering of one of its laser inscriptions, which includes both the words \\"Gemesis created\\" and the serial number prefix \\"LG\\" (laboratory grown).[106]\\r\\nIn May 2015, a record was set for an HPHT colorless diamond at 10.02 carats. The faceted jewel was cut from a 32.2-carat stone that was grown within 300 hours.[107]\\r\\nTraditional diamond mining has led to human-rights abuses in Africa and elsewhere. The 2006 Hollywood movie Blood Diamond helped to publicize the situation. Consumer demand for synthetic diamonds is increasing, albeit from a small base, as customers look for stones which are ethically sound, and are cheaper.[108]\\r\\nAccording to a report from the Gem & Jewellery Export Promotional Council, synthetic diamonds accounted for 0.28% of diamond produced for use as gem stones in 2014.[109] Lab diamond jewellery is sold in the United States by brands including Pure Grown Diamonds (formerly known as Gemesis) and Lab Diamonds Direct; and in the UK by Nightingale online jewellers.[110]\\r\\nAs of January?2017,[update] synthetic diamonds sold as jewelry were typically selling for 15ÿ20% less than natural equivalents, but the relative price is expected to decline further as production economics improve.[111]\\r\\nIn May 2018, De Beers introduced a new brand called \\"Lightbox\\" that are made with synthetic diamonds. The synthetic stones start at $200 for a quarter carat to $800 for full carat diamond. The new lab-grown diamond will retail for about one-tenth the cost of naturally occurring diamonds. The new brand will be sold starting in September 2018.

Arizona, 384 U.S. 436 (1966), was a landmark decision of the United States Supreme Court. In a 5ÿ4 majority, the Court held that both inculpatory and exculpatory statements made in response to interrogation by a defendant in police custody will be admissible at trial only if the prosecution can show that the defendant was informed of the right to consult with an attorney before and during questioning and of the right against self-incrimination before police questioning, and that the defendant not only understood these rights, but voluntarily waived them.\\r\\nThis case has a significant impact on law enforcement in the United States, by making what became known as the Miranda rights part of routine police procedure to ensure that suspects were informed of their rights. The Supreme Court decided Miranda with three other consolidated cases: Westover v. United States, Vignera v. New York, and California v. Stewart.\\r\\nThe Miranda warning (often shortened to \\"Miranda\\", or \\"Mirandizing\\" a suspect) is the name of the formal warning that is required to be given by law enforcement in the United States to criminal suspects in police custody (or in a custodial situation) before they are interrogated, in accordance with the Miranda ruling. Its purpose is to ensure the accused are aware of, and reminded of, these rights before questioning or actions that are reasonably likely to elicit an incriminating response.\\r\\nPer the U.S. Supreme Court decision Berghuis v. Thompkins (June 1, 2010), criminal suspects who are aware of their right to silence and to an attorney, but choose not to \\"unambiguously\\" invoke them, may find any subsequent voluntary statements treated as an implied waiver of their rights, and used as or as part of evidence. At least one scholar has argued that Thompkins effectively gutted Miranda.[1]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nDuring the 1960s, a movement which provided defendants with legal aid emerged from the collective efforts of various bar associations.\\r\\nIn the civil realm, it led to the creation of the Legal Services Corporation under the Great Society program of President Lyndon Baines Johnson. Escobedo v. Illinois, a case which closely foreshadowed Miranda, provided for the presence of counsel during police interrogation. This concept extended to a concern over police interrogation practices, which were considered by many[who?] to be barbaric and unjust. Coercive interrogation tactics were known in period slang as the \\"third degree\\".[citation needed]\\r\\nOn March 13, 1963, Ernesto Miranda was arrested, by the Phoenix Police Department, based on circumstantial evidence linking him to the kidnapping and rape of an eighteen-year-old woman ten days earlier.[2] After two hours of interrogation by police officers, Miranda signed a confession to the rape charge on forms that included the typed statement: \\"I do hereby swear that I make this statement voluntarily and of my own free will, with no threats, coercion, or promises of immunity, and with full knowledge of my legal rights, understanding any statement I make may be used against me.\\"[3]\\r\\nHowever, at no time was Miranda told of his right to counsel. Before being presented with the form on which he was asked to write out the confession he had already given orally, he was not advised of his right to remain silent, nor was he informed that his statements during the interrogation would be used against him. At trial, when prosecutors offered Miranda's written confession as evidence, his court-appointed lawyer, Alvin Moore, objected that because of these facts, the confession was not truly voluntary and should be excluded. Moore's objection was overruled and based on this confession and other evidence, Miranda was convicted of rape and kidnapping. He was sentenced to 20ÿ30 years of imprisonment on each charge, with sentences to run concurrently. Moore filed Miranda's appeal to the Arizona Supreme Court, claiming that Miranda's confession was not fully voluntary and should not have been admitted into the court proceedings. The Arizona Supreme Court affirmed the trial court's decision to admit the confession in State v. Miranda, 401 P.2d 721 (Ariz. 1965). In affirmation, the Arizona Supreme emphasized heavily the fact that Miranda did not specifically request an attorney.[4]\\r\\nAttorney John Paul Frank, former law clerk to Justice Hugo Black, represented Miranda in his appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court.[5]\\r\\nChief Justice Earl Warren, a former prosecutor, delivered the opinion of the Court[6], ruling that due to the coercive nature of the custodial interrogation by police (Warren cited several police training manuals which had not been provided in the arguments), no confession could be admissible under the Fifth Amendment self-incrimination clause and Sixth Amendment right to an attorney unless a suspect had been made aware of his rights and the suspect had then waived them:\\r\\nThe person in custody must, prior to interrogation, be clearly informed that he has the right to remain silent, and that anything he says will be used against him in court; he must be clearly informed that he has the right to consult with a lawyer and to have the lawyer with him during interrogation, and that, if he is indigent, a lawyer will be appointed to represent him.[7]\\r\\nThus, Miranda's conviction was overturned. The Court also made clear what had to happen if the suspect chose to exercise his or her rights:\\r\\nIf the individual indicates in any manner, at any time prior to or during questioning, that he wishes to remain silent, the interrogation must cease... If the individual states that he wants an attorney, the interrogation must cease until an attorney is present. At that time, the individual must have an opportunity to confer with the attorney and to have him present during any subsequent questioning.\\r\\nWarren pointed to the existing practice of the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) and the rules of the Uniform Code of Military Justice, both of which required notifying a suspect of his right to remain silent; the FBI warning included notice of the right to counsel.\\r\\nHowever, the dissenting justices accused the majority of overreacting to the problem of coercive interrogations, and anticipated a drastic effect. They believed that, once warned, suspects would always demand attorneys, and deny the police the ability to gain confessions.\\r\\nIn a separate concurrence in part, dissent in part, Justice Tom C. Clark argued that the Warren Court went \\"too far too fast\\". Instead, Justice Clark would use the \\"totality of the circumstances\\" test enunciated by Justice Goldberg in Haynes v. Washington. Under this test, the court would:\\r\\nconsider in each case whether the police officer prior to custodial interrogation added the warning that the suspect might have counsel present at the interrogation and, further, that a court would appoint one at his request if he was too poor to employ counsel. In the absence of warnings, the burden would be on the State to prove that counsel was knowingly and intelligently waived or that in the totality of the circumstances, including the failure to give the necessary warnings, the confession was clearly voluntary.\\r\\nIn dissent, Justice John Marshall Harlan II wrote that \\"nothing in the letter or the spirit of the Constitution or in the precedents squares with the heavy-handed and one-sided action that is so precipitously taken by the Court in the name of fulfilling its constitutional responsibilities\\". Harlan closed his remarks by quoting former Justice Robert H. Jackson: \\"This Court is forever adding new stories to the temples of constitutional law, and the temples have a way of collapsing when one story too many is added.\\"\\r\\nJustice Byron White took issue with the court announcing a new constitutional right when it had no \\"factual and textual bases\\" in the Constitution or previous opinions of the Court for the rule announced in the opinion. He stated: \\"The proposition that the privilege against self-incrimination forbids in-custody interrogation without the warnings specified in the majority opinion and without a clear waiver of counsel has no significant support in the history of the privilege or in the language of the Fifth Amendment.\\" Nor did Justice White believe it had any basis in English common law.\\r\\nWhite further warned of the dire consequences of the majority opinion:\\r\\nI have no desire whatsoever to share the responsibility for any such impact on the present criminal process.\\r\\nIn some unknown number of cases, the Court's rule will return a killer, a rapist or other criminal to the streets and to the environment which produced him, to repeat his crime whenever it pleases him. As a consequence, there will not be a gain, but a loss, in human dignity.\\r\\nMiranda was retried in 1967 after the original case against him was thrown out. This time the prosecution, instead of using the confession, introduced other evidence and called witnesses. One witness was Twila Hoffman, a woman with whom Miranda was living at the time of the offense; she testified that he had told her of committing the crime.[8][9] Miranda was convicted in 1967 and sentenced to serve 20 to 30 years.[9] The Supreme Court of Arizona affirmed,[10] and the United States Supreme Court denied review.[11] Miranda was paroled in 1972. After his release, he returned to his old neighborhood and made a modest living autographing police officers' \\"Miranda cards\\" which contained the text of the warning, for reading to arrestees. He was stabbed to death during an argument in a bar on January 31, 1976.[12] A suspect was arrested, but he, unlike Miranda, exercised his right to remain silent. With no evidence against him, he was released.[13]\\r\\nAnother three defendants whose cases had been tied in with Miranda's ÿ an armed robber, a stick-up man, and a bank robber ÿ either made plea bargains to lesser charges or were found guilty again despite the exclusion of their confessions.[14]\\r\\nThe Miranda decision was widely criticized when it came down, as many felt it was unfair to inform suspected criminals of their rights, as outlined in the decision. Richard Nixon and other conservatives denounced Miranda for undermining the efficiency of the police, and argued the ruling would contribute to an increase in crime. Nixon, upon becoming President, promised to appoint judges who would be \\"strict constructionists\\" and who would exercise judicial restraint. Many supporters of law enforcement were angered by the decision's negative view of police officers.[citation needed]\\r\\nAfter the Miranda decision, the nation's police departments were required to inform arrested persons or suspects of their rights under the ruling prior to custodial interrogation.[15] Such information is called a Miranda warning. Since it is usually required that the suspects be asked if they understand their rights, courts have also ruled that any subsequent waiver of Miranda rights must be knowing, intelligent, and voluntary.[16]\\r\\nMany American police departments have pre-printed Miranda waiver forms which a suspect must sign and date (after hearing and reading the warnings again) if an interrogation is to occur.[17][18]\\r\\nData from the FBI Uniform Crime Reports shows a sharp reduction in the clearance rate of violent and property crimes after Miranda.[19] However, according to other studies from the 1960s and 1970s, \\"contrary to popular belief, Miranda had little, if any, effect on detectives ability to solve crimes.\\"[9]\\r\\nThe federal Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act of 1968 purported to overrule Miranda for federal criminal cases and restore the \\"totality of the circumstances\\" test that had prevailed previous to Miranda.[20] The validity of this provision of the law, which is still codified at 18 U.S.C. ?3501, was not ruled on for another 30 years because the Justice Department never attempted to rely on it to support the introduction of a confession into evidence at any criminal trial.[citation needed]\\r\\nMiranda was undermined by several subsequent decisions which seemed to grant exceptions to the \\"Miranda warnings\\", challenging its claim to be a necessary corollary of the Fifth Amendment. The exceptions and developments that occurred over the years included:\\r\\nUnited States v. Garibay (1998) pointed out an important matter in regards to expansion of Miranda. Garibay barely spoke English and clearly showed a lack of understanding; indeed, \\"the agent admitted that he had to rephrase questions when the defendant appeared confused.\\"[22] The U.S. Court of Appeals ruled a \\"clear error\\" when the district court found that Garibay had \\"knowingly and intelligently waived his Miranda rights\\" due to the defendants low I.Q. and poor English language skills.[23] The court investigated many facets of his waiver and discovered that Mr. Garibay was missing all items that they were looking for: he never signed a waiver, he only received his warnings verbally and in English, and no interpreter was provided although they were available. With an opinion that stressed \\"the requirement that a defendant 'knowingly and intelligently' waive his Miranda rights\\", the Court reversed Garibay's conviction and remanded his case.[23]\\r\\nMiranda survived a strong challenge in Dickerson v. United States, 530 U.S. 428 (2000), where the validity of Congress's overruling of Miranda through ?3501 was tested. At issue was whether the Miranda warnings were actually compelled by the Constitution, or were rather merely measures enacted as a matter of judicial policy.[citation needed] In Dickerson, the Court, speaking through Chief Justice Rehnquist, upheld Miranda 7ÿ2 and stated that \\"the warnings have become part of our national culture\\". In dissent, Justice Scalia argued Miranda warnings were not constitutionally required. He cited several cases demonstrating a majority of the then-current court, counting himself, and Justices Kennedy, O'Connor, and Thomas, as well as the Chief Justice (who had just delivered a contrary opinion), \\"[were] on record as believing that a violation of Miranda is not a violation of the Constitution\\".[citation needed]\\r\\nOver time, interrogators began to think of techniques to honor the \\"letter\\" but not the \\"spirit\\" of Miranda. In the case of Missouri v. Seibert, 542 U.S. 600 (2004), the Supreme Court halted one of the more controversial practices. Missouri police were deliberately withholding Miranda warnings and questioning suspects until they obtained confessions, then giving the warnings, getting waivers, and getting confessions again. Justice Souter wrote for the plurality: \\"Strategists dedicated to draining the substance out of Miranda cannot accomplish by training instructions what Dickerson held Congress could not do by statute.\\"[24]\\r\\nBerghuis v. Thompkins (2010) is a ruling where the Supreme Court held that a suspect's \\"ambiguous or equivocal\\" statement or no statements do not mean that police must end an interrogation.[25] At least one scholar has argued that Thompkins effectively gutted Miranda. In The Right to Remain Silent, Charles Weisselberg wrote that \\"the majority in Thompkins rejected the fundamental underpinnings of Miranda v. Arizonas prophylactic rule and established a new one that fails to protect the rights of suspects\\" and that\\r\\nBut in Thompkins, neither Michigan nor the Solicitor General were able to cite any decision in which a court found that a suspect had given an implied waiver after lengthy questioning. Thompkins persevered for almost three hours before succumbing to his interrogators. In finding a waiver on these facts, Thompkins gives us an implied waiver doctrine on steroids.[1]","input":"What did the supreme court rule in miranda v. arizona (1966)?"},{"output":"within about 10 seconds after delivery","context":"At the end of pregnancy, the fetus must take the journey of childbirth to leave the reproductive mother. Upon its entry to the air-breathing world, the newborn must begin to adjust to life outside the uterus.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nPerfusing its body by breathing independently instead of utilizing placental oxygen delivered via the umbilical cord is the first challenge of a newborn. At birth, the baby's lungs are filled with lung liquid, which is distinct from amniotic fluid.[1] When the newborn is expelled from the birth canal, its central nervous system reacts to the sudden change in temperature and environment.[2] This triggers it to take the first breath, within about 10 seconds after delivery.[2] With the first breaths, there is a fall in pulmonary vascular resistance, and an increase in the surface area available for gas exchange. Over the next 30 seconds the pulmonary blood flow increases and is oxygenated as it flows through the alveoli of the lungs. Oxygenated blood now reaches the left atrium and ventricle, and through the descending aorta reaches the umbilical arteries. Oxygenated blood now stimulates constriction of the umbilical arteries resulting in a reduction in placental blood flow. As the pulmonary circulation increases there is an equivalent reduction in the placental blood flow which normally ceases completely after about three minutes. These two changes result in a rapid redirection of blood flow into the pulmonary vascular bed, from approximately 4% to 100% of cardiac output. The increase in pulmonary venous return results in left atrial pressure being slightly higher than right atrial pressure, which closes the foramen ovale. The flow pattern changes results in a drop in blood flow across the ductus arteriosus and the higher blood oxygen content of blood within the aorta stimulates the constriction and ultimately the closure of this fetal circulatory shunt.\\r\\nAll of these cardiovascular system changes result in the adaptation from fetal circulation patterns to an adult circulation pattern. During this transition, some types of congenital heart disease that were not symptomatic in utero during fetal circulation will present with cyanosis or respiratory signs.\\r\\nIt is common obstetric practice to intervene in these changes by applying a clamp to the umbilical cord, often within 20 seconds of birth, before transition has taken place. However delayed clamping (>1min) may have benefits in terms of iron status.[3]\\r\\nFollowing birth, the expression and re-uptake of surfactant, which begins to be produced by the fetus at 20 weeks gestation, is accelerated. Expression of surfactant into the alveoli is necessary to prevent alveolar closure (atelectasis). At this point, rhythmic breathing movements also commence. If there are any problems with breathing, management can include stimulation, bag and mask ventilation, intubation and ventilation. Cardiorespiratory monitoring is essential to keeping track of potential problems. Pharmacological therapy such as caffeine can also be given to treat apnea in premature newborns. A positive airway pressure should be maintained, and neonatal sepsis must be ruled out.\\r\\nPotential neonatal respiratory problems include apnea, transient tachypnea of the newborn (TTNB), respiratory distress syndrome (RDS), meconium aspiration syndrome (MAS), airway obstruction, and pneumonia.\\r\\nEnergy metabolism in the fetus must be converted from a continuous placental supply of glucose to intermittent feeding. While the fetus is dependent on maternal glucose as the main source of energy, it can use lactate, free-fatty acids, and ketone bodies under some conditions. Plasma glucose is maintained by glycogenolysis.\\r\\nGlycogen synthesis in the liver and muscle begins in the late second trimester of pregnancy, and storage is completed in the third trimester. Glycogen stores are maximal at term, but even then, the fetus only has enough glycogen available to meet energy needs for 8ÿ10 hours, which can be depleted even more quickly if demand is high. Newborns will then rely on gluconeogenesis for energy, which requires integration, and is normal at 2ÿ4 days of life.\\r\\nFat stores are the largest storage source of energy. At 27 weeks gestation, only 1% of a fetus' body weight is fat. At 40 weeks, that number increases to 16%. Inadequate available glucose substrate can lead to hypoglycemia, fetal growth restriction, preterm delivery, or other problems. Similarly, excess substrate can lead to problems, such as infant of a diabetic mother (IDM), hypothermia or neonatal sepsis.\\r\\nAnticipating potential problems is the key to managing most neonatal problems of energy metabolism. For example, early feeding in the delivery room or as soon as possible may prevent hypoglycemia. If the blood glucose is still low, then an intravenous (IV) bolus of glucose may be delivered, with continuous infusion if necessary. Rarely, steroids or glucagon may have to be employed.\\r\\nNewborns come from a warm environment to the cold and fluctuating temperatures of this world. They are naked, wet, and have a large surface-area-to-mass ratio, with variable amounts of insulation, limited metabolic reserves, and a decreased ability to shiver. Physiologic mechanisms for preserving core temperature include vasoconstriction (decrease blood flow to the skin), maintaining the fetal position (decrease the surface area exposed to the environment), jittery large muscle activity (generate muscular heat), and \\"non-shivering thermogenesis\\". The latter occurs in \\"brown fat\\" which is specialized adipose tissue with a high concentration of mitochondria designed to rapidly oxidize fatty acids in order to generate metabolic heat. The newborn capacity to maintain these mechanisms is limited, especially in premature infants. As such, it is not surprising that some newborns may have problems regulating their temperature. As early as the 1880s, infant incubators were used to help newborns maintain warmth, with humidified incubators being used as early as the 1930s.\\r\\nBasic techniques for keeping newborns warm include keeping them dry, wrapping them in blankets, giving them hats and clothing, or increasing the ambient temperature. More advanced techniques include incubators (at 36.5?C), humidity, heat shields, thermal blankets, double-walled incubators, and radiant warmers while the use of skin-to-skin \\"kangaroo care\\" interventions for low-birth-weight infants have started to spread worldwide after its use as a solution in developing countries.[4]","input":"When does a baby breathe on its own?"},{"output":"Certified Public Accountant","context":"Certified Public Accountant (CPA) is the title of qualified accountants in numerous countries in the English-speaking world. In the United States, the CPA is a license to provide accounting services directly to the public. It is awarded by each of the 50 states for practice in that state. Additionally, almost every state (49 out of 50) has passed mobility laws to allow CPAs from other states to practice in their state. State licensing requirements vary, but the minimum standard requirements include passing the Uniform Certified Public Accountant Examination, 150 semester units of college education, and one year of accounting related experience.\\r\\nContinuing professional education (CPE) is also required to maintain licensure. Individuals who have been awarded the CPA but have lapsed in the fulfillment of the required CPE or have requested to be converted to inactive status are in many states permitted to use the designation \\"CPA Inactive\\" or an equivalent phrase. In most U.S. states, only CPAs are legally able to provide to the public attestation (including auditing) opinions on financial statements. Many CPAs are members of the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants and their state CPA society.\\r\\nState laws vary widely regarding whether a non-CPA is even allowed to use the title accountant. To illustrate, Texas prohibits the use of the designations \\"accountant\\" and \\"auditor\\" by a person not certified as a Texas CPA, unless that person is a CPA in another state, is a non-resident of Texas, and otherwise meets the requirements for practice in Texas by out-of-state CPA firms and practitioners.[1]\\r\\nMany other countries also use the title CPA to designate local public accountants.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe primary functions performed by CPAs relate to assurance services. In assurance services, also known as financial audit services, CPAs attest to the reasonableness of disclosures, the freedom from material misstatement, and the adherence to the applicable generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) in financial statements. CPAs can also be employed by corporationstermed \\"the private sector\\"in finance functions such as Chief Financial Officer (CFO) or finance manager, or as CEOs subject to their full business knowledge and practice. These CPAs do not provide services directly to the public.\\r\\nAlthough some CPA firms serve as business consultants, the consulting role has been under scrutiny following the Enron scandal where Arthur Andersen simultaneously provided audit and consulting services which affected their ability to maintain independence in their audit duties. This incident resulted in many accounting firms divesting in their consulting divisions, but this trend has since reversed. In audit engagements, CPAs are (and have always been) required by professional standards and Federal and State laws to maintain independence (both in fact and in appearance) from the entity for which they are conducting an attestation (audit and review) engagement. However, most individual CPAs who work as consultants do not also work as auditors.\\r\\nCPAs also have a niche within the income tax return preparation industry. Many small to mid-sized firms have both a tax and an auditing department. Along with attorneys and Enrolled Agents, CPAs may represent taxpayers in matters before the Internal Revenue Service. However, the Enrolled Agent designation is given by the IRS and does not grant someone a license to offer tax or other accounting services as licences to offer accounting services are granted by the states and the IRS has no authority to regulate tax preparers.[2]\\r\\nWhether providing services directly to the public or employed by corporations or associations, CPAs can operate in virtually any area of finance including:\\r\\nTo become a CPA in the United States, the candidate must sit for and pass the Uniform Certified Public Accountant Examination (Uniform CPA Exam), which is set by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants (AICPA) and administered by the National Association of State Boards of Accountancy (NASBA). The CPA designation was first established in law in New York State on April 17, 1896.[3]\\r\\nEligibility to sit for the Uniform CPA Exam is determined by individual state boards of accountancy. Many states have adopted what is known as the \\"150 hour rule\\" (150 college semester units or the equivalent), which usually requires an additional year of education past a regular 4 year college degree, or a master's degree. (As such, universities commonly offer combined 5-year bachelor's/master's degree programs, allowing a student to earn both degrees while receiving the 150 hours needed for exam eligibility.)\\r\\nThe Uniform CPA Exam tests general principles of state law such as the laws of contracts and agency (questions not tailored to the variances of any particular state) and some federal laws as well.[4]\\r\\nAlthough the CPA exam is uniform, licensing and certification requirements are imposed separately by each state's laws and therefore vary from state to state.\\r\\nState requirements for the CPA qualification can be summed up as the Three EsEducation, Examination and Experience. The education requirement normally must be fulfilled as part of the eligibility criteria to sit for the Uniform CPA Exam. The examination component is the Uniform CPA Exam itself. Some states have a two-tier system whereby an individual would first become certifiedusually by passing the Uniform CPA Exam. That individual would then later be eligible to be licensed once a certain amount of work experience is accomplished. Other states have a one-tier system whereby an individual would be certified and licensed at the same time when both the CPA exam is passed and the work experience requirement has been met.\\r\\nTwo-tier states include Alabama, Florida, Illinois, Montana, and Nebraska. The trend is for two-tier states to gradually move towards a one-tier system. Since 2002, the state boards of accountancy in Washington and South Dakota have ceased issuing CPA \\"certificates\\" and instead issue CPA \\"licenses.\\" Illinois planned to follow suit in 2012.[5]\\r\\nA number of states are two-tiered, but require work experience for the CPA certificate, such as Ohio.\\r\\nThe experience component varies from state to state:\\r\\nOver 40 of the state boards now require applicants for CPA status to complete a special examination on ethics, which is effectively a fifth exam in terms of requirements to become a CPA. The majority of these accept the AICPA self-study Professional Ethics for CPAs CPE course or another course in general professional ethics. Many states, however, require that the ethics course include a review of that state's specific rules for professional practice.\\r\\nLike other professionals, CPAs are required to take continuing education courses toward continuing professional development (continuing professional education [CPE]) to renew their license. Requirements vary by state (Wisconsin does not require any CPE for CPAs[6][7]) but the vast majority require an average of 40 hours of CPE every year with a minimum of 20 hours per calendar year. The requirement can be fulfilled through attending live seminars, webcast seminars, or through self-study (textbooks, videos, online courses, all of which require a test to receive credit).[8] In general, state boards accept group live and group internet-based credits for all credit requirements, while some states cap the number of credits obtained through the self-study format. All CPAs are encouraged to periodically review their state requirements.[9] As part of the CPE requirement, most states require their CPAs to take an ethics course at some frequency (such as every or every other renewal period). Ethics requirements vary by state and the courses range from 2ÿ8 hours. AICPA guidelines grant licensees 1 hour of CPE credit for every 50 minutes of instruction.[10][11]\\r\\nA CPA license may be suspended or revoked for various reasons. Common reasons include these:\\r\\nMany states had (although a few still do) a second tier of accountant qualification in addition to that of CPA, usually entitled \\"Public Accountant\\" or \\"Licensed Public Accountant\\" (with designatory letters \\"PA\\" or \\"LPA\\"), although other titles have included \\"Registered Public Accountant\\" (RPA), \\"Accounting Practitioner\\" (AP), and \\"Registered Accounting Practitioner\\" (RAP). Such designations served to help regulate the practice of public accounting in that state by grandfathering through licensure non-CPA accountants who were already practicing public accounting before a regulatory state accountancy law was enacted. The majority of states have closed the designation \\"Public Accountant\\" (PA) to new entrants, with only five states continuing to offer the designation. Many PAs belong to the National Society of Accountants.\\r\\nMany states prohibit the use of the designations \\"Public Accountant\\" or \\"Licensed Public Accountant\\" (or the abbreviations \\"PA\\" or \\"LPA\\") by a person who is not certified as a PA in that state.\\r\\nIn Australia the designation \\"Public Accountant\\" is used by members of the Institute of Public Accountants of Australia.\\r\\nAn accountant is required to meet the legal requirements of any state in which the accountant wishes to practice.\\r\\nIn recent years, practice mobility for CPAs has become a major business concern for CPAs and their clients. Practice mobility for CPAs is the general ability of a licensee in good standing from a substantially equivalent state to gain practice privilege outside of their home state without getting an additional license in the state where the CPA will serve a client or an employer. In todays digital age, many organizations requiring the professional services of CPAs conduct business on an interstate and international basis and have compliance responsibilities in multiple jurisdictions. As a result, the practice of CPAs often extends across state lines and international boundaries.[13]\\r\\nDiffering requirements for CPA certification, reciprocity, temporary practice and other aspects of state accountancy legislation in the 55 U.S. licensing jurisdictions (the 50 states, Puerto Rico, the District of Columbia, the U.S. Virgin Islands, Guam and the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands) make the interstate practice and mobility of CPAs more complicated. By removing boundaries to practice in the U.S., CPAs are able to more readily serve individuals and businesses in need of their expertise. At the same time, the state board of accountancys ability to discipline is enhanced by being based on a CPA and the CPA firms performance of services (either physically, electronically or otherwise within a state), rather than being based on whether a state license is held.[13]\\r\\nThe American Institute of Certified Public Accountants (AICPA) and the National Association of State Boards of Accountancy (NASBA) have analyzed the current system for gaining practice privileges across state lines and have endorsed a uniform mobility system. This model approach is detailed through the substantial equivalency provision (Section 23) of the Uniform Accountancy Act (UAA). The UAA is an \\"evergreen\\" model licensing law co-developed, maintained, reviewed and updated by the AICPA and NASBA. The model provides a uniform approach to regulation of the accounting profession.[13]\\r\\nUnder Section 23 of the UAA, a CPA with a license in good standing from a jurisdiction with CPA licensing requirements essentially equivalent to those outlined in the UAA is deemed to be substantially equivalent, or a licensee who individually meets the requirements of:\\r\\nUniform adoption of the UAAs substantial equivalency provision creates a system similar to the nations drivers license program by providing CPAs with mobility while retaining and strengthening state boards ability to protect the public interest. The system enables consumers to receive timely services from the CPA best suited to the job, regardless of location, and without the hindrances of unnecessary filings, forms and increased costs that do not protect the public interest.[13]\\r\\nAs of October 2012, a total of 49 out of the 50 states and the District of Columbia have passed mobility laws and are now in the implementation and navigation phases.[14] Only the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands, the Virgin Islands, Hawaii, Puerto Rico and Guam have not passed mobility laws. On September 20, California Governor Jerry Brown signed legislation that permits cross-border mobility for CPAs. The law went into effect July 1, 2013.[15] The District of Columbia passed mobility laws that went into effect on October 1, 2012.[16]\\r\\nThe CPA designation is granted by individual state boards, not the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants (AICPA). Membership in the AICPA is not obligatory for CPAs, although some CPAs do join. To become a full member of AICPA, the applicant must hold a valid CPA certificate or license from at least one of the fifty-five U.S. state/territory boards of accountancy; some additional requirements apply.\\r\\nAICPA members approved a proposed bylaw amendment to make eligible for voting membership individuals who previously held a CPA[17] certificate/license or have met all the requirements for CPA certification in accordance with the Uniform Accountancy Act (UAA). The AICPA announced its plan to accept applications from individuals meeting these criteria, beginning no later than January 1, 2011.\\r\\nCPAs may also choose to become members of their local state association or society (also optional). Benefits of membership in a state CPA association range from deep discounts on seminars that qualify for continuing education credits to protecting the public and profession's interests by tracking and lobbying legislative issues that affect local state tax and financial planning issues.\\r\\nCPAs who maintain state CPA society memberships are required to follow a society professional code of conduct (in addition to any code enforced by the state regulatory authority), further reassuring clients that the CPA is an ethical business professional conducting a legitimate business who can be trusted to handle confidential personal and business financial matters. State CPA associations also serve the community by providing information and resources about the CPA profession and welcome inquiries from students, business professionals and the public-at-large.\\r\\nCPAs are not normally restricted to membership in the state CPA society in which they reside or hold a license or certificate. Many CPAs who live near state borders or who hold CPA status in more than one state may join more than one state CPA society.\\r\\nState Associations","input":"What does it mean to be a cpa?"},{"output":"setting of academic standards for law schools","context":"The American Bar Association (ABA), founded August 21, 1878,[2] is a voluntary bar association of lawyers and law students, which is not specific to any jurisdiction in the United States.

Specifically, in most U.S. jurisdictions, graduation from an ABA-accredited law school is prerequisite towards being allowed to sit for that state's bar exam, and even for existing lawyers to be admitted to the bar of another state upon motion.[13] Even states which recognize unaccredited schools within their borders will generally not recognize such schools from other jurisdictions for purposes of bar admission.[14]\\r\\nFor law students attending ABA-accredited schools, memberships are available for free.[15] Students attending non-ABA accredited law schools are permitted to join the ABA as associate members.[16]\\r\\nIn June 2009, the ABA Journal reported that the ABA had been working \\"for months\\" to change its accreditation standard, where accreditation will be the result of what kind of lawyer an ABA law school produces as opposed to \\"input\\" measures such as faculty size, budget and physical plant.[17]\\r\\nIn 2012 a non-profit organization called Law School Transparency called upon the ABA to provide meaningful statistics regarding the employment prospects and salary information of graduates of ABA accredited institutions.[18][19][20] On October 17, 2011, the ABA announced it was considering penalties, including loss of accreditation for schools that misreported their graduates employment data.[21] Starting with the Class of 2011, ABA-accredited law schools were required to file Standard 509 Information Reports that included a host of data, ranging from LSAT scores of law students to bar passage rates of graduates. Employment information was filed separately to the Section. On December 12, 2011, despite the ongoing controversy surrounding law school accreditation standards and inability of law school graduates to effectively service their educational debt, the ABA approved another law school.[22]\\r\\nIn 1995 the United States Department of Justice accused the ABA of violating Section 1 of the Sherman Act in its law school accreditation proceedings.

It meets three times a year and is headquartered in Washington, D.C.[27]\\r\\nIn 1991, the Commission on Homelessness & Poverty was established by the Board of Governors of the ABA.[28] The Commission is charged with:\\r\\nThese tasks are carried out by thirteen volunteer members appointed by the ABA President and a staff attorney.\\r\\nThe ABA's Commission on Sexual Orientation and Gender Identity was established in 2007.[29] According to its website, the Commission is \\"leading the ABAs commitment to diversity, inclusion and full and equal participation by lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender persons in the Association, the legal profession and society.\\" [30]\\r\\nThe ABA's Commission on Women in the Profession was established in 1987.[31] Hillary Clinton was its first chair.[31] According to its website, the Commission \\"forges a new and better profession that ensures that women have equal opportunities for professional growth and advancement commensurate with their male counterparts.\\" [32] In 2017, the Commission released A Current Glance at Women in the Law, providing research about the status of women in the American legal profession.[33] Some key points of the ABA's 2017 study:\\r\\nIn 2011, the ABA's House of Delegates passed an anti-bullying resolution that included sexual orientation and gender identity among characteristics that should be protected, along with race, religion, national origin, sex, and disability.[29][35]\\r\\nAt the 2013 annual meeting, the ABA's House of Delegates passed a resolution that made it harder for criminal defense lawyers to use the LGBT panic defense, which argues that a crime victims sexual orientation should mitigate the defendant's guilt.[29]\\r\\nAt the 2014 annual meeting, the ABA passed Resolution 114B, which stated that \\"lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) people have a human right to be free from discrimination, threats, and violence based on their LGBT status,\\" and called on the governments of countries where such discriminatory laws exist to repeal them.[29]\\r\\nIn 1989 the ABA's House of Delegates adopted a resolution stating that \\"the American Bar Association and each of its entities should use gender-neutral language in all documents establishing policy and procedure.\\" [36]\\r\\nA hearing in 2009 heard testimony from the ABA which stated that \\"Sentencing by mandatory minimums is the antithesis of rational sentencing policy\\".[37] In 2004 the association called for the repeal of mandatory minimum sentences, stating that \\"there is no need for mandatory minimum sentences in a guided sentencing system.\\"[38]\\r\\nIn July 2006, an ABA task force under then President Michael S. Greco released a report that concluded that George W. Bush's use of \\"signing statements\\" violates the Constitution.[39] These are documents attached by the President when signing bills, in which the President states that he or she will enforce the new law only to the extent that he or she feels the law conforms to the proper interpretation of the Constitution.[40]\\r\\nAt the 2010 annual meeting, the ABA passed Resolution 111 urging every state, territorial, and tribal government to eliminate legal barriers to civil marriage between two persons of the same sex who are otherwise eligible to marry.[41][42]\\r\\nFor decades, the ABA has participated in the federal judicial nomination process by vetting nominees and giving them a rating ranging from \\"not qualified\\" to \\"well qualified\\". According to a compendium of those ratings, the ABA's Committee on the Federal Judiciary began rating Supreme Court nominees in 1956, but: \\"At various points in its history, the committee altered its ratings categories, making comparisons across time difficult.\\"[43]\\r\\nThe committee consists of two members from the ninth judicial circuit, one member from each of the other federal judicial circuits and the chair of the committee. The ABA's Board of Governors, House of Delegates and officers are not involved with the work of the committee, and it is completely insulated from the rest of the ABA's activities, including its policies. Although the committee rates prospective nominees, it does not propose, recommend or endorse candidates for nomination to the federal judiciary, as that would compromise its independent evaluative function.\\r\\nThe committee focuses solely on integrity, professional competence and judicial temperament; does not consider a prospective nominee's philosophy, political affiliation or ideology; and works in strictly enforced confidentiality, typically evaluating around 60 nominees per year. Nominees are rated as \\"well qualified\\", \\"qualified\\" or \\"not qualified\\". If the president selects a prospective nominee, the committee chair notifies the White House, the Department of Justice, the members of the Senate Judiciary Committee and the nominee of the committee's rating.\\r\\nThere are several procedural differences between the committee's investigations of Supreme Court nominees and those of lower courts, notably that investigations of Supreme Court nominees are conducted after the president has submitted a nomination. Also, there is added scrutiny with Supreme Court nominees, such as teams of law professors examining the legal writings of the prospective justice.[44]\\r\\nThe process has been alleged by some (including the Federalist Society) to have a liberal bias.[45][46][47] For example, the ABA gave Ronald Reagan's judicial nominees Richard Posner and Frank H. Easterbrook low \\"qualified/not qualified\\" ratings; later, the ABA gave Bill Clinton judicial nominees with similar resumes \\"well qualified\\" ratings.[48] Meanwhile, Judges Posner and Easterbrook have gone on to become the two most highly cited judges in the federal appellate judiciary.[49]\\r\\nIn 2001, the George W. Bush administration announced that it would cease cooperating with the ABA in advance of judicial nominations. The ABA continues to rate nominees. In 2005, the ABA gave John Roberts, George W. Bush's nomination for Chief Justice of the United States, a unanimous \\"well-qualified\\" rating. It also gave a unanimous \\"well qualified\\" rating to appellate court nominee Miguel Estrada, who never took his seat because his nomination was filibustered. However, it gave only a \\"qualified/not-qualified\\" rating to nominee Janice Rogers Brown.[50] In 2006, the ABA gave a unanimous \\"well-qualified\\" rating to Judge Samuel Alito, Bush's appointee for Sandra Day O'Connor's Associate Justice position.\\r\\nHowever, conservative Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr., conservative Justice Samuel Alito, liberal Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, liberal Justice Elena Kagan, and conservative Justice Neil Gorsuch all received the same \\"well qualified\\" rating.[51][52]\\r\\nThe ABA has been criticized for racism.[53] In 1925, African-American lawyers formed the National Bar Association at a time when ABA would not allow them to be members.\\r\\nSince the 1960s, the ABA has increased the diversity of its membership and leadership.[citation needed] Dennis Archer, who served as ABA president from 2003 to 2004, was the first African-American to hold the position, while Paulette Brown, 2015ÿ2016, was the associations first president who is a woman of color. Steve Zack, whose term was in 2010 and 2011, was the first Cuban American to hold the American Bar Associations presidency.\\r\\nIn 2016, for the first time, the ABA has an all-female roster of officers, including two African-Americans and one Native American: Linda A. Klein (president), Hilarie Bass (president-elect), Deborah Enix-Ross (chair of the House of Delegates), Mary L. Smith (secretary), Michelle A. Behnke (treasurer) and Paulette Brown (immediate past president).\\r\\nIn recent years, the ABA has also drawn some criticism, mainly from the conservative side of the political spectrum, for taking positions on controversial public policy topics such as abortion, gun control, and same-sex marriage.[54] The ABA's official position in favor of abortion rights led to the formation of a (much smaller) alternative organization for lawyers, the National Lawyers Association. The Federalist Society sponsors a twice-a-year publication called \\"ABA Watch\\" that reports on the political activities of the ABA (although as of September 2017 the Federalist Society's website does not show issues of \\"ABA Watch\\" more recent than 2014[55]).\\r\\nThere are heated debates over requirements placed on law schools by the ABA. Many states and practitioners believe ABA requirements to be unnecessary, costly, outdated and lacking innovation.[56] Some legal professionals and academics feel these requirements promote the rising cost of tuition.\\r\\nThe more recent collision of attorney layoffs in 2009,[57][58] the glut of fresh non top-tier law graduates without work,[59] and the continued expansion of law schools[60] have raised questions on whether the ABA has been too lenient in its accreditation process.\\r\\nSince 2014, the ABA has required law schools to disclose more information about their applicants and graduates. Required information now includes such information as admissions data, tuition and fees, living costs, conditional scholarships, enrollment data, numbers of fulltime and parttime faculty, class sizes for firstyear and upperclass courses, employment outcomes and bar passage data. The 205 ABA-approved law schools reported that, 10 months after graduation, 28,029 graduates of the class of 2015, or 70 percent, were employed in long-term, full-time positions where bar passage is required or a J.D. is preferred.\\r\\nEach year in August, the ABA holds an annual meeting in different cities that consists of speeches, CLE classes, gatherings, and the ABA EXPO.[66] At the meeting, the recipient of the association's highest honor, the American Bar Association Medal, is announced.\\r\\n Media related to American Bar Association at Wikimedia Commons","input":"What is the purpose of the american bar association?"},{"output":"Paris, France","context":"A hot air balloon is a lighter-than-air aircraft consisting of a bag, called an envelope, which contains heated air. Suspended beneath is a gondola or wicker basket (in some long-distance or high-altitude balloons, a capsule), which carries passengers and a source of heat, in most cases an open flame caused by burning liquid propane. The heated air inside the envelope makes it buoyant since it has a lower density than the colder air outside the envelope. As with all aircraft, hot air balloons cannot fly beyond the atmosphere. Unlike gas balloons, the envelope does not have to be sealed at the bottom, since the air near the bottom of the envelope is at the same pressure as the surrounding air. In modern sport balloons the envelope is generally made from nylon fabric and the inlet of the balloon (closest to the burner flame) is made from a fire resistant material such as Nomex. Modern balloons have been made in all kinds of shapes, such as rocket ships and the shapes of various commercial products, though the traditional shape is used for most non-commercial, and many commercial, applications.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe hot air balloon is the first successful human-carrying flight technology. The first untethered manned hot air balloon flight was performed by Jean-Fran?ois Pilatre de Rozier and Fran?ois Laurent d'Arlandes on November 21, 1783, in Paris, France,[1] in a balloon created by the Montgolfier brothers.[2] The first hot-air balloon flown in the Americas was launched from the Walnut Street Jail in Philadelphia on January 9, 1793 by the French aeronaut Jean Pierre Blanchard.[3] Hot air balloons that can be propelled through the air rather than simply drifting with the wind are known as thermal airships.\\r\\n\\r\\nEarly unmanned hot air balloons were used in China. Zhuge Liang of the Shu Han kingdom, during the Three Kingdoms era (220ÿ280 AD), used airborne lanterns for military signaling. These lanterns are known Chinese lanterns (simplified Chinese: ^]; traditional Chinese: ^]??).[4]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the 18th century the Brazilian Jesuit priest Bartolomeu de Gusm?o envisioned an aerial apparatus called Passarola which was the predecessor of the hot air ballon. The purpose of Passarola was to serve as air vessel in order to facilitate communication and as a strategical device[5]. In 1709 John V of Portugal decided to fund Bartolomeu de Gusm?o's project following a petition made by the jesuit priest [6] and an unmanned demonstration was performed at Casa da India in presence of John V, the queen Maria Anna of Austria, having as witnesses the Italian cardinal Michelangelo Conti, two members of the Portuguese Royal Academy of History, one Portuguese diplomat and one chronicler. This event would bring some European attention to this event and this project. A later article dated on October 20, 1786 by the London Daily Universal Register would state that the inventor was able to raise himself by the use of his prototype. Also in 1709, the Portuguese jesuit wrote Manifesto summrio para os que ignoram poderse navegar pelo elemento do ar (Short Manifesto for those who are unaware that is possible to sail through the element air). Persecuted by the Inquisition, he was prevented from continuing his research; however, he left designs for a manned air vessel.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe French brothers Joseph-Michel and Jacques-tienne Montgolfier developed a hot air balloon in Annonay, Ardeche, France, and demonstrated it publicly on September 19, 1783, making an unmanned flight lasting 10 minutes. After experimenting with unmanned balloons and flights with animals, the first balloon flight with humans aboard, a tethered flight, performed on or around October 15, 1783, by Jean-Francois Pilatre de Rozier who made at least one tethered flight from the yard of the Reveillon workshop in the Faubourg Saint-Antoine. Later that same day, Pilatre de Rozier became the second human to ascend into the air, reaching an altitude of 26?m (85?ft), the length of the tether.[7][8]  The first free flight with human passengers was made a few weeks later, on November 21, 1783.[9] King Louis XVI had originally decreed that condemned criminals would be the first pilots, but de Rozier, along with Marquis Fran?ois d'Arlandes, petitioned successfully for the honor.[10][11][12]\\r\\nThe first military use of a hot air balloon happened in 1794 during the battle of Fleurus, when the French used the balloon l'Entreprenant for observation.[13]\\r\\n\\r\\nModern hot air balloons, with an onboard heat source, were developed by Ed Yost, beginning during the 1950s; his work resulted in his first successful flight, on October 22, 1960.[14] The first modern hot air balloon to be made in the United Kingdom (UK) was the Bristol Belle, built in 1967. Presently, hot air balloons are used primarily for recreation. Hot air balloons are able to fly to extremely high altitudes. On November 26, 2005 Vijaypat Singhania set the world altitude record for highest hot air balloon flight, reaching 21,027?m (68,986?ft). He took off from downtown Mumbai, India, and landed 240?km (150?mi) south in Panchale.[15] The previous record of 19,811?m (64,997?ft) had been set by Per Lindstrand on June 6, 1988, in Plano, Texas.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn January 15, 1991, the 'Virgin Pacific Flyer' balloon completed the longest flight in a hot air balloon when Per Lindstrand (born in Sweden, but resident in the UK) and Richard Branson of the UK flew 7,671.91?km (4,767.10?mi) from Japan to Northern Canada. With a volume of 74 thousand cubic meters (2.6 million cubic feet), the balloon envelope was the largest ever built for a hot air craft. Designed to fly in the trans-oceanic jet streams, the Pacific Flyer recorded the fastest ground speed for a manned balloon at 245?mph (394?km/h). The longest duration record was set by Swiss psychiatrist Bertrand Piccard, Auguste Piccard's grandson; and Briton Brian Jones, flying in the Breitling Orbiter 3. It was the first nonstop trip around the world by balloon. The balloon left Chateau-d'Oex, Switzerland, on March 1, 1999, and landed at 1:02?a.m. on March 21 in the Egyptian desert 300 miles (480?km) south of Cairo. The two men exceeded distance, endurance, and time records, traveling 19 days, 21 hours, and 55 minutes. Steve Fossett, flying solo, exceeded the record for briefest time traveling around the world on 3 July 2002 on his sixth attempt,[16] in 320 h 33 min.[17] Fedor Konyukhov flew solo round the world on his first attempt in a hybrid hot-air/helium balloon from 11 to 23 July 2016[18] for a round-the world time of 272h 11m, as of  17?September?2016[update] awaiting official confirmation as the new record.[17]\\r\\n\\r\\nA hot air balloon for manned flight uses a single-layered, fabric gas bag (lifting \\"envelope\\"), with an opening at the bottom called the mouth or throat. Attached to the envelope is a basket, or gondola, for carrying the passengers. Mounted above the basket and centered in the mouth is the \\"burner\\", which injects a flame into the envelope, heating the air within. The heater or burner is fueled by propane, a liquefied gas stored in pressure vessels, similar to high pressure forklift cylinders.[19][20]\\r\\n\\r\\nModern hot air balloons are usually made of materials such as ripstop nylon or dacron (a polyester).[21]\\r\\n\\r\\nDuring the manufacturing process, the material is cut into panels and sewn together, along with structural load tapes that carry the weight of the gondola or basket. The individual sections, which extend from the throat to the crown (top) of the envelope, are known as gores or gore sections. Envelopes can have as few as 4 gores or as many as 24 or more.[22]\\r\\n\\r\\nEnvelopes often have a crown ring at their very top. This is a hoop of smooth metal, usually aluminium, and approximately 1?ft (0.30?m) in diameter. Vertical load tapes from the envelope are attached to the crown ring.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt the bottom of the envelope the vertical load tapes are sewn into loops that are connected to cables (one cable per load tape). These cables, often referred to as flying wires, are connected to the basket by carabiners.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe most common technique for sewing panels together is called the French felled, French fell, or double lap seam.[23][24][25][26] The two pieces of fabric are folded over on each other at their common edge, possibly with a load tape as well, and sewn together with two rows of parallel stitching. Other methods include a flat lap seam, in which the two pieces of fabric are held together simply with two rows of parallel stitching, and a zigzag, where parallel zigzag stitching holds a double lap of fabric.[25]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe fabric (or at least part of it, the top 1/3 for example) may be coated with a sealer, such as silicone or polyurethane, to make it impermeable to air.[27] It is often the degradation of this coating and the corresponding loss of impermeability that ends the effective life of an envelope, not weakening of the fabric itself. Heat, moisture, and mechanical wear-and-tear during set-up and pack-up are the primary causes of degradation. Once an envelope becomes too porous to fly, it may be retired and discarded or perhaps used as a 'rag bag': cold inflated and opened for children to run through. Products for recoating the fabric are becoming available commercially.[28]\\r\\n\\r\\nA range of envelope sizes is available. The smallest, one-person, basket-less balloons (called \\"Hoppers\\" or \\"Cloudhoppers\\") have as little as  600?m3 (21,000?cu?ft) of envelope volume;[29] for a perfect sphere the radius would be around 5?m (16?ft). At the other end of the scale, balloons used by commercial sightseeing operations may be able to carry well over two dozen people, with envelope volumes of up to 17,000?m3 (600,000?cu?ft).[29] The most-used size is about 2,800?m3 (99,000?cu?ft), and can carry 3 to 5 people.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe top of the balloon usually has a vent of some sort, enabling the pilot to release hot air to slow an ascent, start a descent, or increase the rate of descent, usually for landing. Some hot air balloons have turning vents, which are side vents that, when opened, cause the balloon to rotate. Such vents are particularly useful for balloons with rectangular baskets, to facilitate aligning the wider side of the basket for landing.[30]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe most common type of top vent is a disk-shaped flap of fabric called a parachute vent, invented by Tracy Barnes.[31] The fabric is connected around its edge to a set of \\"vent lines\\" that converge in the center. (The arrangement of fabric and lines roughly resembles a parachutethus the name.) These \\"vent lines\\" are themselves connected to a control line that runs to the basket. A parachute vent is opened by pulling on the control line. Once the control line is released, the pressure of the remaining hot air pushes the vent fabric back into place. A parachute vent can be opened briefly while in flight to initiate a rapid descent. (Slower descents are initiated by allowing the air in the balloon to cool naturally.) The vent is pulled open completely to collapse the balloon after landing.\\r\\n\\r\\nAn older, and presently less commonly used, style of top vent is called a \\"Velcro-style\\" vent. This too is a disk of fabric at the top of the balloon. However, rather than having a set of \\"vent lines\\" that can repeatedly open and close the vent, the vent is secured by \\"hook and loop\\" fasteners (such as Velcro) and is only opened at the end of the flight. Balloons equipped with a Velcro-style vent typically have a second \\"maneuvering vent\\" built into the side (as opposed to the top) of the balloon.  Another common type of top design is the \\"Smart Vent,\\" which, rather than lowering a fabric disc into the envelope as in the \\"parachute\\" type, gathers the fabric together in the center of the opening.  This system can theoretically be used for in-flight maneuvering, but is more commonly used only as a rapid-deflation device for use after landing, of particular value in high winds. Other designs, such as the \\"pop top\\" and \\"MultiVent\\" systems, have also attempted to address the need for rapid deflation on landing, but the parachute top remains popular as an all-around maneuvering and deflation system.\\r\\n\\r\\nBesides special shapes, possibly for marketing purposes, there are several variations on the traditional \\"inverted tear drop\\" shape. The simplest, often used by home builders, is a hemisphere on top of a truncated cone. More-sophisticated designs attempt to minimize the circumferential stress on the fabric, with different degrees of success depending on whether they take fabric weight and varying air density into account. This shape may be referred to as \\"natural\\".[32] Finally, some specialized balloons are designed to minimize aerodynamic drag (in the vertical direction) to improve flight performance in competitions.[33]\\r\\n\\r\\nBaskets are commonly made of woven wicker or rattan. These materials have proven to be sufficiently light, strong, and durable for balloon flight. Such baskets are usually rectangular or triangular in shape. They vary in size from just big enough for two people to large enough to carry thirty.[34] Larger baskets often have internal partitions for structural bracing and to compartmentalize the passengers. Small holes may be woven into the side of the basket to act as foot holds for passengers climbing in or out.[35]\\r\\n\\r\\nBaskets may also be made of aluminium, especially a collapsible aluminium frame with a fabric skin, to reduce weight or increase portability.[36] These may be used by pilots without a ground crew or who are attempting to set altitude, duration, or distance records. Other specialty baskets include the fully enclosed gondolas used for around-the-world attempts,[37] and baskets that consist of little more than a seat for the pilot and perhaps one passenger.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe burner unit gasifies liquid propane,[38] mixes it with air, ignites the mixture, and directs the flame and exhaust into the mouth of the envelope. Burners vary in power output; each will generally produce 2 to 3 MW of heat (7 to 10 million BTUs per hour), with double, triple, or quadruple burner configurations installed where more power is needed.[39][40] The pilot actuates a burner by opening a propane valve, known as a blast valve. The valve may be spring-loaded so that it closes automatically, or it may stay open until closed by the pilot. The burner has a pilot light to ignite the propane and air mixture. The pilot light may be lit by the pilot with an external device, such as a flint striker or a lighter, or with a built-in piezo electric spark.[41]\\r\\n\\r\\nWhere more than one burner is present, the pilot can use one or more at a time depending on the desired heat output. Each burner is characterized by a metal coil of propane tubing the flame shoots through to preheat the incoming liquid propane. The burner unit may be suspended from the mouth of the envelope, or supported rigidly over the basket. The burner unit may be mounted on a gimbal to enable the pilot to aim the flame and avoid overheating the envelope fabric. A burner may have a secondary propane valve that releases propane more slowly and thereby generates a different sound. This is called a whisper burner and is used for flight over livestock to lessen the chance of spooking them. It also generates a more yellow flame and is used for night glows because it lights up the inside of the envelope better than the primary valve.\\r\\n\\r\\nPropane fuel tanks are usually cylindrical pressure vessels made from aluminium, stainless steel, or titanium with a valve at one end to feed the burner and to refuel. They may have a fuel gauge and a pressure gauge. Common tank sizes are 10 (38), 15 (57), and 20 (76) US gallons (liters).[27] They may be intended for upright or horizontal use, and may be mounted inside or outside the basket.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe pressure necessary to force the fuel through the line to the burner may be supplied by the vapor pressure of the propane itself, if warm enough, or by the introduction of an inert gas such as nitrogen.[41] Tanks may be preheated with electrical heat tapes to produce sufficient vapor pressure for cold weather flying.[42] Warmed tanks will usually also be wrapped in an insulating blanket to preserve heat during the setup and flight.\\r\\n\\r\\nA balloon may be outfitted with a variety of instruments to aid the pilot. These commonly include an altimeter, a rate of climb (vertical speed) indicator known as a variometer, envelope (air) temperature, and ambient (air) temperature.[43] A GPS receiver can be useful to indicate ground speed (traditional aircraft air speed indicators would be useless) and direction.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe combined mass of an average system can be calculated as follows:[27]\\r\\n\\r\\nusing a density of 0.9486?kg/m3 for dry air heated to 210?F (99?C).\\r\\n\\r\\nIncreasing the air temperature inside the envelope makes it less dense than the surrounding (ambient) air. The balloon floats because of the buoyant force exerted on it. This force is the same force that acts on objects when they are in water and is described by Archimedes' principle. The amount of lift (or buoyancy) provided by a hot air balloon depends primarily upon the difference between the temperature of the air inside the envelope and the temperature of the air outside the envelope. For most envelopes made of nylon fabric, the maximum internal temperature is limited to approximately 120?C (250?F).[44]\\r\\n\\r\\nIt should be noted that the melting point of nylon is significantly greater than this maximum operating temperature  about 230?C (450?F)  but higher temperatures cause the strength of the nylon fabric to degrade more quickly over time. With a maximum operating temperature of 120?C (250?F), balloon envelopes can generally be flown for between 400 and 500 hours before the fabric needs to be replaced. Many balloon pilots operate their envelopes at temperatures significantly less than the maximum to extend envelope fabric life.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe lift generated by 100,000?ft3 (2831.7?m3) of dry air heated to various temperatures may be calculated as follows:\\r\\n\\r\\nThe density of air at 20?C, 68?F is about 1.2?kg/m3. The total lift for a balloon of 100,000?ft3 heated to  (99?C, 210?F) would be 1595?lb, 723.5?kg. This is just enough to generate neutral buoyancy for the total system mass (not including the heated air trapped in the envelope, of course) stated in the previous section. Liftoff would require a slightly greater temperature, depending on the desired rate of climb. In reality, the air contained in the envelope is not all the same temperature, as the accompanying thermal image shows, and so these calculations are based on averages.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor typical atmospheric conditions (20?C, 68?F), a hot air balloon heated to (99?C, 210?F) requires about 3.91?m3 of envelope volume to lift 1?kilogram (62.5?ft3/lb). The precise amount of lift provided depends not only upon the internal temperature mentioned above, but the external temperature, altitude above sea level, and humidity of the air surrounding. On a warm day, a balloon cannot lift as much as on a cool day, because the temperature required for launch will exceed the maximum sustainable for nylon envelope fabric. Also, in the lower atmosphere, the lift provided by a hot air balloon decreases about 3% for each 1,000?meters (1% per 1,000?ft) of altitude gained.[45]\\r\\n\\r\\nStandard hot air balloons are known as Montgolfier balloons and rely solely on the buoyancy of hot air provided by the burner and contained by the envelope.[46] This style of balloon was developed by the Montgolfier brothers, and had its first public demonstration on 4 June 1783 with an unmanned flight lasting 10 minutes, followed later that year with manned flights.[47]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe 1785 Rozire balloon, a type of hybrid balloon, named after its creator, Jean-Fran?ois Pilatre de Rozier, has a separate cell for a lighter than air gas (typically helium,) as well as a cone below for hot air (as is used in a hot air balloon) to heat the helium at night. Hydrogen gas was used in the very early stages of development but was quickly abandoned due to the obvious danger of introducing an open flame near the gas.  All modern Roziere balloons now use helium as a lifting gas.[48]\\r\\n\\r\\nSolar balloons are hot air balloons that use just solar energy captured by a dark envelope to heat the air inside.[49]\\r\\n\\r\\nTo help ensure the safety of pilot and passengers, a hot air balloon may carry several pieces of safety equipment.\\r\\n\\r\\nTo relight the burner if the pilot light goes out and the optional piezo ignition fails, the pilot should have ready access to a means of backup ignition, such as a flint spark lighter. Many systems, especially those that carry passengers, have completely duplicate fuel and burner systems: two fuel tanks, connected to two separate hoses, which feed two distinct burners. This enables a safe landing in the case of a blockage somewhere in one system or if a system must be disabled because of a fuel leak.\\r\\n\\r\\nA fire extinguisher suitable for extinguishing propane fires is useful. Most balloons carry a 1 or 2 ?kg AB:E type fire extinguisher.\\r\\n\\r\\nA handling or drop line is mandatory safety equipment in many countries. This is a rope or webbing of 20ÿ30 meters in length attached to the balloon basket with a quick release connection at one end. In very calm winds the balloon pilot can throw the handling line from the balloon so that the ground crew can guide the balloon safely away from obstructions on the ground.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor commercial passenger balloons, a pilot restraint harness is mandatory in some countries. This consists of a hip belt and a webbing line that together allow for some movement while preventing the pilot from being ejected from the basket during a hard landing.\\r\\n\\r\\nFurther safety equipment may include a first-aid kit, a fire blanket and a strong rescue knife.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt a minimum, the pilot should wear leather or flame-retardant fiber (such as nomex) gloves, so that they may shut off a gas valve in the case of a leak, even if there is a flame present; quick action in this regard can turn a potential catastrophe into a mere inconvenience. The pilot should additionally wear flame-resistant clothing covering their arms and legs; either natural fiber, such as cotton, linen, hemp, or wool, or engineered flame-retardant fiber, such as nomex, is acceptable in this capacity.  Most engineered fibers (with the exception of rayon, which is also safe to wear) are thermoplastic; many are also hydrocarbons.  This makes such fabrics very much unsuitable to wear near high temperatures, since non-flame-retardant thermoplastics will melt onto the wearer, and most hydrocarbons, whether fibrous or not, are suitable to use as fuels.  Natural fiber will singe rather than melt or burn readily, and flame-retardant fiber generally has a very high melting point and is intrinsically non-flammable.  Many pilots also advise their passengers to wear similar protective clothing that covers their arms and legs, as well as strong shoes or boots that offer good ankle support. Finally, some balloon systems, especially those that hang the burner from the envelope instead of supporting it rigidly from the basket, require the use of helmets by the pilot and passengers.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe ground crew should wear gloves whenever there is a possibility of handling ropes or lines. The mass and exposed surface to air movement of a medium-sized balloon is sufficient to cause rope friction burns to the hands of anyone trying to stop or prevent movement. The ground crew should also wear sturdy shoes and at least long pants in case of the need to access a landing or landed balloon in rough or overgrown terrain.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs with aircraft, hot air balloons require regular maintenance to remain airworthy. As aircraft made of fabric and that lack direct horizontal control, hot air balloons may occasionally require repairs to rips or snags. While some operations, such as cleaning and drying, may be performed by the owner or pilot, other operations, such as sewing, must be performed by a qualified repair technician and recorded in the balloon's maintenance log book.\\r\\n\\r\\nTo ensure long life and safe operation, the envelope should be kept clean and dry. This prevents mold and mildew from forming on the fabric and abrasion from occurring during packing, transport, and unpacking due to contact with foreign particles. In the event of a landing in a wet (because of precipitation or early morning or late evening dew) or muddy location (farmer's field), the envelope should be cleaned and laid out or hung to dry.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe burner and fuel system must also be kept clean to ensure safe operation on demand. Damaged fuel hoses need to be replaced. Stuck or leaky valves must be repaired or replaced. The wicker basket may require occasional refinishing or repair. The skids on its bottom may require occasional replacement.\\r\\n\\r\\nBalloons in most parts of the world are maintained in accordance with a fixed manufacturer's maintenance schedule that includes regular (100 flight hours or 12 month) inspections, in addition to maintenance work to correct any damage. In Australia, balloons used for carrying commercial passengers must be inspected and maintained by approved workshops.[50]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the case of a snag, burn, or rip in the envelope fabric, a patch may be applied or the affected panel completely replaced. Patches may be held in place with glue, tape, stitching, or a combination of these techniques. Replacing an entire panel requires the stitching around the old panel to be removed, and a new panel to be sewn in with the appropriate technique, thread, and stitch pattern.\\r\\n\\r\\nDepending on the size of the balloon, location, and intended use, hot air balloons and their pilots need to comply with a variety of regulations.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs with other aircraft in the USA, balloons must be registered (have an N-number), have an airworthiness certificate, and pass annual inspections. Balloons below a certain size (empty weight of less than 155?pounds or 70?kg including envelope, basket, burners and empty fuel tanks) can be used as an ultralight aircraft.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn Australia, private balloon pilots are managed by the Australian Ballooning Federation[51]\\r\\nand typically become members of regional hot air ballooning clubs. Commercial operations carrying fare paying passengers or charging for promotional flights must operate under an Air Operators Certificate from the Australian Civil Aviation and Safety Authority (CASA) with a nominated Chief Pilot. Pilots must have different degrees of experience before they are allowed to progress to larger balloons. Hot air balloons must be registered aircraft with CASA and are subject to regular airworthiness checks by authorised personnel.[52]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the UK, the person in command must hold a valid Private Pilot's Licence issued by the Civil Aviation Authority specifically for ballooning; this is known as the PPL(B). There are two types of commercial balloon licences: CPL(B) Restricted and CPL(B) (Full). The CPL(B) Restricted is required if the pilot is undertaking work for a sponsor or being paid by an external agent to operate a balloon. The pilot can fly a sponsored balloon with everything paid for with a PPL unless asked to attend any event. Then a CPL(B) Restricted is required. The CPL(B) is required if the pilot is flying passengers for money. The balloon then needs a transport category C of A (certificate of air worthiness). If the pilot is only flying sponsor's guests, and not charging money for flying other passengers, then the pilot is exempted from holding an AOC (air operator's certificate) though a copy of it is required.[clarification needed] For passenger flying the balloon also requires a maintenance log.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the United States, a pilot of a hot air balloon must have a pilot certificate from the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) and it must carry the rating of \\"Lighter-than-air free balloon\\", and unless the pilot is also qualified to fly gas balloons, will also carry this limitation: \\"Limited to hot air balloons with airborne heater\\". A pilot does not need a license to fly an ultralight aircraft, but training is highly advised, and some hot air balloons meet the criteria.\\r\\n\\r\\nTo carry paying passengers for hire (and attend some balloon festivals), a pilot must have a commercial pilot certificate. Commercial hot air balloon pilots may also act as hot air balloon flight instructors. While most balloon pilots fly for the pure joy of floating through the air, many are able to make a living as a professional balloon pilot. Some professional pilots fly commercial passenger sightseeing flights, while others fly corporate advertising balloons.[53]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe largest manufacturer of hot air balloons in the world is Cameron Balloons company of Bristol, England, which also owns Lindstrand Balloons of Oswestry, England. Cameron Balloons, Lindstrand Balloons and another English balloon manufacturing company, Thunder and Colt (since acquired by Cameron), have been innovators and developers of special shaped balloons. These hot air balloons use the same principle of lift as conventional inverted teardrop shaped balloons but often sections of the special balloon envelope shape do not contribute to the balloon's ability to stay aloft.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe second largest manufacturer of hot air balloons in the world is Ultramagic company, based in Spain, which produces from 80 to 120 balloons per year. Ultramagic can produce very large balloons, such as the N-500 that accommodates as many as 27 persons in the basket, and has also produced many balloons with special shapes, as well as cold-air inflatables.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the USA Aerostar International, Inc. of Sioux Falls, South Dakota was North America's largest balloon manufacturer and a close second in world manufacturing before ceasing to build balloons in January 2007. The oldest U.S. certified manufacture is now Adams Balloons out of Albuquerque, New Mexico. Firefly Balloons, formerly The Balloon Works, is a manufacturer of hot-air balloons in Statesville, North Carolina. Another manufacturer is Head Balloons, Inc. of Helen, Georgia.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe major manufacturers in Canada are Sundance Balloons and Fantasy Sky Promotions. Other manufacturers include Kavanagh Balloons of Australia, Schroeder Fire Balloons of Germany, Kubicek Balloons of the Czech Republic, and LLopis Balloons of France.","input":"Where was the first ever hot air ballon created?"},{"output":"Buzz Aldrin","context":"Buzz Aldrin (born Edwin Eugene Aldrin Jr.; January 20, 1930) is an American engineer, former astronaut, and Command Pilot in the United States Air Force. As Lunar Module Pilot on the Apollo 11 mission, he and mission commander Neil Armstrong were the first two humans to land on the Moon. Aldrin set foot on the Moon at 03:15:16 on July 21, 1969 (UTC), 9 minutes after Armstrong first touched the surface. One of his first missions was on Gemini 12 where he successfully proved that extravehicular activity (EVA) could be performed by astronauts, spending over 5 hours outside the craft, thus achieving the goals of the Gemini program and paving the way for the Apollo program.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nAldrin was born January 20, 1930, in Mountainside Hospital, in Glen Ridge, New Jersey.[3][4] His parents were Edwin Eugene Aldrin Sr. (1896ÿ1974), a career military man, and Marion Aldrin (ne Moon, 1903ÿ1968), who lived in neighboring Montclair.[5][6] He is of Scottish,[7] Swedish, and German ancestry. His first name, which he legally changed in 1988, originated from a nickname, \\"Buzz\\", arising as a result of the younger of his two elder sisters mispronouncing \\"brother\\" as \\"buzzer\\", which was shortened to Buzz.[8] During his childhood years, Aldrin was a Boy Scout and earned the rank of Tenderfoot Scout.[9]\\r\\nAfter graduating from Montclair High School in 1947,[3][10] Aldrin went to the United States Military Academy at West Point, New York.[11]\\r\\nAldrin graduated third in his class at West Point in 1951 with a Bachelor of Science degree in mechanical engineering. He was commissioned as a second lieutenant in the United States Air Force and served as a jet fighter pilot during the Korean War. He flew 66 combat missions in F-86 Sabres and shot down two Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-15 aircraft. The June 8, 1953, issue of Life magazine featured gun camera photos taken by Aldrin of one of the Soviet pilots ejecting from his damaged aircraft.[12]\\r\\nAfter the war, Aldrin was assigned as an aerial gunnery instructor at Nellis Air Force Base in Nevada, and later served as an aide to the dean of faculty at the United States Air Force Academy, which had begun operations in 1955.[13] That same year, he graduated from the Squadron Officer School at Maxwell Air Force Base in Alabama.[4]:353 He flew F-100 Super Sabres as a flight commander in the 22d Fighter Squadron, while stationed at Bitburg Air Base, West Germany.[13]\\r\\nIn January 1963, Aldrin earned a Sc.D. degree in astronautics from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, where he had been assigned as a graduate student (under the auspices of the Air Force Institute of Technology) since 1959.[13][14] His doctoral thesis was Line-of-Sight Guidance Techniques for Manned Orbital Rendezvous, the dedication of which read, \\"In the hopes that this work may in some way contribute to their exploration of space, this is dedicated to the crew members of this countrys present and future manned space programs. If only I could join them in their exciting endeavors!\\"[14]\\r\\nOn the completion of his doctorate, he was assigned to the Gemini Target Office of the Air Force Space Systems Division in Los Angeles before his selection as an astronaut. His initial application to join the astronaut corps was rejected on the basis of his never having been a test pilot; that prerequisite was lifted when he re-applied and was accepted into the third astronaut class.[15]\\r\\nWith the removal of test pilot experience as a prerequisite for astronaut selection, Aldrin became eligible and in October 1963, he became a member of NASA's Astronaut Group 3.[16] After the deaths of the original Gemini 9 prime crew, Elliot See and Charles Bassett, Aldrin and Jim Lovell were promoted to backup crew for the mission.[17] He was confirmed as pilot on Gemini 12, the final Gemini mission and the last chance to validate methods for extravehicular activity (EVA). Aldrin performed two EVAs; first a standup EVA, and in the second EVA he left the spacecraft. The standup EVA lasted for two hours and 20 minutes He set a record for EVA and demonstrated that astronauts could work outside spacecraft.[18]:141ÿ142\\r\\nOn July 20, 1969, Apollo 11 mission commander Neil Armstrong and Aldrin made the first lunar landing becoming the first and second people, respectively, to walk on the Moon. This mission allowed Aldrin to maintain his record EVA duration until it was surpassed in the Apollo 14 mission. Aldrin's first words on the Moon were \\"Beautiful view\\", to which Armstrong asked \\"Isn't it magnificent?\\". Aldrin answered, \\"Magnificent desolation.\\"[20] He was also the first person to urinate while on the Moon.[21][22][23]\\r\\nThere has been speculation about the extent of Aldrin's desire at the time to be the first astronaut to walk on the Moon and its impact on his pre-flight, in-mission and post-flight actions.[24] According to various NASA accounts, early versions of the EVA checklist had the Lunar Module Pilot as the first to step onto the lunar surface. However, when Aldrin learned that this might be amended, he lobbied within NASA for the original procedure to be followed. A number of factors seem to have contributed to the final decision, including the physical positioning of the astronauts within the compact lunar lander, which made it easier for Armstrong to be the first to exit the spacecraft. Furthermore, there was little support for Aldrin's views among other senior astronauts who would command later Apollo missions, and who may have been the first to make a lunar landing had Apollo 11 failed.[25] Apollo 11 Command Module Pilot Michael Collins has commented that he thought Aldrin \\"resents not being first on the moon more than he appreciates being second.\\"[26]\\r\\nAldrin, a Presbyterian, was the first person to hold a religious ceremony on the Moon. After landing on the Moon, he radioed Earth: \\"I'd like to take this opportunity to ask every person listening in, whoever and wherever they may be, to pause for a moment and contemplate the events of the past few hours, and to give thanks in his or her own way.\\" He took communion on the surface of the Moon, but he kept it secret because of a lawsuit brought by atheist activist Madalyn Murray O'Hair over the reading of Genesis on Apollo 8.[27] Aldrin, then a church elder, used a home communion kit given to him, and recited words used by his pastor at Webster Presbyterian Church, the Rev. Dean Woodruff.[28][29] The communion elements were the first food and liquid consumed on the Moon: in Guideposts, Aldrin stated: \\"It was interesting to think that the very first liquid ever poured on the Moon, and the first food eaten there, were communion elements.\\"[30]\\r\\nLater Aldrin commented on the event: \\"Perhaps, if I had it to do over again, I would not choose to celebrate communion. Although it was a deeply meaningful experience for me, it was a Christian sacrament, and we had come to the Moon in the name of all mankind ÿ be they Christians, Jews, Muslims, animists, agnostics, or atheists. But at the time I could think of no better way to acknowledge the enormity of the Apollo 11 experience than by giving thanks to God.\\"[30][31] Mindful of the controversy caused by the Bible readings made by the Apollo 8 crew, the NASA management had warned the Apollo 11 crew against making any explicit religious comments during the flight. However, in the final Apollo 11 TV broadcast during the return journey to Earth, Aldrin quoted from Psalm 8 (verses 3 and 4)[32] \\"I've been reflecting the events of the past several days and a verse from the Psalms comes to mind to me. 'When I consider the heavens, the work of thy fingers, the moon and the stars which thou hast ordained, what is man that thou art mindful of him?'\\".[33][34]\\r\\nAfter leaving NASA in July 1971, Aldrin was assigned as Commandant of the U.S. Air Force Test Pilot School at Edwards Air Force Base, California. In March 1972, Aldrin retired from active duty, after 21 years of service, and returned to the Air Force in a managerial role but his career was blighted by personal problems. His autobiographies Return to Earth, published in 1973, and Magnificent Desolation, published in June 2009, both recount his struggles with clinical depression and alcoholism in the years after his NASA career.[35]\\r\\nAfter retiring from NASA, Aldrin continued to advocate for space exploration. In 1985 he joined the University of North Dakota (UND)'s College of Aerospace Sciences (now the John D. Odegard School of Aerospace Sciences) at the invitation of John D. Odegard, the dean of the college at time. Aldrin helped to develop UND's Space Studies program and brought Dr. David Webb from NASA to serve as the department's first chair.[36] Later, he produced a computer strategy game called Buzz Aldrin's Race Into Space (1993). To further promote space exploration, and to commemorate the 40th anniversary of the first lunar landing, Aldrin teamed up with Snoop Dogg, Quincy Jones, Talib Kweli, and Soulja Boy to create the rap single and video, \\"Rocket Experience\\", with proceeds from video and song sales to benefit Aldrin's non-profit foundation, ShareSpace.[37]\\r\\nHe referred to the Phobos monolith in a July 22, 2009, interview with C-SPAN: \\"We should go boldly where man has not gone before. Fly by the comets, visit asteroids, visit the moon of Mars. There's a monolith there. A very unusual structure on this potato shaped object that goes around Mars once in seven hours. When people find out about that they're going to say 'Who put that there? Who put that there?' The universe put it there. If you choose, God put it there\\"[38]\\r\\nAldrin has voiced parody versions of himself in two of Matt Groening's animated series: The Simpsons episode \\"Deep Space Homer\\", in which he accompanies Homer Simpson on a trip into space as part of NASA's plan to improve its public appearance, and the Futurama episode \\"Cold Warriors\\". In 2011, Aldrin appeared as himself in the film Transformers: Dark of the Moon, where he explains to Optimus Prime and the Autobots that the Apollo 11 mission also discovered a Cybertronian ship on the Moon whose existence was concealed from the public.\\r\\nIn 2012, he made a cameo appearance in the Japanese drama film Space Brothers.[39] Aldrin appeared as himself in the Big Bang Theory episode, \\"The Holographic Excitation\\", which aired on October 25, 2012.[40] Aldrin also lent his voice talents to the 2012 video game Mass Effect 3, playing a stargazer who appears in the game's final scene.[41]\\r\\nIn December 2016, Aldrin was part of a tourist group visiting the AmundsenÿScott South Pole Station in Antarctica when he fell ill and was evacuated, first to McMurdo Station and from there to Christchurch, New Zealand.[42] At 86 years of age, Aldrin's visit made him the oldest person to ever reach the South Pole.[43]\\r\\nIn 1985, Aldrin proposed the existence of a special spacecraft trajectory now known as the Aldrin cycler.[44][45] Aldrin's proposed system of cycling spacecraft makes travel to Mars possible using far less propellant than conventional means, with an expected five and a half month journey from the Earth to Mars, and a return trip to Earth of about the same duration on a twin-cycler. Aldrin continues to research this concept with engineers from Purdue University.[46]\\r\\nOn September 9, 2002, Aldrin was lured to a Beverly Hills hotel on the pretext of being interviewed for a Japanese children's television show on the subject of space. When he arrived, Apollo conspiracy proponent Bart Sibrel accosted him with a film crew and demanded he swear on a Bible that the Moon landings were not faked, insisting that Aldrin and others had lied about walking on the Moon. After a brief confrontation, during which Sibrel kept following Aldrin despite being told to leave him alone, said to Aldrin: \\"You're the one who said you walked on the moon when you didn't!\\" and finally called him \\"a coward and a liar\\",[47] Aldrin punched Sibrel in the jaw, which was caught on camera by Sibrel's film crew. Aldrin stated that he had struck Sibrel in order to defend himself and his nearby stepdaughter. Witnesses stated that Sibrel had aggressively poked Aldrin with the Bible before being punched. Additional mitigating factors were that Sibrel sustained no visible injury and did not seek medical attention, and that Aldrin had no previous criminal record; the police declined to press charges against Aldrin.[48] Aldrin dedicated a chapter to this incident in his autobiography Magnificent Desolation.[49]\\r\\nIn December 2003, Aldrin published an opinion piece in The New York Times criticizing NASA's objectives.[50] In it, he voiced concern about NASA's development of a spacecraft \\"limited to transporting four astronauts at a time with little or no cargo carrying capability\\" and declared the goal of sending astronauts back to the Moon was \\"more like reaching for past glory than striving for new triumphs\\".[50]\\r\\nIn June 2013, Aldrin wrote an opinion piece, published in The New York Times, supporting a manned mission to Mars and which viewed the Moon \\"not as a destination but more a point of departure, one that places humankind on a trajectory to homestead Mars and become a two-planet species.\\"[51] In August 2015, Aldrin, in association with the Florida Institute of Technology, presented a \\"master plan\\" to NASA for consideration where astronauts, with a \\"tour of duty of ten years\\", establish a colony on Mars before the year 2040.[52]\\r\\nIn 2009, Aldrin commented on climate change by saying: \\"I think the climate has been changing for billions of years. If it's warming now, it may cool off later. I'm not in favor of just taking short-term isolated situations and depleting our resources to keep our climate just the way it is today. I'm not necessarily of the school that we are causing it all, I think the world is causing it.\\"[53]\\r\\nAldrin was awarded the Air Force Distinguished Service Medal in 1969 for his role as lunar module pilot on Apollo 11.[54] He was awarded an oak leaf cluster in 1972 in lieu of a second Distinguished Service Medal for his role in both the Korean War and in the space program.[54] He was also awarded the Legion of Merit for his role in the Gemini and Apollo programs.[54]\\r\\nIn 2005, while being interviewed for a documentary titled First on the Moon: The Untold Story, Aldrin told an interviewer that they saw an unidentified flying object. Aldrin told David Morrison, a NASA Astrobiology Institute senior scientist, the documentary cut the crew's conclusion that they probably saw one of the four detached spacecraft adapter panels. Their S-IVB upper stage was 6,000 miles (9,700?km) away, but the four panels had been jettisoned before the S-IVB made its separation maneuver so they would closely follow the Apollo 11 spacecraft until its first mid-course correction.[73] When Aldrin appeared on The Howard Stern Show on August 15, 2007, Stern asked him about the supposed UFO sighting. Aldrin confirmed that there was no such sighting of anything deemed extraterrestrial and said they were, and are, \\"99.9 percent\\" sure that the object was the detached panel.[74][75]\\r\\nIn an interview with the Science Channel, Aldrin mentioned seeing unidentified objects, but according to Aldrin his words had been taken out of context. He made a request to the Science Channel to clarify to viewers that he did not see alien spacecraft but was refused.[76]\\r\\nAldrin has been married three times. His first marriage was to Joan Archer (1954ÿ1974), mother to his three children (James, Janice and Andrew). His second marriage was to Beverly Van Zile (1975ÿ1978), and his third to Lois Driggs Cannon (1988ÿ2011), from whom he filed for divorce on June 15, 2011, in Los Angeles, citing \\"irreconcilable differences\\".[77] The divorce was finalized on December 28, 2012.[78] He has one grandson, Jeffrey Schuss, born to his daughter, Janice, and three great-grandsons.[79]\\r\\nHis mother committed suicide in 1968, the year before the Moon mission. Her father had also committed suicide, and he believes he inherited depression from them.[80]\\r\\nHis battles against depression and alcoholism, upon returning home from the Apollo 11 mission, have been well documented, most recently in Magnificent Desolation.[81][82] Aldrin is an active supporter of the Republican Party, headlining fundraisers for GOP members of Congress.[83]\\r\\nIn 2007, Aldrin confirmed to Time magazine that he had recently had a face-lift;[84] he joked that the G-forces he was exposed to in space \\"caused a sagging jowl that needed some attention.\\"[84]\\r\\nAldrin commented on the death of his Apollo 11 colleague, Neil Armstrong, saying that he was \\"deeply saddened by the passing. I know I am joined by millions of others in mourning the passing of a true American hero and the best pilot I ever knew. I had truly hoped that on July 20th, 2019, Neil, Mike and I would be standing together to commemorate the 50th Anniversary of our moon landing.... Regrettably, this is not to be.\\"[85][86] Fellow Apollo astronaut Edgar Mitchell died on the eve of the 45th anniversary of Mitchell's lunar landing.[87] His death was widely reported, with Aldrin tweeting the following morning, \\"It's the 45th Anniv of the #Apollo14 landing on the moon & yesterday we lost another Lunar Pioneer Edgar Mitchell.\\"[87]\\r\\nAldrin primarily resided in Los Angeles, California and its environs, including Hidden Hills and Laguna Beach, from 1972 to 2014.[88] Following his third divorce, he sold his Westwood condominium (initially purchased in 1998) for $2.87 million in 2014.[89] As of 2016[update], Aldrin was living in Satellite Beach, Florida.[90]\\r\\nAldrin has been portrayed by:","input":"Who is the second person to reach moon?"},{"output":"over 147,000","context":"Incorporated Society of Liverpool Accountants,\\r\\nThe Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales (ICAEW) was established by royal charter in 1880.[5] It has over 147,000 members. Over 15,000 of these members live and work outside the UK. In 2015, 8,256 students joined ICAEW - the highest ever figure. 82 of FTSE 100 (the leading UK) companies have an ICAEW Chartered Accountant on the board.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Institute is a member of the Consultative Committee of Accountancy Bodies (CCAB), formed in 1974 by the major accountancy professional bodies in the UK and Ireland. The fragmented nature of the accountancy profession in the UK is in part due to the absence of any legal requirement for an accountant to be a member of one of the many Institutes, as the term accountant does not have legal protection. However, a person must belong to the ICAEW, ICAS or CAI to hold themselves out as a chartered accountant in the UK (although there are other chartered bodies of British qualified accountants whose members are likewise authorised to conduct restricted work such as auditing).\\r\\nThe ICAEW has two offices in the United Kingdom; the main one is in Moorgate, London and the other in Central Milton Keynes, in the newly-built Hub:MK complex. It also has offices in Belgium (Europe Region), China (Greater China Region), Hong Kong, Indonesia, Vietnam, Malaysia, Singapore and the United Arab Emirates (Middle East, Africa and South East Asia Region).[6][7]\\r\\nUntil the mid-nineteenth century the role of accountants in England and Wales was restricted to that of bookkeepers in that accountants merely maintained records of what other business people had purchased and sold. However, with the growth of the limited liability company and large scale manufacturing and logistic in Victorian Britain a demand was created for more technically proficient accountants to deal with the increasing complexity of accounting transactions dealing with depreciation of assets, inventory valuation and the Companies legislation being introduced.\\r\\nTo improve their status and combat criticism of low standards, accountants in the cities of Britain formed professional bodies. The ICAEW was formed from the five of these associations that existed in England prior to its establishment by Royal Charter in May 1880.[5]\\r\\nThe headquarter of the Institute, Chartered Accountants' Hall, in the City of London, was designed in the Italian Renaissance style by John Belcher in 1890. It was built by Colls & Sons.[8] It is widely regarded as one of the finest examples of Victorian Baroque architecture. Sir William Whitfield designed the 1964ÿ70 extension and new entrance.[9]\\r\\nIn 1948, the institute received a Supplemental Charter. In 1957, the ICAEW merged with the Society of Incorporated Accountants (founded in 1885 as the Society of Incorporated Accountants and Auditors).[5]\\r\\nIn 2005 the ICAEW sought to merge with the Chartered Institute of Management Accountants (CIMA) and the Chartered Institute of Public Finance and Accountancy (CIPFA). However, this project proved unsuccessful, and wasted a considerable amount of money. The Institute also announced at this time that it was considering dropping the reference to England and Wales in its title to become the Institute of Chartered Accountants. However, this plan was also withdrawn following objections from the Institute of Chartered Accountants of Scotland.\\r\\nThe Institute introduced a new syllabus in 2007. In order to make it more appealing to prospective students the mandatory examinations will become more flexible based on a modular structure. In addition to paper based assessments, there are now computer based assessments of objective test questions (multiple choice).\\r\\nIn 2017, ICAEW launched a new brand identity - 'A world of strong economies', with an updated logo and brand positioning. [10]\\r\\nTo be admitted to membership of the ICAEW, applicants must generally complete 450 days of relevant work experience (training) and pass a series of examinations. During the training, the candidate will also need to display professional ethics and skepticism along with showing a commitment towards continuous professional development, which must be maintained even once the qualification has been obtained. This pathway is defined as the ACA qualification. It is common for accountancy employers in the UK, such as the Big Four, to offer the ACA as part of their training contract for new joiners.\\r\\nThe work experience lasts between three and five years and must be with an employer or employers approved by the Institute for training; there are more than 2,850 authorised employers around the world.[11] The examinations are in three stages. The certificate level consists of six modules examined via e-assessments; the professional stage consists of six written papers while the advanced stage, usually taken on the final year of training, consists of two technical integration papers and a case study.[12]\\r\\nSince 2014, the ICAEW has been offering in parallel with the Chartered Institute of Taxation (CIOT) a joint ACA/CTA route which allows tax students to achieve both prestigious qualifications in a shorter length of time.[13]\\r\\nThe full ACA training programme is also available in Cyprus, Greece, Malaysia, Mauritius, Romania and the Gulf states.\\r\\nMembers of equivalent bodies in other European Economic Area countries and Switzerland may also be admitted to membership after passing an aptitude test, provided they are a citizen of an EEA state or Switzerland.\\r\\nThe Institute has mutual recognition agreements in place with:\\r\\nStarting from 8 January 2010, ICAEW introduced a new \\"Pathways to Membership\\" programme whereby it offers the ACA designation on passing its Examination of Experience and sponsorship by ICAEW member or under ICAEW's ATE training environment, to members (qualified through normal examination and training route) of the following accounting institutes:\\r\\nHowever, AICPA and MICPA members who join the ICAEW under the Pathways to Membership scheme must maintain their home body membership.\\r\\nICAEW has signed Memoranda of Understanding (MOU) with accounting bodies in overseas countries. These bodies are The Institute of Chartered Accountants of Bangladesh (ICAB), Institute of Chartered Accountants of India (ICAI), Institute of Chartered Accountants of Pakistan (ICAP) and Institute of Certified Public Accountants of Singapore (ICPAS). There is also a joint scheme in place to enable members of the Chinese Institute of Certified Public Accountants (CICPA) and the Hong Kong Institute of Certified Public Accountants to qualify as ACA with ICAEW.[7] ICAEW is an affiliate of the Institute of Chartered Accountants of the Caribbean.[14]\\r\\nMembers have the designation ACA (Associate Chartered Accountant) or FCA (Fellow Chartered Accountant) after their name.[15]\\r\\nFellowship is intended to designate those who have achieved a higher level of professional experience, and to raise more money through charging a higher subscription. It is awarded automatically (previously on application) to those members who have attained at least ten years of membership and who, at the date of application, have complied with the Institute's requirements on continuing professional development in the preceding three years and have no outstanding disciplinary charges against them.[15]\\r\\nThe ICAEW has seven faculties, each run by an in-house team working together with members who are experts in their particular sector:[16]\\r\\nThe Tax Faculty was the first to be formed in 1990; The monthly TAXline publication started in 1991, and an annual Technical Review (now Tax Planning) was first published in October 1992. The Tax Faculty joined the Confdration Fiscale Europenne (CFE) in 2001.\\r\\nThe Institute has 25 district societies, the largest of which is the London Society of Chartered Accountants (LSCA) with over 31,000 members.

Scholars speculate that Tennyson created his pen names because these verses used a traditional structure Tennyson employed in his earlier career but suppressed during the 1840s,[1] worrying that poems like \\"The Charge of the Light Brigade\\" (which he initially signed only A.T.) \\"might prove not to be decorous for a poet laureate\\".[2]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe poem was written after the Light Cavalry Brigade suffered great casualties in the Battle of Balaclava. Tennyson wrote the poem based on two articles published in The Times: the first, published in November, 1854, provided the phrase \\"Some one has blunder'd\\" and thus the meter of the poem.[3] The poem was written in a few minutes on December 2 of the same year, based on a recollection of that account;[4] Tennyson wrote other similar poems, like \\"Riflemen, form in town and in Shrine\\" in a similar manner.[5]\\r\\n\\r\\nTennyson made revisions to the poem due to criticisms by the American poet Frederick Goddard Tuckerman and others;[6] these were published in Tennyson's volume Maud and Other Poems. These changes were criticized by several, including both Tennyson and Tuckerman.\\r\\n\\r\\nTennyson sent a version of the poem, after correcting the revisions in Maud, at the soldiers' request.[7] There, it was distributed in pamphlet form at the behest of Jane, Lady Franklin.[8] The same version was used for the second printing of Maud.[7]\\r\\n\\r\\nTennyson recited this poem onto a wax cylinder in 1890.\\r\\n\\r\\nRudyard Kipling wrote \\"The Last of the Light Brigade\\" (1891) some 40 years after the appearance of \\"The Charge of the Light Brigade\\". His poem focuses on the terrible hardships faced in old age by veterans of the Crimean War, as exemplified by the cavalry men of the Light Brigade. Its purpose was to shame the British public into offering financial assistance.[9]","input":"When was charge of the light brigade written?"},{"output":"The Lamb Lies Down on Broadway","context":"","input":"What was peter gabriel's last album with genesis?"},{"output":"the eye closes in upon itself due to the weakening process, which causes surf to decrease","context":"Landfall is the event of a storm moving over land after being over water.

Such effects include the peaking of the storm surge, the core of strong winds coming ashore, and heavy flooding rains. These coupled with high surf can cause major beach erosion. In low-lying areas, the storm surge can stay inland for a long time and mix with chemicals already in the area to create a toxic mess.[citation needed] When a tropical cyclone makes landfall, the eye closes in upon itself due to the weakening process, which causes surf to decrease. Maximum sustained winds will naturally decrease as the cyclone moves inland due to frictional differences between water and land with the free atmosphere.[2]\\r\\nLandfall is distinct from a direct hit. A direct hit is where the core of high winds (or eyewall) comes onshore but the center of the storm may stay offshore. The effects of this are quite similar to a landfall, as this term is used when the radius of maximum wind within a tropical cyclone moves ashore.[3] These effects are high surf, heavy rains that may cause flooding, water buildup along the coast with minor storm surge, coastal beach erosion, high winds, and possibly severe thunderstorms with tornadoes around the periphery.\\r\\nWhen a tornadic waterspout makes landfall it is reclassified as a tornado,[4] which can subsequently cause damage to areas inland of the coast. When a fair weather waterspout makes landfall it usually dissipates quickly due to friction and a reduction in the amount of warm air supplied to the funnel.[5]","input":"What happens immediately after a hurricane makes landfall?"},{"output":"in the mountains near Malibu, California (Calabasas, Los Angeles County, California)","context":"M*A*S*H is an American war comedy-drama television series that aired on CBS from 1972 to 1983. It was developed by Larry Gelbart, adapted from the 1970 feature film M*A*S*H, which, in turn, was based on Richard Hooker's 1968 novel MASH: A Novel About Three Army Doctors. The series, which was produced with 20th Century Fox Television for CBS, follows a team of doctors and support staff stationed at the \\"4077th Mobile Army Surgical Hospital\\" in Uijeongbu, South Korea, during the Korean War (1950ÿ53). The show's title sequence features an instrumental-only version of \\"Suicide Is Painless\\", the original film's theme song. The show was created after an attempt to film the original book's sequel, M*A*S*H Goes to Maine, failed. The television series is the best-known of the M*A*S*H works, and one of the highest-rated shows in US television history.\\r\\n\\r\\nM*A*S*H aired weekly on CBS, with most episodes being a half-hour (25 minutes) in length. The series is usually categorized as a situation comedy, though it has also been described as a \\"dark comedy\\" or a \\"dramedy\\" because of the often dramatic subject matter.[a]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe show is an ensemble piece revolving around key personnel in a United States Army Mobile Army Surgical Hospital (MASH) in the Korean War (1950ÿ53). (The asterisks in the name are not part of military nomenclature and were creatively introduced in the novel and used in only the posters for the movie version, not the actual movie.)[clarification needed] The \\"4077th MASH\\" was one of several surgical units in Korea.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhile the show is traditionally viewed as a comedy, many episodes had a more serious tone. Airing on network prime time while the Vietnam War was still going on, the show was forced to walk the fine line of commenting on that war while at the same time not seeming to protest it. For this reason, the show's discourse, under the cover of comedy, often questioned, mocked, and grappled with America's role in the Cold War.\\r\\n\\r\\nEpisodes were both plot- and character-driven, with several narrated by one of the show's characters as the contents of a letter home. The show's tone could move from silly to sobering from one episode to the next, with dramatic tension often occurring between the civilian draftees of 4077th?ÿ Hawkeye, Trapper John, and B.J. Hunnicutt, for example?ÿ who are forced to leave their homes to tend the wounded and dying of the war, and the \\"regular Army\\" characters, such as Margaret Houlihan and Colonel Potter, who tend to represent patriotism and duty (though Houlihan and Potter could also represent the other perspective at times). Other characters, such as Col. Blake, Maj. Winchester, and Cpl. Klinger, help demonstrate various American civilian attitudes toward army life, while guest characters played by such actors as Eldon Quick, Herb Voland, Mary Wickes, and Tim O'Connor also help further the show's discussion of America's place as Cold War warmaker and peacemaker.\\r\\n\\r\\nM*A*S*H maintained a relatively constant ensemble cast, with four characters ÿ Hawkeye, Father Mulcahy, Margaret Houlihan, and Maxwell Klinger ÿ on the show for all 11 seasons. Several other main characters departed or joined the program during its run, and numerous guest actors and recurring characters were used. The writers found creating so many names difficult, and used names from elsewhere; for example, characters on the seventh season were named after the 1978 Los Angeles Dodgers.[1]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe cast of M*A*S*H from Season 2, 1974 (clockwise from left): Loretta Swit, Larry Linville, Wayne Rogers, Gary Burghoff, McLean Stevenson, and Alan Alda\\r\\n\\r\\nThe cast of M*A*S*H from Season 5, 1977 (clockwise from left): William Christopher, Gary Burghoff, David Ogden Stiers, Jamie Farr, Mike Farrell, Alan Alda, Harry Morgan, Loretta Swit.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe cast of M*A*S*H from season 8 onwards (clockwise from left): Mike Farrell, William Christopher, Jamie Farr, David Ogden Stiers, Loretta Swit, Alan Alda, and Harry Morgan\\r\\n\\r\\nAs the series progressed, it made a significant shift from being primarily a comedy with dramatic undertones to a drama with comedic undertones. This was a result of changes in writing and production staff, rather than the cast defections of McLean Stevenson, Larry Linville, Wayne Rogers and Gary Burghoff. Series co-creator and joke writer Larry Gelbart departed after Season 4, the first featuring Mike Farrell and Harry Morgan. This resulted in Farrell and Morgan having only a single season reading scripts featuring Gelbart's masterful comic timing, which defined the feel and rhythm of Seasons 1ÿ4 featuring predecessors Rogers and Stevenson, respectively. Larry Linville (the show's comic foil) and Executive Producer Gene Reynolds both departed at the conclusion of Season 5 in 1977, resulting in M*A*S*H being fully stripped of its original tight comedic foundation by the beginning of Season 6  the debut of the Charles Winchester era.[2]\\r\\n\\r\\nWhereas Gelbart and Reynolds were the comedic voice of M*A*S*H for the show's first five seasons (1972ÿ1977), Alan Alda and newly promoted Executive Producer Burt Metcalfe became the new dramatic voice of M*A*S*H for Seasons 6ÿ11. By the start of Season 8 (1979ÿ1980), the writing staff had been completely overhauled, and with the departure of Gary Burghoff, M*A*S*H displayed a distinctively different feel, consciously moving between comedy and drama, unlike the seamless integration of its first five years.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe end of the Vietnam War in 1975 was a significant factor as to why storylines become less political in nature and more character driven. Several episodes also experimented with the sitcom format:\\r\\n\\r\\nAnother change was the infusion of story lines based on actual events and medical developments that materialized during the Korean War. Considerable research was done by the producers, including interviews with actual MASH surgeons and personnel to develop story lines rooted in the war itself. Such early 1950s events as the McCarthy era, various sporting events, and the stardom of Marilyn Monroe were all incorporated into various episodes, a trend that continued until the end of the series.[2]\\r\\n\\r\\nWhile the series remained popular through these changes, it eventually began to run out of creative steam. Korean War doctors regularly contacted producers with experiences that they thought might make for a good storyline, only to learn the idea had previously been used. Harry Morgan admitted that he felt \\"the cracks were starting to show\\" by season 9 (1980ÿ1981).[2] Alda wished to make season 10 (1981-1982) M*A*S*H's last, but was persuaded by CBS to produce a slightly shortened 11th season, coupled with a farewell movie finale, because CBS refused to let the show go away so easily. In the end, season 11 had 15 episodes (although six had been filmed during season 10 and held over) and a 2-1/2 hour movie, which was treated as five episodes and was filmed before the nine remaining episodes. The final episode ever produced was the penultimate episode \\"As Time Goes By\\". The series finale movie, titled \\"Goodbye, Farewell and Amen\\", became the most-watched television broadcast in history, tallying a total of 125 million viewers.[2]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe 4077th consisted of two separate sets. An outdoor set in the mountains near Malibu, California (Calabasas, Los Angeles County, California) was used for most exterior and tent scenes for every season. This was the same set used to shoot the movie. The indoor set, on a sound stage at Fox Studios in Century City, was used for the indoor scenes for the run of the series. Later, after the indoor set was renovated to permit many of the \\"outdoor\\" scenes to be filmed there, both sets were used for exterior shooting as script requirements dictated (e.g., night scenes were far easier to film on the sound stage, but scenes at the chopper pad required using the ranch).\\r\\n\\r\\nJust as the series was wrapping production, a brush fire destroyed most of the outdoor set on October 9, 1982. The fire was written into the final episode as a forest fire caused by enemy incendiary bombs that forced the 4077th to bug out.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Malibu location is today known as Malibu Creek State Park. Formerly called the Century Ranch and owned by 20th Century Fox Studios until the 1980s, the site today is returning to a natural state, and is marked by a rusted Jeep and an ambulance used in the show. Through the 1990s, the area was occasionally used for television commercial production.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn February 23, 2008, series stars Mike Farrell, Loretta Swit and William Christopher (along with producers Gene Reynolds and Burt Metcalfe and M*A*S*H director Charles S. Dubin) reunited at the set to celebrate its partial restoration. The rebuilt signpost is now displayed on weekends, along with tent markers and maps and photos of the set. The state park is open to the public. It was also the location where the film How Green Was My Valley (1941) and the Planet of the Apes television series (1974) were filmed, among other productions.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe exhibit M*A*S*H: Binding Up the Wounds was at the National Museum of American History from July 30, 1983 through February 3, 1985.  The exhibit was extremely popular drawing more than 17,000 in a single week, a record for any Smithsonian display.[3]\\r\\n\\r\\nOn exhibit were The Swamp and Operating Room sets, one of the show's 14 Emmy Awards, early drafts of the pilot script, costumes from the show and other memorabilia.  Sets were decorated with props from the show including the iconic signpost, Hawkeye's still and Major Winchester's Webcor tape recorder and phonograph. The exhibit also encouraged visitors to compare the show to real Mobile Army Surgical Hospitals of the Korean and the Vietnam Wars.\\r\\n[4][5]\\r\\n\\r\\nRadar's teddy bear, originally found at the ranch set, was never on display at the Smithsonian.  Following completion of production, the prop was kept by the show's set designer.  It was sold several times including to Burghoff himself.[6]  It was sold at auction on July 29, 2005 for $11,800, it sold again on March 27, 2015 for $14,307.50 after 19 bids.[7]\\r\\n\\r\\nM*A*S*H was one of the first network series to feature brief partial nudity (notably Gary Burghoff's buttocks in \\"The Sniper\\" and Hawkeye in one of the \\"Dear Dad\\" episodes). A different innovation was the show's producers' desire not to have a laugh track, contrary to the network's desire to have one. They compromised by omitting laughter in the scenes set in the operating room. The DVD releases of the series allow viewers to select an audio version with no laugh track.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn his blog, writer Ken Levine revealed that on one occasion, when the cast offered too many nitpicking \\"notes\\" on a script,  his writing partner and he changed the script to a \\"cold show\\" ÿ one set during the frigid Korean winter. The cast then had to stand around barrel fires in parkas at the Malibu ranch when the temperatures neared 100?F (38?C). Levine says, \\"This happened maybe twice, and we never got a ticky-tack note again.\\"[8]\\r\\n\\r\\nJackie Cooper wrote that Alan Alda, whom Cooper directed in several episodes during the first two seasons, concealed a lot of hostility beneath the surface, and the two of them barely spoke to each other by the time Cooper's tenure on the show ended.[9]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe helicopters used on the series were model H-13 Sioux (military designation and nickname of the Bell 47 civilian model). As in the film, some care seems to have been taken to use the correct model of the long-lived Bell 47 series. In the opening credits and many of the episodes, Korean War-vintage H-13Ds and Es (Bell 47D-1s) were used complete with period-correct external litters. A later (1954ÿ73) 47G occasionally made an appearance. The helicopters are similar in appearance (with the later \\"G\\" models having larger two-piece fuel tanks, a slightly revised cabin, and other changes) with differences noticeable only to a serious helicopter fan. In the pilot episode, a later Bell 47J (production began in 1957) was shown flying Henry Blake to Seoul, en route to a meeting with General Hammond in Tokyo.[10] A Sud Aviation Allouette II helicopter was also shown transporting Henry Blake to the 4077th in the episode \\"Henry, Please Come Home\\".\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Jeeps used were 1953 military M38 or civil CJ2A Willys Jeeps and also World War II Ford GPWs and Willys MB's. Two episodes featured the M38A1 Jeep, one of which was stolen from a General by Radar and Hawkeye after their Jeep was stolen. Two of the ambulances were WC-54 Dodges and one was a WC-27. A WC-54 ambulance remains at the site and was burned in the Malibu fires on October 9, 1982, while a second WC-27 survives at a South El Monte museum without any markings. The bus used to transport the wounded was a 1954 Ford model. In the last season, an M43 ambulance from the Korean War era also was used in conjunction with the WC-54s and WC-27.\\r\\n\\r\\nBell 47G helicopter in MASH colours.\\r\\n\\r\\nBurned Dodge ambulance at Malibu Creek State Park\\r\\n\\r\\nBurned Jeep (most likely a CJ-2A) at Malibu Creek State Park\\r\\n\\r\\nSeries creators Larry Gelbart and Gene Reynolds wanted M*A*S*H broadcast without a laugh track. Though CBS initially rejected the idea, a compromise was reached that allowed for omitting the laughter during operating room scenes if desired. \\"We told the network that under no circumstances would we ever can laughter during an OR scene when the doctors were working,\\" said Gelbart in 1998. \\"Its hard to imagine that 300 people were in there laughing at somebodys guts being sewn up.\\"[11]\\r\\n\\r\\nSeasons 1ÿ5 utilized a more invasive laugh track; a more subdued audience was employed for Seasons 6ÿ11 when the series shifted from sitcom to comedy-drama with the departure of Gelbart and Reynolds. Several episodes (\\"O.R.\\", \\"The Bus\\", \\"Quo Vadis, Captain Chandler?\\", \\"The Interview\\", \\"Point of View\\" and \\"Dreams\\" among them) omitted the laugh track altogether; as did almost all of Season 11, including the 135-minute series finale, \\"Goodbye, Farewell and Amen\\".[12] The laugh track is also omitted from some international and syndicated airings of the show; on one occasion during an airing on BBC2, the laugh track was accidentally left on, and viewers expressed their displeasure, an apology from the network for the \\"technical difficulty\\" was later released, as during its original run on BBC2 in the UK, it was shown without the laugh track.  UK DVD critics speak poorly of the laugh track, stating \\"canned laughter is intrusive at the best of times, but with a programme like M*A*S*H, it's downright unbearable.\\"[13]\\r\\n\\r\\nOn all released DVDs, both in Region 1 (including the US and Canada) and Region 2 (Europe, including the UK), an option is given to watch the show with or without the laugh track.[14][15]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\"They're a lie,\\" said Gelbart in a 1992 interview. \\"You're telling an engineer when to push a button to produce a laugh from people who don't exist. It's just so dishonest. The biggest shows when we were on the air were All in the Family and The Mary Tyler Moore Show both of which were taped before a live studio audience where laughter made sense,\\" continued Gelbart. \\"But our show was a film show ÿ supposedly shot in the middle of Korea. So the question I always asked the network was, 'Who are these laughing people? Where did they come from?'\\" Gelbart persuaded CBS to test the show in private screenings with and without the laugh track. The results showed no measurable difference in the audience's enjoyment. \\"So you know what they said?\\" Gelbart said. \\"'Since there's no difference, let's leave it alone!' The people who defend laugh tracks have no sense of humor.\\"[12] Gelbart summed up the situation by saying, \\"I always thought it cheapened the show. The network got their way. They were paying for dinner.\\"[16]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\"Goodbye, Farewell and Amen\\" was the final episode of M*A*S*H. Special television sets were placed in PX parking lots, auditoriums, and dayrooms of the US Army in Korea so that military personnel could watch that episode, in spite of 14 hours' time-zone difference with the East Coast of the US. The episode aired on February 28, 1983, and was 2? hours long. The episode got a Nielsen rating of 60.2 and 77 share[18] and according to a New York Times article from 1983, the final episode of M*A*S*H had 125 million viewers.[19]\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen the M*A*S*H finale aired in 1983, 83.3 million homes in the United States had televisions, compared to almost 115 million in February 2010.[20]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\"Goodbye, Farewell and Amen\\" broke the record for the highest percentage of homes with television sets to watch a television series. Stories persist that the episode was seen by so many people that the New York City Sanitation/Public Works Department reported the plumbing systems broke down in some parts of the city from so many New Yorkers waiting until the end to use the toilet. Articles copied into Alan Alda's book The Last Days of M*A*S*H include interviews with New York City Sanitation workers citing the spike in water use on that night. According to the interviews at 11:03 pm, EST New York City public works noted the highest water usage at one given time in the City's history. They attributed this to the fact that in the three minutes after the finale ended, around 77% of the people of New York City flushed their toilets.[21] These stories have all since been identified as part of an urban legend dating back to the days of the Amos and Andy radio program in the 1930s.[22]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe finale was referenced in a passage from Stephen Chbosky's coming-of-age novel The Perks of Being a Wallflower, in which the main character and his family watch the finale together.[23]\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd many more international broadcasts.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe series premiered in the US on September 17, 1972, and ended on February 28, 1983, with the finale, showcased as a television film, titled \\"Goodbye, Farewell and Amen\\", becoming the most-watched and highest-rated single television episode in US television history at the time, with a record-breaking 125 million viewers (60.2 rating and 77 share),[24] according to the New York Times.[19] It had struggled in its first season and was at risk of being cancelled.[25] Season two of M*A*S*H placed it in a better time slot (airing after the popular All in the Family); the show became one of the top 10 programs of the year and stayed in the top 20 programs for the rest of its run.[25] It is still broadcast in syndication on various television stations. The series, which depicted events occurring during a three-year war, spanned 256 episodes and lasted 11 seasons.  The Korean War lasted 1,128 days, meaning each episode of the series would have averaged almost four and a half days of real time. Many of the stories in the early seasons are based on tales told by real MASH surgeons who were interviewed by the production team. Like the movie, the series was as much an allegory about the Vietnam War (still in progress when the show began) as it was about the Korean War.[26]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe episodes \\"Abyssinia, Henry\\" and \\"The Interview\\" were ranked number 20 and number 80, respectively, on TV Guide's 100 Greatest Episodes of All Time in 1997.[27] In 2002, M*A*S*H was ranked number 25 on TV Guide's 50 Greatest TV Shows of All Time.[28] In 2013, the Writers Guild of America ranked it as the fifth-best written TV series ever[29] and TV Guide ranked it as the eighth-greatest show of all time.[30] In 2016, Rolling Stone ranked it as the sixteenth-greatest TV show.[31]\\r\\n\\r\\nM*A*S*H was nominated for over 100 Emmy Awards during its 11-year run, winning 14:\\r\\n\\r\\nThe show won the Golden Globe Award for Best Television Series (Musical or Comedy) in 1981.

This marked the first time the series was made available on an internet platform. As of July 1, 2015, all 11 seasons were available; syndicated versions of hour-long episodes were utilized for streaming, splitting these shows into two parts.[44] In contrast to the DVD sets, the Netflix streams did not have an option for disabling the laugh track on the soundtrack. On April 1, 2016, M*A*S*H was removed from Netflix due to its contract to stream the series expiring.[45]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn November 2016, SundanceTV announced it will begin airing M*A*S*H and several other classic TV shows.

The more successful Trapper John, M.D. (1979ÿ86) took place nearly three decades after the events of M*A*S*H and depicted Trapper John McIntyre as chief of surgery at a San Francisco hospital; its producers argued successfully in court that it was based on the earlier movie rather than the TV series.[49] In an unpurchased television pilot, W*A*L*T*E*R (1984), Walter \\"Radar\\" O'Reilly joins the St. Louis police force after his farm fails following his return to the US.\\r\\n\\r\\nMaking M*A*S*H, a documentary special narrated by Mary Tyler Moore that takes viewers behind the production of the season 8 episodes \\"Old Soldiers\\" and \\"Lend a Hand\\", was produced for PBS in 1981. The special was later included in the syndicated rerun package, with new narration by producer Michael Hirsch.[50]\\r\\n\\r\\nTwo retrospective specials were produced to commemorate the show's 20th and 30th anniversaries. Memories of M*A*S*H, hosted by Shelley Long and featuring clips from the series and interviews with cast members, was aired by CBS on November 25, 1991. A 30th Anniversary Reunion special, in which the surviving cast members and producers gathered to reminisce, aired on the Fox network on May 17, 2002. The two-hour broadcast was hosted by Mike Farrell, who also got to interact with the actor he replaced, Wayne Rogers; previously filmed interviews with McLean Stevenson and Larry Linville (who had died in 1996 and 2000, respectively) were also featured. The two specials are included as bonuses on the Collector's Edition DVD of \\"Goodbye, Farewell, and Amen\\".

This mistake arose owing to Marriott's first business, an A&W franchise[5]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1924, Allen bought Wright's share, obtained a trademark, and began selling restaurant franchises. A&W was one of the first franchised restaurant chains in the United States. Franchise owners could use the A&W name and logo and purchased concentrated root beer syrup from Allen. By 1933, there were more than 170 A&W franchised outlets. There was no common menu, architecture, or procedures shared by the franchisees and some chose to sell food with the root beer.[4]\\r\\n\\r\\nFranchises struggled with labor shortages and sugar rationing during World War II, but following the war, the number of A&W outlets tripled as GI loans paved the way for private enterprise. Driven by the popularity of the automobile and the new mobile society, more than 450 A&W Root Beer stands were operating by 1950. In that same year, Allen retired and sold the business to Nebraskan Gene Hurtz, who formed the A&W Root Beer Company. The first A&W Root Beer outlet in Canada opened in 1956.\\r\\n\\r\\nBy 1960, the number of A&W restaurants swelled to more than 2,000. In 1963, the A&W Root Beer Company was sold to the J. Hungerford Smith Company, which had produced Allen's concentrate since 1921. In the same year, the first overseas A&W restaurant opened its doors in Guam.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1963, the company was sold to the United Fruit Company, then renamed the United Brands Company. In 1971, United Brands formed a wholly owned subsidiary, A&W Distributing Co., for the purpose of making A&W Root Beer available in bottles on the grocery shelf. After a test run in Arizona and California, the products were distributed nationally in the United States, along with sugar-free, low-sodium, and caffeine-free versions. In 1974, A&W introduced \\"The Great Root Bear,\\" a mascot that served as a goodwill ambassador for the brand.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the late 1970s, A&W Restaurants was formed to manage restaurant franchising. It was bought in 1982 by A. Alfred Taubman.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1986, A&W Cream Soda and A&W Diet Cream Soda were introduced and distributed nationally, followed in 1987 by the reformulation of sugar-free A&W as Diet A&W.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn October 1993, A&W Beverages was folded into Cadbury Beverages. That company would spin off its US beverages business as Keurig Dr Pepper in 2008.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn March 2005, A&W began to appear in the Vintage Bottle, a 20-ounce bottle with graphics reminiscent of an old fashioned root beer barrel. The brand's current tagline is, \\"Classic American Refreshment Since 1919.\\"\\r\\n\\r\\nIn July 2017, A&W Canada reformulated its root beer, dropping High Fructose Corn Syrup from the recipe, substituting two herbs and cane sugar. The new formula comes with an ad campaign for one day of free Root Beer.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Great Root Bear, also called Rooty, is the mascot for A&W Root Beer. It was first used in 1974 by Canada's A&W, and was adopted by the American chain in 1976. In a long-running television advertising campaign for the Canadian A&W chain, his theme was a tuba-driven jingle entitled \\"Ba-Dum, Ba-Dum\\" and released as a single by Attic Records in Canada, credited to \\"Major Ursus\\", a play on the constellation name Ursa Major, which means \\"great bear\\". In the late 1990s, the Great Root Bear's role as mascot was reduced for the restaurant chain, ultimately replaced by \\"The Burger Family\\", although it still appeared in various capacities for the restaurants and on A&W Root Beer cases in Canada.[citation needed] In late 2011, the new ownership of A&W began using the mascot again, particularly in A&W's online presence.[7]\\r\\n\\r\\nShortly after Allen bought out Wright's portion of the business, he began franchising the product. His profits came from a small franchise fee and sales of concentrate. There was no standard food menu for franchises until 1978. By 1960, they had 2,000 stores.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1989, A&W made an agreement with Minnesota-based chain Carousel Snack Bars to convert that chain's 200 locations (mostly kiosks in shopping malls) to \\"A&W Hot Dogs & More\\".[8][9] Some A&W Hot Dogs & More locations are in operation today.\\r\\n\\r\\nMany A&W locations that opened in the U.S. during the Yum! Brands ownership years (2002ÿ2011) were co-branded with Yum!'s other chainsLong John Silver's, Taco Bell, Pizza Hut, or Kentucky Fried Chicken.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs of December 2011, A&W was bought by new ownership and their World Headquarters moved back to Lexington, Kentucky. Since then, in the United States and Southeast Asia, A&W has been a franchisee-owned company.[10]","input":"What company makes a and w root beer?"},{"output":"16 January 1793","context":"The history of Australia from 1788ÿ1850 covers the early colonial period of Australia's history, from the arrival in 1788 of the First Fleet of British ships at Sydney, New South Wales, who established the penal colony, the scientific exploration of the continent and later, establishment of other Australian colonies and the beginnings of representative democratic government.\\r\\nEuropean colonisation created a new dominant society in Australia in place of the pre-existing population of Indigenous Australians, and socio-political debate continues in the 21st century as to whether the colonisation process should be described as settlement, invasion, or a mixture of both.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nIt is commonly reported that the colonisation of Australia was driven by the need to address overcrowding in the British prison system, and the fact of the British losing the Thirteen Colonies of America in the American Revolution; however, it was simply not economically viable to transport convicts halfway around the world for this reason alone.[1] Many convicts were either skilled tradesmen or farmers who had been convicted for trivial crimes and were sentenced to seven years transportation, the time required to set up the infrastructure for the new colony. Convicts were often given pardons prior to or on completion of their sentences and were allocated parcels of land to farm.\\r\\nSir Joseph Banks, the eminent scientist who had accompanied Lieutenant James Cook on his 1770 voyage, recommended Botany Bay as a suitable site.[2] Banks accepted an offer of assistance which by the American Loyalist James Matra in July 1783. Matra had visited Botany Bay with Banks in 1770 as a junior officer on the Endeavour commanded by James Cook. Under Banks's guidance, he rapidly produced \\"A Proposal for Establishing a Settlement in New South Wales\\" (24 August 1783), with a fully developed set of reasons for a colony composed of American Loyalists, Chinese and South Sea Islanders (but not convicts).[3]\\r\\nFollowing an interview with Secretary of State Lord Sydney in March 1784, Matra amended his proposal to include convicts as settlers.[4] Matras plan can be seen to have provided the original blueprint for settlement in New South Wales.[5] A cabinet memorandum December 1784 shows the Government had Matras plan in mind when considering the creation of a settlement in New South Wales.[5][6] The London Chronicle of 12 October 1786 said: Mr. Matra, an Officer of the Treasury, who, sailing with Capt. Cook, had an opportunity of visiting Botany Bay, is the Gentleman who suggested the plan to Government of transporting convicts to that island. The Government also incorporated into the colonisation plan the project for settling Norfolk Island, with its attractions of timber and flax, proposed by Bankss Royal Society colleagues, Sir John Call and Sir George Young.[7]\\r\\nOn 13 May 1787, the First Fleet of 11 ships and about 1,530 people (736 convicts, 17 convicts' children, 211 marines, 27 marines' wives, 14 marines' children and about 300 officers and others) under the command of Captain Arthur Phillip set sail for Botany Bay.[8][9][10] A few days after arrival at Botany Bay the fleet moved to the more suitable Port Jackson where a settlement was established at Sydney Cove on 26 January 1788.[11] This date later became Australia's national day, Australia Day. The colony was formally proclaimed by Governor Phillip on 7 February 1788 at Sydney. Sydney Cove offered a fresh water supply and a safe harbour, which Philip famously described as:[12]\\r\\nPhillip named the settlement after the Home Secretary, Thomas Townshend, 1st Baron Sydney (Viscount Sydney from 1789). The only people at the flag raising ceremony and the formal taking of possession of the land in the name of King George III were Phillip and a few dozen marines and officers from the Supply, the rest of the ship's company and the convicts witnessing it from on board ship. The remaining ships of the Fleet were unable to leave Botany Bay until later on 26 January because of a tremendous gale.[13] The new colony was formally proclaimed as the Colony of New South Wales on 7 February.[14]\\r\\nOn 24 January 1788 a French expedition of two ships led by Admiral Jean-Fran?ois de La Prouse had arrived off Botany Bay, on the latest leg of a three-year voyage that had taken them from Brest, around Cape Horn, up the coast from Chile to California, north-west to Kamchatka, south-east to Easter Island, north-west to Macao, and on to the Philippines, the Friendly Isles, Hawaii and Norfolk Island.[15] Though amicably received, the French expedition was a troublesome matter for the British, as it showed the interest of France in the new land.\\r\\nNevertheless, on 2 February Lieutenant King, at Phillip's request, paid a courtesy call on the French and offered them any assistance they may need.[13] The French made the same offer to the British, as they were much better provisioned than the British and had enough supplies to last three years.[13] Neither of these offers was accepted. On 10 March[13] the French expedition, having taken on water and wood, left Botany Bay, never to be seen again. Phillip and La Prouse never met. La Prouse is remembered in a Sydney suburb of that name. Various other French geographical names along the Australian coast also date from this expedition.\\r\\nGovernor Phillip was vested with complete authority over the inhabitants of the colony. Phillip's personal intent was to establish harmonious relations with local Aboriginal people and try to reform as well as discipline the convicts of the colony. Phillip and several of his officers ÿ most notably Watkin Tench ÿ left behind journals and accounts of which tell of immense hardships during the first years of settlement. Often Phillip's officers despaired for the future of New South Wales. Early efforts at agriculture were fraught and supplies from overseas were few and far between. Between 1788 and 1792 about 3546 male and 766 female convicts were landed at Sydney ÿ many \\"professional criminals\\" with few of the skills required for the establishment of a colony. Many new arrivals were also sick or unfit for work and the conditions of healthy convicts only deteriorated with hard labour and poor sustenance in the settlement. The food situation reached crisis point in 1790 and the Second Fleet which finally arrived in June 1790 had lost a quarter of its \\"passengers\\" through sickness, while the condition of the convicts of the Third Fleet appalled Phillip. From 1791 however, the more regular arrival of ships and the beginnings of trade lessened the feeling of isolation and improved supplies.[16]\\r\\nIn 1792, two French ships, La Recherche and L'Esprance anchored in a harbour near Tasmania's southernmost point they called Recherche Bay. This was at a time when Britain and France were trying to be the first to discover and colonise Australia. The expedition carried scientists and cartographers, gardeners, artists and hydrographers who, variously, planted, identified, mapped, marked, recorded and documented the environment and the people of the new lands that they encountered at the behest of the fledgling Socit D'Histoire Naturelle.\\r\\nWhite settlement began with a consignment of English convicts, guarded by a detachment of the Royal Marines, a number of whom subsequently stayed in the colony as settlers. Their view of the colony and their place in it was eloquently stated by Captain David Collins: \\"From the disposition to crimes and the incorrigible character of the major part of the colonists, an odium was, from the first, illiberally thrown upon the settlement; and the word \\"Botany Bay\\" became a term of reproach that was indiscriminately cast upon every one who resided in New South Wales. But let the reproach light upon those who have used it as such... if the honour of having deserved well of one's country be attainable by sacrificing good name, domestic comforts, and dearest connections in her service, the officers of this settlement have justly merited that distinction\\".[17]\\r\\nWhen the Bellona transport came to anchor in Sydney Cove on 16 January 1793, she brought with her the first immigrant free settlers. They were: Thomas Rose, a farmer from Dorset, his wife and four children; he was allowed a grant of 120 acres; Frederic Meredith, who had formerly been at Sydney with HMS Sirius; Thomas Webb (who had also been formerly at Sydney with the Sirius), his wife, and his nephew, Joseph Webb; Edward Powell, who had formerly been at Sydney with the Juliana transport, and who married a free woman after his arrival. Thomas Webb and Edward Powell each received a grant of 80 acres; and Joseph Webb and Frederic Meredith received 60 acres each.\\r\\nThe conditions they had come out under were that they should be provided with a free passage, be furnished with agricultural tools and implements by the Government, have two years' provisions, and have grants of land free of expense. They were likewise to have the labour of a certain number of convicts, who were also to be provided with two years' rations and one year's clothing from the public stores. The land assigned to them was some miles to the westward of Sydney, at a place named by the settlers, \\"Liberty Plains\\". It is now the area covered mainly by the suburbs of Strathfield and Homebush.\\r\\nOne in three convicts transported after 1798 was Irish, about a fifth of whom were transported in connection with the political and agrarian disturbances common in Ireland at the time. While the settlers were reasonably well-equipped, little consideration had been given to the skills required to make the colony self-supporting ÿ few of the first wave convicts had farming or trade experience (nor the soldiers), and the lack of understanding of Australia's seasonal patterns saw initial attempts at farming fail, leaving only what animals and birds the soldiers were able to shoot. The colony nearly starved, and Phillip was forced to send a ship to Batavia (Jakarta) for supplies. Some relief arrived with the Second Fleet in 1790, but life was extremely hard for the first few years of the colony.\\r\\nConvicts were usually sentenced to seven or fourteen years' penal servitude, or \\"for the term of their natural lives\\". Often these sentences had been commuted from the death sentence, which was technically the punishment for a wide variety of crimes. Upon arrival in a penal colony, convicts would be assigned to various kinds of work. Those with trades were given tasks to fit their skills (stonemasons, for example, were in very high demand) while the unskilled were assigned to work gangs to build roads and do other such tasks. Female convicts were usually assigned as domestic servants to the free settlers, many being forced into prostitution.[18]\\r\\nWhere possible, convicts were assigned to free settlers who would be responsible for feeding and disciplining them; in return for this, the settlers were granted land. This system reduced the workload on the central administration. Those convicts who weren't assigned to settlers were housed at barracks such as the Hyde Park Barracks or the Parramatta female factory.\\r\\nConvict discipline was harsh; convicts who would not work or who disobeyed orders were punished by flogging, being put in stricter confinement (e.g. leg-irons), or being transported to a stricter penal colony. The penal colonies at Port Arthur and Moreton Bay, for instance, were stricter than the one at Sydney, and the one at Norfolk Island was strictest of all. Convicts were assigned to work gangs to build roads, buildings, and the like. Female convicts, who made up 20% of the convict population, were usually assigned as domestic help to soldiers. Those convicts who behaved were eventually issued with ticket of leave, which allowed them a certain degree of freedom. Those who saw out their full sentences or were granted a pardon usually remained in Australia as free settlers, and were able to take on convict servants themselves.\\r\\nIn 1789 former convict James Ruse produced the first successful wheat harvest in NSW. He repeated this success in 1790 and, because of the pressing need for food production in the colony, was rewarded by Governor Phillip with the first land grant made in New South Wales. Ruse's 30 acre grant at Rose Hill, near Parramatta, was aptly named 'Experiment Farm'.[19] This was the colony's first successful farming enterprise, and Ruse was soon joined by others. The colony began to grow enough food to support itself, and the standard of living for the residents gradually improved.\\r\\nIn 1804 the Castle Hill convict rebellion was led by around 200 escaped, mostly Irish convicts, although it was broken up quickly by the New South Wales Corps. On 26 January 1808, there was a military rebellion against Governor Bligh led by John Macarthur. Following this, Governor Lachlan Macquarie was given a mandate to restore government and discipline in the colony. When he arrived in 1810, he forcibly deported the NSW Corps and brought the 73rd regiment to replace them.\\r\\n[24]\\r\\nIn October 1795 George Bass and Matthew Flinders, accompanied by William Martin sailed the boat Tom Thumb out of Port Jackson to Botany Bay and explored the Georges River further upstream than had been done previously by the colonists. Their reports on their return led to the settlement of Banks' Town.[25] In March 1796 the same party embarked on a second voyage in a similar small boat, which they also called the Tom Thumb.[26] During this trip they travelled as far down the coast as Lake Illawarra, which they called Tom Thumb Lagoon. They discovered and explored Port Hacking. In 1798ÿ99, Bass and Flinders set out in a sloop and circumnavigated Van Diemen's Land, thus proving it to be an island.[27]\\r\\nAboriginal guides and assistance in the European exploration of the colony were common and often vital to the success of missions. In 1801ÿ02 Matthew Flinders in The Investigator lead the first circumnavigation of Australia. Aboard ship was the Aboriginal explorer Bungaree, of the Sydney district, who became the first person born on the Australian continent to circumnavigate the Australian continent.[27] Previously, the famous Bennelong and a companion had become the first people born in the area of New South Wales to sail for Europe, when, in 1792 they accompanied Governor Phillip to England and were presented to King George III.[27]\\r\\nIn 1813, Gregory Blaxland, William Lawson and William Wentworth succeeded in crossing the formidable barrier of forested gulleys and sheer cliffs presented by the Blue Mountains, west of Sydney, by following the ridges instead of looking for a route through the valleys. At Mount Blaxland they looked out over \\"enough grass to support the stock of the colony for thirty years\\", and expansion of the British settlement into the interior could begin.[28]\\r\\nIn 1824 the Governor Sir Thomas Brisbane, commissioned Hamilton Hume and former Royal Navy Captain William Hovell to lead an expedition to find new grazing land in the south of the colony, and also to find an answer to the mystery of where New South Wales's western rivers flowed. Over 16 weeks in 1824ÿ25, Hume and Hovell journeyed to Port Phillip and back. They made many important discoveries including the Murray River (which they named the Hume), many of its tributaries, and good agricultural and grazing lands between Gunning, New South Wales and Corio Bay, Victoria.[29]\\r\\nCharles Sturt led an expedition along the Macquarie River in 1828 and discovered the Darling River. A theory had developed that the inland rivers of New South Wales were draining into an inland sea. Leading a second expedition in 1829, Sturt followed the Murrumbidgee River into a 'broad and noble river', the Murray River, which he named after Sir George Murray, secretary of state for the colonies. His party then followed this river to its junction with the Darling River, facing two threatening encounters with local Aboriginal people along the way. Sturt continued down river on to Lake Alexandrina, where the Murray meets the sea in South Australia. Suffering greatly, the party had to then row back upstream hundreds of kilometres for the return journey.[30]\\r\\nSurveyor General Sir Thomas Mitchell conducted a series of expeditions from the 1830s to 'fill in the gaps' left by these previous expeditions. He was meticulous in seeking to record the original Aboriginal place names around the colony, for which reason the majority of place names to this day retain their Aboriginal titles.[31]\\r\\nThe Polish scientist/explorer Count Paul Edmund Strzelecki conducted surveying work in the Australian Alps in 1839 and became the first European to ascend Australia's highest peak, which he named Mount Kosciuszko in honour of the Polish patriot Tadeusz Kosciuszko.[32]\\r\\nTraditional Aboriginal society had been governed by councils of elders and a corporate decision-making process, but the first European-style governments established after 1788 were autocratic and run by appointed governors ÿ although English law was transplanted into the Australian colonies by virtue of the doctrine of reception, thus notions of the rights and processes established by the Magna Carta and the Bill of Rights 1689 were brought from Britain by the colonists. Agitation for representative government began soon after the settlement of the colonies.[33]\\r\\nThe Second Fleet in 1790 brought to Sydney two men who were to play important roles in the colony's future. One was D'Arcy Wentworth, whose son, William Charles, went on to be an explorer, to found Australia's first newspaper and to become a leader of the movement to abolish convict transportation and establish representative government. The other was John Macarthur, a Scottish army officer and founder of the Australian wool industry, which laid the foundations of Australia's future prosperity. Macarthur was a turbulent element: in 1808 he was one of the leaders of the Rum Rebellion against the governor, William Bligh.\\r\\nFrom about 1815 the colony, under the governorship of Lachlan Macquarie, began to grow rapidly as free settlers arrived and new lands were opened up for farming. Despite the long and arduous sea voyage, settlers were attracted by the prospect of making a new life on virtually free Crown land. From the late 1820s settlement was only authorised in the limits of location, known as the Nineteen Counties.\\r\\nMany settlers occupied land without authority and beyond these authorised settlement limits: they were known as squatters and became the basis of a powerful landowning class. As a result of opposition from the labouring and artisan classes, transportation of convicts to Sydney ended in 1840, although it continued in the smaller colonies of Van Diemen's Land (first settled in 1803, later renamed Tasmania) and Moreton Bay (founded 1824, and later renamed Queensland) for a few years more.\\r\\nThe Swan River Settlement (as Western Australia was originally known), centred on Perth, was founded in 1829. The colony suffered from a long-term shortage of labour, and by 1850 local capitalists had succeeded in persuading London to send convicts. (Transportation did not end until 1868.) New Zealand was part of New South Wales until 1840 when it became a separate colony.\\r\\nThe first governments established after 1788 were autocratic and each colony was governed by a British Governor, appointed by the British monarch. There was considerable unhappiness with the way some of the colonies were run. In most cases the administration of the early colonies was carried out by the British military. The New South Wales Corps, which was in charge of New South Wales, became known as the \\"Rum Corps\\", due to its stranglehold on the distribution of rum, which was used as a makeshift currency at the time. In New South Wales this led to the \\"Rum Rebellion\\". Although English law was transplanted into the Australian colonies by virtue of the doctrine of reception, thus notions of the rights and processes established by the Magna Carta and the Bill of Rights 1689 were brought from Britain by the colonists. Agitation for representative government began soon after the settlement of the colonies.[33]\\r\\nThe oldest legislative body in Australia, the New South Wales Legislative Council, was created in 1825 as an appointed body to advise the Governor of New South Wales. William Wentworth established the Australian Patriotic Association (Australia's first political party) in 1835 to demand democratic government for New South Wales. The reformist attorney general, John Plunkett, sought to apply Enlightenment principles to governance in the colony, pursuing the establishment of equality before the law, first by extending jury rights to emancipists, then by extending legal protections to convicts, assigned servants and Aborigines. Plunkett twice charged the colonist perpetrators of the Myall Creek massacre of Aborigines with murder, resulting in a conviction and his landmark Church Act of 1836 disestablished the Church of England and established legal equality between Anglicans, Catholics, Presbyterians and later Methodists.[34]\\r\\nIn 1840, the Adelaide City Council and the Sydney City Council were established. Men who possessed 1000 pounds worth of property were able to stand for election and wealthy landowners were permitted up to four votes each in elections. Australia's first parliamentary elections were conducted for the New South Wales Legislative Council in 1843, again with voting rights (for males only) tied to property ownership or financial capacity. Voter rights were extended further in New South Wales in 1850 and elections for legislative councils were held in the colonies of Victoria, South Australia and Tasmania.[35]\\r\\nBy the mid-19th century, there was a strong desire for representative and responsible government in the colonies of Australia, later fed by the democratic spirit of the goldfields and the ideas of the great reform movements sweeping Europe, the United States and the British Empire. The end of convict transportation accelerated reform in the 1840s and 1850s. The Australian Colonies Government Act [1850] was a landmark development which granted representative constitutions to New South Wales, Victoria, South Australia and Tasmania and the colonies enthusiastically set about writing constitutions which produced democratically progressive parliaments ÿ though the constitutions generally maintained the role of the colonial upper houses as representative of social and economic \\"interests\\" and all established constitutional monarchies with the British monarch as the symbolic head of state.[36]\\r\\nThe colonies relied heavily on imports from England for survival. The official currency of the colonies was the British pound, but the unofficial currency and most readily accepted trade good was rum. During this period Australian businessmen began to prosper. For example, the partnership of Berry and Wollstonecraft made enormous profits by means of land grants, convict labour, and exporting native cedar back to England.\\r\\nSince time immemorial in Australia, indigenous people had performed the rites and rituals of the animist religion of the Dreamtime. The permanent presence of Christianity in Australia however, came with the arrival of the First Fleet of British convict ships at Sydney in 1788. As a British colony, the predominant Christian denomination was the Church of England, but one-tenth of all the convicts who came to Australia on the First Fleet were Catholic, and at least half of them were born in Ireland.[37]\\r\\nA small proportion of British marines were also Catholic. Some of the Irish convicts had been Transported to Australia for political crimes or social rebellion in Ireland, so the authorities were suspicious of the minority religion for the first three decades of settlement.[38] It was therefore the crew of the French explorer La Prouse who conducted the first Catholic ceremony on Australian soil in 1788 ÿ the burial of Father Louis Receveur, a Franciscan monk, who died while the ships were at anchor at Botany Bay, while on a mission to explore the Pacific.[39]\\r\\nIn early colonial times, Church of England clergy worked closely with the governors. Richard Johnson, Anglican chaplain to the First Fleet, was charged by the governor, Arthur Phillip, with improving \\"public morality\\" in the colony, but he was also heavily involved in health and education.[40] The Reverend Samuel Marsden (1765ÿ1838) had magisterial duties, and so was equated with the authorities by the convicts. He became known as the 'floging parson' for the severity of his punishments[41]\\r\\nCatholic convicts were compelled to attend Church of England services and their children and orphans were raised by the authorities as Protestant.[42] The first Catholic priest colonists arrived in Australia as convicts in 1800 ÿ James Harold, James Dixon, and Peter O'Neill, who had been convicted for 'complicity' in the Irish 1798 Rebellion. Fr Dixon was conditionally emancipated and permitted to celebrate Mass. On 15 May 1803, in vestments made from curtains and with a chalice made of tin he conducted the first Catholic Mass in New South Wales.[42]\\r\\nThe Irish led Castle Hill Rebellion of 1804 alarmed the British authorities and Dixon's permission to celebrate Mass was revoked. Fr Jeremiah Flynn, an Irish Cistercian, was appointed as Prefect Apostolic of New Holland, and set out from Britain for the colony, uninvited. Watched by authorities, Flynn secretly performed priestly duties before being arrested and deported to London. Reaction to the affair in Britain led to two further priests being allowed to travel to the Colony in 1820 ÿ John Joseph Therry and Philip Connolly.[38] The foundation stone for the first St Mary's Cathedral, Sydney was laid on 29 October 1821 by Governor Lachlan Macquarie.\\r\\nThe absence of a Catholic mission in Australia before 1818 reflected the legal disabilities of Catholics in Britain and the difficult position of Ireland within the British Empire. The government therefore endorsed the English Benedictines to lead the early Church in the Colony.[43] The Church of England lost its legal privileges in the Colony of New South Wales by the Church Act of 1836. Drafted by the reformist attorney-general John Plunkett, the Act established legal equality for Anglicans, Catholics and Presbyterians and was later extended to Methodists.[44] Catholic missionary William Ullathorne criticised the convict system, publishing a pamphlet, The Horrors of Transportation Briefly Unfolded to the People, in Britain in 1837.[45] Laywoman Caroline Chisolm did ecumenical work to alleviate the suffering of female migrants.\\r\\nInitially, education was informal, primarily occurring in the home.[citation needed] At the instigation of the then British Prime Minister, the Duke of Wellington, and with the patronage of King William IV, Australia's oldest surviving independent school, The King's School, Parramatta, was founded in 1831 as part of an effort to establish grammar schools in the colony.[46] By 1833, there were around ten Catholic schools in the Australian colonies.[38] Today one in five Australian students attend Catholic schools.[47]\\r\\nSydney's first Catholic Bishop, John Bede Polding requested a community of nuns be sent to the colony and five Irish Sisters of Charity arrived in 1838 to set about pastoral care of convict women and work in schools and hospitals before going on to found their own schools and hospitals.[48] At Polding's request, the Christian Brothers arrived in Sydney in 1843 to assist in schools. Establishing themselves first at Sevenhill, in South Australia in 1848, the Jesuits were the first religious order of priests to enter and establish houses in South Australia, Victoria, Queensland and the Northern Territory ÿ where they established schools and missions.\\r\\nSome Australian folksongs date to this period.\\r\\nAmong the first true works of Australian literature produced over this period was the accounts of the settlement of Sydney by Watkin Tench, a captain of the marines on the First Fleet to arrive in 1788. In 1819, poet, explorer, journalist and politician William Wentworth published the first book written by an Australian: A Statistical, Historical, and Political Description of the Colony of New South Wales and Its Dependent Settlements in Van Diemen's Land, With a Particular Enumeration of the Advantages Which These Colonies Offer for Emigration and Their Superiority in Many Respects Over Those Possessed by the United States of America,[49] in which he advocated an elected assembly for New South Wales, trial by jury and settlement of Australia by free emigrants rather than convicts. In 1838 The Guardian: a tale by Anna Maria Bunn was published in Sydney. It was the first Australian novel printed and published in mainland Australia and the first Australian novel written by a woman. It is a Gothic romance.[50]\\r\\nEuropean traditions of Australian theatre also came with the First Fleet, with the first production being performed in 1789 by convicts?: The Recruiting Officer by George Farquhar.[51] Two centuries later, the extraordinary circumstances of the foundations of Australian theatre were recounted in Our Country's Good by Timberlake Wertenbaker: the participants were prisoners watched by sadistic guards and the leading lady was under threat of the death penalty. The play is based on Thomas Keneally's novel The Playmaker.[51] The Theatre Royal, Hobart, opened in 1837 and it remains the oldest theatre in Australia.[52] The Melbourne Athenaeum is one of the oldest public institutions in Australia, founded in 1839 and it served as library, school of arts and dance hall (and later became Australia's first cinema, screening The Story of the Kelly Gang, the world's first feature film in 1906).[53] The Queen's Theatre, Adelaide opened with Shakespeare in 1841 and is today the oldest theatre on the mainland.[54]\\r\\nAboriginal reactions to the sudden arrival of British settlers were varied, but often hostile when the presence of the colonisers led to competition over resources, and to the occupation by the British of Aboriginal lands. European diseases decimated Aboriginal populations, and the occupation or destruction of lands and food resources led to starvation. By contrast with New Zealand, where the Treaty of Waitangi was seen to legitimise British settlement, no treaty was signed with Aborigines, who never authorised British colonisation.\\r\\nAccording to the historian Geoffrey Blainey, in Australia during the colonial period:\\r\\n\\"In a thousand isolated places there were occasional shootings and spearings. Even worse, smallpox, measles, influenza and other new diseases swept from one Aboriginal camp to another... The main conqueror of Aborigines was to be disease and its ally, demoralisation\\".[55]\\r\\nSince the 1980s, the use of the word \\"invasion\\" to describe the British colonisation of Australia has been highly controversial. According to Australian Henry Reynolds however, government officials and ordinary settlers in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries frequently used words such as \\"invasion\\" and \\"warfare\\" to describe their presence and relations with Indigenous Australians. In his book The Other Side of the Frontier,[56] Reynolds described in detail armed resistance by Aboriginal people to white encroachments by means of guerilla warfare, beginning in the eighteenth century and continuing into the early twentieth.\\r\\nIn the early years of colonisation, David Collins, the senior legal officer in the Sydney settlement, wrote of local Aborigines:\\r\\nWhile they entertain the idea of our having dispossessed them of their residences, they must always consider us as enemies; and upon this principle they [have] made a point of attacking the white people whenever opportunity and safety concurred.[57]\\r\\nIn 1847, Western Australian barrister E.W. Landor stated: \\"We have seized upon the country, and shot down the inhabitants, until the survivors have found it expedient to submit to our rule. We have acted as Julius Caesar did when he took possession of Britain.\\"[58] In most cases, Reynolds says, Aborigines initially resisted British presence. In a letter to the Launceston Advertiser in 1831, a settler wrote:\\r\\nWe are at war with them: they look upon us as enemies ÿ as invaders ÿ as oppressors and persecutors ÿ they resist our invasion. They have never been subdued, therefore they are not rebellious subjects, but an injured nation, defending in their own way, their rightful possessions which have been torn from them by force.[59]\\r\\nReynolds quotes numerous writings by settlers who, in the first half of the nineteenth century, described themselves as living in fear and even in terror due to attacks by Aborigines determined to kill them or drive them off their lands. He argues that Aboriginal resistance was, in some cases at least, temporarily effective; the Aboriginal killings of men, sheep and cattle, and burning of white homes and crops, drove some settlers to ruin. Aboriginal resistance continued well beyond the middle of the nineteenth century, and in 1881 the editor of The Queenslander wrote:\\r\\nDuring the last four or five years the human life and property destroyed by the aborigines in the North total up to a serious amount. [...] [S]ettlement on the land, and the development of the mineral and other resources on the country, have been in a great degree prohibited by the hostility of the blacks, which still continues with undiminished spirit.[60]\\r\\nReynolds argues that continuous Aboriginal resistance for well over a century belies the \\"myth\\" of peaceful settlement in Australia. Settlers in turn often reacted to Aboriginal resistance with great violence, resulting in numerous indiscriminate massacres by whites of Aboriginal men, women and children.[61] Among the most famous massacres of the early nineteenth century were the Pinjarra massacre and the Myall Creek massacre.\\r\\nFamous Aborigines who resisted British colonisation in the eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries include Pemulwuy and Yagan. In Tasmania, the \\"Black War\\" was fought in the first half of the nineteenth century.\\r\\nHistory of Australia:","input":"When did free settlers first arrived in australia?"},{"output":"the United States","context":"","input":"What was america called after the revolutionary war?"},{"output":"Bahadur Shah Zafar","context":"The Mughal emperors, from the early 16th century to the early 18th century, built and ruled the Mughal Empire on the Indian subcontinent, mainly corresponding to the modern countries of India, Pakistan, Afghanistan and Bangladesh. The Mughals were a branch of the Timurid dynasty of Turkic origin from what is now Uzbekistan. Their power rapidly dwindled during the 18th century and the last of the emperors was deposed in 1857, with the establishment of the British Raj.[1] Mughal emperors were of direct descent from Timur (generally known in the West as Tamerlane the Great), and also affiliated with Genghis Khan, because of Timurs marriage with a Genghizid princess.\\r\\nThe Mughals also had significant Indian Rajput and Persian ancestry through marriage alliances, as emperors were born to Rajput and Persian princesses.[2][3] Only the first two Mughal emperors, Babur and Humayun, were fully Central Asian (Turki or what is now known as Uzbek), whereas Akbar was half-Persian (his mother was of Persian origin), Jahangir was half-Rajput and quarter-Persian, and Shah Jahan was three-quarters Rajput.[4] Nevertheless, all Mughals were of Turkic seeds.\\r\\nAt their Empire's greatest extent in the late 17th and early 18th centuries, Mughals controlled much of the Indian subcontinent, extending from Bengal in the east to Kabul and Sindh in the west, Kashmir in the north to the Kaveri basin in the south.[5] Its population at the time has been estimated as between 110 and 150 million (a quarter of the world's population), over a territory of more than 3.2 million square kilometres (1.2 million square miles).[6]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Mughal Empire (also referred to as Baburid Empire, Baburid Dynasty) was founded by Zahiriddin Muhammad Babur, a Timurid prince and ruler from Turan or Turkistan, i.e. Central Asia (Uzbekistan). Babur was a direct descendant to the Turkic Emperor Timur on his father's side and also had links to Chagatai, the second son of the Mongol ruler Genghis Khan, on his mothers side.[7] Ousted from his ancestral domains in Turkistan by Sheybani Khan, the 14-year old Prince Babur turned to India to satisfy his ambitions. He established himself in Kabul and then pushed steadily southward into India from Afghanistan through the Khyber Pass.[7] Babur's forces occupied much of northern India after his victory at Panipat in 1526.[7] The preoccupation with wars and military campaigns, however, did not allow the new emperor to consolidate the gains he had made in India.[7] The instability of the empire became evident under his son, Humayun, who was driven out of India and into Persia by rebels.[7] Humayun's exile in Persia established diplomatic ties between the Safavid and Mughal Courts, and led to increasing West Asian cultural influence in the Mughal court. The restoration of Mughal rule began after Humayuns triumphant return from Persia in 1555, but he died from a fatal accident shortly afterwards.[7] Humayun's son, Akbar, succeeded to the throne under a regent, Bairam Khan, who helped consolidate the Mughal Empire in India.[7]\\r\\nThrough warfare and diplomacy, Akbar was able to extend the empire in all directions, and controlled almost the entire Indian subcontinent north of the Godavari river. He created a new class of nobility loyal to him from the military aristocracy of India's social groups, implemented a modern government and supported cultural developments.[7] At the same time Akbar intensified trade with European trading companies. The Indian historian Abraham Eraly wrote that foreigners were often impressed by the fabulous wealth of the Mughal court, but the glittering court hid darker realities, namely that about a quarter of the empire's gross national product was owned by 655 families while the bulk of India's 120 million people lived in appalling poverty.[8] After suffering what appears to have been an epileptic seizure in 1578 while hunting tigers, which he regarded as a religious experience, Akbar grew disenchanted with Islam, and came to embrace a syncretistic mixture of Hinduism and Islam.[9] Akbar allowed free expression of religion and attempted to resolve socio-political and cultural differences in his empire by establishing a new religion, Din-i-Ilahi, with strong characteristics of a ruler cult.[7] He left his successors an internally stable state, which was in the midst of its golden age, but before long signs of political weakness would emerge.[7] Akbar's son, Jahangir, ruled the empire at its peak, but he was addicted to opium, neglected the affairs of the state, and came under the influence of rival court cliques.[7] During the reign of Jahangir's son, Shah Jahan, the culture and splendour of the luxurious Mughal court reached its zenith as exemplified by the Taj Mahal.[7] The maintenance of the court, at this time, began to cost more than the revenue.[7]\\r\\nShah Jahan's eldest son, the liberal Dara Shikoh, became regent in 1658, as a result of his father's illness. However, a younger son, Aurangzeb, allied with the Islamic orthodoxy against his brother, who championed a syncretistic Hindu-Muslim religion and culture, and ascended to the throne. Aurangzeb defeated Dara in 1659 and had him executed.[7] Although Shah Jahan fully recovered from his illness, Aurangzeb declared him incompetent to rule and had him imprisoned. During Aurangzeb's reign, the empire gained political strength once more, but his religious conservatism and intolerance undermined the stability of Mughal society.[7] Aurangzeb expanded the empire to include almost the whole of South Asia, but at his death in 1707, many parts of the empire were in open revolt.[7] Aurangzeb's attempts to reconquer his family's ancestral lands in Central Asia - Turan were not successful while his successful conquest of the Deccan region proved to be a Pyrrhic victory that cost the empire heavily in both blood and treasure.[10] A further problem for Aurangzeb was the army had always been based upon the land-owning aristocracy of northern India who provided the cavalry for the campaigns, and the empire had nothing equivalent to the Janissary corps of the Ottoman Empire.[11] The long and costly conquest of the Deccan had badly dented the \\"aura of success\\" that surrounded Aurangzeb, and from the late 17th century onwards, the aristocracy become increasing unwilling to provide forces for the empire's wars as the prospect of being rewarded with land as a result of a successful war was seen as less and less likely.[12] Furthermore, the fact that at the conclusion of the conquest of the Deccan, Aurangzeb had very selectively rewarded some of the noble families with confiscated land in the Deccan had left those aristocrats who received no confiscated land as reward and for whom the conquest of the Deccan had cost dearly, feeling badly disgruntled and unwilling to participate in further campaigns.[13] Aurangzeb's son, Shah Alam, repealed the religious policies of his father, and attempted to reform the administration. However, after his death in 1712, the Mughal dynasty sank into chaos and violent feuds. In the year 1719 alone, four emperors successively ascended the throne.[7]\\r\\nDuring the reign of Muhammad Shah, the empire began to break up, and vast tracts of central India passed from Mughal to Maratha hands. Mughal warfare had always been based upon heavy artillery for sieges, heavy cavalry for offensive operations and light cavalry for skirmishing and raids.[10] To control a region, the Mughals had always sought to occupy a strategic fortress in some region, which would serve as a nodal point from which the Mughal army would emerge to take on any enemy that challenged the empire.[10] This system was not only expensive, but also made the army somewhat inflexible as the assumption was always the enemy would retreat into a fortress to be besieged or would engage in a set-piece decisive battle of annihilation on open ground.[10] The militantly Hindu Marathas were expert horsemen who refused to engage in set-piece battles, but rather engaged in campaigns of guerrilla warfare, a war of raids, ambushes and attacks upon the Mughal supply lines.[10] The Marathas were unable to take the Mughal fortresses via storm or formal siege as they lacked the artillery, but by constantly intercepting supply columns, they were able to starve Mughal fortresses into submission.[10] Successive Mughal commanders refused to adjust their tactics and develop an appropriate counter-insurgency strategy, which led to the Mughals losing more and more ground to the Maratha.[10] The Indian campaign of Nader Shah of Persia culminated with the Sack of Delhi and shattered the remnants of Mughal power and prestige,[7] as well as drastically accelerating its decline and alarming other far-off invaders, including the later British. Many of the empire's elites now sought to control their own affairs, and broke away to form independent kingdoms.[7] The Mughal Emperor, however, continued to be the highest manifestation of sovereignty. Not only the Muslim gentry, but the Maratha, Hindu, and Sikh leaders took part in ceremonial acknowledgements of the emperor as the sovereign of India.[14]\\r\\nIn the next decades, the Afghans, Sikhs, and Marathas battled against each other and the Mughals, only to prove the fragmented state of the empire. The Mughal Emperor Shah Alam II made futile attempts to reverse the Mughal decline, and ultimately had to seek the protection of outside powers. In 1784, the Marathas under Mahadji Scindia won acknowledgement as the protectors of the emperor in Delhi, a state of affairs that continued until after the Second Anglo-Maratha War. Thereafter, the British East India Company became the protectors of the Mughal dynasty in Delhi.[14] After a crushed rebellion which he nominally led in 1857-58, the last Mughal, Bahadur Shah Zafar, was deposed by the British government, who then assumed formal control of a large part of the former empire,[7] marking the start of the British Raj.\\r\\n4 years 8 months 25 days or 56 months 25 days or 247 weeks 1 days or 1730 days\\r\\n9 years 4 months 21 days or 112 months 21 days or 490 weeks 0 days or 3430 days and 11 months 5 days or 11 months 5 days or 48 weeks 3 days or 339 days Total 3,769 days\\r\\n22 February 1555 - 27 January 1556\\r\\n49 years 9 months 0 days or 597 months 0 days or 2595 weeks 6 days or 18171 days\\r\\n21 years 11 months 23 days or 263 months 23 days or 1146 weeks 6 days or 8028 days\\r\\n30 years 8 months 25 days or 368 months 25 days or 1603 weeks 4 days or 11225 days\\r\\n48 years 7 months 0 days or 583 months 0 days or 2535 weeks 1 days or 17746 days\\r\\n(3 years, 253 days)\\r\\n(0 years, 350 days)\\r\\n(6 years, 48 days)\\r\\n(0 years, 98 days)\\r\\n(0 years, 105 days)\\r\\n(28 years, 212 days)\\r\\n(5 years, 180 days)\\r\\nNote:The Mughal Emperors practised polygamy.

The colonial period lasted approximately three centuries, from the early 16th to the early 19th centuries, when Brazil and the larger Hispanic American nations declared independence. The United States obtained independence from England much earlier, in 1776, while Canada formed a federal dominion in 1867. Others remained attached to their European parent state until the end of the 19th century, such as Cuba and Puerto Rico which were linked to Spain until 1898. Smaller territories such as Guyana obtained independence in the mid-20th century, while certain Caribbean islands and French Guiana remain part of a European power to this day.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe specifics of Paleo-Indian migration to and throughout the Americas, including the exact dates and routes traveled, are subject to ongoing research and discussion.[1] The traditional theory has been that these early migrants moved into the Beringia land bridge between eastern Siberia and present-day Alaska around 40,000 ÿ 17,000 years ago, when sea levels were significantly lowered due to the Quaternary glaciation.[1][2] These people are believed to have followed herds of now-extinct pleistocene megafauna along ice-free corridors that stretched between the Laurentide and Cordilleran ice sheets.[3] Another route proposed is that, either on foot or using primitive boats, they migrated down the Pacific Northwest coast to South America.[4] Evidence of the latter would since have been covered by a sea level rise of a hundred meters following the last ice age.[5]\\r\\n\\r\\nArchaeologists contend that the Paleo-Indian migration out of Beringia (eastern Alaska), ranges from 40,000 to around 16,500 years ago.[6][7][8] This time range is a hot source of debate. The few agreements achieved to date are the origin from Central Asia, with widespread habitation of the Americas during the end of the last glacial period, or more specifically what is known as the late glacial maximum, around 16,000 ÿ 13,000 years before present.[8][9]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe American Journal of Human Genetics released an article in 2007 stating \\"Here we show, by using 86 complete mitochondrial genomes, that all Indigenous American haplogroups, including Haplogroup X (mtDNA), were part of a single founding population.\\"[10] Amerindian groups in the Bering Strait region exhibit perhaps the strongest DNA or mitochondrial DNA relations to Siberian peoples. The genetic diversity of Amerindian indigenous groups increase with distance from the assumed entry point into the Americas.[11][12] Certain genetic diversity patterns from West to East suggest, particularly in South America, that migration proceeded first down the west coast, and then proceeded eastward.[13] Geneticists have variously estimated that peoples of Asia and the Americas were part of the same population from 42,000 to 21,000 years ago.[14]\\r\\n\\r\\nNew studies shed light on the founding population of indigenous Americans, suggesting that their ancestry traced to both east Asian and western Eurasians who migrated to North America directly from Siberia. A 2013 study in the journal Nature reported that DNA found in the 24,000-year-old remains of a young Boy in Malta Siberia suggest that up to one-third of the indigenous Americans may have ancestry that can be traced back to western Eurasians, who may have \\"had a more north-easterly distribution 24,000 years ago than commonly thought\\"[15] Professor Kelly Graf said that \\"Our findings are significant at two levels. First, it shows that Upper Paleolithic Siberians came from a cosmopolitan population of early modern humans that spread out of Africa to Europe and Central and South Asia. Second, Paleoindian skeletons with phenotypic traits atypical of modern-day Native Americans can be explained as having a direct historical connection to Upper Paleolithic Siberia.\\" A route through Beringia is seen as more likely than the Solutrean hypothesis.[16]\\r\\n\\r\\nOn October 3, 2014, the Oregon cave, where the oldest DNA evidence of human habitation in North America was found, was added to the National Register of Historic Places. The DNA, radiocarbon dated to 14,300 years ago, was found in fossilized human coprolites uncovered in the Paisley Five Mile Point Caves in south-central Oregon.[17]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Lithic stage or Paleo-Indian period, is the earliest classification term referring to the first stage of human habitation in the Americas, covering the Late Pleistocene epoch. The time period derives its name from the appearance of \\"Lithic flaked\\" stone tools. Stone tools, particularly projectile points and scrapers, are the primary evidence of the earliest well known human activity in the Americas. Lithic reduction stone tools are used by archaeologists and anthropologists to classify cultural periods.\\r\\n\\r\\nSeveral thousand years after the first migrations, the first complex civilizations arose as hunter-gatherers settled into semi-agricultural communities. Identifiable sedentary settlements began to emerge in the so-called Middle Archaic period around 6000 BCE. Particular archaeological cultures can be identified and easily classified throughout the Archaic period.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the late Archaic, on the north-central coastal region of Peru, a complex civilization arose which has been termed the Norte Chico civilization, also known as Caral-Supe. It is the oldest known civilization in the Americas and one of the five sites where civilization originated independently and indigenously in the ancient world, flourishing between the 30th and 18th centuries BC. It pre-dated the Mesoamerican Olmec civilization by nearly two millennia. It was contemporaneous with the Egypt following the unification of its kingdom under Narmer and the emergence of the first Egyptian hieroglyphics.\\r\\n\\r\\nMonumental architecture, including earthwork platform mounds and sunken plazas have been identified as part of the civilization. Archaeological evidence points to the use of textile technology and the worship of common god symbols. Government, possibly in the form of theocracy, is assumed to have been required to manage the region. However, numerous questions remain about its organization. In archaeological nomenclature, the culture was pre-ceramic culture of the pre-Columbian Late Archaic period. It appears to have lacked ceramics and art.\\r\\n\\r\\nOngoing scholarly debate persists over the extent to which the flourishing of Norte Chico resulted from its abundant maritime food resources, and the relationship that these resources would suggest between coastal and inland sites.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe role of seafood in the Norte Chico diet has been a subject of scholarly debate. In 1973, examining the Aspero region of Norte Chico, Michael E. Moseley contended that a maritime subsistence (seafood) economy had been the basis of society and its early flourishing. This theory, later termed \\"maritime foundation of Andean Civilization\\" was at odds with the general scholarly consensus that civilization arose as a result of intensive grain-based agriculture, as had been the case in the emergence of civilizations in northeast Africa (Egypt) and southwest Asia (Mesopotamia).\\r\\n\\r\\nWhile earlier research pointed to edible domestic plants such as squash, beans, lucuma, guava, pacay, and camote at Caral, publications by Haas and colleagues have added avocado, achira, and corn (Zea Mays) to the list of foods consumed in the region. In 2013, Haas and colleagues reported that maize was a primary component of the diet throughout the period of 3000 to 1800 BC.[18]\\r\\n\\r\\nCotton was another widespread crop in Norte Chico, essential to the production of fishing nets and textiles. Jonathan Haas noted a mutual dependency, whereby \\"The prehistoric residents of the Norte Chico needed the fish resources for their protein and the fishermen needed the cotton to make the nets to catch the fish.\\"\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the 2005 book 1491: New Revelations of the Americas Before Columbus, journalist Charles C. Mann surveyed the literature at the time, reporting a date \\"sometime before 3200 BC, and possibly before 3500 BC\\" as the beginning date for the formation of Norte Chico. He notes that the earliest date securely associated with a city is 3500 BC, at Huaricanga in the (inland) Fortaleza area.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Norte Chico civilization began to decline around 1800 BC as more powerful centers appeared to the south and north along its coast, and to the east within the Andes Mountains.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter the decline of the Norte Chico civilization, several large, centralized civilizations developed in the Western Hemisphere: Chavin, Nazca, Moche, Huari, Quitus, Ca?aris, Chimu, Pachacamac, Tiahuanaco, Aymara and Inca in the Central Andes (Ecuador, Peru and Bolivia); Muisca in Colombia?; Tanos in Dominican Republic (Hispaniola, Espa?ola) and part of Caribbean; and the Olmecs, Maya, Toltecs, Mixtecs, Zapotecs, Aztecs and Purepecha in southern North America (Mexico, Guatemala).\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Olmec civilization was the first Mesoamerican civilization, beginning around 1600-1400 BC and ending around 400 BC. Mesoamerica is considered one of the six sites around the globe in which civilization developed independently and indigenously. This civilization is considered the mother culture of the Mesoamerican civilizations. The Mesoamerican calendar, numeral system, writing, and much of the Mesoamerican pantheon seem to have begun with the Olmec.\\r\\n\\r\\nSome elements of agriculture seem to have been practiced in Mesoamerica quite early. The domestication of maize is thought to have begun around 7,500 to 12,000 years ago. The earliest record of lowland maize cultivation dates to around 5100 BC.[19] Agriculture continued to be mixed with a hunting-gathering-fishing lifestyle until quite late compared to other regions, but by 2700 BC, Mesoamericans were relying on maize, and living mostly in villages. Temple mounds and classes started to appear. By 1300/ 1200 BC, small centres coalesced into the Olmec civilization, which seems to have been a set of city-states, united in religious and commercial concerns. The Olmec cities had ceremonial complexes with earth/clay pyramids, palaces, stone monuments, aqueducts and walled plazas. The first of these centers was at San Lorenzo (until 900 bc). La Venta was the last great Olmec centre. Olmec artisans sculpted jade and clay figurines of Jaguars and humans. Their iconic giant heads - believed to be of Olmec rulers - stood in every major city.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Olmec civilization ended in 400 BC, with the defacing and destruction of San Lorenzo and La Venta, two of the major cities. It nevertheless spawned many other states, most notably the Mayan civilization, whose first cities began appearing around 700-600 BC. Olmec influences continued to appear in many later Mesoamerican civilizations.\\r\\n\\r\\nCities of the Aztecs, Mayas, and Incas were as large and organized as the largest in the Old World, with an estimated population of 200,000 to 350,000 in Tenochtitlan, the capital of the Aztec empire. The market established in the city was said to have been the largest ever seen by the conquistadors when they arrived. The capital of the Cahokians, Cahokia, located near modern East St. Louis, Illinois, may have reached a population of over 20,000. At its peak, between the 12th and 13th centuries, Cahokia may have been the most populous city in North America. Monk's Mound, the major ceremonial center of Cahokia, remains the largest earthen construction of the prehistoric New World.\\r\\n\\r\\nThese civilizations developed agriculture as well, breeding maize (corn) from having ears 2ÿ5?cm in length to perhaps 10ÿ15?cm in length. Potatoes, tomatoes, pumpkins, beans, avocados, and chocolate are now the most popular of the pre-Columbian agricultural products. The civilizations did not develop extensive livestock as there were few suitable species, although alpacas and llamas were domesticated for use as beasts of burden and sources of wool and meat in the Andes. By the 15th century, maize was being farmed in the Mississippi River Valley after introduction from Mexico. The course of further agricultural development was greatly altered by the arrival of Europeans.\\r\\n\\r\\nCahokia was a major regional chiefdom, with trade and tributary chiefdoms located in a range of areas from bordering the Great Lakes to the Gulf of Mexico.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Iroquois League of Nations or \\"People of the Long House\\", based in present-day upstate and western New York, had a confederacy model from the mid-15th?century.  It has been suggested that their culture contributed to political thinking during the development of the later United States government. Their system of affiliation was a kind of federation, different from the strong, centralized European monarchies.[20][21][22]\\r\\n\\r\\nLeadership was restricted to a group of 50 sachem chiefs, each representing one clan within a tribe; the Oneida and Mohawk people had nine seats each; the Onondagas held fourteen; the Cayuga had ten seats; and the Seneca had eight. Representation was not based on population numbers, as the Seneca tribe greatly outnumbered the others. When a sachem chief died, his successor was chosen by the senior woman of his tribe in consultation with other female members of the clan; property and hereditary leadership were passed matrilineally. Decisions were not made through voting but through consensus decision making, with each sachem chief holding theoretical veto power. The Onondaga were the \\"firekeepers\\", responsible for raising topics to be discussed. They occupied one side of a three-sided fire (the Mohawk and Seneca sat on one side of the fire, the Oneida and Cayuga sat on the third side.)[22]\\r\\n\\r\\nElizabeth Tooker, an anthropologist, has said that it was unlikely the US founding fathers were inspired by the confederacy, as it bears little resemblance to the system of governance adopted in the United States. For example, it is based on inherited rather than elected leadership, selected by female members of the tribes, consensus decision-making regardless of population size of the tribes, and a single group capable of bringing matters before the legislative body.[22]\\r\\n\\r\\nLong-distance trading did not prevent warfare and displacement among the indigenous peoples, and their oral histories tell of numerous migrations to the historic territories where Europeans encountered them. The Iroquois invaded and attacked tribes in the Ohio River area of present-day Kentucky and claimed the hunting grounds. Historians have placed these events as occurring as early as the 13th?century, or in the 17th?century Beaver Wars.[23]\\r\\n\\r\\nThrough warfare, the Iroquois drove several tribes to migrate west to what became known as their historically traditional lands west of the Mississippi River. Tribes originating in the Ohio Valley who moved west included the Osage, Kaw, Ponca and Omaha people. By the mid-17th century, they had resettled in their historical lands in present-day Kansas, Nebraska, Arkansas and Oklahoma. The Osage warred with Caddo-speaking Native Americans, displacing them in turn by the mid-18th century and dominating their new historical territories.[23]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Great Kiva of Chetro Ketl at the Chaco Culture National Historical Park, UNESCO World Heritage Site.\\r\\n\\r\\nCliff Palace, Mesa Verde National Park, a UNESCO World Heritage Site.\\r\\n\\r\\nTaos Pueblo, a UNESCO World Heritage site, is an Ancient Pueblo belonging to a Native American tribe of Pueblo people, marking the cultural development in the region during the Pre-Columbian era.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhite House Ruins, Canyon de Chelly National Monument\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Pueblo people of what is now the Southwestern United States and northern Mexico, living conditions were that of large stone apartment like adobe structures. They live in Arizona, New Mexico, Utah, Colorado, and possibly surrounding areas.\\r\\n\\r\\nChichimeca was the name that the Mexica (Aztecs) generically applied to a wide range of semi-nomadic peoples who inhabited the north of modern-day Mexico, and carried the same sense as the European term \\"barbarian\\". The name was adopted with a pejorative tone by the Spaniards when referring especially to the semi-nomadic hunter-gatherer peoples of northern Mexico.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Zapotec emerged around 1500 years BCE. Their writing system influenced the later Olmec. They left behind the great city Monte Alban.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Olmec civilization emerged around 1200 BCE in Mesoamerica and ended around 400 BCE. Olmec art and concepts influenced surrounding cultures after their downfall. This civilization was thought to be the first in America to develop a writing system. After the Olmecs abandoned their cities for unknown reasons, the Maya, Zapotec and Teotihuacan arose.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Purepecha civilization emerged around 1000 CE in Mesoamerica . They flourished from 1100 CE to 1530 CE. They continue to live on in the state of Michoacn. Fierce warriors, they were never conquered and in their glory years, successfully sealed off huge areas from Aztec domination.\\r\\n\\r\\nMaya history spans 3,000 years. The Classic Maya may have collapsed due to changing climate in the end of the 10th century.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Toltec were a nomadic people, dating from the 10th - 12th century, whose language was also spoken by the Aztecs.\\r\\n\\r\\nTeotihuacan (4th century BCE - 7/8th century CE) was both a city, and an empire of the same name, which, at its zenith between 150 and the 5th century, covered most of Mesoamerica.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Aztec having started to build their empire around 14th century found their civilization abruptly ended by the Spanish conquistadors. They lived in Mesoamerica, and surrounding lands. Their capital city Tenochtitlan was one of the largest cities of all time.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe oldest known civilization of the Americas was established in the Norte Chico region of modern Peru. Complex society emerged in the group of coastal valleys, between 3000 and 1800 BCE. The Quipu, a distinctive recording device among Andean civilizations, apparently dates from the era of Norte Chico's prominence.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Chavn established a trade network and developed agriculture by as early as (or late compared to the Old World) 900 BCE according to some estimates and archaeological finds. Artifacts were found at a site called Chavn in modern Peru at an elevation of 3,177 meters. Chavn civilization spanned from 900 BCE to 300 BCE.\\r\\n\\r\\nHolding their capital at the great city of Cusco, the Inca civilization dominated the Andes region from 1438 to 1533.\\r\\nKnown as Tahuantinsuyu, or \\"the land of the four regions\\", in Quechua, the Inca culture was highly distinct and developed. Cities were built with precise, unmatched stonework, constructed over many levels of mountain terrain. Terrace farming was a useful form of agriculture. There is evidence of excellent metalwork and even successful trepanation of the skull in Inca civilization.\\r\\n\\r\\nAround 1000, the Vikings established a short-lived settlement in Newfoundland, now known as L'Anse aux Meadows. Speculations exist about other Old World discoveries of the New World, but none of these are generally or completely accepted by most scholars.\\r\\n\\r\\nSpain sponsored a major exploration led by Italian explorer Christopher Columbus in 1492; it quickly led to extensive European colonization of the Americas. The Europeans brought Old World diseases which are thought to have caused catastrophic epidemics and a huge decrease of the native population. Columbus came at a time in which many technical developments in sailing techniques and communication made it possible to report his voyages easily and to spread word of them throughout Europe. It was also a time of growing religious, imperial and economic rivalries that led to a competition for the establishment of colonies.\\r\\n\\r\\n15th to 19th century colonies in the New World:\\r\\n\\r\\nThe formation of sovereign states in the New World began with the United States Declaration of Independence of 1776. The American Revolutionary War lasted through the period of the Siege of Yorktown  its last major campaign  in the early autumn of 1781, with peace being achieved in 1783.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Spanish colonies won their independence in the first quarter of the 19th century, in the Spanish American wars of independence. Sim܇n Bolvar and Jos de San Martn, among others, led their independence struggle. Although Bolivar attempted to keep the Spanish-speaking parts of Latin America politically allied, they rapidly became independent of one another as well, and several further wars were fought, such as the Paraguayan War and the War of the Pacific. (See Latin American integration.) In the Portuguese colony Dom Pedro I (also Pedro IV of Portugal), son of the Portuguese king Dom Jo?o VI, proclaimed the country's independence in 1822 and became Brazil's first Emperor. This was peacefully accepted by the crown in Portugal, upon compensation.\\r\\n\\r\\nSlavery has had a significant role in the economic development the New World after the colonization of the Americas by the Europeans. The cotton, tobacco, and sugar cane harvested by slaves became important exports for the United States and the Caribbean countries.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs a part of the British Empire, Canada immediately entered World War I when it broke out in 1914. Canada bore the brunt of several major battles during the early stages of the war, including the use of poison gas attacks at Ypres. Losses became grave, and the government eventually brought in conscription, despite the fact this was against the wishes of the majority of French Canadians. In the ensuing Conscription Crisis of 1917, riots broke out on the streets of Montreal. In neighboring Newfoundland, the new dominion suffered a devastating loss on July 1, 1916, the First day on the Somme.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe United States stayed out of the conflict until 1917, when it joined the Entente powers. The United States was then able to play a crucial role at the Paris Peace Conference of 1919 that shaped interwar Europe. Mexico was not part of the war, as the country was embroiled in the Mexican Revolution at the time.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe 1920s brought an age of great prosperity in the United States, and to a lesser degree Canada. But the Wall Street Crash of 1929 combined with drought ushered in a period of economic hardship in the United States and Canada. From 1936 to 1949, there was a popular uprising against the anti-Catholic Mexican government of the time, set off specifically by the anti-clerical provisions of the Mexican Constitution of 1917.\\r\\n\\r\\nOnce again, Canada found itself at war before its neighbors, however even Canadian contributions were slight before the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor. The entry of the United States into the war helped to tip the balance in favour of the allies. Two Mexican tankers, transporting oil to the United States, were attacked and sunk by the Germans in the Gulf of Mexico waters, in 1942. The incident happened in spite of Mexico's neutrality at that time. This led Mexico to enter the conflict with a declaration of war on the Axis nations. The destruction of Europe wrought by the war vaulted all North American countries to more important roles in world affairs, especially the United States, which emerged as a \\"superpower\\".\\r\\n\\r\\nThe early Cold War era saw the United States as the most powerful nation in a Western coalition of which Mexico and Canada were also a part. In Canada, Quebec was transformed by the Quiet Revolution and the emergence of Quebec nationalism. Mexico experienced an era of huge economic growth after World War II, a heavy industrialization process and a growth of its middle class, a period known in Mexican history as \\"El Milagro Mexicano\\" (the Mexican miracle). The Caribbean saw the beginnings of decolonization, while on the largest island the Cuban Revolution introduced Cold War rivalries into Latin America.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe civil rights movement in the U.S. ended Jim Crow and empowered black voters in the 1960s, which allowed black citizens to move into high government offices for the first time since Reconstruction. However, the dominant New Deal coalition collapsed in the mid 1960s in disputes over race and the Vietnam War, and the conservative movement began its rise to power, as the once dominant liberalism weakened and collapsed. Canada during this era was dominated by the leadership of Pierre Elliot Trudeau. In 1982, at the end of his tenure, Canada enshrined a new constitution.\\r\\n\\r\\nCanada's Brian Mulroney not only ran on a similar platform but also favored closer trade ties with the United States. This led to the Canada-United States Free Trade Agreement in January 1989. Mexican presidents Miguel de la Madrid, in the early 1980s and Carlos Salinas de Gortari in the late 1980s, started implementing liberal economic strategies that were seen as a good move. However, Mexico experienced a strong economic recession in 1982 and the Mexican peso suffered a devaluation. In the United States president Ronald Reagan attempted to move the United States back towards a hard anti-communist line in foreign affairs, in what his supporters saw as an attempt to assert moral leadership (compared to the Soviet Union) in the world community. Domestically, Reagan attempted to bring in a package of privatization and regulation to stimulate the economy.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe end of the Cold War and the beginning of the era of sustained economic expansion coincided during the 1990s. On January 1, 1994, Canada, Mexico and the United States signed the North American Free Trade Agreement, creating the world's largest free trade area. In 2000, Vicente Fox became the first non-PRI candidate to win the Mexican presidency in over 70 years. The optimism of the 1990s was shattered by the 9/11 attacks of 2001 on the United States, which prompted military intervention in Afghanistan, which also involved Canada. Canada did not support the United States' later move to invade Iraq, however.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the U.S. the Reagan Era of conservative national policies, deregulation and tax cuts took control with the election of Ronald Reagan in 1980. By 2010, political scientists were debating whether the election of Barack Obama in 2008 represented an end of the Reagan Era, or was only a reaction against the bubble economy of the 2000s (decade), which burst in 2008 and became the Late-2000s recession with prolonged unemployment.\\r\\n\\r\\nDespite the failure of a lasting political union, the concept of Central American reunification, though lacking enthusiasm from the leaders of the individual countries, rises from time to time. In 1856ÿ1857 the region successfully established a military coalition to repel an invasion by United States adventurer William Walker. Today, all five nations fly flags that retain the old federal motif of two outer blue bands bounding an inner white stripe. (Costa Rica, traditionally the least committed of the five to regional integration, modified its flag significantly in 1848 by darkening the blue and adding a double-wide inner red band, in honor of the French tricolor).\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1907, a Central American Court of Justice was created. On December 13, 1960, Guatemala, El Salvador, Honduras, and Nicaragua established the Central American Common Market (\\"CACM\\"). Costa Rica, because of its relative economic prosperity and political stability, chose not to participate in the CACM. The goals for the CACM were to create greater political unification and success of import substitution industrialization policies. The project was an immediate economic success, but was abandoned after the 1969 \\"Football War\\" between El Salvador and Honduras. A Central American Parliament has operated, as a purely advisory body, since 1991. Costa Rica has repeatedly declined invitations to join the regional parliament, which seats deputies from the four other former members of the Union, as well as from Panama and the Dominican Republic.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the 1960s and 1970s, the governments of Argentina, Brazil, Chile, and Uruguay were overthrown or displaced by U.S.-aligned military dictatorships. These dictatorships detained tens of thousands of political prisoners, many of whom were tortured and/or killed (on inter-state collaboration, see Operation Condor). Economically, they began a transition to neoliberal economic policies. They placed their own actions within the United States Cold War doctrine of \\"National Security\\" against internal subversion. Throughout the 1980s and 1990s, Peru suffered from an internal conflict (see T~pac Amaru Revolutionary Movement and Shining Path). Revolutionary movements and right-wing military dictatorships have been common, but starting in the 1980s a wave of democratization came through the continent, and democratic rule is widespread now. Allegations of corruption remain common, and several nations have seen crises which have forced the resignation of their presidents, although normal civilian succession has continued.\\r\\n\\r\\nInternational indebtedness became a notable problem, as most recently illustrated by Argentina's default in the early 21st century. In recent years, South American governments have drifted to the left, with socialist leaders being elected in Chile, Bolivia, Brazil, Venezuela, and a leftist president in Argentina and Uruguay. Despite the move to the left, South America is still largely capitalist. With the founding of the Union of South American Nations, South America has started down the road of economic integration, with plans for political integration in the European Union style.","input":"What is the oldest known civilization in central and south america?"},{"output":"Strait of Gibraltar","context":"The Strait of Gibraltar (Arabic: ???? ??? ??????, Spanish: Estrecho de Gibraltar) is a narrow strait that connects the Atlantic Ocean to the Mediterranean Sea and separates Gibraltar and Peninsular Spain in Europe from Morocco and Ceuta (Spain) in Africa. The name comes from the Rock of Gibraltar, which in turn originates from the Arabic Jebel Tariq (meaning \\"Tariq's mountain\\"[1]) named after Tariq ibn Ziyad. It is also known as the Straits of Gibraltar, the Gut of Gibraltar (although this is mostly archaic),[2] the STROG (Strait Of Gibraltar) in naval use,[3] and Bab Al Maghrib (Arabic: ??? ????????), \\"Gate of the West\\". In the Middle Ages, Muslims called it Al-Zuqaq, \\"The Passage\\", the Romans called it Fretum Gatitanum (Strait of Cadiz),[4] and in the ancient world it was known as the \\"Pillars of Hercules\\" (Ancient Greek: ϫ? ?? ?ϫ).[5]\\r\\nEurope and Africa are separated by 7.7 nautical miles (14.3?km; 8.9?mi) of ocean at the strait's narrowest point. The Strait's depth ranges between 300 and 900 metres (160 and 490 fathoms; 980 and 2,950?ft)[6] which possibly interacted with the lower mean sea level of the last major glaciation 20,000 years ago[7] when the level of the sea is believed to have been lower by 110ÿ120?m (60ÿ66 fathoms; 360ÿ390?ft).[8] Ferries cross between the two continents every day in as little as 35 minutes. The Spanish side of the Strait is protected under El Estrecho Natural Park.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nOn the northern side of the Strait are Spain and Gibraltar (a British overseas territory in the Iberian Peninsula), while on the southern side are Morocco and Ceuta (a Spanish exclave in Morocco). Its boundaries were known in antiquity as the Pillars of Hercules. There are several islets, such as the disputed Isla Perejil, that are claimed by both Morocco and Spain.[9]\\r\\nDue to its location, the Strait is commonly used for illegal immigration from Africa to Europe.[10]\\r\\nThe International Hydrographic Organization defines the limits of the Strait of Gibraltar as follows:[11]\\r\\nThe seabed of the Strait is composed of synorogenic Betic-Rif clayey flysch covered by Pliocene and/or Quaternary calcareous sediments, sourced from thriving cold water coral communities.[12] Exposed bedrock surfaces, coarse sediments and local sand dunes attest to the strong bottom current conditions at the present time.\\r\\nAround 5.9 million years ago,[13] the connection between the Mediterranean Sea and the Atlantic Ocean along the Betic and Rifan Corridor was progressively restricted until its total closure, effectively causing the salinity of the Mediterranean to rise periodically within the gypsum and salt deposition range, during what is known as the Messinian salinity crisis. In this water chemistry environment, dissolved mineral concentrations, temperature and stilled water currents combined and occurred regularly to precipitate many mineral salts in layers on the seabed. The resultant accumulation of various huge salt and mineral deposits about the Mediterranean basin are directly linked to this era. It is believed that this process took a short time, by geological standards, lasting between 500,000 and 600,000 years.\\r\\nIt is estimated that, were the straits closed even at today's higher sea level, most water in the Mediterranean basin would evaporate within only a thousand years, as it is believed to have done then,[13] and such an event would lay down mineral deposits like the salt deposits now found under the sea floor all over the Mediterranean.\\r\\nAfter a lengthy period of restricted intermittent or no water exchange between the Atlantic Ocean and Mediterranean basin, approximately 5.33 million years ago,[14] the Atlantic-Mediterranean connection was completely reestablished through the Strait of Gibraltar by the Zanclean flood, and has remained open ever since.[15] The erosion produced by the incoming waters seems to be the main cause for the present depth of the strait (900 m at the narrows, 280 m at the Camarinal Sill). The strait is expected to close again as the African Plate moves northward relative to the Eurasian Plate,[citation needed] but on geological rather than human timescales.\\r\\nThe Strait has been identified as an Important Bird Area by BirdLife International because hundreds of thousands of seabirds use it every year to pass between the Mediterranean and the Atlantic, including large numbers of Cory's and Balearic shearwaters, Audouin's, yellow-legged and lesser black-backed gulls, razorbills and Atlantic puffins.[16]\\r\\nEvidence of the first human habitation of the area by Neanderthals dates back to 125,000 years ago. It is believed that the Rock of Gibraltar may have been one of the last outposts of Neanderthal habitation in the world, with evidence of their presence there dating to as recently as 24,000 years ago.[17] Archaeological evidence of Homo sapiens habitation of the area dates back c. 40,000 years.\\r\\nThe relatively short distance between the two shores has served as a quick crossing point for various groups and civilizations throughout history, including Carthaginians campaigning against Rome, Romans travelling between the provinces of Hispania and Mauritania, Vandals raiding south from Germania through Western Rome and into North Africa in the 5th century, Moors and Berbers in the 8thÿ11th centuries, and Spain and Portugal in the 16th century.\\r\\nBeginning in 1492, the straits began to play a certain cultural role in acting as a barrier against cross-strait conquest and the flow of culture and language that would naturally follow such a conquest. In that year, the last Muslim government north of the straits was overthrown by a Spanish force. Since that time, the straits have come to foster the development of two very distinct and varied cultures on either side of the straits after sharing much the same culture and greater degrees of tolerance for over 300+ years from the 8th century to the early 13th century.[citation needed]\\r\\nOn the northern side, Christian-European culture has remained dominant since the expulsion of the last Muslim kingdom in 1492, along with the Romance Spanish language, while on the southern side, Muslim-Arabic/Mediterranean has been dominant since the spread of Islam into North Africa in the 700s, along with the Arabic language. For the last 500 years, religious and cultural intolerance, more than the small travel barrier that the straits present, has come to act as a powerful enforcing agent of the cultural separation that exists between these two groups.[citation needed]\\r\\nThe small British enclave of the city of Gibraltar presents a third cultural group found in the straits. This enclave was first established in 1704 and has since been used by Britain to act as a surety for control of the sea lanes into and out of the Mediterranean.\\r\\nFollowing the Spanish coup of July 1936 the Spanish Republican Navy tried to blockade the Strait of Gibraltar to hamper the transport of Army of Africa troops from Spanish Morocco to Peninsular Spain. On 5 August 1936 the so-called Convoy de la victoria was able to bring at least 2,500 men across the strait, breaking the republican blockade.[18]\\r\\nThe Strait is an important shipping route from the Mediterranean to the Atlantic. There are ferries that operate between Spain and Morocco across the strait, as well as between Spain and Ceuta and Gibraltar to Tangier.\\r\\nIn December 2003, Spain and Morocco agreed to explore the construction of an undersea rail tunnel to connect their rail systems across the Strait. The gauge of the rail would be 1,435?mm (4?ft 8.5?in) to match the proposed construction and conversion of significant parts of the existing broad gauge system to standard gauge.[19] While the project remains in a planning phase, Spanish and Moroccan officials have met to discuss it as recently as 2012,[20] and proposals predict it could be completed by 2025.\\r\\nThe Strait of Gibraltar links the Atlantic Ocean directly to the Mediterranean Sea. This direct linkage creates certain unique flow and wave patterns. These unique patterns are created due to the interaction of various regional and global evaporative forces, tidal forces, and wind forces.\\r\\nThrough the strait, water generally flows more or less continually in both an eastward and a westward direction. A smaller amount of deeper saltier and therefore denser waters continually work their way westwards (the Mediterranean outflow), while a larger amount of surface waters with lower salinity and density continually work their way eastwards (the Mediterranean inflow). These general flow tendencies may be occasionally interrupted for brief periods to accommodate temporary tidal flow requirements, depending on various lunar and solar alignments. Still, on the whole and over time, the balance of the water flow is eastwards, due to an evaporation rate within the Mediterranean basin higher than the combined inflow of all the rivers that empty into it.[citation needed] The shallow Camarinal Sill of the Strait of Gibraltar, which forms the shallowest point within the strait, acts to limit mixing between the cold, less saline Atlantic water and the warm Mediterranean waters. The Camarinal Sill is located at the far western end of the strait.\\r\\nThe Mediterranean waters are so much saltier than the Atlantic waters that they sink below the constantly incoming water and form a highly saline (thermohaline, both warm and salty) layer of bottom water. This layer of bottom-water constantly works its way out into the Atlantic as the Mediterranean outflow. On the Atlantic side of the strait, a density boundary separates the Mediterranean outflow waters from the rest at about 100?m (330?ft) depth. These waters flow out and down the continental slope, losing salinity, until they begin to mix and equilibrate more rapidly, much further out at a depth of about 1,000?m (3,300?ft). The Mediterranean outflow water layer can be traced for thousands of kilometres west of the strait, before completely losing its identity.\\r\\nDuring the Second World War, German U-boats used the currents to pass into the Mediterranean Sea without detection, by maintaining silence with engines off.[21] From September 1941 to May 1944 Germany managed to send 62 U-boats into the Mediterranean. All these boats had to navigate the British-controlled Strait of Gibraltar where nine U-boats were sunk while attempting passage and 10 more had to break off their run due to damage. No U-boats ever made it back into the Atlantic and all were either sunk in battle or scuttled by their own crews.[22]\\r\\nInternal waves (waves at the density boundary layer) are often produced by the strait. Like traffic merging on a highway, the water flow is constricted in both directions because it must pass over the Camarinal Sill. When large tidal flows enter the Strait and the high tide relaxes, internal waves are generated at the Camarinal Sill and proceed eastwards. Even though the waves may occur down to great depths, occasionally the waves are almost imperceptible at the surface, at other times they can be seen clearly in satellite imagery. These internal waves continue to flow eastward and to refract around coastal features. They can sometimes be traced for as much as 100?km (62?mi), and sometimes create interference patterns with refracted waves.[23]\\r\\nThe Strait lies mostly within the territorial waters of Spain and Morocco, except for at the far eastern end. The United Kingdom (through Gibraltar) claims 3 nautical miles around Gibraltar putting part of the Strait inside British territorial waters, and the smaller-than-maximal claim also means that part of the Strait therefore lies in international waters according to the British claim. However, the ownership of Gibraltar and its territorial waters is disputed by Spain, meanwhile Morocco dispute the far extern end (of Ceuta).\\r\\nSome studies have proposed the possibility of erecting tidal power generating stations within the strait, to be powered from the predictable current at the strait.\\r\\nIn the 1920s and 1930s, the Atlantropa project proposed damming the strait to generate large amounts of electricity and lower the sea level of the Mediterranean by several hundreds of meters to create large new lands for settlement.[24] This proposal would however have devastating effects on the local climate and ecology and would dramatically change the strength of the West African Monsoon.\\r\\nCoordinates: 355818N 52909W? / ?35.97167N 5.48583W? / 35.97167; -5.48583","input":"What country lies closest to the north african coast?"},{"output":"spelling differences","context":"\\r\\nFlavor (American English) or flavour (British English; see spelling differences) is the sensory impression of food or other substance, and is determined primarily by the chemical senses of taste and smell. The \\"trigeminal senses\\", which detect chemical irritants in the mouth and throat, as well as temperature and texture, are also important to the overall gestalt of flavor perception. The flavor of the food, as such, can be altered with natural or artificial flavorants which affect these senses.\\r\\n\\r\\nA \\"flavorant\\" is defined as a substance that gives another substance flavor, altering the characteristics of the solute, causing it to become sweet, sour, tangy, etc.[citation needed]  A flavor is a quality of something that affects the sense of taste.[1]\\r\\n\\r\\nOf the three chemical senses, smell is the main determinant of a food item's flavor. Five basic tastes ÿ sweet, sour, bitter, salty and umami (savory) are universally recognized, although some cultures also include pungency[2] and oleogustus (\\"fattiness\\")[3]. The number of food smells is unbounded; a food's flavor, therefore, can be easily altered by changing its smell while keeping its taste similar. This is exemplified in artificially flavored jellies, soft drinks and candies, which, while made of bases with a similar taste, have dramatically different flavors due to the use of different scents or fragrances. The flavorings of commercially produced food products are typically created by flavorists.\\r\\n\\r\\nAlthough the terms flavoring and flavorant in common language denote the combined chemical sensations of taste and smell, the same terms are used in the fragrance and flavors industry to refer to edible chemicals and extracts that alter the flavor of food and food products through the sense of smell. Due to the high cost or unavailability of natural flavor extracts, most commercial flavorants are \\"nature-identical\\", which means that they are the chemical equivalent of natural flavors, but chemically synthesized rather than being extracted from source materials. Identification of components of natural foods, for example a raspberry, may be done using technology such as headspace techniques, so the flavorist can imitate the flavor by using a few of the same chemicals present.\\r\\n\\r\\nFlavorings are focused on altering the flavors of natural food product such as meats and vegetables, or creating flavor for food products that do not have the desired flavors such as candies and other snacks. Most types of flavorings are focused on scent and taste. Few commercial products exist to stimulate the trigeminal senses, since these are sharp, astringent, and typically unpleasant flavors.\\r\\n\\r\\nThree principal types of flavorings are used in foods, under definitions agreed in the EU and Australia:[4]\\r\\n\\r\\nMost artificial flavors are specific and often complex mixtures of singular naturally occurring flavor compounds combined together to either imitate or enhance a natural flavor. These mixtures are formulated by flavorists to give a food product a unique flavor and to maintain flavor consistency between different product batches or after recipe changes. The list of known flavoring agents includes thousands of molecular compounds, and the flavor chemist (flavorist) can often mix these together to produce many of the common flavors. Many flavorants consist of esters, which are often described as being \\"sweet\\" or \\"fruity\\".[5]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe compounds used to produce artificial flavors are almost identical to those that occur naturally. It has been suggested that artificial flavors may be safer to consume than natural flavors due to the standards of purity and mixture consistency that are enforced either by the company or by law.[6] Natural flavors, in contrast, may contain impurities from their sources, while artificial flavors are typically more pure and are required to undergo more testing before being sold for consumption.[6]\\r\\n\\r\\nFlavors from food products are usually the result of a combination of natural flavors, which set up the basic smell profile of a food product, while artificial flavors modify the smell to accent it.[7]\\r\\n\\r\\nUnlike smelling, which occurs upon inhalation, the sensing of flavors in the mouth occurs in the exhalation phase of breathing and is perceived differently by an individual. In other words, the smell of food is different depending on whether one is smelling it before or after it has entered one's mouth.[8]\\r\\n\\r\\nWhile salt and sugar can technically be considered flavorants that enhance salty and sweet tastes, usually only compounds that enhance umami, as well as other secondary flavors, are considered and referred to as taste flavorants. Artificial sweeteners are also technically flavorants.[9]\\r\\n\\r\\nUmami or \\"savory\\" flavorants, more commonly called taste or flavor enhancers, are largely based on amino acids and nucleotides. These are typically used as sodium or calcium salts.[10] Umami flavorants recognized and approved by the European Union include:[11]\\r\\n\\r\\nCertain organic and inorganic acids can be used to enhance sour tastes, but like salt and sugar, these are usually not considered and regulated as flavorants under law. Each acid imparts a slightly different sour or tart taste that alters the flavor of a food.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe color of food can affect one's expectations of the flavor significantly.[21]\\r\\nIn one study, adding more red color to a drink increased the perceived sweetness, with  darker colored solutions being rated 2ÿ10% better than lighter ones,  though it had 1% less sucrose concentration.[22] Food manufacturers exploit this phenomenon; different colors of Froot Loops cereal and most brands of gummy bears often use the same flavorings.[23][24]\\r\\n\\r\\nUK Food Law defines a natural flavor as:\\r\\n\\r\\nA flavouring substance (or flavouring substances) which is (or are) obtained, by physical, enzymatic, or microbiological processes, from material of vegetable or animal origin which material is either raw or has been subjected to a process normally used in preparing food for human consumption and to no process other than one normally so used[25]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe UK food industry also draws a distinction between a food being \\"X-flavoured\\", where it contains some amount of X as an ingredient, and \\"X-flavour\\", where it has the taste of X but does not contain it.[26]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe U.S. Code of Federal Regulations describes a \\"natural flavorant\\" as:\\r\\n\\r\\nThe essential oil, oleoresin, essence, or extractive, protein hydrolysate, distillate, or any product of roasting, heating, or enzymolysis, which contains the flavoring constituents derived from a spice, fruit, or fruit juice, vegetable or vegetable juice, edible yeast, herb, bark, bud, root, leaf, or any other edible portions of a plant, meat, seafood, poultry, eggs, dairy products, or fermentation products thereof, whose primary function in food is flavoring rather than nutritional[27]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe European Union's guidelines for natural flavorants are slightly different.[28] Certain artificial flavorants are given an E number, which may be included on food labels.[29]\\r\\n\\r\\nFood manufacturers are sometimes reluctant to inform consumers about the source and identity of flavor ingredients and whether they have been produced with the incorporation of substances such as animal byproducts.[citation needed]  Some flavor ingredients, such as gelatin, are produced from animal products.  Some, such as glycerin can be derived from either animal or vegetable sources.  And some extracts, such as vanilla, may contain alcohol.   Many Jews, Jains, Hindus, and Muslims adhere to religious dietary laws, and vegans to personal convictions, which restrict the use of animal byproducts and/or alcohol in foods unless subject to oversight and inspection by their respective religious authority or moral beliefs.  In many Western countries, some consumers rely on a Jewish kosher pareve certification mark to indicate that natural flavorings used in a food product are free of meat and dairy (although they can still contain fish). The Vegan Society's Sunflower symbol (which is currently used by over 260 companies worldwide) can also be used to see which products do not use any animal ingredients (including flavorings and colorings).[citation needed]\\r\\n\\r\\nSimilarly, persons with known sensitivities or allergies to food products are advised to avoid foods that contain generic \\"natural flavors\\" or to first determine the source of the flavoring before consuming the food. [30] Such flavors may be derived from a variety of source products that are themselves common allergens, such as dairy, soy,[31] sesame,[32] eggs, and nuts.[33]\\r\\n\\r\\nFood and beverage companies may require flavors for new products, product line extensions (e.g., low fat versions of existing products), or changes in formula or processing for existing products. In 2011, about US$10.6 billion were generated with the sale of flavors; the majority of the flavors used are consumed in processed and packaged food.[34]\\r\\n\\r\\nMost flavors represent a mixture of aroma compounds, the raw material that is produced by flavor companies. In rare cases, a single synthetic compound is used in pure form. Artificial vanilla flavors vanillin and ethylvanillin are a notable exception, as well as the artificial strawberry flavor (ethyl methylphenylglycidate). The ubiquitous \\"green apple\\" aroma is based on hexyl acetate.[35]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe flavor creation is done by a specially trained scientist called a \\"flavorist\\", whose job combines scientific knowledge of the chemical palette with creativity to develop new and distinctive flavors. The flavor creation begins when the flavorist receives a brief from the client. In the brief, the clients  attempt to communicate exactly what type of flavor they seek, in what application it will be used, and any special requirements (e.g., must be all natural). The communication barrier can be quite difficult to overcome since most people are not experienced at describing flavors. The flavorist uses his or her knowledge of the available chemical ingredients to create a formula and compound it on an electronic balance. The flavor is then submitted to the client for testing. Several iterations, with feedback from the client, may be needed before the right flavor is found.[citation needed]\\r\\n\\r\\nAdditional work may also be done by the flavor company.[citation needed] For example, the flavor company may conduct sensory taste tests to test consumer acceptance of a flavor before it is sent to the client or to further investigate the \\"sensory space\\". The flavor company may also employ application specialists who work to ensure the flavor will work in the application for which it is intended. This may require special flavor delivery technologies that are used to protect the flavor during processing or cooking so that the flavor is only released when eaten by the end consumer.[citation needed]\\r\\n\\r\\nFew standards are available or being prepared for sensory analysis of flavors.[36] In chemical analysis of flavors, solid phase extraction, solid phase microextraction, and headspace gas chromatography are applied to extract and separate the flavor compounds in the sample. The determination is typically done by various mass spectrometric techniques.[37]  A flavor lexicon can aid the development of objective language for food.","input":"What is the difference between flavor and flavour?"},{"output":"near the waterfront","context":"Faneuil Hall (/?f?nj?l/ or /?f?n?l/; previously /?f?n?l/), located near the waterfront and today's Government Center, in Boston, Massachusetts, has been a marketplace and a meeting hall since 1743. It was the site of several speeches by Samuel Adams, James Otis, and others encouraging independence from Great Britain. Now it is part of Boston National Historical Park and a well-known stop on the Freedom Trail. It is sometimes referred to as \\"the Cradle of Liberty\\".[2]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 2008, Faneuil Hall was rated number 4 in America's 25 Most Visited Tourist Sites by Forbes Traveler.[3]\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter the project of erecting a public market house in Boston had been discussed for some years, slave merchant Peter Faneuil offered, at a public meeting in 1740, to build a suitable edifice at his own cost as a gift to the town. There was a strong opposition to market houses, and although a vote of thanks was passed unanimously, his offer was accepted by a majority of only seven. Funded in part by profits from slave trading,[4] the building was begun in Dock Square in September of the same year.[5] It was built by artist John Smibert in 1740ÿ1742 in the style of an English country market, with an open ground floor serving as the market house, and an assembly room above. According to Sean Hennessey, a National Park Service spokesman, some of Boston's early slave auctions took place near Faneuil Hall.[6]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1761 the hall was destroyed by fire, nothing but the brick walls remaining. It was rebuilt by the town in 1762. In 1775, during the British occupation of Boston, it was used for a theatre.[5]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1806, the hall was greatly expanded by Charles Bulfinch, doubling its height and width and adding a third floor. Four new bays were added, to make seven in all; the open arcades were enclosed, and the cupola was moved to the opposite end of the building. Bulfinch applied Doric brick pilasters to the lower two floors, with Ionic pilasters on the third floor. This renovation added galleries around the assembly hall and increased its height. Neighboring Quincy Market was constructed in 1824ÿ1826. Faneuil Hall was entirely rebuilt of noncombustible materials in 1898ÿ1899.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn October 9, 1960 the building was designated a National Historic Landmark and added to the National Register of Historic Places a number of years later.[7] The ground floor and basement were altered in 1979.

At intermediate altitudes, the air still contains approximately 20.9% oxygen, but the barometric pressure and thus the partial pressure of oxygen is reduced.[1][2]\\r\\n\\r\\nDepending very much on the protocols used, the body may acclimate to the relative lack of oxygen in one or more ways such as increasing the mass of red blood cells and hemoglobin, or altering muscle metabolism.[3][4][5][6] Proponents claim that when such athletes travel to competitions at lower altitudes they will still have a higher concentration of red blood cells for 10ÿ14 days, and this gives them a competitive advantage. Some athletes live permanently at high altitude, only returning to sea level to compete, but their training may suffer due to less available oxygen for workouts.\\r\\n\\r\\nAltitude training can be simulated through use of an altitude simulation tent, altitude simulation room, or mask-based hypoxicator system where the barometric pressure is kept the same, but the oxygen content is reduced which also reduces the partial pressure of oxygen. Hypoventilation training, which consists of reducing the breathing frequency while exercising, can also mimic altitude training by significantly decreasing blood and muscle oxygenation.[7]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe study of altitude training was heavily delved into during and after the 1968 Olympics, which took place in Mexico City, Mexico: elevation 2,240 metres (7,349?ft). It was during these Olympic Games that endurance events saw significant below-record finishes while anaerobic, sprint events broke all types of records.[8] It was speculated prior to these events how the altitude might affect performances of these elite, world-class athletes and most of the conclusions drawn were equivalent to those hypothesized: that endurance events would suffer and that short events would not see significant negative changes. This was attributed not only to less resistance during movementdue to the less dense air[9]but also to the anaerobic nature of the sprint events. Ultimately, these games inspired investigations into altitude training from which unique training principles were developed with the aim of avoiding underperformance.\\r\\n\\r\\nAthletes or individuals who wish to gain a competitive edge for endurance events can take advantage of exercising at high altitude. High altitude is typically defined as any elevation above 1,500 metres (5,000?ft).\\r\\n\\r\\nOne suggestion for optimizing adaptations and maintaining performance is the live-high, train-low principle. This training idea involves living at higher altitudes in order to experience the physiological adaptations that occur, such as increased erythropoietin (EPO) levels, increased red blood cell levels, and higher VO2 max,[10] while maintaining the same exercise intensity during training at sea level. Due to the environmental differences at high altitude, it may be necessary to decrease the intensity of workouts. Studies examining the live-high, train-low theory have produced varied results, which may be dependent on a variety of factors such as individual variability, time spent at high altitude, and the type of training program.[11][12] For example, it has been shown that athletes performing primarily anaerobic activity do not necessarily benefit from altitude training as they do not rely on oxygen to fuel their performances.\\r\\n\\r\\nA non-training elevation of 2,100ÿ2,500 metres (6,900ÿ8,200?ft) and training at 1,250 metres (4,100?ft) or less has shown to be the optimal approach for altitude training.[13] Good venues for live-high train-low include Mammoth Lakes, California; Flagstaff, Arizona; and the Sierra Nevada, near Granada in Spain.[14]\\r\\n\\r\\nAltitude training can produce increases in speed, strength, endurance, and recovery by maintaining altitude exposure for a significant period of time. A study using simulated altitude exposure for 18 days, yet training closer to sea-level, showed performance gains were still evident 15 days later.[15]\\r\\n\\r\\nOpponents of altitude training argue that an athlete's red blood cell concentration returns to normal levels within days of returning to sea level and that it is impossible to train at the same intensity that one could at sea level, reducing the training effect and wasting training time due to altitude sickness. Altitude training can produce slow recovery due to the stress of hypoxia.[16] Exposure to extreme hypoxia at altitudes above 16,000 feet (5,000?m) can lead to considerable deterioration of skeletal muscle tissue. Five weeks at this altitude leads to a loss of muscle volume of the order of 10ÿ15%.[17]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the live-high, train-high regime, an athlete lives and trains at a desired altitude. The stimulus on the body is constant because the athlete is continuously in a hypoxic environment. Initially VO2 max drops considerably: by around 7% for every 1000?m above sea level) at high altitudes. Athletes will no longer be able to metabolize as much oxygen as they would at sea level. Any given velocity must be performed at a higher relative intensity at altitude.[16] However, after long periods of training at altitude, highly trained athletes returning to sea level do not exhibit increased red blood cell count or improved performance on 4000?m cycling tests.[18]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn repeated sprints in hypoxia (RSH), athletes run short sprints under 30 seconds as fast as they can. They experience incomplete recoveries in hypoxic conditions. The exercise to rest time ratio is less than 1:4, which means for every 30 second all out sprint, there is less than 120 seconds of rest.[19]\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen comparing RSH and repeated sprints in normoxia (RSN), studies show that RSH improved time to fatigue and power output. RSH and RSN groups were tested before and after a 4-week training period. Both groups initially completed 9ÿ10 all-out sprints before total exhaustion.  After the 4 week training period, the RSH group was able to complete 13 all out sprints before exhaustion and the RSN group only completed 9.[19]\\r\\n\\r\\nPossible physiological advantages from RSH include compensatory vasodilation and regeneration of phosphocreatine (PCr). The bodys tissues have the ability to sense hypoxia and induce vasodilation. The higher blood flow helps the skeletal muscles maximize oxygen delivery. A greater level of PCr resynthesis augments the muscles power production during the initial stages of high-intensity exercise.[20]\\r\\n\\r\\nRSH is still a relatively new training method and is not fully understood.[19]\\r\\n\\r\\nAltitude simulation systems have enabled protocols that do not suffer from the tension between better altitude physiology and more intense workouts. Such simulated altitude systems can be utilized closer to competition if necessary.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn Finland, a scientist named Heikki Rusko has designed a \\"high-altitude house.\\" The air inside the house, which is situated at sea level, is at normal pressure but modified to have a low concentration of oxygen, about 15.3% (below the 20.9% at sea level), which is roughly equivalent to the amount of oxygen available at the high altitudes often used for altitude training due to the reduced partial pressure of oxygen at altitude. Athletes live and sleep inside the house, but perform their training outside (at normal oxygen concentrations at 20.9%). Rusko's results show improvements of EPO and red-cell levels.\\r\\n\\r\\nArtificial altitude can also be used for hypoxic exercise, where athletes train in an altitude simulator which mimics the conditions a high altitude environment. Athletes are able to perform high intensity training at lower velocities and thus produce less stress on the musculoskeletal system.[16] This is beneficial to an athlete who suffered a musculoskeletal injury and is unable to apply large amounts of stress during exercise which would normally be needed to generate high intensity cardiovascular training. Hypoxia exposure for the time of exercise alone is not sufficient to induce changes in hematologic parameters. Hematocrit and hemoglobin concentrations remain in general unchanged.[17] There are a number of  companies who provide altitude training system, most notably Hypoxico, Inc. who pioneered the artificial altitude training systems in the mid 1990s.\\r\\n\\r\\nA South African scientist named Neil Stacey has proposed the opposite approach, using oxygen enrichment to provide a training environment with an oxygen partial pressure even higher than at sea level. This method is intended to increase training intensity.[21]\\r\\n\\r\\nAltitude training works because of the difference in atmospheric pressure between sea level and high altitude. At sea level, air is denser and there are more molecules of gas per litre of air. Regardless of altitude, air is composed of 21% oxygen and 78% nitrogen. As the altitude increases, the pressure exerted by these gases decreases. Therefore, there are fewer molecules per unit volume: this causes a decrease in partial pressures of gases in the body, which elicits a variety of physiological changes in the body that occur at high altitude.[22]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe physiological adaptation that is mainly responsible for the performance gains achieved from altitude training, is a subject of discussion among researchers. Some, including American researchers Ben Levine and Jim Stray-Gundersen, claim it is primarily the increased red blood cell volume.[23]\\r\\n\\r\\nOthers, including Australian researcher Chris Gore, and New Zealand researcher Will Hopkins, dispute this and instead claim the gains are primarily a result of other adaptions such as a switch to a more economic mode of oxygen utilization.[24]\\r\\n\\r\\nAt high altitudes, there is a decrease in oxygen hemoglobin saturation. This hypoxic condition causes hypoxia-inducible factor 1 (HIF1) to become stable and stimulates the production of erythropoietin (EPO), a hormone secreted by the kidneys,[25] EPO stimulates red blood cell production from bone marrow in order to increase hemoglobin saturation and oxygen delivery. Some athletes demonstrate a strong red blood cell response to altitude while others see little or no gain in red cell mass with chronic exposure.[26] It is uncertain how long this adaptation takes because various studies have found different conclusions based on the amount of time spent at high altitudes.[27]\\r\\n\\r\\nWhile EPO occurs naturally in the body, it is also made synthetically to help treat patients suffering from kidney failure and to treat patients during chemotherapy. Over the past thirty years, EPO has become frequently abused by competitive athletes through blood doping and injections in order to gain advantages in endurance events. Abuse of EPO, however, increases RBC counts beyond normal levels (polycythemia) and increases the viscosity of blood, possibly leading to hypertension and increasing the likelihood of a blood clot, heart attack or stroke. The natural secretion of EPO by the human kidneys can be increased by altitude training, but the body has limits on the amount of natural EPO that it will secrete, thus avoiding the harmful side effects of the illegal doping procedures.\\r\\n\\r\\nOther mechanisms have been proposed to explain the utility of altitude training. Not all studies show a statistically significant increase in red blood cells from altitude training. One study explained the success by increasing the intensity of the training (due to increased heart and respiration rate).[15] This improved training resulted in effects that lasted more than 15 days after return to sea level.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnother set of researchers claim that altitude training stimulates a more efficient use of oxygen by the muscles.[24] This efficiency can arise from numerous other responses to altitude training, including angiogenesis, glucose transport, glycolysis, and pH regulation, each of which may partially explain improved endurance performance independent of a greater number of red blood cells.[5] Furthermore, exercising at high altitude has been shown to cause muscular adjustments of selected gene transcripts, and improvement of mitochondrial properties in skeletal muscle.[28][29]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn a study comparing rats active at high altitude versus rats active at sea level, with two sedentary control groups, it was observed that muscle fiber types changed according to homeostatic challenges which led to an increased metabolic efficiency during the beta oxidative cycle and citric acid cycle, showing an increased utilization of ATP for aerobic performance.[30]\\r\\n\\r\\nDue to the lower atmospheric pressure at high altitudes, the air pressure within the breathing system must be lower than it would be at low altitudes in order for inhalation to occur. Therefore, inhalation at high altitudes typically involves a relatively greater lowering of the thoracic diaphragm than at low altitudes.","input":"What type of athlete would benefit from altitude training?"},{"output":"National Lampoon's Vacation","context":"The National Lampoon's Vacation film series is a comedy film series initially based on John Hughes' short story \\"Vacation '58\\" that was originally published by National Lampoon magazine. The series is distributed by Warner Bros. and consists of five main films, two of which are not sponsored by National Lampoon, and one spin-off. In recent years, the series has been the inspiration for various advertising campaigns featuring some of the original cast members. The series portrays the misadventures of the Griswold family, whose attempts to enjoy vacations and holidays are plagued with continual disasters and strangely embarrassing predicaments.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter the success of National Lampoon's Animal House in 1978, it was decided that another story from the National Lampoon magazine should be adapted into a film.[1] One of such stories chosen for development was John Hughes' \\"Vacation '58\\" that was originally published in the September 1979 issue of National Lampoon. Hughes wrote the screenplay for the first Vacation film as \\"a fairly straight adaptation of the short story\\", with the exception of the ending that was rewritten and reshot after being \\"thoroughly despised by preview audiences\\".[2] In addition to Hughes, Vacation involved the crew of many people connected to National Lampoon. The film was produced by Lampoon co-founder and Animal House producer, Matty Simmons, and directed by Lampoon alumnus and Animal House co-writer Harold Ramis.\\r\\n\\r\\nReleased on July 29, 1983, National Lampoon's Vacation proved to be a financial and critical success. Simmons went on to produce two sequels, with scripts by Hughes. While involved with the early stages of a third sequel, Vegas Vacation, Simmons resigned from production due to creative differences.[3] As a result, the film was made without the \\"National Lampoon\\" title.\\r\\n\\r\\nDuring an interview on the TBS series Dinner and a Movie, Beverly D'Angelo revealed that due to the success of Animal House, the original Vacation was envisioned as a raunchier R-rated comedy targeting young adults.[4] This was principally the reason for nudity such as D'Angelo's shower scene and Chase's profanity-laced tirades and pool scene with Christie Brinkley. However, the movie's success with larger family audiences who identified with Chase's everyman-father character caught the filmmakers by surprise. As a result, subsequent sequels were toned down and family friendly, with PG-13 or PG ratings.\\r\\n\\r\\nAlong with John Belushi, who starred in Animal House, Chevy Chase had previously performed in the National Lampoon Radio Hour and in the stage show National Lampoon Lemmings, both of which were spin-offs from National Lampoon magazine.[5]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn each of the main films of the series, the Griswold children are portrayed by different actors. This is usually attributed to the fact that after Anthony Michael Hall declined to reprise his role in European Vacation in order to star in Weird Science, it was decided to recast both children.[6] Chase has indicated that it was his idea to continue recasting the children by explaining, \\"I always wanted to make the joke, 'Geez, I hardly ever get the chance to see the kids anymore. I hardly know who they are. We should go on a vacation.' That was funny to me: the idea that Clark was such a great family man, but still didn't even recognize his own children.\\"[7]\\r\\n\\r\\nShortly after making European Vacation, Chase and Eric Idle began to write a script for a follow up called National Lampoon's Australian Vacation.[8] According to Idle, \\"We spent some time working together on it. It had some nice shark gags, but I can't pretend it was in any way finished.\\"[9] The concept of Australian Vacation resurfaced in the 90s as a potential fifth installment of the series, but nothing ever came of it.[10]\\r\\n\\r\\nPrior to the confirmed plans of New Line Cinema rebooting the series, Chase made note that he has developed another sequel tentatively titled Swiss Family Griswold.[11] In 2011, Chase revealed that he and Beverly D'Angelo have been working on the idea. He explained, \\"Theres a cruise, theres a fire on the ship, we think the whole ships on fire and we jump - its just a little fire - and we end up on an island where we meet Randy somewhere whos been left there from an old Survivor series.\\"[12]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn February 2010, it was announced by New Line Cinema (owned by Warner Bros., which released the previous films) that a new Vacation film was being produced.[13] The film, titled simply Vacation, was ultimately released on July 29, 2015, exactly 32 years after the original film was released into theaters.[14] It was produced by David Dobkin and written by John Francis Daley and Jonathan Goldstein.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe film is a direct sequel to the previous films (picking up years after the events of Vegas Vacation), starring Ed Helms as Rusty Griswold, as he takes his own family to Walley World.[15] Leslie Mann appeared as Audrey Griswold. Original series stars D'Angelo and Chase appeared in cameo roles.[16] The film also starred  Chris Hemsworth, Charlie Day[17] and Christina Applegate.\\r\\n\\r\\nNational Lampoon's Vacation was directed by Harold Ramis and written by John Hughes. The film follows Clark and Ellen Griswold as they take their two children, Rusty and Audrey, on a cross-country trip from their home in Chicago, to the California theme park Walley World. Planned out by Clark, the trip begins to go awry after getting lost in St. Louis. From there, they make it to Coolidge, Kansas, where they spend the night at the home of Ellen's cousin, Catherine, and husband, Eddie. There they are forced to take their Aunt Edna and her dog to Phoenix, Arizona. Along the way to there, Clark accidentally drags the dog from the back of the car and Edna dies during a long day of driving. Dropping her body off at cousin Normy's house in Phoenix, they soon make it to Walley World only to find that it is closed.\\r\\n\\r\\nNational Lampoon's European Vacation was directed by Amy Heckerling and written by John Hughes and Robert Klane. After becoming the winning family on a game show called \\"Pig In A Poke\\", the Griswolds win a two-week trip to Europe. The vacation begins in London, where they visit sights such as Big Ben, Houses of Parliament and Buckingham Palace. Having trouble with driving on the left side of the road, Clark ends up in many accidents and unknowingly knocks down Stonehenge. From there they stop in France, where their camcorder gets stolen; in West Germany, where they spend the night at the home of strangers they mistake for their relatives; and in Italy, where they become involved with robbery and kidnapping.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis is the first of two Vacation films to not feature the Randy Quaid \\"Cousin Eddie\\" character. The second film is the 2015 Vacation.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the opening \\"Pig in a Poke\\" sequence as well as the closing credits, the family's name is spelled as \\"Griswald\\" as opposed to \\"Griswold\\".\\r\\n\\r\\nNational Lampoon's Christmas Vacation was directed by Jeremiah S. Chechik and written by John Hughes. The film follows Clark's attempt at delivering \\"the most fun-filled old-fashioned family Christmas ever\\". As the Griswolds' dysfunctional relatives begin arriving early, he becomes obsessed with ensuring that everything goes right. Meanwhile, he is also expecting a large Christmas bonus check that will cover a surprise backyard swimming pool that he already ordered. However, when the Christmas bonuses are cut, he instead receives a one-year membership to the Jelly of the Month Club, causing him to snap and go crazy.\\r\\n\\r\\nVegas Vacation was directed by Stephen Kessler and written by Elisa Bell, based on a story by Bell and Bob Ducsay. After receiving a large bonus check, Clark takes his family on vacation to Las Vegas. Immediately hitting the blackjack tables, he begins to blow all his money, resulting in them breaking off in their own directions. While he tries to regain his money through the help of his cousin-in-law, Eddie, Ellen becomes infatuated with Wayne Newton as Rusty wins big at the dice tables and Audrey turns to go-go dancing with her cousin, Vicki. The film is notable for being the first (and to date, only) installment to receive a PG rating from the MPAA.\\r\\n\\r\\nVacation is a 2015 theatrical installment of the series written and directed by John Francis Daley and Jonathan Goldstein. Following in Clark's footsteps, a grown-up Rusty Griswold (Ed Helms) surprises his wife, Debbie (Christina Applegate), and their two sons, James (Skyler Gisondo) and Kevin (Steele Stebbins), with a cross-country road trip back to Walley World, in an effort to recreate the family vacations he had with his parents and sister (Leslie Mann).[18]  It is the first entry since the original to receive an R rating.\\r\\n\\r\\nNational Lampoon's Christmas Vacation 2: Cousin Eddie's Island Adventure is a made-for-TV spin-off film directed by Nick Marck and written by Matty Simmons. After a workplace accident involving a monkey, Eddie Johnson is given a free vacation for him and his family to an island in the South Pacific. But when he tries to catch a shark during a family boat trip, they become lost and eventually shipwrecked on an isolated island.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt can be considered a sequel to National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation, although it is more of a spin-off than a direct chapter in the Vacation series, because Chevy Chase and Beverly D'Angelo do not appear. It stars Randy Quaid and Miriam Flynn, reprising their roles as Cousin Eddie and Catherine, with Dana Barron returning as Audrey Griswold.\\r\\n\\r\\nHotel Hell Vacation is a short film directed by Bryan Buckley. On their way to visit Rusty and his family at a vacation rental, Clark and Ellen decide to have a romantic getaway at a hotel before they get there. Everything, however, goes wrong there for them and they hastily make their way to Rusty's rental.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe film was a campaign ad for HomeAway that originally aired in part during the broadcast of Super Bowl XLIV and in entirety on Homeaway.com.[19] While it was sanctioned by Warner Bros., it was not sponsored by the National Lampoon label.\\r\\n\\r\\nAside from the obvious issues with the characters' physical appearances due to being played by different actors, Rusty and Audrey both age on a floating timeline. It is assumed that each film takes place in the year they are actually filmed, as no other indication of time is mentioned and the characters' clothing, cars, and environment are contemporary to the time of each film's release. In most of the films it is never mentioned which of the two children is older. Rusty and Audrey appear to be in their early teens in Vacation (1983), and in their mid-teens in European Vacation (1985) two years later (at one point in the film, he specifically mentions that he is fifteen years old). However, in Christmas Vacation (1989), while she appears to be in her late teens, he looks younger than he did in the preceding films. Whereas in Vegas Vacation (1997), both are in their late teens to which Clark tells the kids, \\"I hardly recognize you anymore!\\" The next shot freezes for a moment on the kids sitting silently, making fun of the discontinuity.\\r\\n\\r\\nDana Barron, who was then in her late thirties, reprised the role of Audrey in Christmas Vacation 2 (2003). Rusty is also portrayed as an adult with a wife and daughter in Hotel Hell Vacation (2010). However, in Vacation (2015), Rusty is portrayed by Ed Helms and has two sons with no mention of a daughter.\\r\\n\\r\\nEddie and Catherine are seen with the following children in their respective films: Vicky, Dale, Daisy Mable, Eddie Jr, and Junior (Vacation); Rocky and Ruby Sue (Christmas Vacation); Denny (Vegas Vacation); and Clark \\"Third\\" Johnson  the namesake of Clark Griswold (Christmas Vacation 2). In addition to those seen, several others are mentioned or alluded to throughout the series. While the Johnsons do not appear in the 2015 Vacation, Eddie is mentioned once. Although Catherine is clearly referred to as Ellen's sister, it is never explained why husband Eddie is called \\"Cousin Eddie\\".\\r\\n\\r\\nWalley World is mentioned in subsequent films following Vacation:\\r\\n\\r\\nClark is usually very easy-going and optimistic, even in the face of adversity and his family's seeming lack of appreciation for his efforts on their behalf. However, when he is pushed beyond the limit of his patience, he tends to lose his temper and go on furious tirades, as seen in the first Vacation, where he scolds his family for not wanting to continue the trip. He also loses his temper in Christmas Vacation where he gets angry at his relatives because of their wanting to leave, and went into a tirade against his boss.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the first Vacation film, Clark sees a golden-haired beauty driving a red Ferrari played by model and actress Christie Brinkley. Clark later encounters her at a hotel, with her attempts to seduce him resulting in an embarrassing failure on his behalf. In Vegas Vacation,  Clark once again drives alongside the same woman, reprised by Christie Brinkley, asking \\"remember me?\\" After she responds that she does, Clark spots a baby in the backseat of her car, clearly indicating she's now a mom and possibly married  much to Clark's disappointment.\\r\\n\\r\\nA new girl in a red Ferrari played by model Hannah Davis appears in the 2015 Vacation. This time, while driving down the highway, the girl pulls alongside Rusty and makes flirtatious gestures at him before swerving into the other lane, being hit head on and killed by a tractor trailer.[20]\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen released in 1983, National Lampoon's Vacation was a significant box-office hit. The film earned over $61 million in the United States with an estimated budget of $15 million.\\r\\n\\r\\nWithout being adjusted for inflation, the profit earned by the individual Vacation films follow behind National Lampoon's Animal House as the highest-grossing films of the National Lampoon brand.[21]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 2000, readers of Total Film magazine voted National Lampoon's Vacation as the 46th greatest comedy film of all time. The film was also nominated for AFI's 100 Years...100 Laughs list in 2000.[35] Christmas Vacation has additionally become a television staple, especially during the holiday season, as it has often been labeled as a contemporary Christmas classic.[36][37][38]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the Family Guy episode \\"Blue Harvest\\", the Griswold Family is seen driving past the Death Star during the battle at the end. In another episode, there is a scene where a woman is driving next to Peter and gets hit by a truck, which mimics the Christie Brinkley car scene from the first Vacation; Lois responds \\"Eh, you marry Billy Joel, it's gonna happen one way or another.\\"\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 2008, Christie Brinkley spoofed her role as \\"The girl in the red Ferrari\\" in a DirecTV commercial that recreated the swimming pool scene from Vacation by inter-splicing footage from the original film.[39]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn November and December 2012, series regulars Chevy Chase and Beverly D'Angelo were featured in a set of commercials for Old Navy. Joining them in one commercial were Juliette Lewis (from Christmas Vacation), Dana Barron and Anthony Michael Hall (from Vacation), and Jason Lively (from European Vacation); that spot featured three Rustys and three Audreys (including a \\"new Rusty\\" and a \\"new Audrey\\", both of whom were children).[40]\\r\\n\\r\\nOn December 25, 2014, in Clark, NJ, a prankster altered the Garden State Parkway Exit 135 sign for \\"Clark and Westfield\\" to read \\"Clark Griswold\\", making national news headlines.[41]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 2015, Christie Brinkley stars as the mom in an Infiniti QX60 TV spot and comments about another blonde beauty driving by in a red convertible. Ethan Embry, who played Rusty in the 1997 Vegas Vacation, plays the dad.[42]","input":"What was the first national lampoon vacation movie?"},{"output":"April 15, 1964","context":"The Chesapeake Bay BridgeÿTunnel (CBBT) is a 23-mile (37?km) bridgeÿtunnel crossing at the mouth of the Chesapeake Bay, the Hampton Roads harbor, and nearby mouths of the James and Elizabeth Rivers in the American state of the Commonwealth of Virginia. It connects Northampton County on the Delmarva Peninsula and Eastern Shore with Virginia Beach, Norfolk, Chesapeake, and Portsmouth on the Western Shore and South side / Tidewater which are part of the Hampton Roads metropolitan area of eight close cities around the harbor's shores and peninsula. The Bridge-Tunnel originally combined 12 miles (19?km) of trestle, two 1-mile-long (1.6?km) tunnels, four artificial islands, four high-level bridges, approximately 2 miles (3.2?km) of causeway, and 5.5 miles (8.9?km) of northeast and southwest approach roadscrossing the Chesapeake Bay and preserving traffic on the Thimble Shoals and Chesapeake dredged shipping channels leading to the Atlantic. It replaced vehicle ferry services that operated from South Hampton Roads and from the Virginia Peninsula since the 1930s. Financed by toll revenue bonds, the BridgeÿTunnel was opened on April 15, 1964,[1] and remains one of only ten bridgeÿtunnel systems in the world, three of which are located in the water dominated Hampton Roads area of Tidewater Virginia.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs of May 2018 the Chesapeake Bay BridgeÿTunnel has been crossed by more than 130 million vehicles.[2] The CBBT complex carries U.S. Route 13, the main northÿsouth highway on Virginia's Eastern Shore on the Delmarva peninsula, and, as part of the East Coast's longstanding Ocean Highway, provides the only straight direct link along the East Coast and Atlantic Ocean, between the Eastern Shore and South Hampton Roads regions, as well as an alternate route to link the Northeast U.S.A. and points in between with Norfolk and further south to the Carolinas and Florida. The BridgeÿTunnel saves motorists 95 miles (153?km) and ?1?1?2 hours on a trip between Virginia Beach/Norfolk and points north and east of the Chesapeake and Delaware Valley, River and Bay without going through the traffic congestion in the BaltimoreÿWashington Metropolitan Area further west in Maryland and Northern Virginia. The $15 toll is partially offset by some savings of highway tolls in Maryland and Delaware and avoiding often heavy traffic on north-south Interstate 95 (I-95) built in the 1960s and completed in the late 1970s and parallel older United States Route 1 (US-1) from the 1920s. From 1995 to 1999, at an additional cost of almost $200 million, the capacity of the above-water portion of bridges on the facility  was increased and widened to four lanes. An upgrade of the two-lane tunnels was proposed in following years but has not yet been carried out.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe crossing was officially named the Lucius J. Kellam Jr. BridgeÿTunnel in August 1987, 23 years after opening, honoring one of the civic leaders who had long worked for its development, construction and operation; it continues however to be best known as the Chesapeake Bay BridgeÿTunnel. The complex was built by and is operated by the Chesapeake Bay Bridge and Tunnel District, a political subdivision of the Commonwealth of Virginia governed by the Chesapeake Bay Bridge and Tunnel Commission and in cooperation with the state Department of Transportation. Costs are recovered through toll collections. In 2002, a Joint Legislative Audit and Review Commission (JLARC) study commissioned by the Virginia General Assembly concluded that \\"given the inability of the state to fund future capital requirements of the CBBT, the District and Commission should be retained to operate and maintain the BridgeÿTunnel as a toll facility in perpetuity.\\"\\r\\n\\r\\nOccasionally because of similar names, the Bridge-Tunnel is often confused with the Chesapeake Bay Bridge (also known as the Governor William Preston Lane, Jr. Memorial Bridge) further north in Maryland crossing the middle portion of the Bay from Annapolis to Kent Island on the Maryland Eastern Shore of  Delmarva. It was built with two lanes and a higher suspension segment in the middle from 1949 - 1952, with a second parallel wider span of three lanes in 1973. It is one of the longest and highest bridges in the world.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn December 1606, the Virginia Company of London sent an expedition to North America to establish a settlement in the Colony of Virginia. After sailing across the Atlantic Ocean from England, they reached the New World at the southern edge of the mouth of what is now known as the Chesapeake Bay.[3] They named the two flanking Virginia points of land /capes like gateposts at the entrance to the long extensive estuary after the sons of their king, James I, the southern Cape Henry, for the eldest and presumed heir, Henry Frederick, Prince of Wales, and the northern Cape Charles, for his younger brother, Charles, Duke of York (the future King Charles I). A few weeks later they established their first permanent settlement on the southern, mainland, side of the Bay, several miles upstream along the newly named James River at Jamestown on the northern shore on a close-in island for protection, the first permanent settlement in English North America.\\r\\n\\r\\nAcross the Bay, the area north of Cape Charles was located along what became known later as the Delmarva Peninsula. As it bordered the Atlantic Ocean to its east, the region became known as Virginia and neighboring Maryland's Eastern Shore. As the entire colony grew, the Bay was a formidable transportation obstacle for exchanges with the Virginia mainland on the Western Shore. One of the eight original shires of Virginia, Accomac Shire was established there in 1634, eventually becoming the two counties of modern times, Accomack County in the north and Northampton to the south. In comparison to mainland regions, commerce and growth was limited by the need to cross the Bay. Consequently, little industrial base grew there, with the oceanfront peninsula staying predominantly rural with small towns and villages oriented towards life on the waters, and most residents made their living by farming and working as watermen, both on the Bay (locally known as the \\"bay side\\") and in the Atlantic Ocean (\\"sea side\\").\\r\\n\\r\\nFor the first 350 years, ships and ferry systems provided the primary transportation.\\r\\n\\r\\nFrom the early 1930s to 1954, the Virginia Ferry Corporation, a privately owned public service company managed a scheduled vehicular (car, bus, truck) and passenger ferry service between the Virginia Eastern Shore and Princess Anne County (now part of the City of Virginia Beach)  on the mainland Western Shore in the South Hampton Roads area. This system, connecting portions of U.S. Route 13, was known as the Little Creek-Cape Charles Ferry.  In 1951, the Northern terminus in Delmarva was relocated to a location now within Kiptopeke State Park.\\r\\n\\r\\nDespite an expanded fleet of large and modern ships by the V.F.C. in the 1940s and early 1950s which were eventually capable of as many as 90 one-way trips each day, the lengthy crossing suffered delays due to heavy traffic and inclement weather.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1954, the General Assembly of Virginia (state legislature) created a political subdivision, the Chesapeake Bay Ferry District and its governing body, the Chesapeake Bay Ferry Commission.  The Commission was authorized to acquire the private ferry corporation through bond financing, to improve the existing V.F.C. ferry service.\\r\\n\\r\\nOnce the BridgeÿTunnel was built by 1964, much of the ferry equipment and vessels used by the Little Creek-Cape Charles Ferry V.F.C. service was then sold and moved north to be redeployed to start the Cape MayÿLewes Ferry across the 17-mile (27?km) mouth of the Delaware Bay between Cape May, in New Jersey and Lewes across in Delaware still serving transit needs but an increasing number of pleasure trip passengers as the coastal beach resorts developed and grew crowded with vacationers in the next decades partly due to the improved swifter transportation with highway and bridges / tunnel access in the region of three states.[4]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1956, the General Assembly authorized the Ferry Commission to conduct feasibility studies for the construction of a fixed crossing. The conclusion of the study indicated that a vehicular crossing was feasible.[2]\\r\\n\\r\\nConsideration was given to service between the Eastern Shore and both the Peninsula and South Hampton Roads. Eventually, the shortest route, extending between the Eastern Shore and a point in Princess Anne County at Chesapeake Beach (east of Little Creek, west of Lynnhaven Inlet), was selected. An option to also provide a fixed crossing link to Hampton and the Peninsula was not pursued.[5]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe selected route crossed two Atlantic shipping channels: the Thimble Shoals Channel to Hampton Roads and the Chesapeake Channel to the northern Chesapeake Bay. High-level bridges were initially considered for traversing these channels. The United States Navy objected to bridging the Thimble Shoals Channel because a bridge collapse (possibly by sabotage) could cut Naval Station Norfolk off from the Atlantic Ocean. Maryland officials expressed similar concerns about the Chesapeake Channel and the Port of Baltimore.[6]\\r\\n\\r\\nTo address these concerns, the engineers recommended a series of bridges and tunnels known as a bridgeÿtunnel, similar in design to the Hampton Roads BridgeÿTunnel, which had been completed in 1957, but a considerably longer and larger facility. The tunnel portions, anchored by four man-made islands of approximately 5 acres (2.0?ha) each, would be extended under the two main shipping channels. The CBBT was designed by the engineering firm Sverdrup & Parcel of St. Louis, Missouri.[6]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn mid-1960, the Chesapeake Bay Ferry Commission sold $200 million in toll revenue bonds to private investors, and the proceeds were used to finance the construction of the bridgeÿtunnel. Funds collected by future tolls were pledged to pay the principal and interest on the bonds. No local, state, or federal tax funds were used in the construction of the project.\\r\\n\\r\\nConstruction contracts were awarded to a consortium of Tidewater Construction Corporation and  Merritt-Chapman & Scott Corporation. The steel superstructure for the high-level bridges near the north end of the crossing were fabricated by the American Bridge Division of United States Steel Corporation. Construction of the bridgeÿtunnel began in October 1960 after a six-month process of assembling necessary equipment from worldwide sources.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe tunnels were constructed using the technique refined by Ole Singstad with the Baltimore Harbor Tunnel, whereby a large ditch was first dug for each tunnel, into which was lowered pre-fabricated tunnel sections cable-suspended from overhead barges. Interior chambers were filled with water to lower the sections, the sections then aligned, bolted together by divers, the water pumped out, and the tunnels finally covered with earth.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe construction was accomplished under the severe conditions imposed by nor'easters, hurricanes, and the unpredictable Atlantic Ocean. During the Ash Wednesday Storm of 1962, much of the partially completed work and a major piece of custom-built equipment, a pile driver barge called \\"The Big D\\",  were destroyed. Seven workers were killed at various times during the construction. In April 1964, 42 months after construction began, the Chesapeake Bay BridgeÿTunnel opened to traffic and the ferry service discontinued.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Ferry Commission and transportation district it oversees, created in 1954, were later renamed for the revised mission of building and operating the Chesapeake Bay BridgeÿTunnel. The CBBT district is a public agency and it is a legal subdivision of the Commonwealth of Virginia. The bridgeÿtunnel is supported financially by the tolls collected from the motorists who use the facility.\\r\\nEastern Shore native, businessman, and civic leader Lucius J. Kellam Jr. (1911ÿ1995) was the original Commission's first chairman. In a commentary at the time of his death in 1995, the Norfolk-based Virginian-Pilot newspaper recalled that Kellam had been involved in bringing the multimillion-dollar bridgeÿtunnel project from dream to reality.\\r\\n\\r\\nBefore it was built, Kellam handled a political fight over the location, and addressed concerns of the U.S. Navy about prospective hazards to navigation to and from the Norfolk Navy Base at Sewell's Point.\\r\\n\\r\\nKellam was also directly involved in the negotiations to finance the ambitious crossing with bonds. According to the newspaper article, \\"there were not-unfounded fears that (1) storm-driven seas and drifting or off-course vessels could damage, if not destroy, the span and (2) traffic might not be sufficient to service the entire debt in an orderly way. Sure enough, bridge portions of the crossing have occasionally been damaged by vessels, and there was a long period when holders of the riskiest bonds received no interest on their investment.\\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAn icon of eastern Virginia politics, Kellam remained chairman and champion of the CBBT throughout the hard times, and the bondholders were eventually paid as toll revenues caught up with expenses. He continued to serve until he was over 80 years old, finally retiring in 1993. He had held the post for 39 years.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe facility was renamed in his honor in 1987, over 20 years after it was first opened to traffic.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt a cost of $197 million, new parallel two-lane trestles were built both to alleviate traffic and for safety reasons. Immediately after completion of the parallel trestles, traffic was diverted to them and the original trestles and roadway underwent a $20 million retrofit, repairing the wear and tear of 35 years of service and upgrading certain features, such as repaving the road surface. The older portion of the facility was then reopened on April 19, 1999.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe 1995ÿ1999 project increased the capacity of the above-water portion of the facility to four lanes, added wider shoulders for the new southbound portion, facilitated needed repairs, and provided protection against a total closure should a trestle be struck by a ship or otherwise damaged (which had occurred twice in the past); partially for this reason, the parallel trestles are not located immediately adjacent to each other, reducing the chance that both would be damaged during a single incident.\\r\\n\\r\\nConstruction is currently underway to add a second tunnel beside the existing tunnel located on the southern end (Thimble Shoals). The Tunnel Boring Machine is expected to be delivered to the site in 2018. After boring the machine will also be adding the circular concrete segments which will be delivered into the tunnel via mine cars one at a time.  \\r\\n\\r\\nAt the northern end, a parallel Chesapeake Channel Tunnel will be added to finish the entire length to become a four lane highway from shore to shore. This project is marked to begin in 2035, which would possibly be open for traffic in 2040, assuming there are no setbacks or delays.\\r\\n\\r\\nToll collection facilities are located at both ends of the facility. Tolls are paid in each direction. As of 2013, the toll for cars (without trailers) traveling along the CBBT is $15. Should a car make a return trip within 24 hours of the first, the second trip across costs $5. Motorcycles pay the same toll as cars without trailers. All other vehicles are charged based on size and purpose and are not subject to the return-trip discount.[8] All tolls must be paid either in cash, debit/credit card, by scrip tickets issued by the CBBT, or via E-ZPass electronic toll collection.[9]  The bridgeÿtunnel began accepting Smart Tag/E-ZPass payments on November 1, 2007.[10][11]\\r\\n\\r\\nAll toll lanes including E-ZPass-only lanes are gated for safety concerns and to turn around inadmissible vehicles. For example:[12]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe bridgeÿtunnel management prohibits bicycles but offers a shuttle van for $15. Cyclists must call ahead.[15]\\r\\n\\r\\nIt is mandatory that the bridge be checked and serviced every five years. Since servicing the bridge takes about five years, the work never stops.[16]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Chesapeake Bay BridgeÿTunnel is one of only two automobile transportation facilities in Virginia that employs its own police department (the other is the Richmond Metropolitan Authority Toll Road Police). By original charter from the Commonwealth, it has authority to enforce the laws of Virginia.[17] Emergency call boxes are spaced every half-mile (.8?km) along the bridge. The toll schedule, weather advisories, and other information are available at the official website for the bridge.[18]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe CBBT promotes the bridgeÿtunnel as not only a transportation facility to tourist destinations to the north and south, but as a destination itself. For travelers headed elsewhere, the bridgeÿtunnel can save more than 90 miles (140?km) of driving for those headed between Ocean City, Maryland, Rehoboth Beach, Fenwick Island, and Wilmington, Delaware (and areas north) and the Virginia Beach area or the Outer Banks of North Carolina, according to the CBBT district. Unlike the Interstate highways that travelers would avoid by taking the bridgeÿtunnel, the roads in the shortcut have traffic lights.[18]\\r\\n\\r\\nOn the Delmarva peninsula to the north of the bridge, travelers may visit nearby Kiptopeke State Park, Eastern Shore National Wildlife Refuge, Fisherman Island National Wildlife Refuge (closed to the public), campgrounds and other vacation destinations. To the south are tourist destinations around Virginia Beach, including First Landing State Park, Norfolk Botanical Garden, Virginia Beach Maritime Historical Museum, Atlantic Wildfowl Heritage Museum, and the Virginia Aquarium and Maritime Science Center.[18]\\r\\n\\r\\nA scenic overlook is located at the north end of the bridge and was formerly located at South Thimble Island, near the south end. At South Thimble Island, passing ships may include U.S. Navy warships, nuclear submarines, and aircraft carriers, as well as large cargo vessels and sailing ships. A restaurant and gift shop on the island opened in 1964, along with the 625-foot-long (191?m) Sea Gull Pier. Bluefish, trout, croaker, flounder, and other species have been caught from the pier. Since birds use the habitat created by the bridges and islands of the CBBT, birders have travelled to the bridgeÿtunnel to see them at South Thimble Island and the scenic overlook at the north end.[18] As part of the Thimble Shoal Channel Tunnel twinning, the building housing the restaurant and gift shop closed and access to the pier was prohibited starting at the end of September 2017.[19] The building will be demolished and not replaced, and the pier will reopen to the public at the end of the project in 2022.[20]\\r\\n\\r\\nAmong the key features of the Chesapeake Bay Bridge Tunnel are two 1-mile (1.6?km) tunnels beneath the Thimble Shoals and Chesapeake navigation channels and two pairs of side-by-side high-level bridges over two other navigation channels: North Channel Bridge (75?ft or 22.9?m clearance) and Fisherman Inlet Bridge (40?ft or 12.2?m clearance). The remaining portion comprises 12 miles (19?km) of low-level trestle, 2 miles (3.2?km) of causeway, and four man-made islands.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe CBBT is 17.6 miles (28.3?km) long from shore to shore, crossing what is essentially an ocean strait. Including land-approach highways, the overall facility is 23 miles (37?km) long (20 miles or 32 kilometres from toll-plaza to toll-plaza)[1] and despite its length, there is only a height difference of 6 inches (152?mm) from the south to north end of the bridgeÿtunnel.\\r\\n\\r\\nMan-made islands, each approximately 5.25 acres (2.12?ha) in size, are located at each end of the two tunnels. Between North Channel and Fisherman Inlet, the facility crosses at grade over Fisherman Island, a barrier island which is part of the Eastern Shore of Virginia National Wildlife Refuge administered by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe columns that support the bridgeÿtunnel's trestles are called piles. If placed end to end, the piles would stretch for about 100 miles (160?km), roughly the distance from New York City to Philadelphia.[21]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Chesapeake Bay Bridge Tunnel has suffered three major ship accidents which caused the bridge tunnel system to be closed.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe first accident occurred in December 1967 when the Mohawk,[22] a coal barge, broke anchor and struck the bridge, closing it for two weeks for repair.[23]\\r\\n\\r\\nOn January 21, 1970 the USS Yancey (AKA-93), a United States Navy attack cargo ship carrying 250 people,[22] was at anchor near the bridge tunnel. During a gale with winds gusting in excess of 50 miles per hour (80?km/h), the Yancey dragged her anchors and hit the bridge stern first, knocking out a 375 foot (114?m) segment of trestle. There were no vehicles on the bridge at the time of the impact, and no one was injured during the incident. During the 42 days it took to replace the damaged span[23] the Navy offered a free shuttle service for commuters using helicopters and LCUs.[24]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1972, the bridge was again impacted by a barge which had broken loose, again closing the bridge-tunnel for two weeks while the span was repaired.[23]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe bridge-tunnel is frequently impacted by barges moving through the highly trafficked area; most incidents cause no damage and require a closure of the system for inspections before reopening. The most recent example of this was the September 2011 barge strike, which closed the bridge-tunnel for less than four hours.[25]\\r\\n\\r\\nRoute map: Google","input":"When did the chesapeake bay bridge-tunnel officially open for traffic?"},{"output":"red blood cells","context":"Blood transfusion is generally the process of receiving blood or blood products into one's circulation intravenously. Transfusions are used for various medical conditions to replace lost components of the blood. Early transfusions used whole blood, but modern medical practice commonly uses only components of the blood, such as red blood cells, white blood cells, plasma, clotting factors, and platelets.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nHistorically, red blood cell transfusion was considered when the hemoglobin level fell below 100?g/L or hematocrit falls below 30%.[1][2] Because each unit of blood given carries risks, a trigger level lower than that at 70 to 80?g/L is now usually used as it has been shown to have better patient outcomes.[3][4] The administration of a single unit of blood is the standard for hospitalized people who are not bleeding, with this treatment then followed with re-assessment and consideration of symptoms and hemoglobin concentration.[3] Patients with poor oxygen saturation may need more blood.[3] The advisory caution to use blood transfusion only with more severe anemia is in part due to evidence that outcomes are worsened if larger amounts are given.[5] One may consider transfusion for people with symptoms of cardiovascular disease such as chest pain or shortness of breath.[2] In cases where patients have low levels of hemoglobin but are cardiovascularly stable, parenteral iron is a preferred option based on both efficacy and safety.[6] Other blood products are given where appropriate, such as clotting deficiencies.\\r\\nBefore a blood transfusion is given, there are many steps taken to ensure quality of the blood products, compatibility, and safety to the recipient. In 2012, a national blood policy was in place in 70% of countries and 62% of countries had specific legislation that covers the safety and quality of blood transfusion.[7]\\r\\nBlood transfusions typically use sources of blood: one's own (autologous transfusion), or someone else's (allogeneic or homologous transfusion). The latter is much more common than the former. Using another's blood must first start with donation of blood. Blood is most commonly donated as whole blood intravenously and collecting it with an anticoagulant. In developed countries, donations are usually anonymous to the recipient, but products in a blood bank are always individually traceable through the whole cycle of donation, testing, separation into components, storage, and administration to the recipient. This enables management and investigation of any suspected transfusion related disease transmission or transfusion reaction. In developing countries the donor is sometimes specifically recruited by or for the recipient, typically a family member, and the donation occurs immediately before the transfusion.\\r\\nDonated blood is usually subjected to processing after it is collected, to make it suitable for use in specific patient populations. Collected blood is then separated into blood components by centrifugation: red blood cells, plasma, platelets, albumin protein, clotting factor concentrates, cryoprecipitate, fibrinogen concentrate, and immunoglobulins (antibodies). Red cells, plasma and platelets can also be donated individually via a more complex process called apheresis.\\r\\nBefore a recipient receives a transfusion, compatibility testing between donor and recipient blood must be done. The first step before a transfusion is given is to type and screen the recipient's blood. Typing of recipient's blood determines the ABO and Rh status. The sample is then screened for any alloantibodies that may react with donor blood.[21] It takes about 45 minutes to complete (depending on the method used). The blood bank scientist also checks for special requirements of the patient (e.g. need for washed, irradiated or CMV negative blood) and the history of the patient to see if they have previously identified antibodies and any other serological anomalies.\\r\\nA positive screen warrants an antibody panel/investigation to determine if it is clinically significant. An antibody panel consists of commercially prepared group O red cell suspensions from donors that have been phenotyped for antigens that correspond to commonly encountered and clinically significant alloantibodies. Donor cells may have homozygous (e.g. K+k?), heterozygous (K+k+) expression or no expression of various antigens (K?k?). The phenotypes of all the donor cells being tested are shown in a chart. The patient's serum is tested against the various donor cells. Based on the reactions of the patient's serum against the donor cells, a pattern will emerge to confirm the presence of one or more antibodies. Not all antibodies are clinically significant (i.e. cause transfusion reactions, HDN, etc.). Once the patient has developed a clinically significant antibody it is vital that the patient receive antigen-negative red blood cells to prevent future transfusion reactions. A direct antiglobulin test (Coombs test) is also performed as part of the antibody investigation.[22]\\r\\nIf there is no antibody present, an immediate spin crossmatch or computer assisted crossmatch is performed where the recipient serum and donor rbc are incubated. In the immediate spin method, two drops of patient serum are tested against a drop of 3ÿ5% suspension of donor cells in a test tube and spun in a serofuge. Agglutination or hemolysis (i.e., positive Coombs test) in the test tube is a positive reaction and the unit should not be transfused.\\r\\nIf an antibody is suspected, potential donor units must first be screened for the corresponding antigen by phenotyping them. Antigen negative units are then tested against the patient plasma using an antiglobulin/indirect crossmatch technique at 37 degrees Celsius to enhance reactivity and make the test easier to read.\\r\\nIn urgent cases where crossmatching cannot be completed, and the risk of dropping hemoglobin outweighs the risk of transfusing uncrossmatched blood, O-negative blood is used, followed by crossmatch as soon as possible. O-negative is also used for children and women of childbearing age. It is preferable for the laboratory to obtain a pre-transfusion sample in these cases so a type and screen can be performed to determine the actual blood group of the patient and to check for alloantibodies.\\r\\nThis chart shows possible matches in blood transfusion between donor and receiver using ABO and Rh system.\\r\\nIn the same way that the safety of pharmaceutical products is overseen by pharmacovigilance, the safety of blood and blood products is overseen by haemovigilance. This is defined by the World Health Organization (WHO) as a system \\"...to identify and prevent occurrence or recurrence of transfusion related unwanted events, to increase the safety, efficacy and efficiency of blood transfusion, covering all activities of the transfusion chain from donor to recipient.\\" The system should include monitoring, identification, reporting, investigation and analysis of adverse events near-misses and reactions related to transfusion and manufacturing.[23] In the UK this data is collected by an independent organisation called SHOT (Serious Hazards Of Transfusion).[24]\\r\\nTransfusions of blood products are associated with several complications, many of which can be grouped as immunological or infectious. There is controversy on potential quality degradation during storage.[25]\\r\\nThe use of greater amount of red blood cells is associated with a high risk of infections. In those who were given red blood only with significant anemia infection rates were 12% while in those who were given red blood at milder levels of anemia infection rates were 17%.[32] [clarification needed]\\r\\nOn rare occasions, blood products are contaminated with bacteria. This can result in a life-threatening infection known as transfusion-transmitted bacterial infection. The risk of severe bacterial infection is estimated, as of 2002, at about 1 in 50,000 platelet transfusions, and 1 in 500,000 red blood cell transfusions.[33] Blood product contamination, while rare, is still more common than actual infection. The reason platelets are more often contaminated than other blood products is that they are stored at room temperature for short periods of time. Contamination is also more common with longer duration of storage, especially if that means more than 5 days. Sources of contaminants include the donor's blood, donor's skin, phlebotomist's skin, and containers. Contaminating organisms vary greatly, and include skin flora, gut flora, and environmental organisms. There are many strategies in place at blood donation centers and laboratories to reduce the risk of contamination. A definite diagnosis of transfusion-transmitted bacterial infection includes the identification of a positive culture in the recipient (without an alternative diagnosis) as well as the identification of the same organism in the donor blood.\\r\\nSince the advent of HIV testing of donor blood in the mid/later 1980s, ex. 1985's ELISA, the transmission of HIV during transfusion has dropped dramatically. Prior testing of donor blood only included testing for antibodies to HIV. However, due to latent infection (the \\"window period\\" in which an individual is infectious, but has not had time to develop antibodies) many cases of HIV seropositive blood were missed. The development of a nucleic acid test for the HIV-1 RNA has dramatically lowered the rate of donor blood seropositivity to about 1 in 3 million units. As transmittance of HIV does not necessarily mean HIV infection, the latter could still occur at an even lower rate.\\r\\nThe transmission of hepatitis C via transfusion currently stands at a rate of about 1 in 2 million units. As with HIV, this low rate has been attributed to the ability to screen for both antibodies as well as viral RNA nucleic acid testing in donor blood.\\r\\nOther rare transmissible infections include hepatitis B, syphilis, Chagas disease, cytomegalovirus infections (in immunocompromised recipients), HTLV, and Babesia.\\r\\nTransfusion inefficacy or insufficient efficacy of a given unit(s) of blood product, while not itself a \\"complication\\" per se, can nonetheless indirectly lead to complications ÿ in addition to causing a transfusion to fully or partly fail to achieve its clinical purpose. This can be especially significant for certain patient groups such as critical-care or neonatals.\\r\\nFor red blood cells (RBC), by far the most commonly transfused product, poor transfusion efficacy can result from units damaged by the so-called storage lesion ÿ a range of biochemical and biomechanical changes that occur during storage. With red cells, this can decrease viability and ability for tissue oxygenation.[34] Although some of the biochemical changes are reversible after the blood is transfused,[35] the biomechanical changes are less so,[36] and rejuvenation products are not yet able to adequately reverse this phenomenon.[37] There has been controversy about whether a given product unit's age is a factor in transfusion efficacy, specifically about whether \\"older\\" blood directly or indirectly increases risks of complications.[38][39] Studies have not been consistent on answering this question,[40] with some showing that older blood is indeed less effective but with others showing no such difference; these developments are being closely followed by hospital blood bankers ÿ who are the physicians, typically pathologists, who collect and manage inventories of transfusable blood units.\\r\\nCertain regulatory measures are in place to minimize RBC storage lesion ÿ including a maximum shelf life (currently 42 days), a maximum auto-hemolysis threshold (currently 1% in the US, 0.8% in Europe), and a minimum level of post-transfusion RBC survival in vivo (currently 75% after 24 hours).[41] However, all of these criteria are applied in a universal manner that does not account for differences among units of product.[42] For example, testing for the post-transfusion RBC survival in vivo is done on a sample of healthy volunteers, and then compliance is presumed for all RBC units based on universal (GMP) processing standards (of course, RBC survival by itself does not guarantee efficacy, but it is a necessary prerequisite for cell function, and hence serves as a regulatory proxy). Opinions vary as to the \\"best\\" way to determine transfusion efficacy in a patient in vivo.[43] In general, there are not yet any in vitro tests to assess quality or predict efficacy for specific units of RBC blood product prior to their transfusion, though there is exploration of potentially relevant tests based on RBC membrane properties such as erythrocyte deformability[44] and erythrocyte fragility (mechanical).[45]\\r\\nPhysicians have adopted a so-called \\"restrictive protocol\\" ÿ whereby transfusion is held to a minimum ÿ due in part to the noted uncertainties surrounding storage lesion, in addition to the very high direct and indirect costs of transfusions.[46][47][48] Of course, restrictive protocol is not an option with some especially vulnerable patients who may require the best possible efforts to rapidly restore tissue oxygenation.\\r\\nAlthough transfusions of platelets are far less numerous (relative to RBC), platelet storage lesion and resulting efficacy loss is also a concern.[49]\\r\\nGlobally around 85 million units of red blood cells are transfused in a given year.[2]\\r\\nIn the United States, blood transfusions were performed nearly 3 million times during hospitalizations in 2011, making it the most common procedure performed. The rate of hospitalizations with a blood transfusion nearly doubled from 1997, from a rate of 40 stays to 95 stays per 10,000 population. It was the most common procedure performed for patients 45 years of age and older in 2011, and among the top five most common for patients between the ages of 1 and 44 years.[55]\\r\\nAccording to the New York Times: \\"Changes in medicine have eliminated the need for millions of blood transfusions, which is good news for patients getting procedures like coronary bypasses and other procedures that once required a lot of blood.\\" And, \\"Blood bank revenue is falling, and the decline may reach $1.5 billion a year this year [2014] from a high of $5 billion in 2008.\\" Job losses will reach as high as 12,000 within the next three to five years, roughly a quarter of the total in the industry, according to the Red Cross.[56]\\r\\nBeginning with William Harvey's experiments on the circulation of blood, research into blood transfusion began in the 17th century, with successful experiments in transfusion between animals. However, successive attempts by physicians to transfuse animal blood into humans gave variable, often fatal, results.\\r\\nPope Innocent VIII is sometimes said to have been given \\"the world's first blood transfusion\\" by his Jewish physician Giacomo di San Genesio, who had him drink (by mouth) the blood of three 10-year-old boys. The boys subsequently died. The evidence for this story, however, is unreliable and may have been motivated by anti-semitism.[57]\\r\\nWorking at the Royal Society in the 1660s, the physician Richard Lower began examining the effects of changes in blood volume on circulatory function and developed methods for cross-circulatory study in animals, obviating clotting by closed arteriovenous connections. The new instruments he was able to devise enabled him to perform the first reliably documented successful transfusion of blood in front of his distinguished colleagues from the Royal Society.\\r\\nAccording to Lower's account, \\"...towards the end of February 1665 [I] selected one dog of medium size, opened its jugular vein, and drew off blood, until  its strength was nearly gone. Then, to make up for the great loss of this dog by the blood of a second, I introduced blood from the cervical artery of a fairly large mastiff, which had been fastened alongside the first, until this latter animal showed  it was overfilled  by the inflowing blood.\\" After he \\"sewed up the jugular veins,\\" the animal recovered \\"with no sign of discomfort or of displeasure.\\"\\r\\nLower had performed the first blood transfusion between animals. He was then \\"requested by the Honorable [Robert] Boyle  to acquaint the Royal Society with the procedure for the whole experiment,\\" which he did in December 1665 in the Society's Philosophical Transactions. [58]\\r\\nThe first blood transfusion from animal to human was administered by Dr. Jean-Baptiste Denys, eminent physician to King Louis?XIV of France, on June?15, 1667.[59] He transfused the blood of a sheep into a 15-year-old boy, who survived the transfusion.[60] Denys performed another transfusion into a labourer, who also survived. Both instances were likely due to the small amount of blood that was actually transfused into these people. This allowed them to withstand the allergic reaction.\\r\\nDenys' third patient to undergo a blood transfusion was Swedish Baron Gustaf Bonde. He received two transfusions. After the second transfusion Bonde died.[61] In the winter of 1667, Denys performed several transfusions on Antoine Mauroy with calf's blood. On the third account Mauroy died.[62]\\r\\nSix months later in London, Lower performed the first human transfusion of animal blood in Britain, where he \\"superintended the introduction in [a patient's] arm at various times of some ounces of sheep's blood at a meeting of the Royal Society, and without any inconvenience to him.\\" The recipient was Arthur Coga, \\"the subject of a harmless form of insanity.\\" Sheep's blood was used because of speculation about the value of blood exchange between species; it had been suggested that blood from a gentle lamb might quiet the tempestuous spirit of an agitated person and that the shy might be made outgoing by blood from more sociable creatures. Coga received 20 shillings (equivalent to S158 in 2016) to participate in the experiment.[63]\\r\\nLower went on to pioneer new devices for the precise control of blood flow and the transfusion of blood; his designs were substantially the same as modern syringes and catheters.[58] Shortly after, Lower moved to London, where his growing practice soon led him to abandon research.[64]\\r\\nThese early experiments with animal blood provoked a heated controversy in Britain and France.[61] Finally, in 1668, the Royal Society and the French government both banned the procedure. The Vatican condemned these experiments in 1670. Blood transfusions fell into obscurity for the next 150 years.\\r\\nThe science of blood transfusion dates to the first decade of the 20th century, with the discovery of distinct blood types leading to the practice of mixing some blood from the donor and the receiver before the transfusion (an early form of cross-matching).\\r\\nIn the early 19th century, British obstetrician Dr. James Blundell made efforts to treat hemorrhage by transfusion of human blood using a syringe. In 1818 following experiments with animals, he performed the first successful transfusion of human blood to treat postpartum hemorrhage. Blundell used the patient's husband as a donor, and extracted four ounces of blood from his arm to transfuse into his wife. During the years 1825 and 1830, Blundell performed 10 transfusions, five of which were beneficial, and published his results. He also invented a number of instruments for the transfusion of blood.[65] He made a substantial amount of money from this endeavour, roughly $2 million ($50 million real dollars).[66]\\r\\nIn 1840, at St George's Hospital Medical School in London, Samuel Armstrong Lane, aided by Dr. Blundell, performed the first successful whole blood transfusion to treat haemophilia.\\r\\nHowever, early transfusions were risky and many resulted in the death of the patient. By the late 19th century, blood transfusion was regarded as a risky and dubious procedure, and was largely shunned by the medical establishment.\\r\\nWork to emulate James Blundell continued in Edinburgh. In 1845 the Edinburgh Journal described the successful transfusion of blood to a woman with severe uterine bleeding. Subsequent transfusions were successful with patients of Professor James Young Simpson after whom the Simpson Memorial Hospital in Edinburgh was named.[67]\\r\\nThe largest series of early successful transfusions took place at the Edinburgh Royal Infirmary between 1885 and 1892. Edinburgh later became the home of the first blood donation and blood transfusion services.[67]\\r\\nIt was not until 1901, when the Austrian Karl Landsteiner discovered three human blood groups (O, A, and B), that blood transfusion was put onto a scientific basis and became safer.\\r\\nLandsteiner discovered that adverse effects arise from mixing blood from two incompatible individuals. He found that when incompatible types are mixed, an immune response is triggered and the red blood cells clump. The immunological reaction occurs when the receiver of a blood transfusion has antibodies against the donor blood cells. The destruction of red blood cells releases free hemoglobin into the bloodstream, which can have fatal consequences. Landsteiner's work made it possible to determine blood group and allowed a way for blood transfusions to be carried out much more safely. For this discovery he was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physiology and Medicine in 1930, and many other blood groups have been discovered since.\\r\\nGeorge Washington Crile is credited with performing the first surgery using a direct blood transfusion in 1906 at St. Alexis Hospital in Cleveland while a professor of surgery at Case Western Reserve University.[when?][68]\\r\\nJan Jansky also discovered the human blood groups in 1907 which he classified blood into four groups I, II, III, IV. Titled in Czech \\"Hematologick studie u psychotik?\\". His nomenclature is still used in Russia and states of the former USSR, in which blood types O, A, B, and AB are respectively designated I, II, III, and IV.\\r\\nDr. William Lorenzo Moss's (1876ÿ1957) Moss-blood typing technique of 1910 was widely used until World War II.[69][70]\\r\\nWilliam Stewart Halsted, M.D. (September 23, 1852 ÿ September 7, 1922) was an American surgeon who emphasized strict aseptic technique during surgical procedures, was an early champion of newly discovered anesthetics, and introduced several new operations, including the radical mastectomy for breast cancer. Halsted returned to New York in 1880 and for the next six years led an extraordinarily vigorous and energetic life. He operated at multiple hospitals, including Roosevelt Hospital, the College of Physicians and Surgeons, Charity Hospital, Emigrant Hospital, Bellevue Hospital and Chambers Street Hospital. He was an extremely popular, inspiring and charismatic teacher. In 1882 he performed one of the first gallbladder operations in the United States (a cholecystotomy performed on his mother on the kitchen table at 2?am). Halsted also performed one of the first blood transfusions in the United States. He had been called to see his sister after she had given birth. He found her moribund from blood loss, and in a bold move withdrew his own blood, transfused his blood into his sister, and then operated on her to save her life.\\r\\nWhile the first transfusions had to be made directly from donor to receiver before coagulation, it was discovered that by adding anticoagulant and refrigerating the blood it was possible to store it for some days, thus opening the way for the development of blood banks. John Braxton Hicks was the first to experiment with chemical methods to prevent the coagulation of blood at St Mary's Hospital, London in the late 19th century. His attempts, using phosphate of soda, however, were unsuccessful.\\r\\nThe first non-direct transfusion was performed on March?27, 1914 by the Belgian doctor Albert Hustin, though this was a diluted solution of blood. The Argentine doctor Luis Agote used a much less diluted solution in November of the same year. Both used sodium citrate as an anticoagulant.[71]\\r\\nThe First World War acted as a catalyst for the rapid development of blood banks and transfusion techniques. Canadian doctor and Lieutenant Lawrence Bruce Robertson was instrumental in persuading the Royal Army Medical Corps to adopt the use of blood transfusion at the Casualty Clearing Stations for the wounded. In October 1915, Robertson performed his first wartime transfusion with a syringe to a patient suffering from multiple shrapnel wounds. He followed this up with four subsequent transfusions in the following months and his success was reported to Sir Walter Morley Fletcher, director of the Medical Research Committee.[72]\\r\\nRobertson published his findings in the British Medical Journal in 1916 and, with the help of a few like minded individuals (including the eminent physician Edward William Archibald who introduced the citrate anticoagulant method), was able to persuade the British authorities of the merits of blood transfusion. Robertson went on to establish the first blood transfusion apparatus at a Casualty Clearing Station on the Western Front in the spring of 1917.[72] [73]\\r\\nOswald Hope Robertson, a medical researcher and U.S.?Army officer was attached to the RAMC in 1917, where he was instrumental in establishing the first blood banks, in preparation for the anticipated Third Battle of Ypres.[74] He used sodium citrate as the anticoagulant and the blood was extracted from punctures in the vein and was stored in bottles at British and American Casualty Clearing Stations along the Front. He also experimented with preserving separated red blood cells in iced bottles.[73] Geoffrey Keynes, a British surgeon, developed a portable machine that could store blood to enable transfusions to be carried out more easily.\\r\\nThe world's first blood donor service was established in 1921 by the secretary of the British Red Cross, Percy Oliver. In that year, Oliver was contacted by King's College Hospital, where they were in urgent need of a blood donor. [75] After providing a donor, Oliver set about organizing a system for the voluntary registration of blood donors at clinics around London, with Sir Geoffrey Keynes appointed as a medical adviser. Volunteers were subjected to a series of physical tests to establish their blood group. The London Blood Transfusion Service was free of charge and expanded rapidly in its first few years of operation. By 1925, it was providing services for almost 500 patients and it was incorporated into the structure of the British Red Cross in 1926. Similar systems were established in other cities including Sheffield, Manchester and Norwich, and the service's work began to attract international attention. Similar services were established in France, Germany, Austria, Belgium, Australia and Japan.[76]\\r\\nAn academic institution devoted to the science of blood transfusion was founded by Alexander Bogdanov in Moscow in 1925. Bogdanov was motivated, at least in part, by a search for eternal youth, and remarked with satisfaction on the improvement of his eyesight, suspension of balding, and other positive symptoms after receiving 11 transfusions of whole blood. Bogdanov died in 1928 as a result of one of his experiments, when the blood of a student suffering from malaria and tuberculosis was given to him in a transfusion.[77] Following Bogdanov's lead, Vladimir Shamov and Sergei Yudin in the USSR pioneered the transfusion of cadaveric blood from recently deceased donors. Yudin performed such a transfusion successfully for the first time on March 23, 1930 and reported his first seven clinical transfusions with cadaveric blood at the Fourth Congress of Ukrainian Surgeons at Kharkiv in September. However, this method was never used widely, even in Russia.\\r\\nOne of the earliest blood banks was established by Frederic Durn-Jord during the Spanish Civil War in 1936. Duran joined the Transfusion Service at the Barcelona Hospital at the start of the conflict, but the hospital was soon overwhelmed by the demand for blood and the paucity of available donors. With support from the Department of Health of the Spanish Republican Army, Duran established a blood bank for the use of wounded soldiers and civilians. The 300ÿ400?mL of extracted blood was mixed with 10% citrate solution in a modified Duran Erlenmeyer flask. The blood was stored in a sterile glass enclosed under pressure at 2?C. During 30 months of work, the Transfusion Service of Barcelona registered almost 30,000 donors, and processed 9,000 liters of blood. [78]\\r\\nIn 1937 Bernard Fantus, director of therapeutics at the Cook County Hospital in Chicago, established the first hospital blood bank in the United States. In creating a hospital laboratory that preserved, refrigerated and stored donor blood, Fantus originated the term \\"blood bank\\". Within a few years, hospital and community blood banks were established across the United States.[79]\\r\\nFrederic Durn-Jord fled to Britain in 1938, and worked with Dr Janet Vaughan at the Royal Postgraduate Medical School at Hammersmith Hospital to create a system of national blood banks in London.[80] With the outbreak of war looking imminent in 1938, the War Office created the Army Blood Supply Depot (ABSD) in Bristol headed by Lionel Whitby and in control of four large blood depots around the country. British policy through the war was to supply military personnel with blood from centralized depots, in contrast to the approach taken by the Americans and Germans where troops at the front were bled to provide required blood. The British method proved to be more successful at adequately meeting all requirements and over 700,000 donors were bled over the course of the war. This system evolved into the National Blood Transfusion Service established in 1946, the first national service to be implemented. [81]\\r\\nA blood collection program was initiated in the US in 1940 and Edwin Cohn pioneered the process of blood fractionation. He worked out the techniques for isolating the serum albumin fraction of blood plasma, which is essential for maintaining the osmotic pressure in the blood vessels, preventing their collapse.\\r\\nThe use of blood plasma as a substitute for whole blood and for transfusion purposes was proposed as early as 1918, in the correspondence columns of the British Medical Journal, by Gordon R. Ward. At the onset of World War II, liquid plasma was used in Britain. A large project, known as 'Blood for Britain' began in August 1940 to collect blood in New York City hospitals for the export of plasma to Britain. A dried plasma package was developed, which reduced breakage and made the transportation, packaging, and storage much simpler.[82]\\r\\nThe resulting dried plasma package came in two tin cans containing 400 mL bottles. One bottle contained enough distilled water to reconstitute the dried plasma contained within the other bottle. In about three minutes, the plasma would be ready to use and could stay fresh for around four hours.[83] Dr. Charles R. Drew was appointed medical supervisor, and he was able to transform the test tube methods into the first successful technique for mass production.\\r\\nAnother important breakthrough came in 1939ÿ40 when Karl Landsteiner, Alex Wiener, Philip Levine, and R.E. Stetson discovered the Rhesus blood group system, which was found to be the cause of the majority of transfusion reactions up to that time. Three years later, the introduction by J.F. Loutit and Patrick L. Mollison of acidÿcitrateÿdextrose (ACD) solution, which reduced the volume of anticoagulant, permitted transfusions of greater volumes of blood and allowed longer term storage.\\r\\nCarl Walter and W.P. Murphy Jr. introduced the plastic bag for blood collection in 1950. Replacing breakable glass bottles with durable plastic bags made from PVC allowed for the evolution of a collection system capable of safe and easy preparation of multiple blood components from a single unit of whole blood.\\r\\nIn the field of cancer surgery replacement of massive blood loss became a major problem. The cardiac arrest rate was high. In 1963, C. Paul Boyan and William S. Howland discovered that the temperature of the blood and the rate of infusion greatly affected survival rates, and introduced blood warming to surgery.[84][85]\\r\\nFurther extending the shelf life of stored blood was an anticoagulant preservative, CPDA-1, introduced in 1979, which increased the blood supply and facilitated resource-sharing among blood banks.\\r\\nAs of 2006, there were about 15 million units of blood products transfused per year in the United States.[86] By 2013, the number had declined to about 11 million units, due to the shift towards laparoscopic surgery and other surgical advances and studies that have shown that many transfusions were unnecessary. For example, the standard of care reduced that amount of blood transfused from 750 to 200?ml.[87]\\r\\nTo ensure the safety of blood transfusion to pediatric patients, hospitals are taking additional precaution to avoid infection and prefer to use specially tested pediatric blood units that are guaranteed negative for Cytomegalovirus. Most guidelines recommend the provision of CMV-negative blood components and not simply leukoreduced components for newborns or low birthweight infants in whom the immune system is not fully developed.[88] These specific requirements place additional restrictions on blood donors who can donate for neonatal use. vnv Neonatal transfusions typically fall into one of two categories:\\r\\nA massive transfusion protocol is used for massive trauma resuscitation, when more than ten units of blood are needed. Packed red blood cells, fresh frozen plasma, and platelets are administered in lieu of crystalloids or whole blood.[90] Typically higher ratios of fresh frozen plasma and platelets are given relative to packed red blood cells.[90]\\r\\nBecause blood type O negative is compatible with anyone, it is often overused and in short supply.[91] According to the American Association of Blood Banks, the use of this blood should be restricted to persons with O negative blood, as nothing else is compatible with them, and women who might be pregnant and for whom it would be impossible to do blood group testing before giving them emergency treatment.[91] Whenever possible, the AABB recommends that O negative blood be conserved by using blood type testing to identify a less scarce alternative.[91]\\r\\nJehovah's Witnesses object to blood transfusions due to their belief that blood is sacred.[92]\\r\\nAlthough there are clinical situations where transfusion with red blood cells is the only clinically appropriate option, clinicians look at whether alternatives as feasible. This can be due to several reasons, such as patient safety, economic burden or scarcity of blood. Guidelines recommend blood transfusions should be reserved for patients with or at risk of cardiovascular instability due to the degree of their anaemia.[93][94] In these cases parenteral iron is recommended.\\r\\nThus far, there are no available oxygen-carrying blood substitutes, which is the typical objective of a blood (RBC) transfusion; however, there are widely available non-blood volume expanders for cases where only volume restoration is required. These are helping doctors and surgeons avoid the risks of disease transmission and immune suppression, address the chronic blood donor shortage, and address the concerns of Jehovah's Witnesses and others who have religious objections to receiving transfused blood.\\r\\nA number of blood substitutes have been explored (and still are), but thus far they all suffer from many challenges. Most attempts to find a suitable alternative to blood thus far have concentrated on cell-free hemoglobin solutions. Blood substitutes could make transfusions more readily available in emergency medicine and in pre-hospital EMS care. If successful, such a blood substitute could save many lives, particularly in trauma where massive blood loss results. Hemopure, a hemoglobin-based therapy, is approved for use in South Africa.\\r\\nMinor blood transfusions are used by a minority of nyaope drug addicts in South Africa to economically share the high the drug induces in a practice colloquially known as Bluetoothing, named after the wireless technology of the same name.[95]\\r\\nVeterinarians also administer transfusions to other animals. Various species require different levels of testing to ensure a compatible match. For example, cats have 3 known blood types, cattle have 11, dogs have 12, pigs 16 and horses have 34. However, in many species (especially horses and dogs), cross matching is not required before the first transfusion, as antibodies against non-self cell surface antigens are not expressed constitutively ÿ i.e. the animal has to be sensitized before it will mount an immune response against the transfused blood.\\r\\nThe rare and experimental practice of inter-species blood transfusions is a form of xenograft.","input":"What is the most common transfused component of blood?"},{"output":"the 3rd week","context":"Neural tube defects (NTDs) are a group of birth defects in which an opening in the spinal cord or brain remains from early in human development. In the 3rd week of pregnancy called gastrulation, specialized cells on the dorsal side of the embryo begin to change shape and form the neural tube. When the neural tube does not close completely, an NTD develops.\\r\\nSpecific types include: spina bifida which affects the spine, anencephaly which results in little to no brain, encephalocele which affects the skull, and iniencephaly which results in severe neck problems.[1]\\r\\nNTDs are one of the most common birth defects, affecting over 300,000 births each year worldwide.[2] For example, spina bifida affects approximately 1,500 births annually in the USA, or about 3.5 in every 10,000 (0.035% of US births),[1][3] which has decreased from around 5 per 10,000 (0.05% of US births) since folate fortification of grain products was started.[3] The number of deaths in the US each year due to neural tube defects also declined from 1,200 before folate fortification was started to 840.[4]\\r\\nThere are two types of NTDs: open, which are more common, and closed. Open NTDs occur when the brain and/or spinal cord are exposed at birth through a defect in the skull or vertebrae (back bones). Examples of open NTDs are anencephaly, encephaloceles, hydranencephaly, iniencephaly, schizencephaly, and spina bifida. Rarer types of NTDs are called closed NTDs. Closed NTDs occur when the spinal defect is covered by skin. Common examples of closed NTDs are lipomyelomeningocele, lipomeningocele, and tethered cord.\\r\\nAnencephaly (without brain) is a neural tube defect that occurs when the head end of the neural tube fails to close, usually during the 23rd and 26th days of pregnancy, resulting in an absence of a major portion of the brain and skull. Infants born with this condition are born without the main part of the forebrainthe largest part of the cerebrumand are usually blind, deaf and unconscious. The lack of a functioning cerebrum will ensure that the infant will never gain consciousness. Infants are either stillborn or usually die within a few hours or days after birth.\\r\\nEncephaloceles are characterized by protrusions of the brain through the skull that are sac-like and covered with membrane. They can be a groove down the middle of the upper part of the skull, between the forehead and nose, or the back of the skull. Encephaloceles are often obvious and diagnosed immediately. Sometimes small encephaloceles in the nasal and forehead are undetected.[5]\\r\\nHydranencephaly is a condition in which the cerebral hemispheres are missing and instead filled with sacs of cerebrospinal fluid.\\r\\nIniencephaly is a rare neural tube defect that results in extreme bending of the head to the spine. The diagnosis can usually be made on antenatal ultrasound scanning, but if not will undoubtedly be made immediately after birth because the head is bent backwards and the face looks upwards. Usually the neck is absent. The skin of the face connects directly to the chest and the scalp connects to the upper back. The infant will usually not survive more than a few hours.\\r\\nSpina bifida is further divided into two subclasses, spina bifida cystica and spina bifida occulta.\\r\\nThis includes meningocele and myelomeningocele. Meningocele is less severe and is characterized by herniation of the meninges, but not the spinal cord, through the opening in the spinal canal. Myelomeningocele involves herniation of the meninges as well as the spinal cord through the opening.[6]\\r\\nIn this type of neural tube defect, the meninges do not herniate through the opening in the spinal canal.[6] By definition, spina bifida occulta means hidden split spine.[7] The most frequently seen form of spina bifida occulta is when parts of the bones of the spine, called the spinous process, and the neural arch appear abnormal on a radiogram, without involvement of the spinal cord and spinal nerves.[8] The risk of recurrence in those who have a first degree relative (a parent or sibling) is 5ÿ10 times greater compared to the general population.[citation needed]\\r\\nInadequate levels of folate (vitamin B9) and vitamin B12 during pregnancy have been found to lead to increased risk of NTDs.[9][10] Although both are part of the same biopathway, folate deficiency is much more common and therefore more of a concern.[9][10] Folate is required for the production and maintenance of new cells, for DNA synthesis and RNA synthesis. Folate is needed to carry one carbon groups for methylation and nucleic acid synthesis. It has been hypothesized that the early human embryo may be particularly vulnerable to folate deficiency due to differences of the functional enzymes in this pathway during embryogenesis combined with high demand for post translational methylations of the cytoskeleton in neural cells during neural tube closure.[11] Failure of post-translational methylation of the cytoskeleton, required for differentiation has been implicated in neural tube defects.[12] Vitamin B12 is also an important receptor in the folate biopathway such that studies have shown deficiency in vitamin B12 contributes to risk of NTDs as well.[13] There is substantial evidence that direct folic supplementation increases blood serum levels of bioavailable folate even though at least one study have shown slow and variable activity of dihydrofolate reductase in human liver.[14][15] A diet rich in natural folate (350 g/d) can show as much increase in plasma folate as taking low levels of folic acid (250 g/d) in individuals[16] However a comparison of general population outcomes across many countries with different approaches to increasing folate consumption has found that only general food fortification with folic acid reduces neural tube defects.[17] While there have been concerns about folic acid supplementation being linked to an increased risk for cancer, a systematic review in 2012 shows there is no evidence except in the case of prostate cancer which indicates a modest reduction in risk.[18]\\r\\nA deficiency of folate itself does not cause neural tube defects. The association seen between reduced neural tube defects and folic acid supplementation is due to a gene-environment interaction such as vulnerability caused by the C677T Methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) variant. Supplementing folic acid during pregnancy reduces the prevalence of NTDs by not exposing this otherwise sub-clinical mutation to aggravating conditions.[19] Other potential causes can include folate antimetabolites (such as methotrexate), mycotoxins in contaminated corn meal, arsenic, hyperthermia in early development, and radiation.[20][21][22] Maternal obesity has also been found to be a risk factor for NTDs.[23] Studies have shown that both maternal cigarette smoking and maternal exposure to secondhand smoke increased the risk for neural tube defects in offspring.[24] A mechanism by which maternal exposure to cigarette smoke could increase NTD risk in offspring is suggested by several studies that show an association between cigarette smoking and elevations of homocysteine levels.[citation needed] Cigarette smoke during pregnancy, including secondhand exposure, can increase the risk of neural tube defects.[25] All of the above may act by interference with some aspect of normal folic acid metabolism and folate linked methylation related cellular processes as there are multiple genes of this type associated with neural tube defects.[26]\\r\\nFolic acid supplementation reduces the prevalence of neural tube defects by approximately 70% of neural tube defects indicating that 30% are not folate-dependent and are due to some cause other than alterations of methylation patterns.[27] Multiple other genes related to neural tube defects exist which are candidates for folate insensitive neural tube defects.[26] There are also several syndromes such as Meckel syndrome, and Triploid Syndrome which are frequently accompanied by neural tube defects that are assumed to be unrelated to folate metabolism[28]\\r\\nTests for neural tube defects include ultrasound examination and measurement of maternal serum alpha-fetoprotein (MSAFP). Second trimester ultrasound is recommended as the primary screening tool for NTDs, and MSAFP as a secondary screening tool.[29] This is due to increased safety, increased sensitivity and decreased false positive rate of ultrasound as compared to MSAFP.[29] Amniotic fluid alpha-fetoprotein (AFAFP) and amniotic fluid acetylcholinesterase (AFAChE) tests are also used to confirming if ultrasound screening indicates a positive risk.[30] Often, these defects are apparent at birth, but acute defects may not be diagnosed until much later in life. An elevated MSAFP measured at 16ÿ18 weeks gestation is a good predictor of open neural tube defects, however the test has a very high false positive rate, (2% of all women tested in Ontario, Canada between 1993 and 2000 tested positive without having an open neural tube defect, although 5% is the commonly quoted result worldwide) and only a portion of neural tube defects are detected by this screen test (73% in the same Ontario study).[31] MSAFP screening combined with routine ultrasonography has the best detection rate although detection by ultrasonography is dependent on operator training and the quality of the equipment.[32][33]\\r\\nIn 1996, the United States Food and Drug Administration published regulations requiring the addition of folic acid to enriched breads, cereals, flour and other grain products.[34] It is important to note that during the first four weeks of pregnancy (when most women do not even realize that they are pregnant), adequate folate intake is essential for proper operation of the neurulation process. Therefore, women who could become pregnant are advised to eat foods fortified with folic acid or take supplements in addition to eating folate-rich foods to reduce the risks of serious birth defects.[35][36][37] In Canada, mandatory fortification of selected foods with folic acid has been shown to reduce the incidence of neural tube defects by 46%.[38]\\r\\nWomen who may become pregnant are advised to get 400 micrograms of folic acid daily. Women who have previously given birth to a child with a neural tube defect may benefit from a supplement containing 4.0?mg/5.0?mg in the UK?mg daily, following advice provided by their doctor.[39]\\r\\nAs of 2008, treatments of NTDs depends on the severity of the complication. No treatment is available for anencephaly and infants usually do not survive more than a few hours. Aggressive surgical management has improved survival and the functions of infants with spina bifida, meningoceles and mild myelomeningoceles. The success of surgery often depends on the amount of brain tissue involved in the encephalocele. The goal of treatment for NTDs is to allow the individual to achieve the highest level of function and independence. Fetal surgery in utero before 26 weeks gestation has been performed with some hope that there is benefit to the final outcome including a reduction in ArnoldÿChiari malformation and thereby decreases the need for a ventriculoperitoneal shunt but the procedure is very high risk for both mother and baby and is considered extremely invasive with questions that the positive outcomes may be due to ascertainment bias and not true benefit. Further, this surgery is not a cure for all problems associated with a neural tube defect. Other areas of research include tissue engineering and stem cell therapy but this research has not been used in humans.[40]\\r\\nNeural tube defects resulted in 71,000 deaths globally in 2010.[41] It is unclear how common the condition is in low income countries.[42]","input":"When do neural tube defects occur during pregnancy?"},{"output":"Germanic tribes","context":"","input":"Where did the anglo saxons originally come from?"},{"output":"more than 80","context":"Naples is a city in Collier County, Florida, United States. As of 2015, the city's population was about 20,600. Naples is a principal city of the Naples-Marco Island, Florida Metropolitan Statistical Area, which had a population of about 322,000 as of 2015. Naples is one of the wealthiest cities in the United States, with the sixth highest per capita income in the country,[6] and the second highest proportion of millionaires per capita in the US.[7] Real estate is among the most expensive in the country, with houses for sale in excess of $40 million.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe city of Naples was founded during the late 1880s by former Confederate general and Kentucky U.S. Senator John Stuart Williams and his partner, Louisville businessman Walter N. Haldeman, the publisher of the Louisville Courier-Journal. Throughout the 1870s and '80s, magazine and newspaper stories telling of the area's mild climate and abundant fish and game likened it to the sunny Italian peninsula. The name Naples caught on when promoters described the bay as \\"surpassing the bay in Naples, Italy\\". Major development was anticipated after the railroad reached Naples on January 7, 1927, and the Tamiami Trail linking Naples to Miami was completed in 1928, but did not begin until after the Great Depression and World War II. During the war the U.S. Army Air Forces built a small airfield and used it for training purposes; it is now the Naples Municipal Airport.\\r\\nAfter a hurricane in 1945, fill was required to repair the damage. A local dredging company, Forrest Walker & Sons, created a lake north of 16th Avenue S, between Gordon Drive and Gulf Shore Boulevard. In 1949, Forrest Walker asked Mr. Rust to sell him the 296 acres (120?ha) from Jamaica Channel to today's 14th Avenue S. The Jamaica Channel was widened, one canal was dredged, and 14th Avenue S was created by March 1950; a new subdivision was named \\"Aqualane Shores\\"[8] at the opening party that same year. Additional channels were eventually added to the south of 14th Avenue S and are named alphabetically for local water birds. The first channel south of 14th Avenue S is Anhinga Channel, then Bittern Channel is south of 15th Avenue S, Crane Channel is south of 16th Avenue S, Duck Channel is south of 17th Avenue S, and Egret Channel is north of 21st Avenue S. From the channels there are coves named Flamingo, Gull, Heron, and Ibis, as well as the original Aqua Cove. These initial channels, canals, and coves were dredged and bulldozed from the mangrove swamps. Where shallow rock precluded digging, land was filled to create lots with navigable water.\\r\\nThe Aqualane Shores Association was incorporated as a non-profit corporation on February 3, 1966. It served lot owners in the area roughly bounded by the Bay of Naples to the east, Gordon Drive to the west, and the land between 14th Avenue and 21st Avenue S, as well as Marina Drive, Forrest Lane, and Southwinds Drive. Thirty years later, in 1996, a state-mandated city master plan renamed the area to the Aqualane Shores Neighborhood and extended its boundary west to the Gulf of Mexico, east to the Bay of Naples, and the area from 14th Avenue S all the way south to Jamaica Channel. The numerous canals and waterfront homes add a distinctive feature to the south portion of Naples and provide access to the Gulf of Mexico for many homeowners.\\r\\nAs of the census[4] of 2010, there were 19,537 people, 9,710 households, and 6,568 families residing in the city.

The MPAA rating system is a voluntary scheme that is not enforced by law; films can be exhibited without a rating, although certain theaters refuse to exhibit non-rated or NC-17 rated films. Non-members of MPAA may also submit films for rating.[1] Other media, such as television programs, music and video games, are rated by other entities such as the TV Parental Guidelines, the RIAA and the ESRB.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe MPAA rating system is one of various motion picture rating systems that are used to help parents decide what films are appropriate for their children. It is administered by the Classification & Ratings Administration (CARA), an independent division of the MPAA.[2]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe MPAA film ratings are as follows:[3]\\r\\n\\r\\nIf a film has not been submitted for a rating or is an uncut version of a film that was submitted, the labels Not Rated (NR) or Unrated (UR) are often used. Uncut/extended versions of films that are labeled \\"Unrated\\" also contain warnings saying that the uncut version of the film contains content that differs from the theatrical release and might not be suitable for minors.\\r\\n\\r\\nIf a film has not yet been assigned a final rating, the label This Film Is Not Yet Rated is used in trailers and television commercials.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe MPAA also rates film trailers, print advertising, posters, and other media used to promote a film. Green, yellow, or red title cards displayed before the start of a trailer indicate the trailer's rating.\\r\\n\\r\\nJack Valenti, who had become president of the Motion Picture Association of America in May 1966, deemed the Motion Picture Production Code ÿ in place since 1930 and rigorously enforced since 1934 ÿ as out of date and bearing \\"the odious smell of censorship\\". Filmmakers were pushing at the boundaries of the Code, and Valenti cited examples such as Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?, which contained the expressions \\"screw\\" and \\"hump the hostess\\"; and Blowup, which was denied Code approval due to nudity, resulting in the MPAA member studio releasing it through a subsidiary. He revised the Code to include the \\"SMA\\" (Suggested for Mature Audiences) advisory as a stopgap measure. To accommodate \\"the irresistible force of creators determined to make 'their films'\\", and to avoid \\"the possible intrusion of government into the movie arena\\", he developed a set of advisory ratings which could be applied after a film was completed. On November 1, 1968, the voluntary MPAA film rating system took effect, with three organizations serving as its monitoring and guiding groups: the MPAA, the National Association of Theater Owners (NATO), and the International Film Importers & Distributors of America (IFIDA).[6] Only films that premiered in the U.S. after November 1, 1968 had to carry the ratings.[7] Walter Reade was the only one of 75 top U.S. exhibitors who refused to use the ratings.[7] Warner-7 Arts' The Girl on a Motorcycle was the first film to receive the X rating and was distributed by their subsidiary, Claridge Pictures.[8] Two other films were rated X by the time the MPAA published their first weekly bulletin listing ratings, Paramount's Sin With a Stranger and Universal's Birds in Peru.  Both were to be released by subsidiaries.[9]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe ratings used from 1968 to 1970 were:[10][11]\\r\\n\\r\\nThis content classification system originally was to have three ratings, with the intention of allowing parents to take their children to any film they chose. However, the National Association of Theater Owners urged the creation of an adults-only category, fearful of possible legal problems in local jurisdictions. The \\"X\\" rating was not an MPAA trademark and would not receive the MPAA seal; any producer not submitting a film for MPAA rating could self-apply the \\"X\\" rating (or any other symbol or description that was not an MPAA trademark).[6]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1970 the ages for \\"R\\" and \\"X\\" were raised from 16 to 17.[12] Also, due to confusion over whether \\"M\\"-rated films were suitable for children,[12] \\"M\\" was renamed to \\"GP\\" (for General audiences, Parental guidance suggested),[13][14] and in 1971 the MPAA added the content advisory \\"Some material not generally suitable for pre-teenagers\\".[15] On February 11, 1972,[16] \\"GP\\" was revised to \\"PG\\".[12]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe ratings used from 1970 to 1972 were:\\r\\n\\r\\nThe ratings used from 1972 to 1984 were:[17]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the early 1980s complaints about violence and gore in films such as Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom and Gremlins, both of which received PG ratings, refocused attention on films seen by small children and pre-teens.[18] According to author Filipa Antunes, this revealed the conundrum of a film which \\"could not be recommended for all children but also could not be repudiated for all children uniformly,\\" leading to speculation that the rating systems scope, in particular its PG classification, \\"no longer matched a notion of childhood most parents in America could agree on.\\"[19] Steven Spielberg, director of Temple of Doom and executive producer of Gremlins, suggested a new intermediate rating between \\"PG\\" and \\"R\\".[20] The \\"PG-13\\" rating was introduced on July 1, 1984, with the advisory \\"Parents Are Strongly Cautioned to Give Special Guidance for Attendance of Children Under 13 ÿ Some Material May Be Inappropriate for Young Children\\".  The first film to be released with this rating was the 1984 John Milius war film Red Dawn.[21]  In 1985, the wording was simplified to \\"Parents Strongly Cautioned ÿ Some Material May Be Inappropriate for Children Under 13\\".[22] Around the same time, the MPAA won a trademark infringement lawsuit against the producers and distributors of I Spit on Your Grave over a fraudulent application of its R rating to the uncut version of the film,[23] and forced its member studios and several other home video distributors to put MPAA ratings on the packaging of MPAA-rated films via a settlement that would come into effect by fall that year.[24]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe ratings used from 1984 to 1990 were:\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1989, Tennessee state law set the minimum age to view a theatrically exhibited R-rated film without adult accompaniment at 18, instead of 17, and categorized the admission of minors to X-rated films as a misdemeanor. The statute stayed in force until 2013 when it was ruled to be in violation of the First Amendment. The law was amended in 2013 as to only prohibit persons under the age of 18 if the film was considered \\"harmful to minors\\".[25][26]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the rating system's early years, \\"X\\"-rated films such as Midnight Cowboy (1969) and A Clockwork Orange (1971) were understood to be unsuitable for children, but non-pornographic and intended for the general public. However, pornographic films often self-applied the non-trademarked \\"X\\" rating, and it soon became synonymous with pornography in American culture.[27] In late 1989 and early 1990, two critically acclaimed art films featuring strong adult content, Henry: Portrait of a Serial Killer and The Cook, the Thief, His Wife & Her Lover, were released. Neither film was approved for an MPAA rating, thus limiting their commercial distribution, and prompting criticism of the rating system's lack of a designation for such films.[28][29]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn September 1990, the MPAA introduced the rating \\"NC-17\\" (\\"No Children Under 17 Admitted\\").[30] Henry & June ÿ previously to be assigned an \\"X\\" rating ÿ was the first film to receive the \\"NC-17\\" rating instead.[30][31] Although films with an \\"NC-17\\" rating had more mainstream distribution opportunities than \\"X\\"-rated films, many theaters refused to screen them, most entertainment media did not accept advertising for them, and many large video outlets refused to stock them.[32] In 1996,[33] the minimum age for \\"NC-17\\" films was raised to 18, by rewording it to \\"No One 17 and Under Admitted\\".[34]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe ratings used from 1990 to 1996 were:\\r\\n\\r\\nThe ratings used since 1996 are:[3]\\r\\n\\r\\nSince September 1990, the MPAA has included brief explanations of why each film received an \\"R\\" rating, allowing parents to know what type of content the film contained. For example, some films' explanations may read \\"Strong Brutal Violence, Pervasive Language, Some Strong Sexual Content, and Drug Material\\". In 2000, the MPAA began applying rating explanations for \\"PG\\", \\"PG-13\\", and \\"NC-17\\" films as well.[35][36]\\r\\n\\r\\nDepictions of violence are permitted under all ratings but must be moderated for the lower ones. Violence must be kept to a minimum in G rated films and must not be intense in PG rated films. Depictions of intense violence are permitted under the PG-13 rating, but violence that is both realistic and extreme or persistent will generally require at least an R rating.[2]\\r\\n\\r\\nSnippets of language that go \\"beyond polite conversation\\" are permitted in G rated films, but no stronger words are present. Profanity may be present in PG rated films, and use of one of the harsher \\"sexually-derived words\\" as an expletive will initially incur at least a PG-13 rating. Multiple occurrences will usually incur an R rating as will the usage of such an expletive in a sexual context. Nevertheless, the ratings board may still award a PG-13 rating passed by a two-thirds majority if they believe the language is justified by the context or by the manner in which the words are used.[2]\\r\\n\\r\\nThere are several exceptional cases in which PG-13 rated films contain multiple occurrences of the word fuck: Adventures in Babysitting, where the word is used twice in the same scene;[37] The Hip Hop Project, which has seventeen uses;[38] and Gunner Palace, a documentary of soldiers in the Second Gulf War, which has 42 uses of the word with two used sexually.[39] Both Bully, a 2011 documentary about bullying, and Philomenawhich has two instances of the wordreleased in 2013, were originally given R ratings on grounds of the language but the ratings were dropped to PG-13 after successful appeals.[40][41]\\r\\n\\r\\nDrug use content is restricted to PG-13 and above.[2] An example of an otherwise PG film being assigned a PG-13 rating for a drug reference (momentary, along with brief language) is Whale Rider. The film contained only mild profanity, but was rated PG-13 because of a scene where drug paraphernalia were briefly visible. Critic Roger Ebert criticized the MPAA for the rating and called it \\"a wild overreaction\\".[42]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn May 2007, the MPAA announced that depictions of cigarette smoking would be considered in a film's rating.[43][44] Anti-smoking advocates stated that the child-friendly PG rating was inappropriate for the 2011 Nickelodeon-animated film Rango, which included over 60 depictions of characters smoking.[45]\\r\\n\\r\\nNudity is restricted to PG and above, and anything that constitutes more than brief nudity will require at least a PG-13 rating. Nudity that is sexually oriented will generally require an R rating.[2] As of 2010, the MPAA has added a descriptor of \\"male nudity\\" to films featuring said content.[46]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe MPAA does not have any explicit criteria for sexual content other than excluding sex scenes from G rated films.[2]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe NC-17 rating has been described as a \\"kiss of death\\" for any film that receives it.[47] Like the X rating it replaced, NC-17 limits a film's prospects of being marketed, screened in theaters and sold in major video outlets.[32] In 1995, United Artists released the big-budget film Showgirls (1995); it became the most widely distributed film with an NC-17 rating (showing in 1,388 cinemas simultaneously), but it was a financial failure that grossed only 45% of its $45 million budget.[48] Some modest successes can be found among NC-17 theatrical releases, however; Fox Searchlight Pictures released the original NC-17-rated American edition of the European film The Dreamers (2003) in theaters in the United States, and later released both the original NC-17 and the cut R-rated version on DVD. A Fox Searchlight spokesman said the NC-17 rating did not give them much trouble in releasing this film (they had no problem booking it, and only the  Salt Lake City newspaper Deseret News refused to take the film's ad), and Fox Searchlight was satisfied with this film's United States box office result.[49] Another notable exception is Bad Education (2004), an NC-17 foreign-language film which grossed $5.2 million in the United States theatrically[50] (a moderate success for a foreign-language film[51]).\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 2000, the Directors Guild of America called the NC-17 rating an \\"abject failure\\", for causing filmmakers to re-edit films to receive an R rating, rather than accept an NC-17 rating. They argued that this was \\"not only compromising filmmakers visions, but also greatly increasing the likelihood that adult-oriented movies are seen by the very groups for which they are not intended.\\"[52] As of March 2007, according to Variety, MPAA chairman Dan Glickman had been made aware of the attempts to introduce a new rating, or find ways to reduce the stigma of the NC-17 rating. Film studios have pressured the MPAA to retire the NC-17 rating, because of its likely impact on their film's box office revenue.[53][54]\\r\\n\\r\\nDuring the controversy about the MPAA's decision to give the film Blue Valentine (2010) an NC-17 rating (The Weinstein Company challenged this decision, and the MPAA ended up awarding the same cut an R rating on appeal), actor Ryan Gosling, who stars in the film, noted that NC-17 films are not allowed wide advertisement and that, given the refusal of major cinema chains like AMC and Regal to show NC-17 rated movies, many such films will never be accessible to people who live in markets that do not have art house theatres.[55]\\r\\n\\r\\nLegal scholar Julie Hilden wrote that the MPAA has a \\"masterpiece exception\\" that it has made for films that would ordinarily earn an NC-17 rating, if not for the broader artistic masterpiece that requires the violence depicted as a part of its message. She cites Saving Private Ryan, with its bloody depiction of the D-Day landings, as an example. This exception is troubling, Hilden argues, because it ignores context and perspective in evaluating other films and favors conventional films over edgier films that contribute newer and more interesting points to public discourse about violence.[56]\\r\\n\\r\\nStarting in 2004, GKC Theatres (now AMC Theatres) introduced \\"R-Cards\\", which parents could obtain for their teenage children, under the age of 17, to see R-rated films without adult accompaniment. The cards generated much controversy; MPAA president Jack Valenti said in a news article: \\"I think it distorts and ruptures the intent of this voluntary film ratings system. All R-rated films are not alike.\\"[57] John Fithian, the president of the National Association of Theatre Owners, also said that the cards can be harmful. He noted in a news article for the Christian Science Monitor that the R rating is \\"broad enough to include relatively family-friendly fare such as Billy Elliot and Erin Brockovich (which were both rated R for language) along with films that push the extremes of violence, including Pulp Fiction and Kill Bill.\\"[58]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe film rating system has had a number of high-profile critics. Film critic Roger Ebert has called for replacing the NC-17 rating with separate ratings for pornographic and non-pornographic adult film.[59] Ebert argued that the system places too much emphasis on sex, while allowing the portrayal of massive amounts of gruesome violence. The uneven emphasis on sex versus violence is echoed by other critics, including David Ansen, as well as many filmmakers. Moreover, Ebert argued that the rating system is geared toward looking at trivial aspects of the film (such as the number of times a profane word is used) rather than at the general theme of the film (for example, if the film realistically depicts the consequences of sex and violence). He called for an A (adults only) rating, to indicate films high in violence or mature content that should not be marketed to teenagers, but do not have NC-17 levels of sex. He also called for the NC-17 rating to be removed and have the X rating revived. He felt that everyone understood what X-rated means, while fewer people understood what NC-17 meant. He called for ratings A and X to identify whether an adult film is pornographic or not.[60][61][62]\\r\\n\\r\\nMPAA chairman Dan Glickman has disputed these claims, stating that far more films are initially rated NC-17 for violence than for sex, but that these are later edited by studios to receive an R rating.[63]\\r\\n\\r\\nDespite this, an internal critic of the early workings of the ratings system is film critic and writer Stephen Farber, who was a CARA intern for six months during 1969 and 1970. In The Movie Ratings Game,[64] he documents a prejudice against sex in relation to violence. This Film Is Not Yet Rated also points out that four times as many films received an NC-17 rating for sex than they did for violence according to the MPAA's own website, further mentioning a bias against homosexual content compared to heterosexual content, particularly with regards to sex scenes. Filmmaker Darren Stein further insists that his tame teen comedy G.B.F., which features multiple same-sex kisses but no intercourse, strong language, violence, or nudity, was \\"rated R for being gay.\\"[65]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe 2011 documentary Bully received an R rating for the profanity contained within the film, which prevented most of the intended audience, middle and high schoolers, from seeing the film. The film's director, Lee Hirsch, has refused to recut the film, stating, \\"I feel a responsibility as a filmmaker, as the person entrusted to tell (these kids') stories, to not water them down.\\" A petition collected more than 200,000 signatures to change the film's rating[66] and a version with less profanity was finally given a PG-13 rating. The same, however, could not be said about the 1995 teen drama Kids, which director Larry Clark wanted rated R so parents could take their kids to it for educational purposes, but the MPAA rated it NC-17 due to its content of teen sex and turned down Clark's appeal. The movie was then released unrated by Miramax (under Shining Excalibur Films as Miramax, owned by Disney, hesitated to release it as an NC-17 film).\\r\\n\\r\\nMany critics of the MPAA system, especially independent distributors, have charged that major studios' releases often receive more lenient treatment than independent films. The independent film Saints and Soldiers, which contains no nudity, almost no sex (although, there is a scene in which a German soldier is about to rape a French woman), very little profanity, and a minimum of violence, was said to have been rated R for a single clip where a main character is shot and killed, and required modification of just that one scene to receive a PG-13 rating.[67][68] Eric Watson, producer of the independently-distributed, NC-17-rated Requiem for a Dream complained that the studios are paying the budget of the MPAA, which gives the studios leverage over the MPAA's decisions.[69]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe comedy Scary Movie, released by Dimension Films, at the time a division of The Walt Disney Company, contained \\"strong crude sexual humor, language, drug use and violence,\\" including images of ejaculation and an erect penis, but was rated R, to the surprise of many reviewers and audiences; by comparison, the comparatively tame porn spoof Orgazmo, an independent release by South Park creators Matt Stone and Trey Parker, contained \\"explicit sexual content and dialogue\\" and received an NC-17 (the only on-screen penis seen in the film is a dildo). As Parker and Stone did not have the money and the time to edit the film, it retained its NC-17 rating. In contrast, Parker and Stone's second feature film, South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut, was distributed by a major studio (Paramount Pictures) and, after multiple submissions and notes from the MPAA, received an R rating.[69]\\r\\n\\r\\nMany critics of the system, both conservative and liberal, would like to see the MPAA ratings unveiled and the standards made public. The MPAA has consistently cited nationwide scientific polls (conducted each year by the Opinion Research Corporation of Princeton, New Jersey), which show that parents find the ratings useful. Critics such as Matt Stone in Kirby Dick's documentary This Film is not Yet Rated respond this proves only that parents find the ratings more useful than nothing at all.[70] In the film, it is also discussed how the MPAA will not reveal any information about how or why certain decisions are made, and that the association will not even reveal to the filmmaker the specific scenes that need to be cut in order to get alternative rating.\\r\\n\\r\\nAlthough there has always been concern about the content of films,[71] the MPAA has, in recent years, been accused of a \\"ratings creep\\", whereby the films that fall into today's ratings categories now contain more objectionable material than those that appeared in the same categories two decades earlier.[72] A study put forward by the Harvard School of Public Health in 2004 concluded that there had been a significant increase in the level of profanity, sex and violence in films released between 1992 and 2003.[73] Kimberly Thompson, director of the study, stated: \\"The findings demonstrate that ratings creep has occurred over the last decade and that todays movies contain significantly more violence, sex, and profanity on average than movies of the same rating a decade ago.\\"[73]\\r\\n\\r\\nSlashfilm.com managing editor David Chen wrote on the website: \\"It's time for more people to condemn the MPAA and their outrageous antics. We're heading towards an age when we don't need a mommy-like organization to dictate what our delicate sensibilities can and can't be exposed to. I deeply hope that the MPAA's irrelevance is imminent.\\"[74]\\r\\n\\r\\nChicago Tribune film critic Michael Phillips wrote that the MPAA ratings board \\"has become foolish and irrelevant, and its members do not have my interests at heart, or yours. They're too easy on violence yet bizarrely reactionary when it comes to nudity and language.\\"[75]","input":"When did the motion picture rating system start?"},{"output":"2004ÿ05","context":"Liverpool Football Club, an English professional association football club, is Britain's most successful team in Union of European Football Associations (UEFA) competitions. Since 1964, they have won eleven European trophies: the UEFA Champions League (formerly known as the European Cup) five times, the UEFA Europa League (formerly known as the UEFA Cup) three times, and the UEFA Super Cup three times.\\r\\nQualification for European competitions is determined by a team's success in its domestic league and cup competitions from the previous season. Liverpool competed in European competitions for 21 consecutive seasons until the 1985 European Cup Final, the occasion of the Heysel Stadium disaster, following which the club was banned from European competitions for six seasons. Since being readmitted in 1991, they have qualified for the Champions League (the successor to the European Cup) nine times and the Europa League (the successor to the Uefa Cup) nine times.\\r\\nAs a result of their victory in the 2005 UEFA Champions League Final, Liverpool won the European Champion Clubs' Cup trophy outright, and were awarded a multiple winner badge.

They have also won the UEFA Super Cup on three occasions, a total only Milan and Barcelona (five titles each) have bettered.\\r\\nBob Paisley is the club's most successful manager in Europe, with five trophies. Liverpool's biggest-margin win in Europe is an 11ÿ0 victory over Str?msgodset in the 1974ÿ75 European Cup Winners' Cup. In European competitions, Jamie Carragher holds the club record for the most appearances, with 150, and Steven Gerrard is the club's record goalscorer, with 41 goals.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nClub competitions between teams from different European countries can trace their origins as far back as 1897, when the Challenge Cup was created for clubs in the Austro-Hungarian Empire, who did not meet under normal circumstances. The Sir Thomas Lipton Trophy, named after entrepreneur and sportsman Thomas Lipton, was established in 1909 and was contested between clubs from Italy, Great Britain, Germany and Switzerland; the competition lasted for two years.[1] The earliest attempt to create a cup for national champion clubs of Europe was made by Swiss club FC Servette. Founded in 1930, the Coupe des Nations featured clubs of ten major European football leagues and was deemed a success. Due to financial reasons, the competition was abandoned.[2]\\r\\nThe first continental competition organised by UEFA was the European Cup in 1955. Conceived by Gabriel Hanot, the editor of L'quipe, as a competition for winners of the European national football leagues, it is considered the most prestigious European football competition.[3][4] When the European Cup was first played, Liverpool were in the Second Division, following relegation from the First Division after the 1953ÿ54 season, and thus were ineligible for the competition.[5] During their time in the Second Division, two further competitions were created: the Inter-Cities Fairs Cup and UEFA Cup Winners' Cup. Established in 1955, the Inter-Cities Fairs Cup was later re-branded as the UEFA Cup when it came under the auspices of UEFA in 1971.[6] Since the 2009ÿ10 season, the competition has been known as the UEFA Europa League.[7] The UEFA Cup Winners' Cup was inaugurated in 1960 for the winners of domestic cup competitions.[6]\\r\\nIn 1962 Liverpool were promoted to the First Division. Two years later, they won the Football League championship, thus making their European debut in the 1964ÿ65 European Cup. In the following years, further European competitions were inaugurated. The first, the UEFA Super Cup, was originally a match played between the winners of the European Cup and the Cup Winners' Cup. First established in 1973, it changed formats in 2000; since then, it has been contested between the winners of the Champions League (formerly the European Cup) and the Europa League (formerly the UEFA Cup), following the Cup Winners' Cup amalgamation into the latter.[8] The Intercontinental Cup was a competition for the winners of the European Cup (later, the UEFA Champions League) and the South American equivalent, the Copa Libertadores. Established in 1960, the Intercontinental Cup was jointly organised by UEFA and the Confederaci܇n Sudamericana de F~tbol (CONMEBOL). It ran until 2004, when the FIFA Club World Cup, which includes the winners of all six confederations' regional championships replaced it.[9]\\r\\nBill Shankly began managing Liverpool in 1959, and it was under him that the team first competed in European competition in 1964ÿ65, qualifying for the European Cup by winning the First Division championship the previous season.[10] The club's first opponents were Knattspyrnuflag Reykjavkur of Iceland, who they played in the preliminary round. Liverpool won 11ÿ1 on aggregate. The next round, against Belgian club Anderlecht, was the first time in Liverpool's history that they wore their now common all-red strip. The decision was made to change from red shirts, white shorts and socks by Shankly, who wanted his players to make more of a psychological impact on opponents.[11] They beat Anderlecht and progressed to the semi-finals, where they met Italian team Internazionale. Before the first leg at Anfield, Shankly asked two injured players to parade the FA Cup, which Liverpool had won the previous week, to intimidate the Italians.[12] The team won the match 3ÿ1,[13] but Inter won the second leg 3ÿ0, securing a 4ÿ3 aggregate victory. The second leg was controversial; Shankly described it as \\"a war\\".[14] He felt that the referee, Jose Maria Ortiz de Mendibel, had shown bias towards Internazionale,[15] and the Liverpool players felt cheated by his decisions.[14] The club's 1964ÿ65 FA Cup victory ensured qualification for the UEFA Cup Winners' Cup the following season, and in that competition, they reached their first European final. Borussia Dortmund, Liverpool's opponents, employed counter-attacking tactics that had paid dividends in previous rounds and did so again, with the West Germans beating Liverpool 2ÿ1 after extra time.[16]\\r\\nIn the next four seasons, they competed in the European Cup and Inter-Cities Fairs Cup, but failed to progress past the third round in either competition.[17] A tie against Dutch team Ajax during the 1966ÿ67 European Cup was to prove pivotal in the history of Liverpool in European competition.[18] Ajax beat Liverpool 7ÿ3 on aggregate. However, the style of football that Ajax played?ÿ a patient passing game, inspired by Johann Cruyff?ÿ convinced Shankly that Liverpool had to replicate this style to be successful in Europe.[19] Liverpool reached the semi-finals of the 1970ÿ71 Inter-Cities Fairs Cup, losing 1ÿ0 on aggregate to Leeds United.[20] They competed in the 1971ÿ72 European Cup Winners' Cup, despite losing the 1971 FA Cup Final, as the FA Cup winners, Arsenal, had also qualified for the European Cup by winning the league championship. Liverpool were eliminated in the second round by Bayern Munich of Germany, losing 3ÿ1 on aggregate.[21]\\r\\nThe changes made to Liverpool's tactics came to fruition during the 1972ÿ73 UEFA Cup. The club reached their second European final, where they faced Borussia M?nchengladbach of Germany. Liverpool won the first leg 3ÿ0 as a result of two goals from Kevin Keegan and one from Larry Lloyd. Victory in this first leg meant Liverpool only needed to avoid losing by three or more goals in order to win the final. This influenced their tactics?ÿ The Times reported that Liverpool employed a \\"holding action\\" against the \\"attacking Germans\\".[22] The tactics worked, allowing M?nchengladbach only two goals, granting Liverpool a 3ÿ2 aggregate victory.[23] Liverpool also won the First Division championship that season, and as a result qualified for the 1973ÿ74 European Cup, where they were eliminated in the second round by Red Star Belgrade of Yugoslavia. At the end of that season, Shankly retired.[24]\\r\\nShankly was succeeded by his assistant, Bob Paisley, in 1974.[25] Liverpool competed in the Cup Winners' Cup during Paisley's first season and defeated Str?msgodset of Norway 11ÿ0 at Anfield. This remains the club's largest margin of victory in all matches.[26] They lost in the next round to Hungarian side Ferencvros on the away goals rule. In 1975ÿ76 the club entered the UEFA Cup after a second-place finish in the First Division. Victories over Hibernian (Scotland), Real Sociedad (Spain), ?l?sk Wroc?aw (Poland), Dynamo Dresden (East Germany) and Barcelona (Spain) took Liverpool to their third European final. Crucial to their progress was goalkeeper Ray Clemence, who made two important penalty saves against Hibernian and Dresden, saving Liverpool from elimination on the away goals rule on both occasions.[27] Their opponents in the final were Club Brugge of Belgium. Liverpool recovered from a two-goal deficit to win the first leg at Anfield 3ÿ2, with Ray Kennedy, Jimmy Case, and Keegan scoring a goal each in a span of six minutes. A 1ÿ1 draw at the Jan Breydel Stadion in Bruges meant Liverpool won 4ÿ3 on aggregate, earning their second UEFA Cup.[28]\\r\\nAs the 1975ÿ76 league champions, the club entered the 1976ÿ77 European Cup. They defeated Crusaders of Northern Ireland and Trabzonspor of Turkey to reach the quarter-finals, where they faced the runners-up from the previous season, Saint-tienne. The French team won the first leg 1ÿ0. The second leg at Anfield began well for Liverpool when Keegan scored in the first two minutes. Saint-tienne equalised to make the score 2ÿ1 on aggregate in their favour. Kennedy scored for Liverpool, but the away goals rule meant they still needed another goal to win the tie. With six minutes remaining, David Fairclough was brought on to replace John Toshack; he immediately scored in front of the Kop, ensuring a 3ÿ2 aggregate victory for Liverpool.[29] In the semi-finals, they defeated FC Zrich of Switzerland 6ÿ1 on aggregate to reach the final, where they met their opponents from the 1973 UEFA Cup Final, Borussia M?nchengladbach. The final was held in Rome, four days after the club had lost the 1977 FA Cup Final to Manchester United. Before the match, Paisley announced that striker Toshack would be fit to start. However, he was not named in the matchday squad. This change upset the Germans' game plan and allowed Keegan to torment his marker, Berti Vogts.[30] Liverpool won 3ÿ1 to become European champions for the first time.[31]\\r\\nBy winning the European Cup, they qualified for the European Super Cup and played the winners of the Cup Winners' Cup, German team Hamburg, who had just signed Keegan.[32] Liverpool won the tie 7ÿ1 on aggregate.[33] Liverpool entered the 1977ÿ78 European Cup as champions and received a bye in the first round. They defeated Dynamo Dresden and Portuguese team Benfica in the second round and quarter-finals, respectively. In the semi-final, the club again met Borussia M?nchengladbach, who won the first leg 2ÿ1. Liverpool won the second leg 3ÿ0, progressing to a second successive European Cup final, this time against Club Brugge at Wembley Stadium in London. In the final Kenny Dalglish, who had been signed to replace Keegan, scored the winning goal after receiving the ball from a Graeme Souness pass. The 1ÿ0 victory meant Liverpool became the first British team to retain the European Cup.[34] They faced Anderlecht in the 1978 European Super Cup, but failed to retain the trophy, losing 4ÿ3 on aggregate against the Belgian side.[35] Liverpool were eliminated in the first round of the 1978ÿ79 European Cup by English champions Nottingham Forest. Nottingham Forest won the tie 2ÿ0 on aggregate, and went on to win the competition.[36] Liverpool entered the 1979ÿ80 European Cup as English champions but were again eliminated in the first round, this time beaten 4ÿ2 on aggregate by Dinamo Tbilisi of the Soviet Union.[37]\\r\\nLiverpool participated in the 1980ÿ81 European Cup as English league champions, defeating Finnish champions Oulun Palloseura, Scottish club Aberdeen and CSKA Sofia of Bulgaria to qualify for the semi-finals, where they faced three-time champions Bayern Munich. The first leg at Anfield finished goalless. In the second leg at the Olympiastadion in Munich, Ray Kennedy scored in the 83rd minute and, although the German side equalised, Liverpool went through to the final on the away goals rule.[38] They faced Spanish side Real Madrid in the final, held at the Parc des Princes in Paris. Alan Kennedy scored the only goal to give Liverpool a 1ÿ0 victory, which secured the club'sand Paisley'sthird European Cup. As champions of Europe, Liverpool competed in the Intercontinental Cup against South American champions Flamengo of Brazil. Liverpool lost the match 3ÿ0.[39] The club's defence of the European Cup in 1981ÿ82 was ended by CSKA Sofia in the quarter-finals.[40] Another quarter-final exit occurred in the 1982ÿ83 European Cup when Polish club Widzew ?܇d? eliminated Liverpool 4ÿ3 on aggregate.[41] Paisley retired as manager at the end of the season and was succeeded by his assistant, Joe Fagan.[42]\\r\\nLiverpool entered the 1983ÿ84 European Cup as league champions for the fourth time in five seasons. Victories over Odense of Denmark and Spanish champions Athletic Bilbao brought Liverpool to face Portuguese champions Benfica in the quarter-finals.[43] Liverpool won the first leg at Anfield 1ÿ0. In the second leg, their tactic of withdrawing Dalglish into midfield put Benfica's game plan into disarray,[44] leading to a 4ÿ1 match victory and a 5ÿ1 aggregate victory. Their opponents in the semi-finals were Dinamo Bucure?ti of Romania. The tie proved a brutal encounter, characterised by Souness breaking the jaw of the Bucharest captain Lic? Movil?, and was won 3ÿ1 on aggregate by Liverpool.[44]\\r\\nFagan's first season in charge of Liverpool had been a successful one. When they reached their fourth European Cup final, they had already won the Football League Cup and the league championship;[45] victory in the European final against Italian side Roma would complete an unprecedented treble. The final was played at Rome's Stadio Olimpico, and Liverpool went ahead in the 13th minute when Phil Neal scored, though Roma equalised towards the end of the first half. The score remained the same throughout full and extra time; Liverpool won the subsequent penalty shoot-out, with Alan Kennedy scoring the winning penalty after goalkeeper Bruce Grobbelaar had put off Francesco Graziani, causing him to place his penalty over the crossbar.[46] After the game, gangs of Roma fans assaulted Liverpool supporters travelling back to their hotels.[47] Success in the European Cup entitled Liverpool to compete in the 1984 Intercontinental Cup. However, they were unable to beat the winners of the Copa Libertadores, Independiente of Argentina, who claimed a 1ÿ0 victory.[48]\\r\\nLiverpool entered the 1984ÿ85 European Cup as champions, and once again progressed to the final, where their opponents were Juventus of Italy. They aimed to win their fifth European Cup and keep the trophy. The 1985 European Cup Final was held at the Heysel Stadium in Brussels. The choice of venue had been criticised due to the dilapidated state of the stadium, and the club tried to persuade UEFA to change the venue.[49] Before the kick-off, Liverpool fans breached a fence separating the two groups of supporters and charged the Juventus fans. The resulting weight of people caused a retaining wall to collapse, killing 39 people and injuring hundreds more.[50] Despite calls for an abandonment, the match was played, as it was felt that further trouble would be caused otherwise.[51]\\r\\nJuventus won the match 1ÿ0; Michel Platini scored from the penalty spot to give Juventus their first European Cup.[52] UEFA laid the blame for the incident solely on the Liverpool fans: the official UEFA observer stated, \\"Only the English fans were responsible. Of that there is no doubt\\".[53] Three days after the final, UEFA banned all English clubs from European competition for an indefinite period. Liverpool were initially given an additional three-year ban.[52] Fagan retired after the 1984ÿ85 season and was succeeded by Dalglish, who took over as player-manager.[54]\\r\\nThe ban on English clubs in European competitions ultimately lasted for five years, and even when the ban was lifted in 1990, Liverpool were not re-admitted; they had to serve an extra year. The ban prevented them qualifying for the European Cup in 1986 (as league champions and FA Cup winners), the UEFA Cup in 1987 (as league runners-up), the European Cup in 1988 (as league champions), the European Cup Winners' Cup in 1989 (as FA Cup winners) and the European Cup in 1990 (as league champions).[55]\\r\\nLiverpool were allowed to return to European competition in the 1991ÿ92 season, a year later than other English clubs. They qualified for the UEFA Cup as runners-up in the English league. Their manager by this stage was Graeme Souness, who had taken over towards the end of the previous season following Dalglish's resignation.[56]\\r\\nTheir first match, in the UEFA Cup, was against Finnish side Kuusyi Lahti, which they won 6ÿ1.[57] A 6ÿ2 aggregate victory set up a tie against Auxerre of France in the second round who they beat 3ÿ2 on aggregate.[58] The club defeated Swarovski Tirol of Austria in the third round 6ÿ0 on aggregate before losing to Genoa (Italy) 4ÿ1 over two legs in the quarter finals.[59]\\r\\nLiverpool's victory over Sunderland in the 1992 FA Cup Final qualified them for the 1992ÿ93 European Cup Winners' Cup, but this campaign was short-lived, as they were eliminated in the second round by Russian side Spartak Moscow.[60] Liverpool finished no higher than sixth in the Premier League during the next two seasons, thus failing to qualify for European competition. In the 1995ÿ96 season, they entered the UEFA Cup, but again progressed no further than the second round, this time losing to Br?ndby of Denmark.[61]\\r\\nAs runners-up to League champions Manchester United in the 1996 FA Cup Final, Liverpool were able to compete in the 1996ÿ97 UEFA Cup Winners' Cup. This proved the club's most successful campaign since their return to European competition, as they reached the semi-finals, where they were eliminated 3ÿ2 on aggregate by Paris SaintÿGermain.[62] In the next two seasons, Liverpool played in the UEFA Cup but were eliminated at an early stage of the competition, by Strasbourg and Celta de Vigo, respectively.[63][64] A seventh-place finish in the 1998ÿ99 FA Premier League meant the club did not qualify for Europe in 1999ÿ2000.[65]\\r\\nHaving finished fourth in the 1999ÿ2000 FA Premier League, Liverpool qualified for the 2000ÿ01 UEFA Cup. Their victory in this competition marked a third win for a club. The entire season was the club's most successful since the 1983ÿ84 season, as they won a cup treble consisting of the UEFA Cup, the FA Cup and the League Cup. Their opponents in the final in Dortmund were Alavs of Spain. The match was tied at 4ÿ4 in extra time when Alavs defender Delf Geli scored an own goal to give Liverpool victory on the golden goal rule.[66] The performance of Gary McAllister, whose free-kick resulted in the winning goal, was praised as \\"outstanding\\" by Trevor Brooking.[67] This was the club's first European trophy since their European Cup victory in 1984.[68] As UEFA Cup winners, Liverpool played in the 2001 UEFA Super Cup against Champions League winners Bayern Munich and won 3ÿ2.[69]\\r\\nIn the 2001ÿ02 season, Liverpool returned to the European Cup, now called the UEFA Champions League, for the first time since the Heysel disaster. A 2ÿ0 victory over Roma in the second group stage meant they progressed to the quarter-finals.[70] They faced German club Bayer Leverkusen and won the first leg 1ÿ0. The outlook for the second leg appeared to be to Liverpool's advantage, as their counter-attacking style of play had served them well during away matches throughout the season;[71] however, they lost the second leg 4ÿ2 and were eliminated 4ÿ3 on aggregate.[72]\\r\\nA second-place finish in the 2001ÿ02 FA Premier League entitled Liverpool to participate in the Champions League for a second successive season, but they only finished third in their group and were eliminated from the competition.[73] The third-place finish meant they entered the 2002ÿ03 UEFA Cup. Liverpool beat Dutch team Vitesse Arnhem and Auxerre to set up an all-British tie with Scottish team Celtic. A 1ÿ1 draw in the first leg meant Liverpool would progress to the semi-finals if they did not concede a goal in the second leg at Anfield. However, Celtic scored before half-time and again in the second half to win 3ÿ1 on aggregate.[74]\\r\\nLiverpool entered the UEFA Cup for the 2003ÿ04 season, after Chelsea beat them on the final day of the previous league season to claim the fourth place needed to qualify for the Champions League.[75] Liverpool were eliminated in the fourth round by eventual runners-up Marseille of France. At the end of the season, manager Grard Houllier was replaced by Rafael Bentez.[76]\\r\\nLiverpool had finished fourth in the 2003ÿ04 season, which qualified them to compete in the Champions League in the 2004ÿ05 season. A poor start in the group stages, with two losses in their first five games, had the club facing elimination. A 3ÿ1 victory over Greek side Olympiacos, however, eventually ensured their passage to the knock-out rounds. Liverpool beat Bayer Leverkusen and Juventus to reach the semi-finals, and progressed to the final after they beat Chelsea 1ÿ0 on aggregate; the goal scored by Luis Garca was referred to as a \\"ghost goal\\" by Chelsea manager Jos Mourinho, as it was unclear whether the ball crossed the goal line.[77] Liverpool's performances in Europe contrasted strongly with their league form, where they struggled to finish in the top-four and thus ensure qualification for the next Champions League season.[78]\\r\\nLiverpool faced six-time European champions Milan in the final at the Atatrk Stadium in Istanbul on 25 May 2005. Trailing 3ÿ0 at half-time, they scored three goals in a six-minute spell in the second half to level the score at 3ÿ3. There were no goals during extra time, so the match was decided by a penalty shoot-out. With the shoot-out score at 3ÿ2, Liverpool goalkeeper Jerzy Dudek saved Andriy Shevchenko's penalty to give Liverpool victory.[79] The nature of Liverpool's comeback victory has led to the match being referred to as the \\"miracle of Istanbul.\\"[80] As this was the club's fifth European Cup victory, Liverpool were allowed to keep the European Champion Clubs' Cup permanently, and a new trophy was commissioned for the following year's competition.[81] The victory also entitled Liverpool to compete in the 2005 UEFA Super Cup at Stade Louis II, Monaco in August. They defeated UEFA Cup winners CSKA Moscow of Russia 3ÿ1(aet.) to win their third Super Cup.[82] Their success in the Champions League meant Liverpool also qualified for the 2005 FIFA Club World Championship, where they lost 1ÿ0 in the final to Brazilian team S?o Paulo.[83]\\r\\nA fifth-place finish in the Premier League in 2004ÿ05 meant Liverpool were not guaranteed entry into the Champions League, and faced the prospect of not being able to defend their European title. UEFA eventually ruled that they would be allowed to do so, but would be required to start in the first qualifying round, with no country protection, meaning they could face a team from England in the group stages.[84] This turned out to be the caseLiverpool advanced through three qualifying rounds and were drawn with Chelsea in the group stages. They progressed from their group as winners but were beaten by Benfica in the first knock-out round.[85]\\r\\nIn the 2006ÿ07 Champions League, Liverpool progressed from the group stages and beat holders Barcelona, PSV and Chelsea to face Milan in a rematch of the 2005 final.[86] The Liverpool team, which contained only five players from the 2005 final, enjoyed more possession than in 2005,[87] but two goals from Filippo Inzaghi gave Milan their seventh European Cup in a 2ÿ1 win.[88]\\r\\nLiverpool were eliminated from the 2007ÿ08 Champions League in the semi-finals by Chelsea, who they had beaten in the semi-finals in 2005 and 2007. A fourth-place finish in the 2007ÿ08 Premier League secured their entry into the 2008ÿ09 Champions League. Liverpool reached the quarter-finals and again faced Chelsea, but lost 7ÿ5 on aggregate.[89]\\r\\nA second-place finish in the 2008ÿ09 Premier League entitled Liverpool to compete in the 2009ÿ10 UEFA Champions League, but their campaign was short-lived; they finished third in their group, and were eliminated from the competition. They entered the 2009ÿ10 UEFA Europa League, progressing to the semi-finals, where they were eliminated by eventual winners Atltico Madrid of Spain on the away goals rule after the tie finished 2ÿ2 on aggregate.[90]\\r\\nRafael Bentez left the club at the end of the 2009ÿ10 season and was replaced by Roy Hodgson.[91] A seventh-place finish in the 2009ÿ10 Premier League meant Liverpool would be competing in the 2010ÿ11 Europa League. They beat Rabotni?ki of Macedonia and Trabzonspor of Turkey to progress to the group stage, where Liverpool were drawn alongside Napoli, FC Utrecht and Steaua Bucure?ti. They won two games and drew four to finish top of their group with ten points and progress to the round of 32.[92] They were drawn against Sparta Prague in the next round. Before the tie was played, however, Hodgson was replaced by former manager Kenny Dalglish, who initially served as a caretaker manager.[93] A 1ÿ0 aggregate victory ensured progression to the round of 16, in which Liverpool lost 1ÿ0 on aggregate to eventual runners-up Braga.[94] A sixth-place finish in the 2010ÿ11 Premier League meant the club failed to qualify for European competition for the first time since 1999.[95] On the following season, victory in the League Cup final ensured Liverpool a place in the 2012ÿ13 Europa League.[96]\\r\\nLiverpool qualified for the knockout phase of the 2012ÿ13 Europa League after winning their group at the group stage, but were eliminated from the competition at the round of 32 by Zenit Saint Petersburg on the away goals rule after a 0ÿ2 loss away and a 3ÿ1 win at home.[97] A seventh-place finish in the 2012ÿ13 Premier League and a failure to secure qualification via domestic cups meant Liverpool failed to qualify for any European competition in the 2013ÿ14 season. A second-placed finish in the 2013ÿ14 Premier League, ensured Liverpool qualified for the group stage of the 2014ÿ15 Champions League.[98] One win out of six in the group stage meant they were eliminated and entered into the knockout phase of the 2014ÿ15 Europa League.[99] The campaign was short-lived, as Liverpool eliminated by Be?ikta? in the round of 32.[100]\\r\\nFinishing sixth in the 2014ÿ15 Premier League qualified Liverpool directly to the group stage of the 2015ÿ16 Europa League, where they faced Sion, Bordeaux and for the first time, Russian side Rubin Kazan.[101] During the group stage, manager Brendan Rodgers was replaced by Jrgen Klopp.[102] After winning the group, Liverpool qualified for the knockout phase, beating FC Augsburg in the round of 32 before facing bitter rivals Manchester United in the round of 16, the two clubs' first meeting in Europe.[103][104] Liverpool defeated them 3ÿ1 on aggregate and victory led to a quarter-final tie with Klopp's former team Borussia Dortmund.[105][106] After a 1ÿ1 draw in the first leg at Signal Iduna Park, Dortmund went 3ÿ1 up in the return leg at Anfield with 33 minutes remaining, requiring Liverpool to score three goals due to the Away goals rule. Goals from Philippe Coutinho, Mamadou Sakho and a last minute winner from Dejan Lovren, however, saw Liverpool complete the comeback and qualify for their first European semi-final since 2010.[107] There they faced Villarreal, completing a second comeback after overturning a 1ÿ0 defeat in the first leg at El Madrigal to qualify for the final with a 3ÿ1 aggregate win.[108][109] Liverpool played Sevilla in the final at St. Jakob-Park, Basel, on 18 May, losing 3ÿ1. A 4th place finish in the 2016ÿ17 Premier League qualified Liverpool for the 2017ÿ18 UEFA Champions League and a return to Europe's premier club tournament for only the second time in 8 years during the 2010's.\\r\\nKey\\r\\nKey to colours:","input":"When did liverpool last won uefa champions league?"},{"output":"two days in the lives of four real estate salesmen and how they become desperate when the corporate office sends a trainer to \\"motivate\\" them by announcing that, in one week, all except the top two salesmen will be fired","context":"Glengarry Glen Ross is a 1992 American drama film adapted by David Mamet from his 1984 Pulitzer Prize- and Tony-winning play of the same name, and directed by James Foley. The film is set and was filmed in New York City.[3] It depicts two days in the lives of four real estate salesmen and how they become desperate when the corporate office sends a trainer to \\"motivate\\" them by announcing that, in one week, all except the top two salesmen will be fired.\\r\\nLike the play, the film is notorious for its use of profanity, leading the cast to refer to the film jokingly as \\"Death of a Fuckin' Salesman.\\"[4] The title of the film comes from the names of two of the real estate developments being peddled by the salesmen characters: Glengarry Highlands and Glen Ross Farms.\\r\\nThe world premiere of the film was held at the 49th Venice Film Festival, where Jack Lemmon was awarded the Volpi Cup for Best Actor. Al Pacino was nominated for an Academy Award and a Golden Globe for Best Supporting Actor for his work in the film. The film grossed $10.7 million in North America on a $12.5 million budget.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe film depicts two days in the lives of four real estate salesmen who are supplied with leads: the names and phone numbers of prospects; they use deceitful and dubious tactics to make sales. Many of the leads rationed out by the office manager lack either the money or the desire to actually invest in land.\\r\\nBlake (Baldwin) is sent by Mitch and Murray, the owners of Premiere Properties, to motivate the sales team. Blake unleashes a torrent of verbal abuse on the salesmen and announces that only the top two will be allowed access to the more promising Glengarry leads and the rest of them will be fired.\\r\\nShelley \\"The Machine\\" Levene (Lemmon), a once powerful and successful salesman, now in a long-running slump and with a chronically ill daughter in the hospital with an unknown medical condition, knows that he will lose his job soon if he cannot generate sales. He tries to persuade office manager John Williamson (Spacey) to give him some of the Glengarry leads, but Williamson refuses. Levene tries first to charm Williamson, then to threaten him, and finally to bribe him. Williamson is willing to sell some of the prime leads, but demands cash in advance. Levene cannot come up with the cash and leaves without better leads.\\r\\nMeanwhile, Dave Moss (Harris) and George Aaronow (Arkin) complain about Mitch and Murray, and Moss proposes that they strike back at the two by stealing all the Glengarry leads and selling them to a competing real estate agency. Moss's plan requires Aaronow to break into the office, stage a burglary and steal all of the prime leads. Aaronow wants no part of the plan, but Moss tries to coerce him, saying that Aaronow is already an accessory before the fact simply because he knows about the proposed burglary.\\r\\nAt a nearby bar, Ricky Roma (Pacino), the office's top \\"closer,\\" delivers a long, disjointed but compelling monologue to a meek, middle-aged man named James Lingk (Pryce). Roma does not broach the subject of a Glengarry Farms real estate deal until he has completely won Lingk over with his speech. Framing it as an opportunity rather than a purchase, Roma plays upon Lingk's feelings of insecurity.\\r\\nThe next day, when the salesmen come into the office, they learn that there has been a burglary and the Glengarry leads have been stolen. Williamson and the police question each of the salesmen in private. After his interrogation, Moss leaves in disgust, only after having one last shouting match with Roma. During the cycle of interrogations, Lingk arrives to tell Roma that his wife has told him to cancel the deal. Scrambling to salvage the deal, Roma tries to deceive Lingk by telling him that the check he wrote the night before has yet to be cashed, and that accordingly he has time to reason with his wife and reconsider.\\r\\nLevene abets Roma by pretending to be a wealthy investor who just happens to be on his way to the airport. Williamson, unaware of Roma and Levene's stalling tactic, lies to Lingk, claiming that he already deposited his check in the bank. Upset, Lingk rushes out of the office, and Roma berates Williamson for what he has done. Roma then enters Williamson's office to take his turn at being interrogated by the police.\\r\\nLevene, proud of a massive sale he made that morning, takes the opportunity to mock Williamson in private. In his zeal to get back at Williamson, Levene accidentally reveals that he knows Williamson lied to Roma minutes earlier about depositing Lingk's check and had left the check on his desk and had not made the bank run the previous night  something only a man who broke into the office would know. Williamson catches Levene's slip of the tongue and compels Levene to admit that he broke into the office. Levene finally caves in and admits that he and Moss conspired to steal the leads. Levene attempts to bribe Williamson to keep quiet about the burglary. Williamson scoffs at the suggestion and tells Levene that the buyers to whom he had made his sale earlier that day are in fact bankrupt and delusional and just enjoy talking to salesmen. Levene, crushed by this revelation, asks Williamson why he seeks to ruin him. Williamson coldly responds, \\"Because I don't like you.\\"\\r\\nLevene makes a last-ditch attempt at gaining sympathy from Williamson by mentioning his daughter's health, but Williamson cruelly rebuffs him and leaves to inform the detective about Levene's part in the burglary. Williamson walks out of the room as Roma enters. Unaware, Roma talks to Levene about their forming a business partnership. The detective calls for Levene, who walks into Williamson's office. Roma leaves the office to go for lunch. Aaronow returns to his desk to make his sales calls.\\r\\nDavid Mamet's play was first performed in 1983 at the Royal National Theatre, London. It won the Pulitzer Prize in 1984. That same year, the play made its American debut in Chicago before moving to Broadway. Producer Jerry Tokofsky read the play on a trip to New York City in 1985 at the suggestion of director Irvin Kershner who wanted to make it into a film.[5] Tokofsky saw the play on Broadway and contacted Mamet. Stanley R. Zupnik was a Washington, D.C. based producer of B movies who was looking for a more profitable project. Tokofsky had co-produced two previous Zupnik films. In 1986, Tokofsky told Zupnik about Mamet's play, and Zupnik saw it on Broadway but found the plot confusing.\\r\\nMamet wanted $500,000 for the film rights and another $500,000 to write the screenplay. Zupnik agreed to pay Mamet's $1 million asking price, figuring that they could cut a deal with a cable company to bankroll the production. Because of the uncompromising subject matter and abrasive language, no major studio wanted to finance it, even with film stars attached. Financing came from cable and video companies, a German television station, an Australian movie theater chain, several banks, and New Line Cinema over the course of four years.[5]\\r\\nAl Pacino originally wanted to do the play on Broadway, but at the time he was doing another Mamet production, American Buffalo, in London. He expressed interest in appearing in the film adaptation. In 1989, Tokofsky asked Jack Lemmon to act in the film.[6] During this time, Kershner dropped out to make another film, as did Pacino. Alec Baldwin, who also attached, left the project over a contract disagreement. James Foley's agent sent Foley Mamet's screenplay in early 1991, but Foley was hesitant to direct because he \\"wanted great actors, people with movie charisma, to give it watchability, especially since the locations were so restricted\\".[7] Foley took the screenplay to Pacino, with whom he had been trying to work on a film for years.[8] Foley was hired to direct, only to leave the production as well.\\r\\nBy March 1991, Tokofsky contacted Baldwin and begged him to reconsider doing the film. Baldwin's character was specifically written for the actor, to include in the film version, and is not part of the original play. Tokofsky remembers, \\"Alec said: 'I've read 25 scripts and nothing is as good as this. OK. If you make it, I'll do it'.\\"[5] The two men arranged an informal reading with Lemmon in Los Angeles. Subsequently, the three men organized readings with several other actors, as Lemmon remembers, \\"Some of the best damn actors you're ever going to see came in and read and I'm talking about names\\".[8] Tokofsky's lawyer, Jake Bloom, called a meeting at the Creative Artists Agency, who represented many of the actors involved, and asked for their help. CAA showed little interest, but two of their clients ÿ Ed Harris and Kevin Spacey ÿ soon joined the cast.\\r\\nBecause of the film's modest budget, many of the actors took significant pay cuts. For example, Pacino cut his per-movie price from $6 million to $1.5 million, Lemmon was paid $1 million, Baldwin received $250,000, and so on.[5] This did not stop other actors, like Robert De Niro, Bruce Willis,[5] Richard Gere, and Joe Mantegna,[6] from expressing interest in the film. Mantegna had been in the original Broadway cast and won a Tony Award in 1985 for his portrayal of Roma.\\r\\nOnce the film's cast was assembled, they spent three weeks in rehearsals. With a budget set at $12.5 million, filming began in August 1991 at the Kaufman Astoria Soundstage in Queens, New York, and on location in Sheepshead Bay, Brooklyn, over 39 days. Harris remembers, \\"There were five and six-page scenes we would shoot all at once. It was more like doing a play at times [when] you'd get the continuity going\\".[8] Alan Arkin said of the script, \\"What made it [challenging] was the language and the rhythms, which are enormously difficult to absorb\\".[8] During filming, members of the cast who were not required to be on the set certain days would show up anyway to watch the other actors' performances.[9]\\r\\nThe film's director of photography, Juan Ruiz Ancha, relied on low lighting and shadows with a blues, greens, and reds color scheme for the first part of the film. For the second half, he adhered to a monochromatic blue-grey color scheme.\\r\\nDuring the production, Tokofsky and Zupnik had a falling out over money and credit for the film. Tokofsky sued to strip Zupnik of his producer's credit and share of the producer's fee.[10] Zupnik claimed that he personally put up $2 million of the film's budget and countersued, claiming that Tokofsky was fired for embezzlement.[10]\\r\\nGlengarry Glen Ross had its world premiere at the Venice Film Festival, where Jack Lemmon won the Volpi Cup for Best Actor.[11] In addition, it was originally slated to be shown at the Montreal Film Festival, but it was necessary to show it out of competition because it was entered into competition at the Venice Film Festival at the same time. Instead, it was given its North American premiere at the Toronto International Film Festival.[12] The film opened in wide release on October 2, 1992 in 416 theaters, grossing $2.1 million on its opening weekend. It went on to make $10.7 million in North America,[2] just below its $12.5 million budget.[2]\\r\\nThe film received a rating of 94% on Rotten Tomatoes with a consensus of, \\"This adaptation of David Mamet's play is every bit as compelling and witty as its source material, thanks in large part to a clever script and a bevy of powerhouse actors.\\"[13] On Metacritic, the film has a score of 80 out of 100, based on 14 critics, indicating \\"generally favorable reviews\\".[14]\\r\\nOwen Gleiberman gave the film an \\"A\\" rating in his review for Entertainment Weekly magazine, praising Lemmon's performance as \\"a revelation\\" and describing his character as \\"the weaselly soul of Glengarry Glen RossÿWilly Loman turned into a one-liner\\".[15] In his review in the Chicago Sun-Times, Roger Ebert wrote, \\"Mamet's dialogue has a kind of logic, a cadence, that allows people to arrive in triumph at the ends of sentences we could not possibly have imagined. There is great energy in it. You can see the joy with which these actors get their teeth into these great lines, after living through movies in which flat dialogue serves only to advance the story\\".[16]\\r\\nNewsweek magazine's Jack Kroll observed of Alec Baldwin's performance, \\"Baldwin is sleekly sinister in the role of Blake, a troubleshooter called in to shake up the salesmen. He shakes them up, all right, but this character (not in the original play) also shakes up the movie's toned balance with his sheer noise and scatological fury\\".[17] In his review for The New York Times, Vincent Canby praised, \\"the utterly demonic skill with which these foulmouthed characters carve one another up in futile attempts to stave off disaster. It's also because of the breathtaking wizardry with which Mr. Mamet and Mr. Foley have made a vivid, living film that preserves the claustrophobic nature of the original stage work\\".[18]\\r\\nIn his review for Time, Richard Corliss wrote, \\"A peerless ensemble of actors fills Glengarry Glen Ross with audible glares and shudders.

If his intention is to create a sense of claustrophobia, he also creates the (presumably) unwanted effect of a soundstage. There is no evidence of life outside the immediate world of the movie\\".[20] Movie Room Reviews gave the film 4 stars and said \\"Director James Foley does a great job of making the film seem claustrophobic, so that the audience almost feels as if it is in the fluorescent lighting of the drab office.\\"[21]\\r\\nJack Lemmon was voted Best Actor by the National Board of Review.[22] Al Pacino was nominated for a Golden Globe for Best Supporting Actor but did not win.[23] He was also nominated for an Academy Award for Best Actor in a Supporting Role but lost to Gene Hackman for Unforgiven; the same year he was nominated and won the Best Actor Oscar for Scent of a Woman.[24] Empire magazine voted the film the 470th greatest film in their \\"500 Greatest Movies of All Time\\" list.[25]\\r\\nLemmon's portrayal of Shelley Levene was a major source of inspiration in the creation of the recurring character Gil Gunderson on The Simpsons.[26] The character borrows many of the mannerisms of Levene, and is often portrayed as an unsuccessful salesman.[27][28]","input":"What is the plot of glengarry glen ross?"},{"output":"late Carboniferous period","context":"The evolution of mammals has passed through many stages since the first appearance of their synapsid ancestors in the late Carboniferous period. The most ancestral forms in the class Mammalia are the egg-laying mammals in the subclass Prototheria. This class first started out as something close to the platypus and evolved to modern day mammals.[1] By the mid-Triassic, there were many synapsid species that looked like mammals. The lineage leading to today's mammals split up in the Jurassic; synapsids from this period include Dryolestes, more closely related to extant placentals and marsupials than to monotremes, as well as Ambondro, more closely related to monotremes.[2] Later on, the eutherian and metatherian lineages separated; the metatherians are the animals more closely related to the marsupials, while the eutherians are those more closely related to the placentals. Since Juramaia, the earliest known eutherian, lived 160 million years ago in the Jurassic, this divergence must have occurred in the same period.\\r\\nAfter the CretaceousÿPaleogene extinction event wiped out the non-avian dinosaurs (birds are generally regarded as the surviving dinosaurs) and several mammalian groups, placental and marsupial mammals diversified into many new forms and ecological niches throughout the Paleogene and Neogene, by the end of which all modern orders had appeared.\\r\\nMammals are the only living synapsids.[3] The synapsid lineage became distinct from the sauropsid lineage in the late Carboniferous period, between 320 and 315 million years ago.[4] The sauropsids are today's reptiles and birds along with all the extinct animals more closely related to them than to mammals.[4] This does not include the mammal-like reptiles, a group more closely related to the mammals.\\r\\nThroughout the Permian period, the synapsids included the dominant carnivores and several important herbivores. In the subsequent Triassic period, however, a previously obscure group of sauropsids, the archosaurs, became the dominant vertebrates. The mammaliaforms appeared during this period; their superior sense of smell, backed up by a large brain, facilitated entry into nocturnal niches with less exposure to archosaur predation. The nocturnal lifestyle may have contributed greatly to the development of mammalian traits such as endothermy and hair. Later in the Mesozoic, after theropod dinosaurs replaced rauisuchians as the dominant carnivores, mammals spread into other ecological niches. For example, some became aquatic, some were gliders, and some even fed on juvenile dinosaurs.\\r\\nMost of the evidence consists of fossils. For many years, fossils of Mesozoic mammals and their immediate ancestors were very rare and fragmentary; but, since the mid-1990s, there have been many important new finds, especially in China. The relatively new techniques of molecular phylogenetics have also shed light on some aspects of mammalian evolution by estimating the timing of important divergence points for modern species. When used carefully, these techniques often, but not always, agree with the fossil record.\\r\\nAlthough mammary glands are a signature feature of modern mammals, little is known about the evolution of lactation as these soft tissues are not often preserved in the fossil record. Most research concerning the evolution of mammals centers on the shapes of the teeth, the hardest parts of the tetrapod body. Other important research characteristics include the evolution of the middle ear bones, erect limb posture, a bony secondary palate, fur, hair, and warm-bloodedness.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nWhile living mammal species can be identified by the presence of milk-producing mammary glands in the females, other features are required when classifying fossils, because mammary glands and other soft-tissue features are not visible in fossils.\\r\\nOne such feature available for paleontology, shared by all living mammals (including monotremes), but not present in any of the early Triassic therapsids, is shown in figure 1: mammals use two bones for hearing that all other amniotes use for eating. The earliest amniotes had a jaw joint composed of the articular (a small bone at the back of the lower jaw) and the quadrate (a small bone at the back of the upper jaw). All non-mammalian tetrapods use this system including amphibians, turtles, lizards, snakes, crocodilians, dinosaurs (and their descendants the birds), ichthyosaurs, pterosaurs and therapsids. But mammals have a different jaw joint, composed only of the dentary (the lower jaw bone, which carries the teeth) and the squamosal (another small skull bone). In the Jurassic, their quadrate and articular bones evolved into the incus and malleus bones in the middle ear.[5][6] Mammals also have a double occipital condyle; they have two knobs at the base of the skull that fit into the topmost neck vertebra, while other tetrapods have a single occipital condyle.[5]\\r\\nIn a 1981 article, Kenneth A. Kermack and his co-authors argued for drawing the line between mammals and earlier synapsids at the point where the mammalian pattern of molar occlusion was being acquired and the dentary-squamosal joint had appeared. The criterion chosen, they noted, is merely a matter of convenience; their choice was based on the fact that \\"the lower jaw is the most likely skeletal element of a Mesozoic mammal to be preserved.\\"[7] Today, most paleontologists consider that animals are mammals if they satisfy this criterion.[8]\\r\\nAmphibians\\r\\nSauropsids (including dinosaurs)\\r\\n?Cotylorhynchus?\\r\\n?Edaphosaurus?\\r\\n?\\r\\n?Dimetrodon?\\r\\nMammals\\r\\nThe first fully terrestrial vertebrates were amniotes  their eggs had internal membranes that allowed the developing embryo to breathe but kept water in. This allowed amniotes to lay eggs on dry land, while amphibians generally need to lay their eggs in water (a few amphibians, such as the Surinam toad, have evolved other ways of getting around this limitation). The first amniotes apparently arose in the middle Carboniferous from the ancestral reptiliomorphs.[9]\\r\\nWithin a few million years, two important amniote lineages became distinct: mammals' synapsid ancestors and the sauropsids, from which lizards, snakes, crocodilians, dinosaurs, and birds are descended.[4] The earliest known fossils of synapsids and sauropsids (such as Archaeothyris and Hylonomus, respectively) date from about 320 to 315 million years ago. The times of origin are difficult to know, because vertebrate fossils from the late Carboniferous are very rare, and therefore the actual first occurrences of each of these types of animal might have been considerably earlier than the first fossil.[10]\\r\\nSynapsid skulls are identified by the distinctive pattern of the holes behind each eye, which served the following purposes:\\r\\nThe synapsid pelycosaurs included the largest land vertebrates of the Early Permian, such as the 6?m (20?ft) long Cotylorhynchus hancocki. Among the other large pelycosaurs were Dimetrodon grandis and Edaphosaurus cruciger.\\r\\nTherapsids descended from pelycosaurs in the middle Permian and took over their position as the dominant land vertebrates. They differ from pelycosaurs in several features of the skull and jaws, including larger temporal fenestrae and incisors that are equal in size.[11]\\r\\nThe therapsid lineage that led to mammals went through a series of stages, beginning with animals that were very like their pelycosaur ancestors and ending with some that could easily be mistaken for mammals:[12]\\r\\n(simplified from;[11] only those that are most relevant to the evolution of mammals are described below)\\r\\nBiarmosuchia\\r\\nDinocephalia\\r\\nDicynodonts\\r\\nGorgonopsia\\r\\nTherocephalia\\r\\n(Mammals, eventually)\\r\\nOnly the dicynodonts, therocephalians, and cynodonts survived into the Triassic.\\r\\nThe Biarmosuchia were the most primitive and pelycosaur-like of the therapsids.[14]\\r\\nDinocephalians (\\"terrible heads\\") included both carnivores and herbivores. They were large; Anteosaurus was up to 6?m (20?ft) long. Some of the carnivores had semi-erect hindlimbs, but all dinocephalians had sprawling forelimbs. In many ways they were very primitive therapsids; for example, they had no secondary palate and their jaws were rather \\"reptilian\\".[15]\\r\\nThe anomodonts (\\"anomalous teeth\\") were among the most successful of the herbivorous therapsids  one sub-group, the dicynodonts, survived almost to the end of the Triassic. But anomodonts were very different from modern herbivorous mammals, as their only teeth were a pair of fangs in the upper jaw and it is generally agreed that they had beaks like those of birds or ceratopsians. [16]\\r\\nThe theriodonts (\\"beast teeth\\") and their descendants had jaw joints in which the lower jaw's articular bone tightly gripped the skull's very small quadrate bone. This allowed a much wider gape, and one group, the carnivorous gorgonopsians (\\"gorgon faces\\"), took advantage of this to develop \\"sabre teeth\\". But the theriodont's jaw hinge had a longer term significance  the much reduced size of the quadrate bone was an important step in the development of the mammalian jaw joint and middle ear.\\r\\nThe gorgonopsians still had some primitive features: no bony secondary palate (but other bones in the right places to perform the same functions); sprawling forelimbs; hindlimbs that could operate in both sprawling and erect postures. But the therocephalians (\\"beast heads\\"), which appear to have arisen at about the same time as the gorgonopsians, had additional mammal-like features, e.g. their finger and toe bones had the same number of phalanges (segments) as in early mammals (and the same number that primates have, including humans).[17]\\r\\nThe cynodonts, a theriodont group that also arose in the late Permian, include the ancestors of all mammals. Cynodonts' mammal-like features include further reduction in the number of bones in the lower jaw, a secondary bony palate, cheek teeth with a complex pattern in the crowns, and a brain which filled the endocranial cavity.[18]\\r\\nMulti-chambered burrows have been found, containing as many as 20 skeletons of the Early Triassic cynodont Trirachodon; the animals are thought to have been drowned by a flash flood. The extensive shared burrows indicate that these animals were capable of complex social behaviors.[19]\\r\\nThe catastrophic Permian-Triassic mass extinction slightly more than 250 million years ago killed off about 70 percent of terrestrial vertebrate species and the majority of land plants.\\r\\nAs a result,[20] ecosystems and food chains collapsed, and the establishment of new stable ecosystems took about 30 million years. With the disappearance of the gorgonopsians, which were dominant predators in the late Permian,[21] the cynodonts' principal competitors for dominance of the carnivorous niches were a previously obscure sauropsid group, the archosaurs, which includes the ancestors of crocodilians and dinosaurs.\\r\\nThe archosaurs quickly became the dominant carnivores,[21] a development often called the \\"Triassic takeover\\". Their success may have been due to the fact that the early Triassic was predominantly arid and therefore archosaurs' superior water conservation gave them a decisive advantage. All known archosaurs have glandless skins and eliminate nitrogenous waste in a uric acid paste containing little water, while the cynodonts probably excreted most such waste in a solution of urea, as mammals do today; considerable water is required to keep urea dissolved.[22]\\r\\nHowever, this theory has been questioned, since it implies synapsids were necessarily less advantaged in water retention, that synapsid decline coincides with climate changes or archosaur diversity (neither of which has been tested) and the fact that desert-dwelling mammals are as well adapted in this department as archosaurs,[23] and some cynodonts like Trucidocynodon were large-sized predators.[24]\\r\\nThe Triassic takeover was probably a vital factor in the evolution of the mammals. Two groups stemming from the early cynodonts were successful in niches that had minimal competition from the archosaurs: the tritylodonts, which were herbivores, and the mammals, most of which were small nocturnal insectivores (although some, like Sinoconodon, were carnivores that fed on vertebrate prey, while still others were herbivores or omnivores).[25] As a result:\\r\\nThis retreat to a nocturnal role is called a nocturnal bottleneck, and is thought to explain many of the features of mammals.[31]\\r\\nMesozoic synapsids that had evolved to the point of having a jaw joint composed of the dentary and squamosal bones are preserved in few good fossils, mainly because they were mostly smaller than rats:\\r\\nIn the past 40 years, however, the number of Mesozoic fossil mammals has increased decisively; only 116 genera were known in 1979, for example, but about 310 in 2007, with an increase in quality such that \\"at least 18 Mesozoic mammals are represented by nearly complete skeletons\\".[33]\\r\\nSome writers restrict the term \\"mammal\\" to the crown group mammals, the group consisting of the most recent common ancestor of the monotremes, marsupials, and placentals, together with all the descendants of that ancestor. In an influential 1988 paper, Timothy Rowe advocated this restriction, arguing that \\"ancestry... provides the only means of properly defining taxa\\" and, in particular, that the divergence of the monotremes from the animals more closely related to marsupials and placentals \\"is of central interest to any study of Mammalia as a whole.\\"[34] To accommodate some related taxa falling outside the crown group, he defined the Mammaliaformes as comprising \\"the last common ancestor of Morganucodontidae and Mammalia [as he had defined the latter term] and all its descendants.\\" Besides Morganucodontidae, the newly defined taxon includes Docodonta and Kuehneotheriidae. Though haramiyids have been referred to the mammals since the 1860s,[35] Rowe excluded them from the Mammaliaformes as falling outside his definition, putting them in a larger clade, the Mammaliamorpha.\\r\\nSome writers have adopted this terminology noting, to avoid misunderstanding, that they have done so. Most paleontologists, however, still think that animals with the dentary-squamosal jaw joint and the sort of molars characteristic of modern mammals should formally be members of Mammalia.[8]\\r\\nWhere the ambiguity in the term \\"mammal\\" may be confusing, this article uses \\"mammaliaform\\" and \\"crown mammal\\".\\r\\n(based on Cynodontia:Dendrogram ÿ Palaeos)\\r\\nDvinia\\r\\nProcynosuchidae\\r\\nThrinaxodon\\r\\nCynognathus\\r\\nTritylodontidae\\r\\nTraversodontidae\\r\\nTritheledontidae\\r\\nChiniquodontidae\\r\\nProzostrodon\\r\\nMorganucodontidae\\r\\nDocodonta\\r\\nHadrocodium\\r\\nKuehneotheriidae\\r\\ncrown group Mammals\\r\\nThe Morganucodontidae first appeared in the late Triassic, about 205M years ago. They are an excellent example of transitional fossils, since they have both the dentary-squamosal and articular-quadrate jaw joints.[36] They were also one of the first discovered and most thoroughly studied of the mammaliaforms outside of the crown-group mammals, since an unusually large number of morganucodont fossils have been found.\\r\\nDocodonts, among the most common Jurassic mammaliaforms, are noted for the sophistication of their molars. They are thought to have had general semi-aquatic tendencies, with the fish-eating Castorocauda (\\"beaver tail\\"), which lived in the mid-Jurassic about 164M years ago and was first discovered in 2004 and described in 2006, being the most well-understood example. Castorocauda was not a crown group mammal, but it is extremely important in the study of the evolution of mammals because the first find was an almost complete skeleton (a real luxury in paleontology) and it breaks the \\"small nocturnal insectivore\\" stereotype:[37]\\r\\nThe family tree above shows Hadrocodium as an \\"aunt\\" of crown mammals. This mammaliaform, dated about 195M years ago in the very early Jurassic, exhibits some important features: [38]\\r\\nThe crown group mammals, sometimes called 'true mammals', are the extant mammals and their relatives back to their last common ancestor. Since this group has living members, DNA analysis can be applied in an attempt to explain the evolution of features that do not appear in fossils. This endeavor often involves molecular phylogenetics, a technique that has become popular since the mid-1980s.\\r\\nCladogram after Z.-X Luo.[33] (? marks extinct groups)\\r\\nAusktribosphenidae ?\\r\\nMonotremes\\r\\nEutriconodonta ?\\r\\nMultituberculates ?\\r\\nSpalacotheroidea ?\\r\\nDryolestoidea ?\\r\\nMarsupials\\r\\nPlacentals\\r\\nEarly amniotes had four opsins in the cones of their retinas to use for distinguishing colours: one sensitive to red, one to green, and two corresponding to different shades of blue.[39][40] The green opsin was not inherited by any crown mammals, but all normal individuals did inherit the red one. Early crown mammals thus had three cone opsins, the red one and both of the blues.[39] All their extant descendants have lost one of the blue-sensitive opsins but not always the same one: marsupials and placentals (except for cetaceans) retain one blue-sensitive opsin while monotremes retain the other.[41] Some placentals and marsupials, including humans, subsequently evolved green-sensitive opsins; like early crown mammals, therefore, their vision is trichromatic.[42][43]\\r\\nAusktribosphenidae is a group name that has been given to some rather puzzling finds that:[44]\\r\\nAustralosphenida is a group that has been defined in order to include the Ausktribosphenidae and monotremes. Asfaltomylos (mid- to late Jurassic, from Patagonia) has been interpreted as a basal australosphenid (animal that has features shared with both Ausktribosphenidae and monotremes; lacks features that are peculiar to Ausktribosphenidae or monotremes; also lacks features that are absent in Ausktribosphenidae and monotremes) and as showing that australosphenids were widespread throughout Gondwanaland (the old Southern Hemisphere super-continent).[46]\\r\\nRecent analysis of Teinolophos, which lived somewhere between 121 and 112.5 million years ago, suggests that it was a \\"crown group\\" (advanced and relatively specialised) monotreme. This was taken as evidence that the basal (most primitive) monotremes must have appeared considerably earlier, but this has been disputed (see the following section). The study also indicated that some alleged Australosphenids were also \\"crown group\\" monotremes (e.g. Steropodon) and that other alleged Australosphenids (e.g. Ausktribosphenos, Bishops, Ambondro, Asfaltomylos) are more closely related to and possibly members of the Therian mammals (group that includes marsupials and placentals, see below).[47]\\r\\nTeinolophos, from Australia, is the earliest known monotreme. A 2007 study (published 2008) suggests that it was not a basal (primitive, ancestral) monotreme but a full-fledged platypus, and therefore that the platypus and echidna lineages diverged considerably earlier.[47] A more recent study (2009), however, has suggested that, while Teinolophos was a type of platypus, it was also a basal monotreme and predated the radiation of modern monotremes. The semi-aquatic lifestyle of platypuses prevented them from being outcompeted by the marsupials that migrated to Australia millions of years ago, since joeys need to remain attached to their mothers and would drown if their mothers ventured into water (though there are exceptions like the water opossum and the lutrine opossum; however, they both live in South America and thus don't come into contact with monotremes). Genetic evidence has determined that echidnas diverged from the platypus lineage as recently as 19-48M, when they made their transition from semi-aquatic to terrestrial lifestyle.[48]\\r\\nMonotremes have some features that may be inherited from the cynodont ancestors:\\r\\nUnlike other mammals, female monotremes do not have nipples and feed their young by \\"sweating\\" milk from patches on their bellies.\\r\\nOf course these features are not visible in fossils, and the main characteristics from paleontologists' point of view are:[44]\\r\\nMultituberculates (named for the multiple tubercles on their \\"molars\\") are often called the \\"rodents of the Mesozoic\\", but this is an example of convergent evolution rather than meaning that they are closely related to the Rodentia. They existed for approximately 120 million yearsthe longest fossil history of any mammal lineagebut were eventually outcompeted by rodents, becoming extinct during the early Oligocene.\\r\\nSome authors have challenged the phylogeny represented by the cladogram above. They exclude the multituberculates from the mammalian crown group, holding that multituberculates are more distantly related to extant mammals than even the Morganucodontidae.[50][51] Multituberculates are like undisputed crown mammals in that their jaw joints consist of only the dentary and squamosal bones-whereas the quadrate and articular bones are part of the middle ear; their teeth are differentiated, occlude, and have mammal-like cusps; they have a zygomatic arch; and the structure of the pelvis suggests that they gave birth to tiny helpless young, like modern marsupials.[52] On the other hand, they differ from modern mammals:\\r\\nTheria (\\"beasts\\"), is the clade originating with the last common ancestor of the Eutheria (including placentals) and Metatheria (including marsupials). Common features include:[53]\\r\\nThe living Metatheria are all marsupials (animals with pouches). A few fossil genera, such as the Mongolian late Cretaceous Asiatherium, may be marsupials or members of some other metatherian group(s).[54][55]\\r\\nThe oldest known metatherian is Sinodelphys, found in 125M-year-old early Cretaceous shale in China's northeastern Liaoning Province. The fossil is nearly complete and includes tufts of fur and imprints of soft tissues.[56]\\r\\nDidelphimorphia (common opossums of the Western Hemisphere) first appeared in the late Cretaceous and still have living representatives, probably because they are mostly semi-arboreal unspecialized omnivores.[57]\\r\\nThe best-known feature of marsupials is their method of reproduction:\\r\\nAlthough some marsupials look very like some placentals (the thylacine or \\"marsupial wolf\\" is a good example), marsupial skeletons have some features that distinguish them from placentals:[59]\\r\\nMarsupials also have a pair of marsupial bones (sometimes called \\"epipubic bones\\"), which support the pouch in females. But these are not unique to marsupials, since they have been found in fossils of multituberculates, monotremes, and even eutherians  so they are probably a common ancestral feature that disappeared at some point after the ancestry of living placental mammals diverged from that of marsupials.[60][61] Some researchers think the epipubic bones' original function was to assist locomotion by supporting some of the muscles that pull the thigh forwards.[62]\\r\\nThe time of appearance of the earliest eutherians has been a matter of controversy. On one hand, recently discovered fossils of Juramaia have been dated to 160 million years ago and classified as eutherian.[63] Fossils of Eomaia from 125 million years ago in the Early Cretaceous have also been classified as eutherian.[64] A recent analysis of phenomic characters, however, classified Eomaia as pre-eutherian and reported that the earliest clearly eutherian specimens came from Maelestes, dated to 91 million years ago.[65] That study also reported that eutherians did not significantly diversify until after the catastrophic extinction at the CretaceousÿPaleogene boundary, about 66 million years ago.\\r\\nEomaia was found to have some features that are more like those of marsupials and earlier metatherians:\\r\\nEomaia also has a Meckelian groove, a primitive feature of the lower jaw that is not found in modern placental mammals.\\r\\nThese intermediate features are consistent with molecular phylogenetics estimates that the placentals diversified about 110M years ago, 15M years after the date of the Eomaia fossil.\\r\\nEomaia also has many features that strongly suggest it was a climber, including several features of the feet and toes; well-developed attachment points for muscles that are used a lot in climbing; and a tail that is twice as long as the rest of the spine.\\r\\nPlacentals' best-known feature is their method of reproduction:\\r\\nIt has been suggested that the evolution of placental reproduction was made possible by retroviruses that:[68]\\r\\nFrom a paleontologist's point of view, eutherians are mainly distinguished by various features of their teeth,[69] ankles and feet.[70]\\r\\nThere is still some truth in the \\"small, nocturnal insectivores\\" stereotype, but recent finds, mainly in China, show that some mammaliaforms and crown group mammals were larger and had a variety of lifestyles. For example:\\r\\nThere are currently vigorous debates between traditional paleontologists and molecular phylogeneticists about how and when the modern groups of mammals diversified, especially the placentals. Generally, the traditional paleontologists date the appearance of a particular group by the earliest known fossil whose features make it likely to be a member of that group, while the molecular phylogeneticists suggest that each lineage diverged earlier (usually in the Cretaceous) and that the earliest members of each group were anatomically very similar to early members of other groups and differed only in their genetics. These debates extend to the definition of and relationships between the major groups of placentals  the controversy about Afrotheria is a good example.\\r\\nHere is a very simplified version of a typical family tree based on fossils, based on Cladogram of Mammalia ÿ Palaeos. It tries to show the nearest thing there is at present to a consensus view, but some paleontologists have very different views, for example:[82]\\r\\nFor the sake of brevity and simplicity, the diagram omits some extinct groups in order to focus on the ancestry of well-known modern groups of placentals  ? marks extinct groups. The diagram also shows the following:\\r\\nXenarthra (late cretaceous)\\r\\n(armadillos, anteaters, sloths)\\r\\nPholidota (late cretaceous)\\r\\n(pangolins)\\r\\n(some extinct groups) ?\\r\\nInsectivora (latest Cretaceous)\\r\\n(hedgehogs, shrews, moles, tenrecs)\\r\\nZalambdalestidae ?

For example:\\r\\nMolecular phylogenetics uses features of organisms' genes to work out family trees in much the same way as paleontologists do with features of fossils  if two organisms' genes are more similar to each other than to those of a third organism, the two organisms are more closely related to each other than to the third.\\r\\nMolecular phylogeneticists have proposed a family tree that is very different from the one with which paleontologists are familiar. Like paleontologists, molecular phylogeneticists have different ideas about various details, but here is a typical family tree according to molecular phylogenetics:[87][88] Note that the diagram shown here omits extinct groups, as one cannot extract DNA from fossils.\\r\\nXenarthra (armadillos, anteaters, sloths)\\r\\nAfrosoricida (golden moles, tenrecs, otter shrews)\\r\\nMacroscelidea (elephant shrews)\\r\\nTubulidentata (aardvarks)\\r\\nHyracoidea (hyraxes)\\r\\nProboscidea (elephants)\\r\\nSirenia (manatees, dugongs)\\r\\nErinaceomorpha (hedgehogs, gymnures)\\r\\nSoricomorpha (moles, shrews, solenodons)\\r\\nCetartiodactyla (camels and llamas, pigs and peccaries, ruminants, whales and hippos)\\r\\nPholidota (pangolins)\\r\\nChiroptera (bats)\\r\\nCarnivora (cats, dogs, bears, seals)\\r\\nPerissodactyla (horses, rhinos, tapirs).\\r\\nLagomorpha (rabbits, hares, pikas)\\r\\nRodentia (late Paleocene) (mice and rats, squirrels, porcupines)\\r\\nScandentia (tree shrews)\\r\\nDermoptera (colugos)\\r\\nPrimates (tarsiers, lemurs, monkeys, apes including humans)\\r\\nHere are the most significant of the many differences between this family tree and the one familiar to paleontologists:\\r\\nThe grouping together of the Afrotheria has some geological justification. All surviving members of the Afrotheria originate from South American or (mainly) African lineages  even the Indian elephant, which diverged from an African lineage about 7.6?million years ago.[91] As Pangaea broke up, Africa and South America separated from the other continents less than 150M years ago, and from each other between 100M and 80M years ago.[92][93] So it would not be surprising if the earliest eutherian immigrants into Africa and South America were isolated there and radiated into all the available ecological niches.\\r\\nNevertheless, these proposals have been controversial. Paleontologists naturally insist that fossil evidence must take priority over deductions from samples of the DNA of modern animals. More surprisingly, these new family trees have been criticised by other molecular phylogeneticists, sometimes quite harshly:[94]\\r\\nRecent molecular phylogenetic studies suggest that most placental orders diverged late in the Cretaceous period, about 100 to 85 million years ago, but that modern families first appeared later, in the late Eocene and early Miocene epochs of the Cenozoic period.[98][99] Fossil-based analyses, on the contrary, limit the placentals to the Cenozoic.[100] Many Cretaceous fossil sites contain well-preserved lizards, salamanders, birds, and mammals, but not the modern forms of mammals. It is likely that they simply did not exist, and that the molecular clock runs fast during major evolutionary radiations.[101] On the other hand, there is fossil evidence from 85?million years ago of hoofed mammals that may be ancestors of modern ungulates.[102]\\r\\nFossils of the earliest members of most modern groups date from the Paleocene, a few date from later and very few from the Cretaceous, before the extinction of the dinosaurs. But some paleontologists, influenced by molecular phylogenetic studies, have used statistical methods to extrapolate backwards from fossils of members of modern groups and concluded that primates arose in the late Cretaceous.[103] However, statistical studies of the fossil record confirm that mammals were restricted in size and diversity right to the end of the Cretaceous, and rapidly grew in size and diversity during the Early Paleocene.[104][105]\\r\\nHadrocodium, whose fossils date from the early Jurassic, provides the first clear evidence of fully mammalian jaw joints and middle ears, in which the jaw joint is formed by the dentary and squamosal bones while the articular and quadrate move to the middle ear, where they are known as the incus and malleus.\\r\\nOne analysis of the monotreme Teinolophos suggested that this animal had a pre-mammalian jaw joint formed by the angular and quadrate bones and that the definitive mammalian middle ear evolved twice independently, in monotremes and in therian mammals, but this idea has been disputed.[106] In fact, two of the suggestion's authors co-authored a later paper that reinterpreted the same features as evidence that Teinolophos was a full-fledged platypus, which means it would have had a mammalian jaw joint and middle ear.[47]\\r\\nIt has been suggested that lactation's original function was to keep eggs moist. Much of the argument is based on monotremes (egg-laying mammals):[107][108][109]\\r\\nLater research demonstrated that caseins already appeared in the common mammalian ancestor approximately 200ÿ310 million years ago.[110] The question of whether secretion of a substance to keep egg moist translated into actual lactation in therapsids is open. A small mammaliomorph called Sinocodon, generally assumed to be the sister group of all later mammals, had front teeth in even the smallest individuals. Combined with a poorly ossified jaw, they very probably did not suckle.[111] Thus suckling may have evolved right at the pre-mammal/mammal transition. However, tritylodontids, generally assumed to be more basal, show evidence of suckling.[112] Morganucodontans, also assumed to be basal Mammaliaformes, also show evidence of lactation.[113]\\r\\nThe first clear evidence of hair or fur is in fossils of Castorocauda and Megaconus, from 164M years ago in the mid-Jurassic.[37] As both extant mammals, Megaconus and Castorocauda have a double coat of hair, with both guard hairs and an undercoat, it may be assumed that their last common ancestor did as well. This animal must have been Triassic as it was an ancestor of the Triassic Tikitherium.[33] More recently, the discovery of hair remnants in Permian coprolites pushes back the origin of mammalian hair much further back in the synapsid line to Paleozoic therapsids.[114]\\r\\nIn the mid-1950s, some scientists interpreted the foramina (passages) in the maxillae (upper jaws) and premaxillae (small bones in front of the maxillae) of cynodonts as channels that supplied blood vessels and nerves to vibrissae (whiskers) and suggested that this was evidence of hair or fur.[115][116] It was soon pointed out, however, that foramina do not necessarily show that an animal had vibrissae; the modern lizard Tupinambis has foramina that are almost identical to those found in the non-mammalian cynodont Thrinaxodon.[13][117] Popular sources, nevertheless, continue to attribute whiskers to Thrinaxodon.[118] A trace fossil from the Lower Triassic had been erroneously regarded as a cynodont footprint showing hair,[119] but this interpretation has been refuted.[120] A study of cranial openings for facial nerves connected whiskers in extant mammals indicate the Prozostrodontia, small immediate ancestors of mammals, presented whiskers similar to mammals, but that less advanced therapsids would either have immobile whiskers or no whisker at all.[121] Fur may have evolved from whiskers.[122] Whiskers themselves may have evolved as a response to nocturnal and/or burrowing lifestyle.\\r\\nRuben & Jones (2000) note that the Harderian glands, which secrete lipids for coating the fur, were present in the earliest mammals like Morganucodon, but were absent in near-mammalian therapsids like Thrinaxodon.[123] The Msx2 gene associated with hair follicle maintenance is also linked to the closure of the parietal eye in mammals, indicating that fur and lack of pineal eye is linked. The pineal eye is present in Thrinaxodon, but absent in more advanced cynognaths (the Probainognathia).[121]\\r\\nInsulation is the \\"cheapest\\" way to maintain a fairly constant body temperature, without consuming energy to produce more body heat. Therefore, the possession of hair or fur would be good evidence of homeothermy, but would not be such strong evidence of a high metabolic rate.[124] [125]\\r\\nUnderstanding of the evolution of erect limbs in mammals is incomplete  living and fossil monotremes have sprawling limbs. Some scientists think that the parasagittal (non-sprawling) limb posture is limited to the Boreosphenida, a group that contains the therians but not, for example, the multituberculates. In particular, they attribute a parasagittal stance to the therians Sinodelphys and Eomaia, which means that the stance had arisen by 125 million years ago, in the Early Cretaceous. However, they also discuss that earlier mammals had more erect forelimbs as opposed to the more sprawling hindlimbs, a trend still continued to some extent in modern placentals and marsupials.[126]\\r\\n\\"Warm-bloodedness\\" is a complex and rather ambiguous term, because it includes some or all of the following:\\r\\nSince scientists cannot know much about the internal mechanisms of extinct creatures, most discussion focuses on homeothermy and tachymetabolism. However, it is generally agreed that endothermy first evolved in non-mammalian synapsids such as dicynodonts, which possess body proportions associated with heat retention,[127] high vascularised bones with Haversian canals,[128] and possibly hair.[129] More recently, it has been suggested that endothermy evolved as far back as Ophiacodon.[130]\\r\\nModern monotremes have a low body temperature compared to marsupials and placental mammals, around 32?C (90?F).[131] Phylogenetic bracketing suggests that the body temperatures of early crown-group mammals were not less than that of extant monotremes. There is cytological evidence that the low metabolism of monotremes is a secondarily evolved trait.[132]\\r\\nModern mammals have respiratory turbinates, convoluted structures of thin bone in the nasal cavity. These are lined with mucous membranes that warm and moisten inhaled air and extract heat and moisture from exhaled air. An animal with respiratory turbinates can maintain a high rate of breathing without the danger of drying its lungs out, and therefore may have a fast metabolism. Unfortunately these bones are very delicate and therefore have not yet been found in fossils. But rudimentary ridges like those that support respiratory turbinates have been found in advanced Triassic cynodonts, such as Thrinaxodon and Diademodon, which suggests that they may have had fairly high metabolic rates. [115] [133][134]\\r\\nMammals have a secondary bony palate, which separates the respiratory passage from the mouth, allowing them to eat and breathe at the same time. Secondary bony palates have been found in the more advanced cynodonts and have been used as evidence of high metabolic rates.[115][116][135] But some cold-blooded vertebrates have secondary bony palates (crocodilians and some lizards), while birds, which are warm-blooded, do not.[13]\\r\\nA muscular diaphragm helps mammals to breathe, especially during strenuous activity. For a diaphragm to work, the ribs must not restrict the abdomen, so that expansion of the chest can be compensated for by reduction in the volume of the abdomen and vice versa. Diaphragms are known in caseid pelycosaurs, indicating an early origin within synapsids, though they were still fairly inefficient and likely required support from other muscle groups and limb motion.[136]\\r\\nThe advanced cynodonts have very mammal-like rib cages, with greatly reduced lumbar ribs. This suggests that these animals had more developed diaphragms, were capable of strenuous activity for fairly long periods and therefore had high metabolic rates.[115][116] On the other hand, these mammal-like rib cages may have evolved to increase agility.[13] However, the movement of even advanced therapsids was \\"like a wheelbarrow\\", with the hindlimbs providing all the thrust while the forelimbs only steered the animal, in other words advanced therapsids were not as agile as either modern mammals or the early dinosaurs.[137] So the idea that the main function of these mammal-like rib cages was to increase agility is doubtful.\\r\\nThe therapsids had sprawling forelimbs and semi-erect hindlimbs.[116][138] This suggests that Carrier's constraint would have made it rather difficult for them to move and breathe at the same time, but not as difficult as it is for animals such as lizards, which have completely sprawling limbs.[139] Advanced therapsids may therefore have been significantly less active than modern mammals of similar size and so may have had slower metabolisms overall or else been bradymetabolic (lower metabolism when at rest).\\r\\nMammals are noted for their large brain size relative to body size, compared to other animal groups. Recent findings suggest that the first brain area to expand was that involved in smell.[140] Scientists scanned the skulls of early mammal species dating back to 190ÿ200 million years ago and compared the brain case shapes to earlier pre-mammal species; they found that the brain area involved in the sense of smell was the first to enlarge.[140] This change may have allowed these early mammals to hunt insects at night when dinosaurs were not active.[140]","input":"When did the first mammal appear on earth?"},{"output":"In 1898, following the SpanishÿAmerican War","context":"","input":"When did peurto rico become part of the united states?"},{"output":"about the construction of the First Transcontinental Railroad across the United States","context":"Hell on Wheels is an American Western television series about the construction of the First Transcontinental Railroad across the United States.

In particular, the story focused on Cullen Bohannon (Mount), a former Confederate soldier who, while working as foreman and chief engineer on the railroad, initially attempted to track down the Union soldiers who murdered his wife and young son during the American Civil War. The series, which broadcast in the United States and Canada on the cable channel AMC, aired from November 6, 2011[2] to July 23, 2016.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe series was created and produced by Joe and Tony Gayton, and developed by Endemol USA, under the stewardship of senior vice-president of scripted programming Jeremy Gold, and it is produced by Entertainment One and Nomadic Pictures.[2] In 2012, AMC announced creators Joe and Tony Gayton were no longer involved in the day-to-day production of the series.[3] On December 12, 2012, AMC announced that writer John Wirth would take over as showrunner for the third season.\\r\\n\\r\\nSeason one (2011ÿ12) began in 1865, shortly after the assassination of Abraham Lincoln, season two (2012) covered 1866, seasons three (2013) and four (2014) opened in 1867, season five (2015ÿ16) carries the series into 1869. On November 7, 2014, Hell on Wheels was renewed for a fifth and final season comprising 14 episodes, split between 2015 and 2016.[4]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1865, former Confederate soldier Cullen Bohannon (Anson Mount) journeys to the Union Pacific Railroad's westward construction of the First Transcontinental Railroad, seeking both work and vengeance on the Union soldiers who killed his wife and son. Cullen gets hired by the railroad and supervises an all-black \\"cut crew\\", including Elam (Common), whose job is to prepare the terrain for track laying. Through conversation with the railroad foreman, Daniel Johnson (Ted Levine), Cullen learns more about his wife's death,  but tragedy strikes before Johnson reveals her killer's name. Thomas \\"Doc\\" Durant (Colm Meaney) begins his \\"mad, noble quest\\" to expand his Union Pacific westward, in order to complete the transcontinental railroad. Lily Bell (Dominique McElligott) accompanies her ailing husband, Robert (Robert Moloney), as he surveys the landscape for the Union Pacific; when Robert is killed by the Cheyenne natives, Lily must cope with being a widow on foreign soil. Reverend Nathaniel Cole (Tom Noonan) baptizes Joseph Black Moon (Eddie Spears), a Cheyenne, then takes him under his tutelage in the church. Season one ends with Bohannon killing a man he believes was responsible for the rape and murder of his wife, only to discover that man was not there at the time.\\r\\n\\r\\nBohannon tries to find himself again while continuing to drive the westward expansion of the Union Pacific Railroad, under Durant's leadership. Bohannon takes up with a gang of train robbers but is turned over to the Union Army and imprisoned. Durant manages to get him pardoned. The railroad construction enters the Sioux territory, where The Swede and a misguided Reverend Cole assist the natives in attacking the railroad. Lily Bell seeks to gain control of the railroad from Durant and mails his accounting ledgers to the government. Army officers arrive to find the town has been attacked by the Sioux.\\r\\n\\r\\nBohannon abandons his quest to avenge his wife and son's deaths, in order to battle Durant for control of the Union Pacific Railroad. Eva gives birth to a baby who was sired during her marriage to Gregory Toole. Elam proposes marriage to her, even though her post-partum depression weighs heavily on her. The Swede takes up with a Mormon family on their way to the fictional Fort Smith and later reveals his true nature.\\r\\n\\r\\nConflict arises among the government and businesses, ranchers, homesteaders, and the railroad, as all of those interests compete with one another for control of Cheyenne, Wyoming, the most important railroad hub in 1867. Meanwhile, the Union Pacific Railroad continues its expansion westward, and Bohannon adjusts to being a husband and father, again.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn Season 5, set in California and Laramie, Wyoming,[5] Bohannon is hired by the Central Pacific Railroad to build the transcontinental railroad eastward over the Sierra Nevada Mountains. He befriends its Chinese workers, including Mei, a woman disguised as a man known as Fong. President Ulysses S. Grant increases the competition between the Central Pacific and Union Pacific Railroad companies. This is further complicated by Thomas Durant's corruption.\\r\\n\\r\\nHell on Wheels was created by Joe and Tony Gayton in late 2008, and Endemol USA's scripted television division, headed by senior vice president of original programming Jeremy Gold, came on board to develop the series for AMC.[6] On May 18, 2010, AMC placed a pilot order for Hell on Wheels with Endemol USA.[7] Joe and Tony Gayton wrote the pilot, David Von Ancken was attached to the project as director, and Jeremy Gold, Joe Gayton, and Tony Gayton served as executive producers. On July 6, 2010, Endemol USA announced that they had entered into a partnership with Entertainment One, which would serve as the production studio on the project.[8]\\r\\n\\r\\nPart of the deal between the two companies included provisions of international distribution, with Endemol retaining rights to the series across Europe, while Entertainment One acquired rights to Hell on Wheels in all remaining territories.[8] As a result of the deal, Entertainment One also holds global rights for DVD and Blu-ray sales, as well as video-on-demand and other digital distribution services.[8] The Canadian production company Nomadic Pictures was brought onto the project to serve as co-producers alongside Entertainment One.[9] The pilot was delivered to AMC executives in November 2010.[9]\\r\\n\\r\\nOn November 12, 2010 it was reported by Deadline that the executives at AMC were impressed with the pilot, and, coupled with the fact that the network had just cancelled their drama series, Rubicon, were likely to order Hell on Wheels to series.[9]\\r\\n\\r\\nOn December 15, 2010, AMC green-lighted the series with an order of 10 episodes.[10][11][12] Along with the series pickup, AMC announced that Nomadic Pictures would again co-produce the series, as they had done for the pilot, with Mike Frislev and Chad Oakes joining the series as producers, while John Shiban and David Von Ancken joined the series as executive producers; Von Ancken had previously served as director on the pilot.[12][13] The network also announced that John Morayniss and Michael Rosenberg would oversee production for Entertainment One, while Joel Stillerman and Susie Fitzgerald would oversee production for AMC.[12][13]\\r\\n\\r\\nOn July 28, 2011, AMC announced that Hell on Wheels would premiere on November 6, 2011.[2] The series is produced by Entertainment One and Nomadic Pictures.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn November 8, 2011, co-creator Joe Gayton spoke of the series' origins: \\"We [Tony and I] started talking and remembered this story, American Experience, which was this really great documentary, and I thought, 'God, thats great. I just learned a bunch of stuff I had never learned before.' You just have this cursory information that the Chinese and the Irish built the railroad, but it got in underneath all the dirt and stuff that went on, with the financing of it, and the greed and corruption. And then, I heard about this Hell on Wheels place and I went, 'What a great setting for a western.' So, we pitched that to Jeremy Gold [at Endemol] and ended up taking it to AMC, and they loved it,\\" he said.[14]\\r\\n\\r\\nOn October 29, 2012, AMC renewed Hell on Wheels for a third season,[15] however it was also announced that the series creators and showrunners, Joe and Tony Gayton, \\"will no longer be involved day-to-day on the show\\" and series producer/writer/director John Shiban would take over.[3] Following the departure of Shiban, the renewal was put on hold until a replacement could be found.[16] On December 12, 2012, AMC announced that John Wirth, a writer for Terminator: The Sarah Connor Chronicles, will be the new showrunner, starting with the show's third season.[17]\\r\\n\\r\\nCasting announcements began in July 2010, with Common first to be cast. Common portrays Elam Ferguson, \\"an emancipated slave who is working to achieve true freedom in a world entrenched in prejudice\\".[2][18]\\r\\nNext to join the series were Anson Mount and Dominique McElligott, with Mount playing Cullen Bohannon, \\"a former soldier hell bent on avenging his wifes death\\", and McElligott playing Lily Bell, \\"a newly widowed woman trying to survive in a mans world\\".[2][19]\\r\\nColm Meaney was next to be cast as Thomas \\"Doc\\" Durant, a \\"greedy entrepreneur taking full advantage of the changing times\\".[2][20]\\r\\nBen Esler, Phil Burke and Eddie Spears were the last actors to be cast, with Esler playing Sen McGinnes and Burke playing Mickey McGinnes, \\"two young brothers looking to find their fortune in the new West\\".  Spears was cast as Joseph Black Moon, \\"a Native American man torn between his culture and the changing world around him\\".[2]\\r\\nIt was later announced that Jesse Lipscombe, Gerald Auger, Robert Moloney and Ted Levine had joined the series as recurring guest stars.[21][22]\\r\\n\\r\\nJennifer Ferrin joined the cast as a series regular for season three, playing a New York Sun journalist covering the construction of the railroad.[23]\\r\\nAMC announced that Dohn Norwood (Psalms) became a series regular for season three.[24]\\r\\n\\r\\nJake Weber joined the fourth season's cast. He was initially to portray a carpetbagger seeking to profit from the frontier,[25] but his role changed to John Allen Campbell, first governor of Wyoming. MacKenzie Porter has also been cast. She will replace Siobhan Williams in the role of Naomi, Bohannon's Mormon bride.[26]\\r\\n\\r\\nCommon spoke about the challenges of playing a former slave: \\"Very challenging. And that's why I took it on. It's a lot of responsibility because what black people went through in slavery, within that system of slavery, was really treacherous. And for me, I felt like I owed it to the people that lived during that time to bring something truthful to the character. And even just revisiting some of the experiences of it, [there] was just a lot of emotion and a lot of pain. At the same time, a lot of strength came from it. What I enjoy most about the character is the fact that he was written so strong, not as just a person that was oppressed and kept his head down.\\"[29]\\r\\n\\r\\nCanadian actor Christopher Heyerdahl talks about how he got his role and the rarity of a Scandinavian character: \\"Well, luck and providence, I suppose. They say, 'Whats luck? Preparation and opportunity.' So, I guess the opportunity came, in the form of an audition. I put myself on tape, and they responded to it. I went in and did a call-back audition, and they felt that we were on the same track. My idea of who The Swede was, was the same as theirs, and vice versa. This kind of character is very rare, with the fact that it fit so well with my background and my understanding of a Norwegian man. It all just fell into place. I still get a little choked up thinking about how often a character like this comes along. For the viewer, its quite interesting. Its not a character that we see very often, and certainly not in this form. As an actor, it seemed to be tailor-made for me. Its quite wonderful.\\"[30]\\r\\n\\r\\nIrish actress Dominique McElligott never expected to be cast in a period American role: \\"I was hanging out in London, having drinks with friends who are all flight attendants, and they said that they would get me over to America for free, and I could stay and do some meetings and auditions. Hell on Wheels was the first one. I arrived on the 5th of July, and the Hell on Wheels audition was on the 6th or the 7th. It was crazy! They didnt know me, at all. Obviously, I loved the pilot and I loved the character, but I didnt anticipate ever actually getting the chance to do it. When you go up for these brilliant parts, you just figure, 'Okay, well, theyre going to pick some American actress, and that will be that.' But, the opportunity was there, and I really enjoyed the audition. It was fun.\\"[31]\\r\\n\\r\\nFilming of the first season took place in Calgary, as well as areas in central and southern Alberta, Canada.[32] The T'suu T'ina Native Indian Reservation, an Indian reserve in southern Alberta, was the location for most of the exteriors.[33]\\r\\n\\r\\nExterior filming of the second season was near the Bow River in Calgary. Interior filming was in a building near the city's airport. Series producers expected the filming of the season's ten episodes to take about 80 days.[1]\\r\\n\\r\\nFilming of the third season was suspended part way through the sixth episode when the location was included in the mandatory evacuation area due to the flooding in southern Alberta.[34]  Originally, producers had announced a two-day shut down, when the only road to the location was underwater.[35] Later, on June 21, producers announced that the production hiatus, scheduled to begin June 27, would take effect immediately.[34] Anson Mount shared pictures of the nearby river and exterior sets flooding on June 20 and 21.[34][36][37]\\r\\n\\r\\nFilming of the fourth season's 13 episodes took place along the Bow River. Filming occurred from April 24 to September 24, 2014.[38]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe fifth season's production filming occurred on the CL Ranch, west of Calgary, for the Truckee, California, and Laramie, Wyoming, locations. The Kananaskis Country park system, 40 miles west of the ranch, served as the Sierra Nevada mountains the Central Pacific must cross.[39]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe first season was given 63% on Metacritic based on 28 reviews, indicating a \\"generally favorable\\" impression.[40]\\r\\nThe second season was given 60% on Metacritic, indicating \\"mixed or average\\"  reviews.[41]\\r\\nThe Washington Post's Hank Stuever rated the show highly, commenting, \\"Hands down, the most intriguing show on the fall slate.

Plenty of guns, knives, arrows, scalpings ÿ mixed with the incendiary socio-psychological wounds left in the Civil Wars wake.\\"[42]\\r\\n\\r\\nRobert Lloyd of the Los Angeles Times says the show \\"...takes its cues more from the movies than from life. Never, in the episodes I watched, did I feel as if I were actually seeing how a railroad got built, and sometimes it took a bit of squinting not to see the characters as actors in a field, reading lines. Still, for all the unlikely things [the creators] make happen in order to get their characters into place, and the dogged refusal of a couple of those characters to become interesting at all, the show gathers steam as it goes on.\\"[43]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Wall Street Journal's Nancy Dewolf Smith comments: \\" 'Hell on Wheels' finds enough beauty, danger and emotion to make some part of every episode seem fresh and worth waiting for. Not that new is always a good thing. Despite striking performances even in many of the smaller roles, the actors sometimes are made to symbolize very modern obsessions, e.g. with race and gender. The sight of modern sensibilities lurking behind the curtains can break ye olde spell.\\"[44]\\r\\n\\r\\nBrian Lowry of Variety writes: \\"While the diverse mix of characters could work to the program's advantage over the long haul, jumping to and fro among them creates a diluted, herky-jerky ride in the early going.\\"[45]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Washington Post reported that the series has been criticized for not depicting Chinese immigrants during the transcontinental railroad construction scenes. Creator Joe Gayton said \\"budget-wise and time-wise .?.?. we could really only concentrate on one side of [the railroad building], and thats probably why we, you know, that's why we chose the [emanating from the East Coast] Union Pacific as opposed to the [emanating from the West Coast] Central Pacific.\\"[46] By the fifth season, the show expanded its focus to include a significant look at the role of Chinese immigrant workers in the growth of the railroad.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe pilot, premiering November 6. 2011, was watched by 4.4 million viewers ÿ AMC's second-highest series premiere in history, following The Walking Dead.

DVD-Video discs had been limited to a maximum resolution of 480p (NTSC, 720G480 pixels) or 576p (PAL, 720G576 pixels).[7] Besides the hardware specifications, Blu-ray is associated with a set of multimedia formats.\\r\\nThe BD format was developed by the Blu-ray Disc Association, a group representing makers of consumer electronics, computer hardware, and motion pictures. Sony unveiled the first Blu-ray disc prototypes in October 2000, and the first prototype player was released in April 2003 in Japan. Afterwards, it continued to be developed until its official release in June 2006. During the high definition optical disc format war, Blu-ray Disc competed with the HD DVD format. Toshiba, the main company that supported HD DVD, conceded in February 2008,[8] releasing its own Blu-ray Disc player in late 2009.[9] According to Media Research, high-definition software sales in the US were slower in the first two years than DVD software sales. Blu-ray faces competition from video on demand and the continued sale of DVDs.[10] As of January 2016, 44% of U.S. broadband households had a Blu-ray player.[11]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe information density of the DVD format was limited by the wavelength of the laser diodes used. Following protracted development, blue laser diodes operating at 405 nanometers became available on a production basis. Sony started two projects in collaboration with Philips[12] applying the new diodes: UDO (Ultra Density Optical),[13] and DVR Blue (together with Pioneer),[14] a format of rewritable discs that would eventually become Blu-ray Disc (more specifically, BD-RE). The core technologies of the formats are similar. The first DVR Blue prototypes were unveiled at the CEATEC exhibition in October 2000 by Sony.[15] A trademark for the \\"Blue Disc\\" logo was filed February 9, 2001.[16] On February 19, 2002, the project was officially announced as Blu-ray Disc,[17][18] and Blu-ray Disc Founders was founded by the nine initial members.\\r\\nThe first consumer device arrived in stores on April 10, 2003: the Sony BDZ-S77, a $3,800 (US) BD-RE recorder that was made available only in Japan.[19] But there was no standard for prerecorded video, and no movies were released for this player. Hollywood studios insisted that players be equipped with digital rights management before they would release movies for the new format, and they wanted a new DRM system that would be more secure than the failed Content Scramble System (CSS) used on DVDs. On October 4, 2004, the name \\"Blu-ray Disc Founders\\" was officially changed to the Blu-ray Disc Association (BDA), and 20th Century Fox joined the BDA's Board of Directors.[20] The Blu-ray Disc physical specifications were completed in 2004.[21]\\r\\nIn January 2005, TDK announced that they had now developed an ultra-hard yet very thin polymer coating (\\"Durabis\\") for Blu-ray discs; this was a significant technical advance because a far tougher protection was desired in the consumer market to protect bare discs against scratching and damage compared to DVD, while technically Blu-ray Disc required a much thinner layer for the denser and higher frequency blue laser.[22] Cartridges, originally used for scratch protection, were no longer necessary and were scrapped. The BD-ROM specifications were finalized in early 2006.[23]\\r\\nAACS LA, a consortium founded in 2004,[24] had been developing the DRM platform that could be used to securely distribute movies to consumers. However, the final AACS standard was delayed,[25] and then delayed again when an important member of the Blu-ray Disc group voiced concerns.[26] At the request of the initial hardware manufacturers, including Toshiba, Pioneer, and Samsung, an interim standard was published that did not include some features, such as managed copy.[27]\\r\\nThe first BD-ROM players (Samsung BD-P1000) were shipped in mid-June 2006, though HD DVD players beat them to market by a few months.[28][29] The first Blu-ray Disc titles were released on June 20, 2006: 50 First Dates, The Fifth Element, Hitch, House of Flying Daggers, Twister, Underworld: Evolution, xXx (all Sony), and MGM's The Terminator.[30] The earliest releases used MPEG-2 video compression, the same method used on standard DVDs. The first releases using the newer VC-1 and AVC formats were introduced in September 2006.[31] The first movies using 50?GB dual-layer discs were introduced in October 2006.[32] The first audio-only albums were released in May 2008.[33][34]\\r\\nThe first mass-market Blu-ray Disc rewritable drive for the PC was the BWU-100A, released by Sony on July 18, 2006.[35] It recorded both single and dual-layer BD-Rs as well as BD-REs and had a suggested retail price of US $699. As of June 2008[update], more than 2,500 Blu-ray Disc titles were available in Australia and the United Kingdom, with 3,500 in the United States and Canada.[36] In Japan, as of July 2010[update], more than 3,300 titles have been released.[37]\\r\\nThe DVD Forum, chaired by Toshiba, was split over whether to develop the more expensive blue laser technology. In March 2002 the forum approved a proposal, which was endorsed by Warner Bros. and other motion picture studios. The proposal involved compressing HD video onto dual-layer standard DVD-9 discs.[38][39] In spite of this decision, however, the DVD Forum's Steering Committee announced in April that it was pursuing its own blue-laser high-definition video solution. In August, Toshiba and NEC announced their competing standard, Advanced Optical Disc.[40] It was finally adopted by the DVD Forum and renamed HD DVD the next year,[41] after being voted down twice by DVD Forum members who were also Blu-ray Disc Association membersa situation that drew preliminary investigations by the U.S. Department of Justice.[42]\\r\\nHD DVD had a head start in the high-definition video market, as Blu-ray Disc sales were slow to gain market share. The first Blu-ray Disc player was perceived as expensive and buggy, and there were few titles available.[43]\\r\\nThe appearance of the Sony PlayStation 3, which contained a Blu-ray Disc player for primary storage, helped support Blu-ray.[44] Sony also ran a more thorough and influential marketing campaign for the format.[45] AVCHD camcorders were also introduced in 2006. These recordings can be played back on many Blu-ray Disc players without re-encoding but are not compatible with HD DVD players. By January 2007, Blu-ray Discs had outsold HD DVDs,[46] and during the first three-quarters of 2007, BD outsold HD DVD by about two to one. At CES 2007, Warner proposed Total Hi Defa hybrid disc containing Blu-ray on one side and HD DVD on the other, but it was never released.\\r\\nIn a June 28, 2007, press release, Twentieth Century Fox cited Blu-ray Disc's adoption of the BD+ anticopying system as key to their decision to support the Blu-ray Disc format.[47][48] On January 4, 2008, a day before CES 2008, Warner Bros. (the only major studio still releasing movies in both HD DVD and Blu-ray Disc format) announced that it would release only in Blu-ray Disc after May 2008.[49] This effectively included other studios that came under the Warner umbrella, such as New Line Cinema and HBOthough in Europe, HBO distribution partner, the BBC, announced it would, while keeping an eye on market forces, continue to release product on both formats. This led to a chain reaction in the industry, with major U.S. retailers such as Best Buy, Walmart, and Circuit City and Canadian chains such as Future Shop dropping HD DVD in their stores. A then major European retailer, Woolworths, dropped HD DVD from its inventory.[50] Netflix and Blockbustermajor DVD rental companiessaid they would no longer carry HD DVD.\\r\\nFollowing these new developments, on February 19, 2008, Toshiba announced it would end production of HD DVD devices,[51] allowing Blu-ray Disc to become the industry standard for high-density optical discs. Universal Studios, the sole major movie studio to back HD DVD since its inception, said shortly after Toshiba's announcement: \\"While Universal values the close partnership we have shared with Toshiba, it is time to turn our focus to releasing new and catalog titles on Blu-ray Disc.\\"[52] Paramount Pictures, which started releasing movies only in HD DVD format during late 2007, also said it would start releasing in Blu-ray Disc. Both studios announced initial Blu-ray lineups in May 2008. With this, all major Hollywood studios supported Blu-ray.[53]\\r\\nAccording to Media Research, high-definition software sales in the US were slower in the first two years than DVD software sales.[54] 16.3 million DVD software units were sold in the first two years (1997ÿ98) compared to 8.3 million high-definition software units (2006ÿ07).[54][55] One reason given for this difference was the smaller marketplace (26.5 million HDTVs in 2007 compared to 100 million SDTVs in 1998).[55] Former HD DVD supporter Microsoft did not make a Blu-ray Disc drive for the Xbox 360.[56] The 360's successor Xbox One features a Blu-ray drive, as does the PS4, with both supporting 3D Blu-ray after later firmware updates.[57][58]\\r\\nShortly after the \\"format war\\" ended, Blu-ray disc sales began to increase. A study by The NPD Group found that awareness of Blu-ray Disc had reached 60% of U.S. households. Nielsen VideoScan sales numbers showed that for some titles, such as 20th Century Fox's Hitman, up to 14% of total disc sales were from Blu-ray, although the average Blu-ray sales for the first half of the year were only around 5%. In December 2008, the Blu-ray Disc version of The Dark Knight sold 600,000 copies on the first day of its launch in the United States, Canada, and the United Kingdom.[59] A week after the launch, The Dark Knight BD had sold over 1.7 million copies worldwide, making it the first Blu-ray Disc title to sell over a million copies in the first week of release.[60]\\r\\nAccording to Singulus Technologies AG, Blu-ray is being adopted faster than the DVD format was at a similar period in its development. This conclusion was based on the fact that Singulus Technologies has received orders for 21 Blu-ray dual-layer machines during the first quarter of 2008, while 17 DVD machines of this type were made in the same period in 1997.[63] According to GfK Retail and Technology, in the first week of November 2008, sales of Blu-ray recorders surpassed DVD recorders in Japan.[64] According to the Digital Entertainment Group, the number of Blu-ray Disc playback devices (both set-top box and game console) sold in the U.S. had reached 28.5 million by the end of 2010.[62]\\r\\nBlu-ray faces competition from video on demand[65] and from new technologies that allow access to movies on any format or device, such as Digital Entertainment Content Ecosystem or Disney's Keychest.[66] Some commentators have suggested that renting Blu-ray will play a vital part in keeping the technology affordable while allowing it to move forward.[67] In an effort to increase sales, studios are releasing movies in combo packs with Blu-ray Discs and DVDs as well as digital copies that can be played on computers and mobile devices. Some are released on \\"flipper\\" discs with Blu-ray on one side and DVD on the other. Other strategies are to release movies with the special features only on Blu-ray Discs and none on DVDs.\\r\\nThe Holographic Versatile Disc (HVD), described in the ECMA-377 standard, has been in development by The Holography System Development (HSD) Forum using a green writing/reading laser (532?nm) and a red positioning/addressing laser (650?nm). It is to offer MPEG-2, MPEG-4 AVC (H.264), HEVC (H.265), and VC-1 encoding, supporting a maximum storage capacity of 6TB.[68] No systems corresponding to the Ecma International HVD standard have been released.[69] Because the Blu-ray Disc format is upgradable it poses challenges to the adoption of the HVD format. 4K Blu-ray discs and players became available in the first quarter of 2016, having a storage capacity of up to 100?GB.[70][71]\\r\\nAlthough the Blu-ray Disc specification has been finalized, engineers continue to work on advancing the technology. By 2005, quad-layer (128?GB) discs had been demonstrated on a drive with modified optics[72] and standard unaltered optics.[73] Hitachi stated that such a disc could be used to store 7?hours of 32?Mbit/s video (HDTV) or 3?hours and 30?minutes of 64?Mbit/s video (Ultra high definition television). In August 2006, TDK announced that they had created a working experimental Blu-ray Disc capable of holding 200?GB of data on a single side, using six 33?GB data layers.[74]\\r\\nAlso, behind closed doors at CES 2007, Ritek revealed that they had successfully developed a High Definition optical disc process that extends the disc capacity to ten layers, which increases the capacity of the discs to 250?GB. However, they noted that the major obstacle is that current read/write technology does not allow additional layers.[75] JVC has developed a three-layer technology that allows putting both standard-definition DVD data and HD data on a BD/(standard) DVD combination.[76] This would have enabled the consumer to purchase a disc that can be played on DVD players and can also reveal its HD version when played on a BD player.[77] Japanese optical disc manufacturer Infinity announced the first \\"hybrid\\" Blu-ray Disc/(standard) DVD combo, to be released February 18, 2009. This disc set of the TV series \\"Code Blue\\" featured four hybrid discs containing a single Blu-ray Disc layer (25?GB) and two DVD layers (9?GB) on the same side of the disc.[78]\\r\\nIn January 2007, Hitachi showcased a 100?GB Blu-ray Disc, consisting of four layers containing 25?GB each.[79] Unlike TDK and Panasonic's 100?GB discs, they claim this disc is readable on standard Blu-ray Disc drives that are currently in circulation, and it is believed that a firmware update is the only requirement to make it readable to current players and drives.[80] In December 2008, Pioneer Corporation unveiled a 400?GB Blu-ray Disc (containing 16 data layers, 25?GB each) that will be compatible with current players after a firmware update. Its planned launch was in the 2009ÿ10 time frame for ROM and 2010ÿ13 for rewritable discs. Ongoing development was underway to create a 1?TB Blu-ray Disc.[81]\\r\\nAt CES 2009, Panasonic unveiled the DMP-B15, the first portable Blu-ray Disc player, and Sharp introduced the LC-BD60U and LC-BD80U series, the first LCD HDTVs with integrated Blu-ray Disc players. Sharp has also announced that they will sell HDTVs with integrated Blu-ray Disc recorders in the United States by the end of 2009. Set-top box recorders were not being sold in the U.S. for fear of unauthorized copying. However, personal computers with Blu-ray recorder drives were available. On January 1, 2010, Sony, in association with Panasonic, announced plans to increase the storage capacity on their Blu-ray Discs from 25?GB to 33.4?GB via a technology called i-MLSE (Maximum likelihood Sequence Estimation). The higher-capacity discs, according to Sony, would be readable on existing Blu-ray Disc players with a firmware upgrade. No date was set to include the increased space, although in 2010 Blu-ray.com reported that \\"it will likely happen sometime later this year.\\"[82]\\r\\nOn July 20, 2010, the research team of Sony and Japanese Tohoku University announced the joint development of a blue-violet laser,[83] to help create Blu-ray discs with a capacity of 1 TB using only two layers (and potentially more than 1 TB with additional layering). By comparison, the first blue laser was invented in 1996, with the first prototype discs coming four years later. \\r\\nOn January 7, 2013, Sony announced that it would release \\"Mastered in 4K\\" Blu-ray Disc titles which are sourced at 4K and encoded at 1080p.[84] \\"Mastered in 4K\\" Blu-ray Disc titles can be played on existing Blu-ray Disc players and have a larger color space using xvYCC.[84][85] On January 14, 2013, Blu-ray Disc Association president, Andy Parsons, stated that a task force was created three months prior to conduct a study concerning an extension to the Blu-ray Disc specification that would add the ability to contain 4K Ultra HD video.[86][87]\\r\\nOn August 5, 2015, The Blu-ray Disc Association (BDA) announced it will commence licensing the Ultra HD Blu-ray format starting August 24, 2015. The Ultra HD Blu-ray format delivered high dynamic range content that significantly expanded the range between the brightest and darkest elements, expanded color range, high frame rate (up to 60fps) and up to 3840G2160 resolution, object-based sound formats, and an optional \\"digital bridge\\" feature. New players were required to play this format, which were able to play both DVDs, traditional Blu-rays and the new format. New Ultra HD Blu-ray discs hold up to 66?GB and 100?GB of data on dual and triple layer discs respectively.[88]\\r\\nWhile a DVD uses a 650?nm red laser, Blu-ray Disc uses a 405?nm \\"blue\\" laser diode. Note that even though the laser is called \\"blue\\", its color is actually in the violet range. The shorter wavelength can be focused to a smaller area, thus enabling it to read information recorded in pits that are less than half the size of those on a DVD, and can consequently be spaced more closely, resulting in a shorter track pitch, enabling a Blu-ray Disc to hold about five times the amount of information that can be stored on a DVD. The lasers are GaN (gallium nitride) laser diodes that produce 405?nm light directly, that is, without frequency doubling or other nonlinear optical mechanisms.[90] Conventional DVDs use 650?nm red lasers, and CDs use 780?nm near-infrared lasers.\\r\\nThe minimum \\"spot size\\" on which a laser can be focused is limited by diffraction and depends on the wavelength of the light and the numerical aperture of the lens used to focus it. By decreasing the wavelength, increasing the numerical aperture from 0.60 to 0.85, and making the cover layer thinner to avoid unwanted optical effects, designers can cause the laser beam to focus on a smaller spot, which effectively allows more information to be stored in the same area.[91] For Blu-ray Disc, the spot size is 580?nm.[92] This allows a reduction of the pit size from 400?nm for DVD to 150?nm for Blu-ray Disc, and of the track pitch from 740?nm to 320?nm.[91] See Compact Disc for information on optical discs' physical structure. In addition to the optical improvements, Blu-ray Discs feature improvements in data encoding that further increase the amount of content that can be stored.[93]\\r\\nSince the Blu-ray Disc data layer is closer to the surface of the disc compared to the DVD standard, it was more vulnerable to scratches in early designs.[94] The first discs were therefore housed in cartridges for protection, resembling Professional Discs introduced by Sony in 2003. Using a cartridge would increase the price of an already expensive medium, so designers chose hard-coating of the pickup surface instead. TDK was the first company to develop a working scratch-protection coating for Blu-ray Discs, naming it Durabis. In addition, both Sony's and Panasonic's replication methods include proprietary hard-coat technologies. Sony's rewritable media are spin-coated, using a scratch-resistant and antistatic coating. Verbatim's recordable and rewritable Blu-ray Discs use their own proprietary technology, called Hard Coat.[95]\\r\\nThe Blu-ray Disc specification requires the testing of resistance to scratches by mechanical abrasion.[91] In contrast, DVD media are not required to be scratch-resistant, but since development of the technology, some companies, such as Verbatim, implemented hard-coating for more expensive lines of recordable DVDs.\\r\\nThe table shows the speeds available. Even the lowest speed (1x) is sufficient to play and record real-time 1080p video; the higher speeds are relevant for general data storage and more sophisticated handling of video.\\r\\nThe usable data rate of a Blu-ray Disc drive can be limited by the capacity of the drive's data interface. With a USB 2.0 interface, the maximum exploitable drive speed is 288?Mbit/s or 36?MB/s (also called 8G speed).[96] A USB 3.0 interface (with proper cabling) does not have this limitation,[97] nor do even the oldest version of Serial ATA (SATA) nor the latest Parallel ATA standards.[98] Blu-ray drives that are integrated into a computer (as opposed to physically separate and connected via a cable) typically have a SATA interface.[99]\\r\\nPre-recorded Blu-ray Disc titles usually ship in packages similar to but slightly smaller (18.5?mm shorter and 2?mm thinner: 135?mm x 171.5?mm x 13?mm.[100]) than a standard DVD keep case, generally with the format prominently displayed in a horizontal stripe across the top of the case (blue for Blu-ray, red for PlayStation 3 Greatest Hits Games, and clear for PlayStation 3 regular games), clear dark blue for PlayStation 4 games and clear dark green for Xbox One games. Warren Osborn and The Seastone Media Group, LLC created the package that was adopted worldwide following the Blu-ray vs. HD DVD market adoption choice.[101]\\r\\nThe \\"Mini Blu-ray Disc\\" (also, \\"Mini-BD\\" and \\"Mini Blu-ray\\") is a compact 8?cm (~3?in)-diameter variant of the Blu-ray Disc that can store 7.8?GB of data in its single layer configuration, or 15.6?GB on a dual layer disc.[102] It is similar in concept to the MiniDVD and MiniCD. Recordable (BD-R) and rewritable (BD-RE) versions of Mini Blu-ray Disc have been developed specifically for compact camcorders and other compact recording devices.[103]\\r\\n\\"Blu-ray Disc recordable\\" refers to two optical disc formats that can be recorded with an optical disc recorder. BD-Rs can be written to once, whereas BD-REs can be erased and re-recorded multiple times. The current practical maximum speed for Blu-ray Discs is about 12G. Higher speeds of rotation (10,000+ rpm) cause too much wobble for the discs to be written properly, as with the 20G and 52G maximum speeds, respectively, of standard DVDs and CDs. Since September 2007, BD-RE is also available in the smaller 8?cm Mini Blu-ray Disc size.[103][104]\\r\\nOn September 18, 2007, Pioneer and Mitsubishi codeveloped BD-R LTH (\\"Low to High\\" in groove recording), which features an organic dye recording layer that can be manufactured by modifying existing CD-R and DVD-R production equipment, significantly reducing manufacturing costs.[105] In February 2008, Taiyo Yuden, Mitsubishi, and Maxell released the first BD-R LTH Discs,[106] and in March 2008, Sony's PlayStation 3 officially gained the ability to use BD-R LTH Discs with the 2.20 firmware update.[107] In May 2009 Verbatim/Mitsubishi announced the industry's first 6X BD-R LTH media, which allows recording a 25?GB disc in about 16 minutes.[108] Unlike with the previous releases of 120?mm optical discs (i.e. CDs and standard DVDs), Blu-ray recorders hit the market almost simultaneously with Blu-ray's debut.\\r\\nThe BD9 format was proposed to the Blu-ray Disc Association by Warner Home Video as a cost-effective alternative to the 25/50?GB BD-ROM discs. The format was supposed to use the same codecs and program structure as Blu-ray Disc video but recorded onto less expensive 8.5?GB dual-layer DVD. This red-laser media could be manufactured on existing DVD production lines with lower costs of production than the 25/50?GB Blu-ray media.[109]\\r\\nUsage of BD9 for releasing content on \\"pressed\\" discs never caught on. With the end of the format war, manufacturers ramped production of Blu-ray Discs and lowered prices to compete with DVDs. On the other hand, the idea of using inexpensive DVD media became popular among individual users. A lower-capacity version of this format that uses single-layer 4.7?GB DVDs has been unofficially called BD5. Both formats are being used by individuals for recording high definition content in Blu-ray format onto recordable DVD media.[110][111] Despite the fact that the BD9 format has been adopted as part of the BD-ROM basic format, none of the existing Blu-ray player models explicitly claim to be able to read it. Consequently, the discs recorded in BD9 and BD5 formats are not guaranteed to play on standard Blu-ray Disc players. AVCHD and AVCREC also use inexpensive media like DVDs, but unlike BD9 and BD5 these formats have limited interactivity, codec types, and data rates. As of March 2011, BD9 was removed as an official BD-ROM disc.[112]\\r\\nThe BDXL format allows 100?GB and 128?GB write-once discs,[113][114] and 100?GB rewritable discs for commercial applications. It was defined in June 2010.[citation needed] BD-R 3.0 Format Specification (BDXL) defined a multi-layered disc recordable in BDAV format with the speed of 2G and 4G, capable of 100/128?GB and usage of UDF2.5/2.6.[115] BD-RE 4.0 Format Specification (BDXL) defined a multi-layered disc rewritable in BDAV with the speed of 2G and 4G, capable of 100?GB and usage of UDF2.5 as file system.[116]\\r\\nThe IH-BD (Intra-Hybrid Blu-ray) format includes a 25?GB rewritable layer (BD-RE) and a 25?GB write once layer (BD-ROM), designed to work with existing Blu-ray Discs.[113][114]\\r\\nBlu-ray Disc specifies the use of Universal Disk Format (UDF) 2.50 as a convergent friendly format for both PC and consumer electronics environments. It is used in the latest specifications of BD-ROM, BD-RE, and BD-R.[117][118][119] In the first BD-RE specification (defined in 2002), the BDFS (Blu-ray Disc File System) was used. The BD-RE 1.0 specification was defined mainly for the digital recording of high-definition television (HDTV) broadcast television. The BDFS was replaced by UDF 2.50 in the second BD-RE specification in 2005, in order to enable interoperability among consumer electronics Blu-ray recorders and personal computer systems. These optical disc recording technologies enabled PC recording and playback of BD-RE.[119][120][121] BD-R can use UDF 2.50/2.60.[122]\\r\\nThe Blu-ray Disc application for recording of digital broadcasting has been developed as System Description Blu-ray Rewritable Disc Format part 3 Audio Visual Basic Specifications (BDAV). The requirements related with computer file system have been specified in System Description Blu-ray Rewritable Disc Format part 2 File System Specifications version 1.0 (BDFS).[123] Initially, the BD-RE version 1.0 (BDFS) was specifically developed for recording of digital broadcasts using the Blu-ray Disc application (BDAV application). But these requirements are superseded by the Blu-ray Rewritable Disc File System Specifications version 2.0 (UDF) (a.k.a. RE 2.0) and Blu-ray Recordable Disc File System Specifications version 1.0 (UDF) (a.k.a. R 1.0). Additionally, a new application format, BDMV (System Description Blu-ray Disc Prerecorded Format part 3 Audio Visual Basic Specifications) for High Definition Content Distribution was developed for BD-ROM. The only file system developed for BDMV is the System Description Blu-ray Read-Only Disc Format part 2 File System Specifications version 1.0 (UDF) which defines the requirements for UDF 2.50.[119][123]\\r\\nAll BDMV application files are stored under a BDMV directory.[128][129][130][131]\\r\\nAudio, video, and other streams are multiplexed and stored on Blu-ray Discs in a container format based on the MPEG transport stream. It is also known as BDAV MPEG-2 transport stream and can use filename extension .m2ts.[128][132] Blu-ray Disc titles authored with menus are in the BDMV (Blu-ray Disc Movie) format and contain audio, video, and other streams in BDAV container.[133][134] There is also the BDAV (Blu-ray Disc Audio/Visual) format, the consumer oriented alternative to the BDMV format used for movie releases. The BDAV format is used on BD-REs and BD-Rs for audio/video recording.[134] BDMV format was later defined also for BD-RE and BD-R (in September 2006, in the third revision of BD-RE specification and second revision of BD-R specification).[117][118]\\r\\nBlu-ray Disc employs the MPEG transport stream recording method. That enables transport streams of digital broadcasts to be recorded as they are broadcast, without altering the format.[135] It also enables flexible editing of a digital broadcast that is recorded as is and where the data can be edited just by rewriting the playback stream. Although it is quite natural, a function for high-speed and easy-to-use retrieval is built in.[135][136] Blu-ray Disc Video use MPEG transport streams, compared to DVD's MPEG program streams. An MPEG transport stream contains one or more MPEG program streams, so this allows multiple video programs to be stored in the same file so they can be played back simultaneously (e.g. with \\"picture-in-picture\\" effect).\\r\\nThe BD-ROM specification mandates certain codec compatibilities for both hardware decoders (players) and movie software (content).[132][137] Windows Media Player does not come with the codecs required to play Blu-ray discs.[138]\\r\\nOriginally BD-ROMs stored video up to 1920G1080 pixel resolution at up to 60 (59.94) fields per second. Currently with UHD BD-ROM videos can be stored at a maximum of 3840G2160 pixel resolution at up to 60 (59.94) frames per second, progressively scanned. While most current Blu-ray players and recorders can read and write 1920G1080 video at the full 59.94p and 50p progressive format, new players for the UHD specifications will be able to read at 3840G2160 video at either 59.94p and 50p formats.\\r\\n^ a Interlaced formats are listed in fields per second.\\r\\n^ b MPEG-2 at 1440G1080 was previously not included in a draft version of the specification from March 2005.[141]\\r\\nFor video, all players are required to process H.262/MPEG-2 Part 2, H.264/MPEG-4 Part 10: AVC, and SMPTE VC-1.[142] BD-ROM titles with video must store video using one of the three mandatory formats; multiple formats on a single title are allowed. Blu-ray Disc allows video with a bit depth of 8-bits per color YCbCr with 4:2:0 chroma subsampling.[143][144] The choice of formats affects the producer's licensing/royalty costs as well as the title's maximum run time, due to differences in compression efficiency. Discs encoded in MPEG-2 video typically limit content producers to around two hours of high-definition content on a single-layer (25?GB) BD-ROM. The more-advanced video formats (VC-1 and MPEG-4 AVC) typically achieve a video run time twice that of MPEG-2, with comparable quality.\\r\\nMPEG-2 was used by many studios (including Paramount Pictures, which initially used the VC-1 format for HD DVD releases) for the first series of Blu-ray Discs, which were launched throughout 2006.[145] Modern releases are now often encoded in either MPEG-4 AVC or VC-1, allowing film studios to place all content on one disc, reducing costs and improving ease of use. Using these formats also frees a lot of space for storage of bonus content in HD (1080i/p), as opposed to the SD (480i/p) typically used for most titles. Some studios, such as Warner Bros., have released bonus content on discs encoded in a different format than the main feature title. For example, the Blu-ray Disc release of Superman Returns uses VC-1 for the feature film and MPEG-2 for some of its bonus content.[146] Today, Warner and other studios typically provide bonus content in the video format that matches the feature.\\r\\nFor audio, BD-ROM players are required to implement Dolby Digital (AC-3), DTS, and linear PCM. Players may optionally implement Dolby Digital Plus and DTS-HD High Resolution Audio as well as lossless formats Dolby TrueHD and DTS-HD Master Audio.[147] BD-ROM titles must use one of the mandatory schemes for the primary soundtrack. A secondary audiotrack, if present, may use any of the mandatory or optional codecs.\\r\\nFor users recording digital television programming, the recordable Blu-ray Disc standard's initial data rate of 36?Mbit/s is more than adequate to record high-definition broadcasts from any source (IPTV, cable/satellite, or terrestrial). BD Video movies have a maximum data transfer rate of 54?Mbit/s, a maximum AV bitrate of 48?Mbit/s (for both audio and video data), and a maximum video bit rate of 40?Mbit/s. This compares to HD DVD movies, which have a maximum data transfer rate of 36?Mbit/s, a maximum AV bitrate of 30.24?Mbit/s, and a maximum video bitrate of 29.4?Mbit/s.[149]\\r\\nAt the 2005 JavaOne trade show, it was announced that Sun Microsystems' Java cross-platform software environment would be included in all Blu-ray Disc players as a mandatory part of the standard.[150] Java is used to implement interactive menus on Blu-ray Discs, as opposed to the method used on DVD-video discs. DVDs use pre-rendered MPEG segments and selectable subtitle pictures, which are considerably more primitive and rarely seamless. At the conference, Java creator James Gosling suggested that the inclusion of a Java virtual machine, as well as network connectivity in some BD devices, will allow updates to Blu-ray Discs via the Internet, adding content such as additional subtitle languages and promotional features not included on the disc at pressing time.[151] This Java Version is called BD-J and is built on a profile of the Globally Executable MHP (GEM) standard; GEM is the worldwide version of the Multimedia Home Platform standard.\\r\\nThe BD-ROM specification defines four Blu-ray Disc player profiles, including an audio-only player profile (BD-Audio) that does not require video decoding or BD-J. All of the video-based player profiles (BD-Video) are required to have a full implementation of BD-J.\\r\\n^ a This is used for storing audio/video and title updates. It can either be built-in memory or removable media, such as a memory card or USB flash memory.\\r\\n^ b A secondary audio decoder is typically used for interactive audio and commentary.\\r\\n^ c Profile 3.0 is a separate audio-only player profile. The first Blu-ray Disc album to be released was Divertimenti, by record label Lindberg Lyd, and it has been confirmed to work on the PS3.[152][153]\\r\\n^ d Also known as Initial Standard profile.\\r\\n^ e Also known as Final Standard profile.\\r\\nOn November 2, 2007, the Grace Period Profile was superseded by Bonus View as the minimum profile for new BD-Video players released to the market.[154] When Blu-ray Disc software not authored with interactive features dependent on Bonus View or BD-Live hardware capabilities is played on Profile 1.0 players, it is able to play the main feature of the disc, but some extra features may not be available or will have limited capability.[155]\\r\\nThe biggest difference between Bonus View and BD-Live is that BD-Live requires the Blu-ray Disc player to have an Internet connection to access Internet-based content. BD-Live features have included Internet chats, scheduled chats with the director, Internet games, downloadable featurettes, downloadable quizzes, and downloadable movie trailers.[156][157][158] Note that while some Bonus View players may have an Ethernet port, these are used for firmware updates and are not used for Internet-based content.[159] In addition, Profile 2.0 also requires more local storage in order to handle this content.\\r\\nProfile 1.0 players are not eligible for Bonus View or BD-Live compliant upgrades and do not have the function or capability to access these upgrades, with the exception of the latest players and the PlayStation 3. Internet is required to use.[160][161][162]\\r\\nAs with the implementation of region codes for DVDs, Blu-ray Disc players sold in a specific geographical region are designed to play only discs authorized by the content provider for that region. This is intended to permit content providers (motion picture studios, television production company etc.) to do effective price differentiation between regions. According to the Blu-ray Disc Association, all Blu-ray Disc players and Blu-ray Disc-equipped computer systems are required to enforce regional coding. However, content providers need not use region playback codes.[164] Some current estimates suggest 70% of available [movie] Blu-ray Discs from the major studios are region-code-free and can, therefore, be played on any Blu-ray Disc player, in any region.[165]\\r\\nMovie distributors have different region coding policies. Among major U.S. studios, Walt Disney Pictures, Warner Bros., Paramount Pictures, Universal Studios, and Sony Pictures have released most of their titles region-free.[166][167][168][169][170][171] MGM and Lions Gate Entertainment have released a mix of region-free and region-coded titles.[172][173] 20th Century Fox has released most of their titles region-coded.[174] Vintage film restoration and distribution company The Criterion Collection uses US region coding in all Blu-ray releases.[175][176]\\r\\nThe Blu-ray Disc region coding scheme divides the world into three regions, labeled A, B, and C.\\r\\nIn circumvention of region coding restrictions, stand-alone Blu-ray Disc players are sometimes modified by third parties to allow for playback of Blu-ray Discs (and DVDs) with any region code.[177] Instructions (\\"hacks\\") describing how to reset the Blu-ray region counter of computer player applications to make them multi-region indefinitely are also regularly posted to video enthusiast websites and forums. Unlike DVD region codes, Blu-ray region codes are verified only by the player software, not by the optical drive's firmware.\\r\\nThe latest type of Blu-Ray disc, suitable for UltraHD content, are region-free.[178]\\r\\nThe Blu-ray Disc format employs several layers of digital rights management (DRM) which restrict the usage of the discs.[179][180] This has led to extensive criticism of the format by organizations opposed to DRM, such as the Free Software Foundation,[181] and consumers because new releases require player firmware updates to allow disc playback.[182][183]\\r\\nBlu-ray equipment is required to implement the High-bandwidth Digital Content Protection (HDCP) system to encrypt the data sent by players to rendering devices through physical connections. This is aimed at preventing the copying of copyrighted content as it travels across cables. Through a protocol flag in the media stream called the Image Constraint Token (ICT), a Blu-ray Disc can enforce its reproduction in a lower resolution whenever a full HDCP-compliant link is not used. In order to ease the transition to high definition formats, the adoption of this protection method was postponed until 2011.[184]\\r\\nThe Advanced Access Content System (AACS) is a standard for content distribution and digital rights management. It was developed by AS Licensing Administrator, LLC (AACS LA), a consortium that includes Disney, Intel, Microsoft, Panasonic, Warner Bros., IBM, Toshiba, and Sony. Since the appearance of the format on devices in 2006, several successful attacks have been made on it. The first known attack relied on the trusted client problem. In addition, decryption keys have been extracted from a weakly protected player (WinDVD). Since keys can be revoked in newer releases,[185] this is only a temporary attack, and new keys must continually be discovered in order to decrypt the latest discs.\\r\\nBD+ was developed by Cryptography Research Inc. and is based on their concept of Self-Protecting Digital Content.[186] BD+, effectively a small virtual machine embedded in authorized players, allows content providers to include executable programs on Blu-ray Discs. Such programs can:[179]\\r\\nIf a playback device manufacturer finds that its devices have been hacked, it can potentially release BD+ code that detects and circumvents the vulnerability. These programs can then be included in all new content releases.[187] The specifications of the BD+ virtual machine are available only to licensed device manufacturers. A list of licensed commercial adopters is available from the BD+ website.\\r\\nThe first titles using BD+ were released in October 2007. Since November 2007, versions of BD+ protection have been circumvented by various versions of the AnyDVD HD program.[188][189] Other programs known to be capable of circumventing BD+ protection are DumpHD (versions 0.6 and above, along with some supporting software),[190] MakeMKV,[191] and two applications from DVDFab (Passkey and HD Decrypter[192]).\\r\\nBD-ROM Mark is a small amount of cryptographic data that is stored separately from normal Blu-ray Disc data, aiming to prevent replication of the discs. The cryptographic data is needed to decrypt the copyrighted disc content protected by AACS.[193] A specially licensed piece of hardware is required to insert the ROM-Mark into the media during mastering. During replication, this ROM Mark is transferred together with the recorded data to the disc. In consequence, any copies of a disc made with a regular recorder will lack the ROM-Mark data and will be unreadable on standard players.\\r\\nThe Blu-ray Disc Association recommends but does not require that Blu-ray Disc drives be capable of reading standard DVDs and CDs, for backward compatibility.[194] Most Blu-ray Disc players are capable of reading both CDs and DVDs; however, a few of the early Blu-ray Disc players released in 2006, such as the Sony BDP-S1, could play DVDs but not CDs.[195][196][197]\\r\\nHigh Fidelity Pure Audio (HFPA) is a marketing initiative, spearheaded by the Universal Music Group, for audio-only Blu-ray optical discs. Launched in 2013 as a potential successor to the Compact disc, it has been compared with DVD-A and SACD, which had similar aims.\\r\\nAVCHD was originally developed as a high definition format for consumer tapeless camcorders. Derived from the Blu-ray Disc specification, AVCHD shares a similar random access directory structure but is restricted to lower audio and video bitrates, simpler interactivity, and the use of AVC-video and Dolby AC-3 (or linear PCM) audio. Being primarily an acquisition format, AVCHD playback is not recognized by all devices that play Blu-ray Disc. Nevertheless, many such devices are capable of playing AVCHD recordings from removable media, such as DVDs, SD/SDHC memory cards, \\"Memory Stick\\" cards, and hard disk drives.[198]\\r\\nAVCREC uses a BDAV container to record high definition content on conventional DVDs.[199] Presently AVCREC is tightly integrated with the Japanese ISDB broadcast standard and is not marketed outside of Japan. AVCREC is used primarily in set-top digital video recorders and in this regard is comparable to HD REC.\\r\\nThe Blu-ray Disc Association (BDA) created a task force made up of executives from the film industry and the consumer electronics and IT sectors to help define standards for putting 3D film and 3D television content on a Blu-ray Disc.[200] On December 17, 2009, the BDA officially announced 3D specs for Blu-ray Disc, allowing backward compatibility with current 2D Blu-ray players.[201] The BDA has said, \\"The Blu-ray 3D specification calls for encoding 3D video using the \\"Stereo High\\" profile defined by Multiview Video Coding (MVC), an extension to the ITU-T H.264 Advanced Video Coding (AVC) codec currently implemented by all Blu-ray Disc players. MPEG4-MVC compresses both left and right eye views with a typical 50% overhead compared to equivalent 2D content, and can provide full 1080p resolution backward compatibility with current 2D Blu-ray Disc players.\\"[202] This means the MVC (3D) stream is backward compatible with H.264/AVC (2D) stream, allowing older 2D devices and software to decode stereoscopic video streams, ignoring additional information for the second view.\\r\\nSony added Blu-ray 3D support to its PlayStation 3 console via a firmware upgrade on 21 September 2010.[203] The console had previously gained 3D gaming capability via an update on 21 April 2010.[204] Since the version 3.70 software update in August 9, 2011, the PlayStation 3 can play DTS-HD Master Audio and DTS-HD High Resolution Audio while playing 3D Blu-ray.[205] Dolby TrueHD is used on a small minority of Blu-ray 3D releases, and bitstreaming implemented in slim PlayStation 3 models only (original \\"fat\\" PS3 models decode internally and send audio as LPCM).[206]\\r\\nUltra HD Blu-ray is a new disc format, incompatible with existing Blu-Ray disc players, that supports 60fps 4K UHD video encoded in HEVC with 10-bit HDR and a wider color gamut.","input":"What type of file system is used by blu-ray discs?"},{"output":"second infarction","context":"Myocardial infarction complications may occur immediately following a heart attack (in the acute phase), or may need time to develop (a chronic problem). After an infarction, an obvious complication is a second infarction, which may occur in the domain of another atherosclerotic coronary artery, or in the same zone if there are any live cells left in the infarct.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nA myocardial infarction may compromise the function of the heart as a pump for the circulation, a state called heart failure. There are different types of heart failure; left- or right-sided (or bilateral) heart failure may occur depending on the affected part of the heart, and it is a low-output type of failure. If one of the heart valves is affected, this may cause dysfunction, such as mitral regurgitation in the case of left-sided coronary occlusion that disrupts the blood supply of the papillary muscles. The incidence of heart failure is particularly high in patients with diabetes and requires special management strategies.[1]\\r\\nMyocardial rupture is most common three to five days after myocardial infarction, commonly of small degree, but may occur one day to three weeks later. In the modern era of early revascularization and intensive pharmacotherapy as treatment for MI, the incidence of myocardial rupture is about 1% of all MIs.[2] This may occur in the free walls of the ventricles, the septum between them, the papillary muscles, or less commonly the atria. Rupture occurs because of increased pressure against the weakened walls of the heart chambers due to heart muscle that cannot pump blood out effectively. The weakness may also lead to ventricular aneurysm, a localized dilation or ballooning of the heart chamber.\\r\\nRisk factors for myocardial rupture include completion of infarction (no revascularization performed), female sex, advanced age, and a lack of a previous history of myocardial infarction.[2] In addition, the risk of rupture is higher in individuals who are revascularized with a thrombolytic agent than with PCI.[3][4] The shear stress between the infarcted segment and the surrounding normal myocardium (which may be hypercontractile in the post-infarction period) makes it a nidus for rupture.[5]\\r\\nRupture is usually a catastrophic event that may result a life-threatening process known as cardiac tamponade, in which blood accumulates within the pericardium or heart sac, and compresses the heart to the point where it cannot pump effectively. Rupture of the intraventricular septum (the muscle separating the left and right ventricles) causes a ventricular septal defect with shunting of blood through the defect from the left side of the heart to the right side of the heart, which can lead to right ventricular failure as well as pulmonary overcirculation. Rupture of the papillary muscle may also lead to acute mitral regurgitation and subsequent pulmonary edema and possibly even cardiogenic shock.\\r\\nSince the electrical characteristics of the infarcted tissue change (see pathophysiology section), arrhythmias are a frequent complication.[6] The re-entry phenomenon may cause rapid heart rates (ventricular tachycardia and even ventricular fibrillation), and ischemia in the electrical conduction system of the heart may cause a complete heart block (when the impulse from the sinoatrial node, the normal cardiac pacemaker, does not reach the heart chambers).[7][8]\\r\\nAs a reaction to the damage of the heart muscle, inflammatory cells are attracted. The inflammation may reach out and affect the heart sac. This is called pericarditis. In Dressler's syndrome, this occurs several weeks after the initial event.\\r\\nA complication that may occur in the acute setting soon after a myocardial infarction or in the weeks following is cardiogenic shock. Cardiogenic shock is defined as a hemodynamic state in which the heart cannot produce enough of a cardiac output to supply an adequate amount of oxygenated blood to the tissues of the body.\\r\\nWhile the data on performing interventions on individuals with cardiogenic shock is sparse, trial data suggests a long-term mortality benefit in undergoing revascularization if the individual is less than 75 years old and if the onset of the acute myocardial infarction is less than 36 hours and the onset of cardiogenic shock is less than 18 hours.[9] If the patient with cardiogenic shock is not going to be revascularized, aggressive hemodynamic support is warranted, with insertion of an intra-aortic balloon pump if not contraindicated.[9] If diagnostic coronary angiography does not reveal a culprit blockage that is the cause of the cardiogenic shock, the prognosis is poor.[9]","input":"What is the most common complication of acute myocardial infarction?"},{"output":"Mandarin","context":"Chinese, also known as Sinitic,[a] is a branch of the Sino-Tibetan language family consisting of hundreds of local language varieties, many of which are not mutually intelligible. The differences are similar to those within the Romance languages, with variation particularly strong in the more rugged southeast. These varieties, often called \\"dialects\\", have been classified into seven to ten groups, the largest being Mandarin (e.g. Beijing dialect), Wu (e.g. Shanghainese), Min (e.g. Hokkien), and Yue (e.g. Cantonese).\\r\\nChinese varieties differ most in their phonology, and to a lesser extent in vocabulary and syntax. Southern varieties tend to have fewer initial consonants than northern and central varieties, but more often preserve the Middle Chinese final consonants. All have phonemic tones, with northern varieties tending to have fewer distinctions than southern ones. Many have tone sandhi, with the most complex patterns in the coastal area from Zhejiang to eastern Guangdong.\\r\\nStandard Chinese takes its phonology from the Beijing dialect, with vocabulary from the Mandarin group and grammar based on literature in the modern written vernacular. It is the sole official language of both China and Taiwan, one of the four official languages of Singapore, and one of the six official languages of the United Nations.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nAt the end of the 2nd millennium BC, a form of Chinese was spoken in a compact area around the lower Wei River and middle Yellow River. From there it expanded eastwards across the North China Plain to Shandong and then south into the valley of the Yangtze River and beyond to the hills of south China. As the language spread, it replaced formerly dominant languages in those areas, and regional differences grew. Simultaneously, especially in periods of political unity, there was a tendency to promote a central standard to facilitate communication between people from different regions.[4]\\r\\nThe first evidence of dialectal variation is found in texts from the Spring and Autumn period (722ÿ479 BC). At that time, the Zhou royal domain, though no longer politically powerful, still defined standard speech.[5] The Fangyan (early 1st century AD) is devoted to differences in vocabulary between regions.[6] Commentaries from the Eastern Han period (first two centuries AD) contain much discussion of local variations in pronunciation. The Qieyun rhyme book (601 AD) noted wide variation in pronunciation between regions, and set out to define a standard pronunciation for reading the classics.[7] This standard, known as Middle Chinese, is believed to be a diasystem based on the reading traditions of northern and southern capitals.[8]\\r\\nThe North China Plain provided few barriers to migration, leading to relative linguistic homogeneity over a wide area in northern China. In contrast, the mountains and rivers of southern China have spawned the other six major groups of Chinese languages, with great internal diversity, particularly in Fujian.[9][10]\\r\\nUntil the mid-20th century, most Chinese people spoke only their local language. As a practical measure, officials of the Ming and Qing dynasties carried out the administration of the empire using a common language based on Mandarin varieties, known as Gunhu (?, literally \\"speech of officials\\"). Knowledge of this language was thus essential for an official career, but it was never formally defined.[11]\\r\\nIn the early years of the Republic of China, Literary Chinese was replaced as the written standard by written vernacular Chinese, which was based on northern dialects. In the 1930s a standard national language was adopted, with its pronunciation based on the Beijing dialect, but with vocabulary also drawn from other Mandarin varieties.[12] It is the official spoken language of the People's Republic of China and of the Republic of China governing Taiwan, and one of the official languages of Singapore.\\r\\nStandard Mandarin Chinese now dominates public life in mainland China, and is much more widely studied than any other variety of Chinese.[13] Outside China and Taiwan, the only varieties of Chinese commonly taught in university courses are Standard Mandarin and Cantonese.[14]\\r\\nChinese has been likened to the Romance languages of Europe, the modern descendents of Latin. In both cases, the ancestral language was spread by imperial expansion over substrate languages 2000 years ago, by the QinÿHan empire in China and the Roman Empire in Europe. In Western Europe, Medieval Latin remained the standard for scholarly and administrative writing for centuries, and influenced local varieties, as did Literary Chinese in China. In both Europe and China, local forms of speech diverged from the written standard and from each other, producing extensive dialect continua, with widely separated varieties being mutually unintelligible.[14][15]\\r\\nOn the other hand, there are major differences. In China, political unity was restored in the late 6th century (by the Sui dynasty) and has persisted (with interludes of division) until the present day. Meanwhile, Europe remained fragmented and developed numerous independent states. Vernacular writing, facilitated by the alphabet, supplanted Latin, and these states developed their own standard languages. In China, however, Literary Chinese maintained its monopoly on formal writing until the start of the 20th century. The logographic writing, read with varying local pronunciations, continued to serve as a source of vocabulary and idioms for the local varieties. The new national standard, Vernacular Chinese, the written counterpart of spoken Standard Chinese, is also used as a literary form by speakers of all varieties.[16][17]\\r\\nDialectologist Jerry Norman estimated that there are hundreds of mutually unintelligible varieties of Chinese.[18] These varieties form a dialect continuum, in which differences in speech generally become more pronounced as distances increase, although there are also some sharp boundaries.[19] However, the rate of change in mutual intelligibility varies immensely depending on region. For example, the varieties of Mandarin spoken in all three northeastern Chinese provinces are mutually intelligible, but in the province of Fujian, where Min varieties predominate, the speech of neighbouring counties or even villages may be mutually unintelligible.[20]\\r\\nProportions of first-language speakers[21]\\r\\nClassifications of Chinese varieties in the late 19th century and early 20th century were based on impressionistic criteria. They often followed river systems, which were historically the main routes of migration and communication in southern China.[22] The first scientific classifications, based primarily on the evolution of Middle Chinese voiced initials, were produced by Wang Li in 1936 and Li Fang-Kuei in 1937, with minor modifications by other linguists since.[23] The conventionally accepted set of seven dialect groups first appeared in the second edition of Yuan Jiahua's dialectology handbook (1961):[24][25]\\r\\nThe Language Atlas of China (1987) follows a classification of Li Rong, distinguishing three further groups:[38][39]\\r\\nSome varieties remain unclassified, including the Danzhou dialect of northwestern Hainan, Waxiang, spoken in a small strip of land in western Hunan, and Shaozhou Tuhua, spoken in the border regions of Guangdong, Hunan, and Guangxi.[44] This region is an area of great linguistic diversity but has not yet been conclusively described.[citation needed]\\r\\nMost of the vocabulary of the Bai language of Yunnan appears to be related to Chinese words, though many are clearly loans from the last few centuries. Some scholars have suggested that it represents a very early branching from Chinese, while others argue that it is a more distantly related Sino-Tibetan language overlaid with two millennia of loans.[45][46][47]\\r\\nJerry Norman classified the traditional seven dialect groups into three larger groups: Northern (Mandarin), Central (Wu, Gan, and Xiang) and Southern (Hakka, Yue, and Min). He argued that the Southern Group is derived from a standard used in the Yangtze valley during the Han dynasty (206 BC ÿ 220 AD), which he called Old Southern Chinese, while the Central group was transitional between the Northern and Southern groups.[48] Some dialect boundaries, such as between Wu and Min, are particularly abrupt, while others, such as between Mandarin and Xiang or between Min and Hakka, are much less clearly defined.[19]\\r\\nScholars account for the transitional nature of the central varieties in terms of wave models. Iwata argues that innovations have been transmitted from the north across the Huai River to the Lower Yangtze Mandarin area and from there southeast to the Wu area and westwards along the Yangtze River valley and thence to southwestern areas, leaving the hills of the southeast largely untouched.[49]\\r\\nA 2007 study compared fifteen major urban dialects on the objective criteria of lexical similarity and regularity of sound correspondences, and subjective criteria of intelligibility and similarity. Most of these criteria show a top-level split with Northern, New Xiang, and Gan in one group and Min (samples at Fuzhou, Xiamen, Chaozhou), Hakka, and Yue in the other group. The exception was phonological regularity, where the one Gan dialect (Nanchang Gan) was in the Southern group and very close to Hakka,[which?] and the deepest phonological difference was between Wenzhounese (the southernmost Wu dialect) and all other dialects.[50]\\r\\nThe study did not find clear splits within the Northern and Central areas:\\r\\nThe two Wu dialects occupied an intermediate position, closer to the Northern/New Xiang/Gan group in lexical similarity and strongly closer in subjective intelligibility but closer to Min/Hakka/Yue in phonological regularity and subjective similarity, except that Wenzhou was farthest from all other dialects in phonological regularity. The two Wu dialects were close to each other in lexical similarity and subjective similarity but not in mutual intelligibility, where Suzhou was actually closer to Northern/Xiang/Gan than to Wenzhou.\\r\\nIn the Southern subgroup, Hakka and Yue grouped closely together on the three lexical and subjective measures but not in phonological regularity. The Min dialects showed high divergence, with Min Fuzhou (Eastern Min) grouped only weakly with the Southern Min dialects of Xiamen and Chaozhou on the two objective criteria and was actually slightly closer to Hakka and Yue on the subjective criteria.\\r\\nLocal varieties from different areas of China are often mutually unintelligible, differing at least as much as different Romance languages.[51][52] These varieties form the Sinitic branch of the Sino-Tibetan language family (with Bai sometimes being included in this grouping).[53] Because speakers share a standard written form, and have a common cultural heritage with long periods of political unity, the varieties are popularly perceived among native speakers as variants of a single Chinese language,[54] and this is also the official position.[55] Conventional English-language usage in Chinese linguistics is to use dialect for the speech of a particular place (regardless of status) while regional groupings like Mandarin and Wu are called dialect groups.[18] ISO 639-3 follows the Ethnologue in assigning language codes to eight of the top-level groups listed above (all but Min and Pinghua) and five subgroups of Min.[56] Other linguists choose to refer to the major groupings as languages.[52]\\r\\nIn Chinese, the term fngyn[b] is used for any regional subdivision of Chinese, from the speech of a village to major branches such as Mandarin and Wu. Linguists writing in Chinese often qualify the term to distinguish different levels of classification. All these terms have customarily been translated into English as dialect, a practice that has been criticized as confusing. The neologisms regionalect and topolect have been proposed as alternative renderings of fngyn.[58][c]\\r\\nThe only varieties usually recognized as languages in their own right are Dungan and Taz.[citation needed] This is mostly due to political reasons[citation needed] as they are spoken in the former Soviet Union and are usually not written in Han characters but in Cyrillic. Various mixed languages, particularly those spoken by ethnic minorities, are also referred to as languages such as Tangwang language and E language. Some people and institutions may also allude to Taiwanese language, Cantonese language, and Hakka languages. The Taiwanese Ministry of Education uses the terms \\"Minnan language\\" and \\"Taiwan Minnan language\\".[60]\\r\\nThe usual unit of analysis is the syllable, traditionally analysed as consisting of an initial consonant, a final and a tone.[61] In general, southern varieties have fewer initial consonants than northern and central varieties, but more often preserve the Middle Chinese final consonants.[62] Some varieties, such as Cantonese and the Shanghai dialect, include syllabic nasals as independent syllables.[63]\\r\\nIn the 42 varieties surveyed in the Great Dictionary of Modern Chinese Dialects, the number of initials (including a zero initial) ranges from 15 in some southern dialects to a high of 35 in the dialect of Chongming Island, Shanghai.[64]\\r\\nThe initial system of the Fuzhou dialect of northern Fujian is a minimal example.[67] With the exception of /?/, which is often merged with the zero initial, the initials of this dialect are present in all Chinese varieties, although several varieties do not distinguish /n/ from /l/. However, most varieties have additional initials, due to a combination of innovations and retention of distinctions from Middle Chinese:\\r\\nChinese finals may be analysed as an optional medial glide, a main vowel and an optional coda.[72]\\r\\nConservative vowel systems, such as those of Gan dialects, have high vowels /i/, /u/ and /y/, which also function as medials, mid vowels /e/ and /o/, and a low /a/-like vowel.[73] In other dialects, including Mandarin dialects, /o/ has merged with /a/, leaving a single mid vowel with a wide range of allophones.[74] Many dialects, particularly in northern and central China, have apical or retroflex vowels, which are syllabic fricatives derived from high vowels following sibilant initials.[75] In many Wu dialects, vowels and final glides have monophthongized, producing a rich inventory of vowels in open syllables.[76] Reduction of medials is common in Yue dialects.[77]\\r\\nThe Middle Chinese codas, consisting of glides /j/ and /w/, nasals /m/, /n/ and /?/, and stops /p/, /t/ and /k/, are best preserved in southern dialects, particularly Yue dialects.[35] In Jin, Lower Yangtze Mandarin and Wu dialects, the stops have merged as a final glottal stop, while in most northern varieties they have disappeared.[78] In Mandarin dialects final /m/ has merged with /n/, while some central dialects have a single nasal coda, in some cases realized as a nasalization of the vowel.[79]\\r\\nAll varieties of Chinese, like neighbouring languages in the Mainland Southeast Asia linguistic area, have phonemic tones. Each syllable may be pronounced with between three and seven distinct pitch contours, denoting different morphemes. For example, the Beijing dialect distinguishes m (g \\"mother\\"), m (^ \\"hemp\\"), mҊ ( \\"horse\\") and m ( \\"to scold\\"). The number of tonal contrasts varies between dialects, with northern dialects tending to have fewer distinctions than southern ones.[80] Many dialects have tone sandhi, in which the pitch contour of a syllable is affected by the tones of adjacent syllables in a compound word of phrase.[81] This process is so extensive in Shanghainese that the tone system is reduced to a pitch accent system much like modern Japanese.\\r\\nThe tonal categories of modern varieties can be related by considering their derivation from the four tones of Middle Chinese, though cognate tonal categories in different dialects are often realized as quite different pitch contours.[82] Middle Chinese had a three-way tonal contrast in syllables with vocalic or nasal endings. The traditional names of the tonal categories are \\"level\\"/\\"even\\" ( png), \\"rising\\" (f shҊng) and \\"departing\\"/\\"going\\" (?? q). Syllables ending in a stop consonant /p/, /t/ or /k/ (checked syllables) had no tonal contrasts but were traditionally treated as a fourth tone category, \\"entering\\" (?? r), corresponding to syllables ending in nasals /m/, /n/, or /?/.[83]\\r\\nThe tones of Middle Chinese, as well as similar systems in neighbouring languages, experienced a tone split conditioned by syllabic onsets. Syllables with voiced initials tended to be pronounced with a lower pitch, and by the late Tang Dynasty, each of the tones had split into two registers conditioned by the initials, known as \\"upper\\" (w/? yؐn) and \\"lower\\" (/? yng). When voicing was lost in all dialects except the Wu and Old Xiang groups, this distinction became phonemic, yielding eight tonal categories, with a six-way contrast in unchecked syllables and a two-way contrast in checked syllables. Cantonese maintains these tones and has developed an additional distinction in checked syllables as well as one in unchecked syllables. (The latter distinction has disappeared again in many varieties.) However, most Chinese varieties have reduced the number of tonal distinctions. For example, in Mandarin, the tones resulting from the split of Middle Chinese rising and departing tones merged, leaving four tones. Furthermore, final stop consonants disappeared in most Mandarin dialects, and such syllables were distributed amongst the four remaining tones.[84]\\r\\nIn Wu, voiced obstruents were retained, and the tone split never became phonemic: the higher-pitched allophones occur with initial voiceless consonants, and the lower-pitched allophones occur with initial voiced consonants.[88] (Traditional Chinese classification nonetheless counts these as different tones.) Most Wu dialects retain the tone categories of Middle Chinese, but in Shanghainese several of these have merged.\\r\\nMany Chinese varieties exhibit tone sandhi, in which the realization of a tone varies depending on the context of the syllable. For example, in Standard Chinese a third tone changes to a second tone when followed by another third tone.[92] Particularly complex sandhi patterns are found in Wu dialects and coastal Min dialects.[93] In Shanghainese, the tone of all syllables in a word is determined by the tone of the first, so that Shanghainese has word rather than syllable tone.\\r\\nMost morphemes in Chinese varieties are monosyllables descended from Old Chinese words, and have cognates in all varieties:\\r\\nOld Chinese had two families of negatives starting with *p- and *m-, respectively.[95] Northern and Central varieties tend to use a word from the first family, cognate with Beijing pu5 , as the ordinary negator.[96] A word from the second family is used as an existential negator \\"have not\\", as in Beijing mei2 ?] and Shanghai m2.[97] In Mandarin varieties this word is also used for \\"not yet\\", whereas in Wu and other groups a different form is typically used.[98] In Southern varieties, negators tend to come from the second family. The ordinary negators in these varieties are all derived from a syllabic nasal *m?, though it has a level tone in Hakka and Yue and a rising tone in Min. Existential negators derive from a proto-form *mau, though again the tonal category varies between groups.[99]\\r\\nFirst- and second-person pronouns are cognate across all varieties. For third-person pronouns, Jin, Mandarin, and Xiang varieties have cognate forms, but other varieties generally use forms that originally had a velar or glottal initial:[100]\\r\\nSouthern varieties also include distinctive substrata of vocabulary of non-Chinese origin. Some of these words may have come from TaiÿKadai and Austroasiatic languages.[108]\\r\\nThe Min languages are often regarded as furthest removed linguistically from Standard Chinese in phonology, grammar, and vocabulary. Historically, the Min languages were the first to diverge from the rest of the Chinese languages (see the discussion of historical Chinese phonology for more details). The Min languages are also the group with the greatest amount of internal diversity and are often regarded as consisting of at least five separate languages, e.g. Northern Min, Southern Min, Central Min, Eastern Min, and Puxian Min.\\r\\nTo illustrate, in Taiwanese (a variety of Hokkien, a Min language) to express the idea that one is feeling a little ill (\\"I am not feeling well.\\"), one might say (in Pe?h-o-jؐ)\\r\\nGo k-kؐ lang  tm-po?h- b? s܇ng-khoi.\\r\\n\\r\\nģ?s?oߓkzבģ?s~z?\\r\\nwhich, when translated cognate-by-cognate into Mandarin, would be spoken as an awkward or semantically unrecognizable sentence:\\r\\nW jij rn yu dnb܇ w~ shuҊngkui.\\r\\n\\r\\nCould roughly be interpreted as:\\r\\nMy family's own person is weakly not feeling refreshed.\\r\\nWhereas when spoken colloquially in Mandarin, one would either say,\\r\\nW zj yu yؐdiҊn b shfu.\\r\\n\\r\\n\`?czב\`\\r\\n\\r\\nI myself feel a bit uncomfortable.\\r\\nor\\r\\nW yu yؐdiҊn b shfu.\\r\\n\\r\\n?czב\\r\\n\\r\\nI feel a bit uncomfortable.\\r\\nthe latter omitting the reflexive pronoun (zj), not usually needed in Mandarin.\\r\\nSome people, particularly in northern China, would say,\\r\\nW yu diҊnr b shfu.\\r\\n\\r\\n?c??zבǼ\\r\\n\\r\\nLiterally: I am [a] bit[DIM.] uncomfortable.\\r\\nIn southern China (not including Hong Kong and Macau), where the difference between Standard Chinese and local dialects is particularly pronounced, well-educated Chinese are generally fluent in Standard Chinese, and most people have at least a good passive knowledge of it, in addition to being native speakers of the local dialect. The choice of dialect varies based on the social situation. Standard Chinese is usually considered more formal and is required when speaking to a person who does not understand the local dialect. The local dialect (be it non-Standard Chinese or non-Mandarin altogether) is generally considered more intimate and is used among close family members and friends and in everyday conversation within the local area. Chinese speakers will frequently code switch between Standard Chinese and the local dialect. Parents will generally speak to their children in dialect, and the relationship between dialect and Mandarin appears to be mostly stable. Local languages give a sense of identity to local cultures.\\r\\nKnowing the local dialect is of considerable social benefit, and most Chinese who permanently move to a new area will attempt to pick up the local dialect. Learning a new dialect is usually done informally through a process of immersion and recognizing sound shifts. Generally the differences are more pronounced lexically than grammatically. Typically, a speaker of one dialect of Chinese will need about a year of immersion to understand the local dialect and about three to five years to become fluent in speaking it. Because of the variety of dialects spoken, there are usually few formal methods for learning a local dialect.\\r\\nDue to the variety in Chinese speech, Mandarin speakers from each area of China are very often prone to fuse or \\"translate\\" words from their local language into their Mandarin conversations. In addition, each area of China has its recognizable accents while speaking Mandarin. Generally, the nationalized standard form of Mandarin pronunciation is only heard on news and radio broadcasts. Even in the streets of Beijing, the flavour of Mandarin varies in pronunciation from the Mandarin heard on the media.\\r\\nWithin mainland China, there has been a persistent drive towards promoting the standard language (\\\\Фѻos; dl tuؐguҊng PѸtnghu); for instance, the education system is entirely Mandarin-medium from the second year onward. However, usage of local dialect is tolerated and socially preferred in many informal situations. In Hong Kong, colloquial Cantonese characters are never used in formal documents other than quoting witnesses' spoken statements during legal trials, and within the PRC a character set closer to Mandarin tends to be used. At the national level, differences in dialect generally do not correspond to political divisions or categories, and this has for the most part prevented dialect from becoming the basis of identity politics. Historically, many of the people who promoted Chinese nationalism were from southern China and did not natively speak the national standard language, and even leaders from northern China rarely spoke with the standard accent. For example, Mao Zedong often emphasized his Hunan origins in speaking, rendering much of what he said incomprehensible to many Chinese. One consequence of this is that China does not have a well-developed tradition of spoken political rhetoric, and most Chinese political works are intended primarily as written works rather than spoken works. Another factor that limits the political implications of dialect is that it is very common within an extended family for different people to know and use different dialects.\\r\\nBefore 1945, other than a small Japanese-speaking population, most of the population of Taiwan were Han Chinese, who spoke Taiwanese Hokkien or Hakka, with a minority of Taiwanese aborigines, who spoke Formosan languages.[109] When the Kuomintang retreated to the island after losing the Chinese Civil War in 1949, they brought a substantial influx of speakers of Northern Chinese, and viewed the use of Mandarin as part of their claim to be a legitimate government of the whole of China.[110] Education policy promoted the use of Mandarin over the local languages, and was implemented especially rigidly in elementary schools, with punishments and public humiliation for children using other languages at school.[110] From the 1970s, the government promoted adult education in Mandarin, required Mandarin for official purposes, and encouraged its increased use in broadcasting.[111] Over a 40-year period, these policies succeeded in spreading the use and prestige of Mandarin through society at the expense of the other languages.[112] They also aggravated social divisions, as Mandarin speakers found it difficult to find jobs in private companies but were favoured for government positions.[112] From the 1990s, Taiwanese native languages were offered in elementary and middle schools, first in Yilan county, then in other areas governed by elected Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) politicians, and finally throughout the island.[113]\\r\\nIn 1966, the Singaporean government implemented a policy of bilingual education, where Singaporean students learn both English and their designated native language, which was Mandarin for Chinese Singaporeans. The Goh Report, an evaluation of Singapore's education system by Goh Keng Swee, showed that less than 40% of the student population managed to attain minimum levels of competency in two languages.[114] It was later determined that the learning of Mandarin among Singaporean Chinese was hindered by home use of other Chinese varieties, such as Hokkien, Teochew, Cantonese and Hakka.[115][116] Hence, the government decided to rectify problems facing implementation of the bilingual education policy, by launching a campaign to promote Mandarin as a common language among the Chinese population, and to discourage use of other Chinese varieties.\\r\\nLaunched in 1979 by then Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew,[117] the campaign aimed to simplify the language environment for Chinese Singaporeans, improve communication between them, and create a Mandarin-speaking environment conducive to the successful implementation of the bilingual education programme. The initial goal of the campaign was for all young Chinese to stop speaking dialects in five years, and to establish Mandarin as the language of choice in public places within 10 years.[118][119] According to the government, for the bilingual policy to be effective, Mandarin should be spoken at home and should serve as the lingua franca among Chinese Singaporeans.[120] They also argued that Mandarin was more economically valuable, and speaking Mandarin would help Chinese Singaporeans retain their heritage, as Mandarin contains a cultural repository of values and traditions that are identifiable to all Chinese, regardless of dialect group.[121]\\r\\nWorks cited","input":"What is the most common dialect of chinese?"},{"output":"partially published in serial form in 1945ÿ1946 and as a novel in 1951","context":"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Catcher in the Rye is a story by J. D. Salinger, partially published in serial form in 1945ÿ1946 and as a novel in 1951.[3] A classic novel originally published for adults, it has since become popular with adolescent readers for its themes of teenage angst and alienation.[4][5] It has been translated into almost all of the world's major languages.[6]\\r\\nAround 1 million copies are sold each year, with total sales of more than 65 million books.[7] The novel's protagonist Holden Caulfield has become an icon for teenage rebellion.[8] The novel also deals with complex issues of innocence, identity, belonging, loss, and connection.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe novel was included on Time's 2005 list of the 100 best English-language novels written since 1923,[9] and it was named by Modern Library and its readers as one of the 100 best English-language novels of the 20th century.[10][11][12] In 2003, it was listed at #15 on the BBC's survey The Big Read.[13]\\r\\n\\r\\nHolden Caulfield, a teenager, is living in an unspecified institution in Southern California near Hollywood in 1951. Caulfield intends to live with his brother D.B, an author and World War II veteran whom Holden is angered at for becoming a screenwriter, one month after his discharge.  As he waits, Holden recalls the events of the previous Christmas.\\r\\n\\r\\nHolden begins his story at Pencey Preparatory Academy, an exclusive boarding school in Hagerstown, Pennsylvania, on the Saturday afternoon of the traditional football game with a rival school.  Holden has been expelled from Pencey due to poor work and is not to return after Christmas break, which begins the following Wednesday.  He plans to return home on that day so that he will not be present when his parents receive notice of his expulsion.  After forfeiting a fencing match in New York by forgetting the equipment aboard the subway, he is invited to the home of his history teacher, Mr. Spencer.  Spencer is a well-meaning but long-winded old man.  Spencer greets him and offers him advice, but embarrasses Holden by further criticizing Holden's work in his subject in a rude manner.\\r\\n\\r\\nHolden returns to his dorm wearing the new red hunting cap he bought in New York. His dorm neighbor Robert Ackley is one of the few students also missing the game.  Ackley, unpopular among his peers, disturbs Holden with his impolite questioning and mannerisms. Holden, who feels sorry for Ackley, tolerates his presence. Later, Holden agrees to write an English composition for his roommate, Ward Stradlater, who is leaving for a date.  However, Holden is distressed to learn that Stradlater's date is an old friend, Jane Gallagher, whom Holden had romantic feelings for and feels protective of. That night, Holden decides to go to a Cary Grant comedy with his best friend Mal Brossard and Ackley. Since Ackley and Mal had already seen the film, they end up just playing pinball and returning to Pencey. When Stradlater returns hours later, he fails to appreciate the deeply personal composition Holden wrote for him about the baseball glove of Holden's late brother Allie, and refuses to reveal whether he slept with Jane.  Enraged, Holden punches him, and Stradlater easily wins the ensuing fight. When Holden continues insulting him after the fight, Stradlater knocks him unconscious and leaves him with a bloody nose. After leaving for Ackley's room, Holden is disappointed when he treats him rudely. Fed up with the so-called \\"phonies\\" at Pencey Prep, Holden impulsively decides to leave Pencey early, sells his typewriter to earn money, and catches a train to Penn Station in New York. Holden intends to stay away from his home in a hotel until Wednesday, when his parents would have received news of his expulsion. Aboard the train, Holden meets the mother of a wealthy, obnoxious Pencey student named Ernest Morrow, and lies to her about himself and her son.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn a taxicab, Holden inquires with the driver about whether the ducks in the Central Park lagoon migrate during winter, a subject he brings up often, but the man barely responds.  Holden checks into the dilapidated Edmont Hotel.  He spends an evening dancing with three tourist women from Seattle in the hotel lounge and enjoys dancing with one, though is disappointed that he is unable to hold a conversation with them. Following an unpromising visit to Ernie's Nightclub in Greenwich Village, Holden becomes preoccupied with his internal angst and agrees to have a prostitute named Sunny visit his room. His attitude toward the girl changes the minute she enters the room; she seems about the same age as him. Holden becomes uncomfortable with the situation, and when he tells her all he wants to do is talk, she becomes annoyed and leaves. Even though he still paid her the right amount for her time, she returns with her pimp Maurice and demands more money.  Holden insults Maurice, and after Sunny takes the money from Holden's wallet, Maurice punches him in the stomach and leaves with Sunny. Afterwards, Holden imagines that he has been shot by Maurice, and pictures murdering him with an automatic pistol.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe next morning, Holden, becoming increasingly depressed and in need of personal connection, calls Sally Hayes, a familiar date. Although Holden claims that she is \\"the queen of all phonies\\", they agree to meet that afternoon to attend a play at the Biltmore Theater.  Holden shops for a special record, \\"Little Shirley Beans\\", for his 10-year-old sister Phoebe. He spots a small boy singing \\"If a body catch a body coming through the rye\\", which lifts his mood. Although Holden's date initially goes well, it soon sours after Sally introduces her friend George. After the play, Holden and Sally go ice skating at Rockefeller Center, where Holden suddenly begins ranting against society and frightens Sally. He impulsively invites Sally to run away with him that night to live in the wilderness of New England, but she is uninterested in his hastily conceived plan and declines. The conversation turns sour, and the two angrily part ways.\\r\\n\\r\\nHolden decides to meet his old classmate, a Columbia student named Carl Luce, for drinks at the Wicker Bar in the Seton Hotel. During the meeting, Holden annoys Carl with his fixation on sex. After Luce leaves, Holden gets drunk, awkwardly flirts with several adults, and calls an icy Sally. Exhausted and out of money, Holden wanders over to Central Park to investigate the ducks, breaking Phoebe's record on the way.  Nostalgically recalling his experience in elementary school and the unchanging dioramas in the Museum of Natural History that he enjoyed visiting as a child, Holden heads home to see Phoebe.  He sneaks into his parents' apartment while they are out, and wakes up Phoebe ÿ the only person with whom he seems to be able to communicate his true feelings. Although Phoebe is happy to see Holden, she quickly deduces that he has been expelled, and chastises him for his aimlessness and his apparent dislikes towards everything. When asked if he cares about anything, Holden shares a selfless fantasy he has been thinking about (based on a mishearing of Robert Burns's Comin' Through the Rye): he pictures himself as the sole guardian of thousands of children playing in a huge rye field on the edge of a cliff. His job is to catch the children if, in their abandon, they come close to falling off the brink; to be, in effect, the \\"catcher in the rye\\". Because of this misinterpretation, Holden believes that to be the \\"catcher in the rye\\" means to save children from losing their innocence.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen his mother returns home, Holden slips out and visits his former and much-admired English teacher, Mr. Antolini, who is now a New York University professor. Mr. Antolini expresses concern that Holden is headed for \\"a terrible fall\\" and advises him to begin applying himself. Although Holden is exhausted, he is courteous and considers his advice. Mr. Antolini also provides Holden with a place to sleep. Holden is upset when he wakes up in the night to find Mr. Antolini patting his head, which he interprets as a homosexual advance. Confused and uncertain, he leaves and spends the rest of the night in a waiting room at Grand Central Station, where he sinks further into despair and expresses regret over leaving Mr. Antolini. He spends most of Monday morning wandering Fifth Avenue.\\r\\n\\r\\nLosing hope of finding belonging or companionship in the city, Holden impulsively decides that he will head out west and live a reclusive lifestyle as a gas station attendant. He decides to see Phoebe at lunchtime to explain his plan and say farewell.  While visiting Phoebe's school to give a forged excuse note, Holden becomes quite annoyed by graffiti containing the word \\"fuck\\", and becomes distressed by the thought of children learning the word's meaning.  When he meets Phoebe at the Metropolitan Museum of Art, she arrives with a suitcase and asks to go with him, even though she was looking forward to acting as Benedict Arnold in a play that Friday. Holden refuses to let her come with him, which upsets Phoebe, so Holden decides not to leave after all. He tries to cheer her up by allowing her to skip school and taking her to the Central Park Zoo, but she remains angry with him. They eventually reach the zoo's carousel, where Phoebe reconciles with Holden after he buys her a ticket. Holden is finally filled with happiness and joy at the sight of Phoebe riding in the rain.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn a short epilogue, Holden briefly alludes to encountering his parents that night and \\"getting sick\\" (implying a tuberculosis diagnosis), mentioning that he will be attending another school in September.  Holden says that he doesn't want to tell anything more because, surprisingly, he has found himself missing his former classmates.  He warns the reader that telling others about their own experiences will lead them to miss the people who shared them.\\r\\n\\r\\nVarious older stories by Salinger contain characters similar to those in The Catcher in the Rye. While at Columbia University, Salinger wrote a short story called \\"The Young Folks\\" in Whit Burnett's class; one character from this story has been described as a \\"thinly penciled prototype of Sally Hayes\\". In November 1941 he sold the story \\"Slight Rebellion off Madison\\", which featured Holden Caulfield, to The New Yorker, but it wasn't published until December 21, 1946, due to World War II. The story \\"I'm Crazy\\", which was published in the December 22, 1945, issue of Collier's, contained material that was later used in The Catcher in the Rye. In 1946, The New Yorker accepted a 90-page manuscript about Holden Caulfield for publication, but Salinger later withdrew it.[14]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Catcher in the Rye is narrated in a subjective style from the point of view of Holden Caulfield, following his exact thought processes. There is flow in the seemingly disjointed ideas and episodes; for example, as Holden sits in a chair in his dorm, minor events, such as picking up a book or looking at a table, unfold into discussions about experiences.\\r\\n\\r\\nCritical reviews affirm that the novel accurately reflected the teenage colloquial speech of the time.[15] Words and phrases that appear frequently include:\\r\\n\\r\\nBruce Brooks held that Holden's attitude remains unchanged at story's end, implying no maturation, thus differentiating the novel from young adult fiction.[16]\\r\\nIn contrast, Louis Menand thought that teachers assign the novel because of the optimistic ending, to teach adolescent readers that \\"alienation is just a phase.\\"[17] While Brooks maintained that Holden acts his age, Menand claimed that Holden thinks as an adult, given his ability to accurately perceive people and their motives. Others highlight the dilemma of Holden's state, in between adolescence and adulthood.[18][19] Holden is quick to become emotional. \\"I felt sorry as hell for...\\" is a phrase he often uses. It is often said that Holden changes at the end, when he watches Phoebe on the carousel, and he talks about the golden ring and how it's good for kids to try and grab it.[18]\\r\\n\\r\\nPeter Beidler, in his A Reader's Companion to J. D. Salinger's \\"The Catcher in the Rye\\", identifies the movie that the prostitute \\"Sunny\\" refers to. In chapter 13 she says that in the movie a boy falls off a boat. The movie is Captains Courageous (1937), starring Spencer Tracy. Sunny says that Holden looks like the boy who fell off the boat. Beidler shows (page 28) a still of the boy, played by child-actor Freddie Bartholomew.\\r\\n\\r\\nEach Caulfield child has literary talent. D.B. writes screenplays in Hollywood; Holden also reveres D.B. for his writing skill (Holden's own best subject), but he also despises Hollywood industry-based movies, considering them the ultimate in \\"phony\\" as the writer has no space for his own imagination, and describes D.B.'s move to Hollywood to write for films as \\"prostituting himself\\"; Allie wrote poetry on his baseball glove; and Phoebe is a diarist.[20][not in citation given]\\r\\nThis \\"catcher in the rye\\" is an analogy for Holden, who admires in children attributes that he struggles to find in adults, like innocence, kindness, spontaneity, and generosity. Falling off the cliff could be a progression into the adult world that surrounds him and that he strongly criticizes. Later, Phoebe and Holden exchange roles as the \\"catcher\\" and the \\"fallen\\"; he gives her his hunting hat, the catcher's symbol, and becomes the fallen as Phoebe becomes the catcher.[21]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn their biography of Salinger, David Shields and Shane Salerno argue that: \\"The Catcher in the Rye can best be understood as a disguised war novel.\\" Salinger witnessed the horrors of World War II, but rather than writing a combat novel, Salinger, according to Shields and Salerno, \\"took the trauma of war and embedded it within what looked to the naked eye like a coming-of-age novel.\\"[22]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Catcher in the Rye has been listed as one of the best novels of the twentieth century. Shortly after its publication, writing for The New York Times, Nash K. Burger called it \\"an unusually brilliant novel,\\"[23] while James Stern wrote an admiring review of the book in a voice imitating Holden's.[24] George H. W. Bush called it a \\"marvelous book,\\" listing it among the books that have inspired him.[25] In June 2009, the BBC's Finlo Rohrer wrote that, 58 years since publication, the book is still regarded \\"as the defining work on what it is like to be a teenager. Holden is at various times disaffected, disgruntled, alienated, isolated, directionless, and sarcastic.\\"[26] Adam Gopnik considers it one of the \\"three perfect books\\" in American literature, along with Adventures of Huckleberry Finn and The Great Gatsby, and believes that \\"no book has ever captured a city better than Catcher in the Rye captured New York in the fifties.\\"[27] Jeff Pruchnic wrote an appraisal of The Catcher in the Rye after the death of J.D. Salinger. In this article, Pruchnic focuses on how the novel continues to be received incredibly well, even after it has aged many generations. Pruchnic describes Holden as a teenage protagonist frozen midcentury but destined to be discovered by those of a similar age in every generation to come.[28] Bill Gates said that The Catcher in the Rye is one of his favorite books ever.[29]\\r\\n\\r\\nHowever, not all reception has been positive; the book has had its share of critics. Rohrer writes, \\"Many of these readers are disappointed that the novel fails to meet the expectations generated by the mystique it is shrouded in.  J. D. Salinger has done his part to enhance this mystique.  That is to say, he has done nothing.\\"[26]  Rohrer assessed the reasons behind both the popularity and criticism of the book, saying that it \\"captures existential teenage angst\\" and has a \\"complex central character\\" and \\"accessible conversational style\\"; while at the same time some readers may dislike the \\"use of 1940s New York vernacular\\" and other things.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1960, a teacher in Tulsa, Oklahoma was fired for assigning the novel in class; however, she was later reinstated.[30] Between 1961 and 1982, The Catcher in the Rye was the most censored book in high schools and libraries in the United States.[31] The book was banned in the Issaquah, Washington high schools in 1978 as being part of an \\"overall communist plot\\".[32] In 1981, it was both the most censored book and the second most taught book in public schools in the United States.[33] According to the American Library Association, The Catcher in the Rye was the 10th most frequently challenged book from 1990 to 1999.[10] It was one of the ten most challenged books of 2005,[34] and although it had been off the list for three years, it reappeared in the list of most challenged books of 2009.[35]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe challenges generally begin with Holden's frequent use of vulgar language,[36][37] with other reasons including sexual references,[38] blasphemy, undermining of family values[37] and moral codes,[39] encouragement of rebellion,[40] and promotion of drinking, smoking, lying, promiscuity, and sexual abuse.[39]\\r\\nOften the challengers have been unfamiliar with the plot itself.[31] Shelley Keller-Gage, a high school teacher who faced objections after assigning the novel in her class, noted that \\"the challengers are being just like Holden... They are trying to be catchers in the rye\\".[37] A Streisand effect has been that this incident caused people to put themselves on the waiting list to borrow the novel, when there was no waiting list before.[41][42]\\r\\n\\r\\nSeveral shootings have been associated with Salinger's novel, including Robert John Bardo's murder of Rebecca Schaeffer and John Hinckley Jr.'s assassination attempt on Ronald Reagan. Additionally, after fatally shooting John Lennon, Mark David Chapman was arrested with a copy of the book that he had purchased that same day, inside of which he had written: \\"To Holden Caulfield, From Holden Caulfield, This is my statement\\".[43][44]\\r\\n\\r\\nEarly in his career, Salinger expressed a willingness to have his work adapted for the screen.[45] In 1949, a critically panned film version of his short story \\"Uncle Wiggily in Connecticut\\" was released; renamed My Foolish Heart, the film took great liberties with Salinger's plot and is widely considered to be among the reasons that Salinger refused to allow any subsequent film adaptations of his work.[18][46] The enduring popularity of The Catcher in the Rye, however, has resulted in repeated attempts to secure the novel's screen rights.[47]\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen The Catcher in the Rye was first released, many offers were made to adapt it for the screen, including one from Samuel Goldwyn, producer of My Foolish Heart.[46] In a letter written in the early 1950s, Salinger spoke of mounting a play in which he would play the role of Holden Caulfield opposite Margaret O'Brien, and, if he couldn't play the part himself, to \\"forget about it.\\" Almost 50 years later, the writer Joyce Maynard definitively concluded, \\"The only person who might ever have played Holden Caulfield would have been J. D. Salinger.\\"[48]\\r\\n\\r\\nSalinger told Maynard in the 1970s that Jerry Lewis \\"tried for years to get his hands on the part of Holden,\\"[48] despite Lewis not having read the novel until he was in his thirties.[41] Celebrities ranging from Marlon Brando and Jack Nicholson to Tobey Maguire and Leonardo DiCaprio have since tried to make a film adaptation.[49] In an interview with Premiere, John Cusack commented that his one regret about turning 21 was that he had become too old to play Holden Caulfield. Writer-director Billy Wilder recounted his abortive attempts to snare the novel's rights:\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1961, Salinger denied Elia Kazan permission to direct a stage adaptation of Catcher for Broadway.[51] More recently, Salinger's agents received bids for the Catcher film rights from Harvey Weinstein and Steven Spielberg,[52] neither of which was even passed on to Salinger for consideration.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 2003, the BBC television program The Big Read featured The Catcher in the Rye, interspersing discussions of the novel with \\"a series of short films that featured an actor playing J. D. Salinger's adolescent antihero, Holden Caulfield.\\"[51] The show defended its unlicensed adaptation of the novel by claiming to be a \\"literary review\\", and no major charges were filed.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter Salinger's death in 2010, Phyllis Westberg, who was Salinger's agent at Harold Ober Associates, stated that nothing has changed in terms of licensing film, television, or stage rights of his works.[53] A letter written by Salinger in 1957 revealed that he was open to an adaptation of The Catcher in the Rye released after his death. He wrote: \\"Firstly, it is possible that one day the rights will be sold. Since there's an ever-looming possibility that I won't die rich, I toy very seriously with the idea of leaving the unsold rights to my wife and daughter as a kind of insurance policy. It pleasures me no end, though, I might quickly add, to know that I won't have to see the results of the transaction.\\" Salinger also wrote that he believed his novel was not suitable for film treatment, and that translating Holden Caulfield's first-person narrative into voice-over and dialogue would be contrived.[54]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 2009, a year before his death, Salinger successfully sued to stop the U.S. publication of a novel that presents Holden Caulfield as an old man.[26][55] The novel's author, Fredrik Colting, commented: \\"call me an ignorant Swede, but the last thing I thought possible in the U.S. was that you banned books\\".[56] The issue is complicated by the nature of Colting's book, 60 Years Later: Coming Through the Rye, which has been compared to fan fiction.[57] Although commonly not authorized by writers, no legal action is usually taken against fan fiction, since it is rarely published commercially and thus involves no profit.[58] Colting, however, has published his book commercially, therefore interfering with copyright law and is not protected.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Catcher in the Rye has had significant cultural influence, and works inspired by the novel have been said to form their own genre. Sarah Graham assessed works influenced by The Catcher in the Rye to include the novels Less Than Zero by Bret Easton Ellis, The Perks of Being a Wallflower by Stephen Chbosky, A Complicated Kindness by Miriam Toews, The Bell Jar by Sylvia Plath, Ordinary People by Judith Guest, and the film Igby Goes Down by Burr Steers.[59]\\r\\n\\r\\nFantasy writer Harry Turtledove has written a pastiche-parody \\"Catcher in the Rhine\\", based on his daughter's mishearing of Salinger's title. In this short story, an unnamed narrator, who is clearly meant to be Holden Caulfield but is unnamed to avoid copyright problems, goes on vacation to Germany and meets characters from the Niebelunglied. This was first published in The Chick is in the Mail, edited by Esther Friesner, Baen 2000 and reprinted in the omnibus Chicks Ahoy! (2010). It was reprinted in Atlantis and Other Places also in 2010.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn \\"Catcher In The Wry\\" former major league baseball player, Bob Uecker, recounts anecdotes of his years behind the plate and on the road, recalling the antics of his famous teammates, including Hank Aaron, Bob Gibson, Richie Allen, and Warren Spahn.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe July 1985 issue of National Lampoon included a parody of the novel, ostensibly written by Holden Caulfield's son, entitled 'The Son of the Catcher, who Lives in Rye'.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn Postal 2 a book by the name of \\"Catch her in the Rye\\" is present.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn December 1991, punk rock band Green Day released their second studio album (Kerplunk), containing the song Who Wrote Holden Caulfield. The song describes said character as crazy, frustrated, and lacking motivation.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\"The Catcher in the Rye\\" deeply influenced the 2017 biographical drama film, \\"Rebel in the Rye\\", which is about J.D. Salinger. It is a visual about his life, before and after World War II, and gives more about the author's life than the readers of \\"The Catcher in the Rye\\" learned from the novel.[60]","input":"When was the catcher in the rye published?"},{"output":"an American multinational medical devices, pharmaceutical and consumer packaged goods manufacturing company","context":"Johnson & Johnson is an American multinational medical devices, pharmaceutical and consumer packaged goods manufacturing company founded in 1886. Its common stock is a component of the Dow Jones Industrial Average and the company is listed among the Fortune 500.\\r\\nJohnson & Johnson is headquartered in New Brunswick, New Jersey, the consumer division being located in Skillman, New Jersey. The corporation includes some 250 subsidiary companies with operations in 60 countries and products sold in over 175 countries. Johnson & Johnson had worldwide sales of $70.1?billion during calendar year 2015.[3] The company has made the 3rd largest pharmaceutical settlement with the U.S. Department of Justice.\\r\\nJohnson & Johnson's brands include numerous household names of medications and first aid supplies. Among its well-known consumer products are the Band-Aid Brand line of bandages, Tylenol medications, Johnson's baby products, Neutrogena skin and beauty products, Clean & Clear facial wash and Acuvue contact lenses.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nJohnson & Johnson operates over 250 companies in what is termed \\"the Johnson & Johnson family of companies\\".[4] The company operates in three broad divisions; Consumer Healthcare, Medical Devices and Pharmaceuticals.\\r\\nInspired by a speech by antiseptic advocate Joseph Lister, Robert Wood Johnson joined his brothers James Wood Johnson and Edward Mead Johnson to create a line of ready-to-use surgical dressings in 1885. The company produced its first products in 1886 and incorporated in 1887. Those products already featured a logo resembling the signature of James Wood Johnson, very similar to the logo used today. It is one of the longest-used company logos in the world.[8]\\r\\nRobert Wood Johnson served as the first president of the company. He worked to improve sanitation practices in the nineteenth century, and lent his name to the Robert Wood Johnson University Hospital in New Brunswick, New Jersey. Upon his death in 1910, he was succeeded in the presidency by his brother James Wood Johnson until 1932, and then by his son, Robert Wood Johnson II.\\r\\nRobert Wood Johnson's granddaughter, Mary Lea Johnson Richards, was the first baby to appear on a Johnson & Johnson baby powder label.[9][10][11] His great-grandson, Jamie Johnson, made a documentary called Born Rich about the experience of growing up as the heir to one of the world's greatest fortunes.\\r\\nMcNeil Consumer Healthcare was founded on March 16, 1879, by 23-year-old Robert McNeil. In 1904, one of McNeil's sons, Robert Lincoln McNeil, became part of the company, and together they created McNeil Laboratories in 1933. The company focused on direct marketing of prescription drugs to hospitals, pharmacists, and doctors. Development of acetaminophen began under the leadership of Robert L. McNeil, Jr., who later served as the firm's chairman.[12] In 1959, Johnson & Johnson acquired McNeil Laboratories and a year later the company was able to sell Tylenol for the first time ever, without a prescription. In 1977, two subsidiary companies were created; McNeil medicals products and McNeil Consumer Products Company (also known as McNeil Consumer Healthcare). The focus of McNeil medicals products is to market prescription drugs. In 1993 McNeil medicals products merged with the Ortho Pharmaceutical to form Ortho-McNeil Pharmaceutical. In 2001 McNeil Consumer Healthcare changed its name to McNeil Consumer & Specialty medicals products. However, it was later changed to \\"McNeil Consumer Healthcare\\". The company markets over-the-counter and prescription medicals products including complete lines of Tylenol and Motrin IB (ibuprofen) products for adults and children.\\r\\nIn 1933, Swiss chemist Bernhard Joos set up a small research laboratory in Schaffhausen, Switzerland. This set the basis for the founding of Chemische Industrie-Labor AG (Chemical Industry Laboratory AG or Cilag) on 12 May 1936. In 1959, Cilag joined the Johnson & Johnson family of companies. In the early nineties, the marketing organizations of Cilag and Janssen Pharmaceutica were joined to form Janssen-Cilag. The non-marketing activities of both companies still operate under their original name. Cilag continues to have operations under the Cilag name in Switzerland, ranging from research and development through manufacturing and international services. In August 2014, Cilag acquired Covagen a biopharmaceutical company which specializes in the development of multi-specific protein based therapeutics. As part of the acquisition Cilag will gain access to Covagens lead drug candidate, COVA 322, a bi-specific anti-tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha/anti-interleukin (IL)-17A FynomAb, is in a Phase Ib study for psoriasis.[13]\\r\\nJanssen Pharmaceuticals can be traced back to 1933. In 1933, Constant Janssen, the father of Paul Janssen, acquired the right to distribute the pharmaceutical products of Richter, a Hungarian pharmaceutical company, for Belgium, the Netherlands and Belgian Congo. On 23 October 1934, he founded the N.V. Produkten Richter in Turnhout. After the Second World War, the name for the company products was changed to Eupharma, although the company name Richter would remain until 1956.[14]\\r\\nPaul Janssen founded his own research laboratory in 1953 on the third floor of the building in the Statiestraat, still within the Richter-Eurpharma company of his father. On 5 April 1956, the name of the company was changed to NV Laboratoria Pharmaceutica C. Janssen (named after Constant Janssen). On 2 May 1958, the research department in Beerse became a separate legal entity, the N.V. Research Laboratorium C. Janssen. On 24 October 1961, the company was acquired by the American corporation Johnson & Johnson. On 10 February 1964, the name was changed to Janssen Pharmaceutica N.V. Between 1990 and 2004, Janssen Pharmaceuticals expanded worldwide, with the company growing in size to approximately 28000 employees worldwide. In 1999, clinical research and non-clinical development become a global organization within Johnson & Johnson. In 2001, part of the research activities was transferred to the United States with the reorganization of research activities in the Johnson & Johnson Pharmaceutical Research and Development organization. The research activities of the Janssen Research Foundation and the R.W. Johnson Pharmaceutical Research Institute were merged into the new global research organization. On 27 October 2004, the Paul Janssen Research Center, for discovery research, was inaugurated.\\r\\nIn August 2013, the company acquired Aragon Pharmaceuticals, Inc.. In November 2014, the company acquired Alios BioPharma, Inc. for $1.75 billion. As a result of the purchase, Alios was incorporated into the infectious diseases therapeutic area of the Janssen Pharmaceutical Companies of Johnson & Johnson.[15] In March 2015, Janssen licensed Tipofarnib (a farnesyl transferase inhibitor) to Kura Oncology who will assume sole responsibility for developing and commercialising the anti-cancer drug.[16] Later in the same month the company announced that Galapagos Pharma and regained the rights to the anti-inflammatory drug candidate GLPG1690 as well as two other compounds including GLPG1205 (a first-in-class inhibitor of GPR84).[17] Finally, in March, the company acquired XO1 Limited [18] In November 2015, the company acquired Novira Therapeutics, Inc., gaining the lead candidate, NVR 3-778.[19]\\r\\nDePuy was acquired by J&J in 1998, rolling it into the Johnson & Johnson Medical Devices group. On June 14, 2012, Johnson and Johnson completed the acquisition of Synthes for $19.7 billion,[20] which was then integrated with the DePuy franchise to establish the DePuy Synthes Companies of Johnson & Johnson which includes; Codman & Shurteff, Inc., DePuy Mitek, Inc., DePuy Orthopaedics, Inc. and DePuy Spine, Inc. In February 2015, DePuy announced it would acquire Olive Medical Corporation.[21] In May 2016, DePuy Orthopaedics, Inc. acquired Biomedical Enterprises, Inc., an industry leader in small bone fixation.[22]Later in December of the same year, DePuy Synthes announced it would acquire Pulsar Vascular Inc., adding Pulsar to its Codman division.[23]\\r\\nIn April 2017, Irish subsidiary; DePuy Ireland Unlimited Company announced it would acquire Neuravi, a company with a portfolio of products for hemorrhagic and ischemic strokes for an undisclosed sum, with Codman Neuro being behind the deal.[24][25] In June, DePuy Synthes Products, Inc. announced it would acquire Innovative Surgical Solutions, LLC (trading as Sentio, LLC) for an undisclosed sum, bolstering the company's technology for innovative nerve localisation in spinal surgery. [26]\\r\\nJanssen Biotech, Inc., formerly known as Centocor Biotech, Inc., is a biotechnology company that was founded in Philadelphia in 1979. In 1982, Centocor transitioned into a publicly traded company. In 1999, Centocor became a wholly owned subsidiary of Johnson & Johnson. Since the acquisition, Janssen Biotech increased its annual sales from $500 million to more than $2 billion. During the same period, research and development investment increased from $75 million to more than $300 million. In 2008, Centocor, Inc. and Ortho Biotech Inc. merged to form Centocor Ortho Biotech Inc. In June 2010, Centocor Ortho Biotech acquired RespiVert, a privately held drug discovery company focused on developing small-molecule, inhaled therapies for the treatment of pulmonary diseases.[27] In June 2011, Centocor Ortho Biotech changed its name to Janssen Biotech, Inc. as part of a global effort to unite the Janssen Pharmaceutical Companies around the world under a common identity. In December 2014, the company announced it would co-develop MacroGenics cancer drug candidate (MGD011) which targets both CD19 and CD3 proteins in treating B-cell malignant tumours. This could net MacroGenics up to $700 million.[28] In January 2015, the company announced it will utilise Isis Pharmaceuticals' RNA-targeting technology to discover and develop antisense drugs targeting autoimmune disorders of the gastrointestinal tract, with the partnership potentially generating up to $835 million for Isis.[29]\\r\\nIn 1915, George F. Merson opened a facility in Edinburgh for the manufacturing, packaging and sterilizing of catgut, silk and nylon sutures. Johnson & Johnson acquired Mr. Mersons company in 1947, and this was renamed Ethicon Suture Laboratories.[30] In 1953 this became Ethicon Inc.[31] In 1992, Ethicon was restructured, and Ethicon Endo-Surgery, Inc. became a separate corporation. During the 1990s, Ethicon diversified into new and advanced products and technologies and formed four different companies under the Ethicon umbrella, each of which specialize in different products. In 2008 J&J announced it would acquire Mentor Corporation for $1 billion and merge its operations into Ethicon.[32] In March 2016, J&Js Ethicon business unit announced it would acquire NeuWave Medical, Inc.[33] In January 2017, J&J subsidiary Ethicon announced it would acquire Megadyne Medical Products, Inc., a medical device company that develops, manufactures and markets electrosurgical tools.[34] In February 2017, Ethicon acquired medical device manufacturer, Torax Medical for an undisclosed sum.[35]\\r\\nEthicon Endo-Surgery was part of Ethicon Inc. until 1992, when it became a separate corporate entity under the J&J umbrella.\\r\\nIn January 2017, J&J fought off competition from Sanofi to acquire Swiss drugmaker Actelion. Later in the month J&J announced a $30 billion deal, the largest ever pursued by the company,[36] to purchase the Swiss company Actelion and to spin off its research and development unit, into a separate legal entity.[37][38] In March, the company declared its tender offer for Swiss biotechnology company Actelion successful on Friday, reporting that Janssen Holding GmbH controlled 77.2 percent of the voting rights after the main offer period,[39] equating to 83,195,346 Actelion shares. In keeping with earlier agreements, the company announced its intention to delist Actelion, whilst spinning out its drug discovery operations and early-stage clinical development assets into a newly created Swiss-based biopharmaceutical company, Idorsia Ltd.[40] J&J will control 16% of Idorsia, with the ability to raise their stake to 32% through convertible notes.[41]\\r\\nIn July 2016, J&J announced its intention to acquire the privately held company, Vogue International LLC, boosting Johnson & Johnson Consumer Inc.[42] In September of the same year, J&J announced it would acquire Abbott Medical Optics from Abbott Laboratories for $4.325 billion, adding the new division into Johnson & Johnson Vision Care, Inc.[43]\\r\\nIn July 2017, Johnson & Johnson Vision Care, Inc announced that its Abbott Medical Optics subsidiary would acquire TearScience, who recently received FDA approval for an office-based approach to imaging meibomian glands and treating meibomian gland dysfunction.[44] In September, the company acquired subscription-based contact lens startup Sightbox.[45]\\r\\nIn October 2010, J&J acquired Crucell for $2.4 billion.[46]\\r\\nIn November 2015, Biosense Webster, Inc. acquired Coherex, Medical Inc. expanding the companies range of treatment options for patients with atrial fibrillation.[47]\\r\\nThe following is an illustration of the company's structure, maintained though a number of mergers & acquisitions (this is not a comprehensive list):\\r\\nBaby Care\\r\\nSkin & Hair Care\\r\\nWound Care and Topicals\\r\\nOral Health Care\\r\\nWomens Health\\r\\nOver-The-Counter Medicines\\r\\nNutritionals\\r\\nVogue International LLC\\r\\nNeoStrata Company, Inc.[48]\\r\\nAnimas Corporation\\r\\nCoherex Medical, Inc.\\r\\nPulsar Vascular Inc.\\r\\nNeuravi\\r\\nDePuy Mitek, Inc.\\r\\nBiomedical Enterprises, Inc.\\r\\nDePuy Spine, Inc\\r\\nSentio, LLC\\r\\nOlive Medical Corporation\\r\\nGloster Europe[49]\\r\\nOrthotaxy[50]\\r\\nSurgical Process Institute[51]\\r\\nMentor\\r\\nAcclarent\\r\\nNeuWave Medical, Inc\\r\\nTorax Medical\\r\\nMegadyne Medical Products, Inc.[52]\\r\\nJanssen Diagnostics BVBA\\r\\nVistakon\\r\\nTearScience\\r\\nSightbox\\r\\nLifeScan, Inc.\\r\\nCovagen\\r\\nJanssen-Cilag\\r\\nAragon Pharmaceuticals, Inc.\\r\\nAlios BioPharma, Inc.\\r\\nNovira Therapeutics, Inc.\\r\\nActelion\\r\\nJanssen R&D LLC\\r\\nJanssen Healthcare Innovation\\r\\nOrtho Biotech Inc.\\r\\nRespiVert\\r\\nJanssen Therapeutics\\r\\nJanssen Diagnostics\\r\\nJanssen Scientific Affairs\\r\\nCrucell\\r\\nJanssen-Ortho\\r\\nMcNeil Nutritionals\\r\\nMead Johnson\\r\\n(Sold to Reckitt Benckiser)\\r\\nCurrent members of the board of directors of Johnson & Johnson are: Mary Sue Coleman, James G.

Weldon.[53]\\r\\nSandi Peterson has served as Group Worldwide Chairman since 2012.[54]\\r\\nOn top of Alex Gorsky and Sandi Peterson, current members of Executive Committees of Johnson & Johnson are: Dominic Caruso (the company's chief financial officer),[36] Peter Fasolo, Paul Stoffels, and Michael Sneed.[55]\\r\\nThe company has historically been located on the Delaware and Raritan Canal in New Brunswick. The company considered moving its headquarters out of New Brunswick in the 1960s, but decided to stay in the town after city officials promised to gentrify downtown New Brunswick by demolishing old buildings and constructing new ones.\\r\\nWhile New Brunswick lost many historic structures, including the early home of Rutgers University, and most of its historic commercial waterfront to the redevelopment effort, the gentrification did attract people back to New Brunswick. Johnson & Johnson hired Henry N. Cobb from Pei Cobb Freed & Partners to design an addition to its headquarters. The white tower in a park across the railroad tracks from the older portion of the headquarters in one of tallest buildings in New Brunswick.\\r\\nThe stretch of Delaware and Raritan canal by the company's headquarters was replaced by a stretch of Route 18 in the late 1970s,[56] after a lengthy dispute.[57] In 2002, the company released its plan of setting up Asia-Pacific information technology headquarters in New South Wales within five years.[58]\\r\\nThe company's business is divided into three major segments, Pharmaceuticals, Medical Devices, and Consumer Products. In 2015, these segments contributed 44.9%, 35.9%, and 19.3%, respectively, of the company's total revenues.[59]\\r\\nThe company's major franchises in the Pharmaceutical segment include Immunology, Neuroscience, Infectious Disease, and Oncology.\\r\\nImmunology products include the anti-tumor necrosis factor antibodies Remicade (infliximab), and Simponi (golimumab) used for the treatment[60] of autoimmune diseases, including rheumatoid arthritis, Crohn's disease (Remicade only), ulcerative colitis, ankylosing spondylitis, and other disorders. In 2013, these two products accounted for 29% of Johnson and Johnson's pharmaceutical revenues, and 11.3% of the company's total revenues. A third immunology product, Stelara (ustekinumab), targets interleukin-12 and interleukin-23 and is used for the treatment of psoriasis.[61]\\r\\nKey infectious diseases products include Incivio (telaprevir), a hepatitis C protease inhibitor; Intelence (Etravirine), a non-nucleoside HIV polymerase inhibitor; and Prezista (darunavir), an HIV protease inhibitor. Telaprevir sales are expected to decline due to the recent approval of treatment regimens that are more efficacious and much better tolerated. Etravirine and darunavir are notable for their high barriers to resistance development.[62][63] Darunavir in combination with HIV polymerase inhibitors is recommended as a first line treatment option for treatment naive persons with HIV infection[64] but etravirine is approved only for use in treatment-experienced patients, owing in part to its requirement for twice-daily dosing.\\r\\nThe company's CNS products include the ADHD drug Concerta (methylphenidate extended release), and the long-acting injectable antipsychotics Invega Sustenna (paliperidone palmitate) and Risperdal Consta (risperidone). Invega Sustenna and Risperdal Consta were the first widely utilized long-acting depot injections for the treatment of schizophrenia. Designed to address the issue of poor patient compliance with oral therapy, they are administered by intramuscular injection at intervals of 2 weeks and one month, respectively. Only minimal improvements in outcomes relative to the oral versions of these drugs were observed in the clinical trial setting, but some evidence suggests that the advantages of long-acting injections in clinical practice may be greater than is readily demonstrated in the environment of a clinical trial.[65][66][67]\\r\\nOncology products include Velcade (bortezomib), for the treatment of multiple myeloma and mantle cell lymphoma[68] and Zytiga (abiraterone), an androgen antagonist for the treatment of prostate cancer. In clinical trials, abiraterone treatment was associated with a 4.6 to 5.2 survival advantage when used either before or after chemotherapy with platinum based drugs.[69] On December 31, 2012, the Food and Drug Administration approved Sirturo (bedaquiline), a Johnson & Johnson tuberculosis drug that is the first new medicine to fight the infection in more than forty years.[70]\\r\\nSectors in which the company is active[71] include:\\r\\nSectors in which the company is active[72] include:\\r\\nThe company does not have a slogan per se, but they do have a lengthy credo that is frequently referenced:\\r\\nWe believe our first responsibility is to the doctors, nurses and patients, to mothers and fathers and all others who use our products and services. In meeting their needs everything we do must be of high quality. We must constantly strive to reduce our costs in order to maintain reasonable prices.

We must maintain in good order the property we are privileged to use, protecting the environment and natural resources.\\r\\nJohnson & Johnson has set several positive goals to keep the company environmentally friendly and was ranked third among the United States's largest companies in Newsweek's \\"Green Rankings\\".[73] Some examples are the reduction in water use, waste, and energy use and an increased level of transparency.[74] Johnson & Johnson agreed to change its packaging of plastic bottles used in the manufacturing process, switching their packaging of liquids to non-polycarbonate containers.[75] The corporation is working with the Climate Northwest Initiative and the EPA National Environmental Performance Track program.[76] As a member of the national Green Power Partnership, Johnson & Johnson operates the largest solar power generator in Pennsylvania at its site in Spring House, PA.[77]\\r\\nOn September 29, 1982, a \\"Tylenol scare\\" began when the first of seven individuals died in Chicago metropolitan area, after ingesting Extra Strength Tylenol that had been deliberately laced with cyanide.[78] Within a week, the company pulled 31 million bottles of capsules back from retailers, making it one of the first major recalls in American history.[78] The incident led to reforms in the packaging of over-the-counter substances and to federal anti-tampering laws. The case remains unsolved and no suspects have been charged. Johnson & Johnson's quick response, including a nationwide recall, was widely praised by public relations experts and the media and was the gold standard for corporate crisis management.[79][80][81]\\r\\nOn April 30, 2010, McNeil Consumer Healthcare, a subsidiary of Johnson and Johnson, voluntarily recalled 43 over-the-counter children's medicines, including Tylenol, Tylenol Plus, Motrin, Zyrtec and Benadryl. The recall was conducted after a routine inspection at a manufacturing facility in Fort Washington, Pennsylvania, United States revealed that some \\"products may not fully meet the required manufacturing specifications\\".[82][83] Affected products may contain a \\"higher concentration of active ingredients\\" or exhibit other manufacturing defects.[83] Products shipped to Canada, Dominican Republic, Guam, Guatemala, Jamaica, Puerto Rico, Panama, Trinidad and Tobago, the United Arab Emirates, Kuwait and Fiji were included in the recall.[82] In a statement, Johnson & Johnson said \\"a comprehensive quality assessment across its manufacturing operations\\" was underway.[82][83] A dedicated website was established by the company listing affected products and other consumer information.[83]\\r\\nOn August 2009, 2010, DePuy, a subsidiary of American giant Johnson & Johnson, recalled its ASR (articular surface replacement) hip prostheses from the market. DePuy said the recall was due to unpublished National Joint Registry data showing a 12% revision rate for resurfacing at five years and an ASR XL revision rate of 13%. All hip prostheses fail in some patients, but it is expected that the rate will be about 1% a year.[84] Pathologically, the failing prosthesis had several effects. Metal debris from wear of the implant led to a reaction that destroyed the soft tissues surrounding the joint, leaving some patients with long term disability. Ions of cobalt and chromiumthe metals from which the implant was madewere also released into the blood and cerebral spinal fluid in some patients.[85]\\r\\nIn March 2013, a jury in Los Angeles ordered Johnson & Johnson to pay more than $8.3 million in damages to a Montana man in the first of more than 10,000 lawsuits pending against the company in connection with the now-recalled DePuy hip.[86]\\r\\nSome lawyers and industry analysts have estimated that the suits ultimately will cost Johnson & Johnson billions of dollars to resolve.[86]\\r\\nIn 2010 and 2011, Johnson & Johnson voluntarily recalled some over-the-counter products including Tylenol due to an odor caused by tribromoanisole.[87][88] In this case, 2,4,6-tribromophenol was used to treat wooden pallets on which product packaging materials were transported and stored.[87]\\r\\nIn 2010 a group of shareholders sued the board for allegedly failing to take action to prevent serious failings and illegalities since the 1990s, including manufacturing problems, bribing officials, covering up adverse effects and misleading marketing for unapproved uses. The judge initially dismissed the case in September 2011, but allowed the plaintiffs opportunity to refile at a later time.[89] In 2012 Johnson and Johnson proposed a settlement with the shareholders, whereby the company would institute new oversight, quality and compliance procedures binding for five years.[90]\\r\\nJuries in several US states have found J&J guilty of concealing the adverse effects of Janssen Pharmaceuticals' antipsychotic medication Risperdal, produced by its unit, in order to promote it to doctors and patients as better than cheaper generics, and of falsely marketing it for treating patients with dementia.[91] States that have awarded damages include Texas ($158 million), South Carolina ($327 million), Louisiana ($258 million), and most notably Arkansas ($1.2 billion).[92]\\r\\nIn 2010, the United States Department of Justice joined a whistleblowers suit accusing the company of illegally marketing Risperdal through Omnicare, the largest company supplying pharmaceuticals to nursing homes.[93][94] The allegations include that J&J were warned by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) not to promote Risperdal as effective and safe for elderly patients, but they did so, and that they paid Omnicare to promote the drug to care home physicians.[95] The settlement was finalized on November 4, 2013, with J&J agreeing to pay a penalty of around $2.2 billion, \\"including criminal fines and forfeiture totaling $485 million and civil settlements with the federal government and states totaling $1.72 billion.\\"[96]\\r\\nJohnson & Johnson has also been subject to congressional investigations related to payments given to psychiatrists to promote its products and ghost write articles, notably Joseph Biederman and his pediatric bipolar disorder research unit.[97]\\r\\nIn 2011, J&J settled litigation brought by the US Securities and Exchange Commission under the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and paid around $70M in disgorgement and fines.[98] J&J's employees had given kickbacks and bribes to doctors in Greece, Poland, and Romania to obtain business selling drugs and medical devices and had bribed officials in Iraq to win contracts under the Oil for Food program.[99] J&J fully cooperated with the investigation once the problems came to light.[100]\\r\\nIn May 2017, J&J reached an agreement to pay $33 million to several states to settle consumer fraud allegations in some of the companys over-the-counter drugs.[101][102][103]\\r\\nJohnson & Johnson registered the Red Cross as a U.S. trademark for \\"medicinal and surgical plasters\\" in 1905 and has used the design since 1887.[104] The Geneva Conventions, which reserved the Red Cross emblem for specific uses, were first approved in 1864 and ratified by the United States in 1882. However, the emblem was not protected by U.S. law for the use of the American Red Cross and the U.S. military until after Johnson & Johnson had obtained its trademark. A clause in this law (now 18 U.S.C. 706) permits this pre-existing uses of the Red Cross to continue.\\r\\nA declaration made by the U.S. upon its ratification of the 1949 Geneva Conventions includes a reservation that pre-1905 U.S. domestic uses of the Red Cross, such as Johnson & Johnson's, would remain lawful as long as the cross is not used on \\"aircraft, vessels, vehicles, buildings or other structures, or upon the ground,\\" i.e., uses which could be confused with its military uses.[105] This means that the U.S. did not agree to any interpretation of the 1949 Geneva Conventions that would overrule Johnson & Johnson's trademark. The American Red Cross continues to recognize the validity of Johnson & Johnson's trademark.[106]\\r\\nIn August 2007, Johnson & Johnson filed a lawsuit against the American Red Cross (ARC), demanding that the charity halt the use of the red cross symbol on products it sells to the public, though the company takes no issue with the charity's use of the mark for non-profit purposes.[107] In May 2008, the judge in the case dismissed most of Johnson & Johnson's claims, and a month later the two organizations announced a settlement had been reached in which both parties would continue to use the symbol.[108]\\r\\nSince 2003, Johnson & Johnson and Boston Scientific have both claimed that the other had infringed on their patents covering heart stent medical devices. The litigation was settled when Boston Scientific agreed to pay $716?million to Johnson & Johnson in September 2009 and an additional $1.73?billion in February 2010.[109] Their dispute was renewed in 2014, now on the grounds of a contract dispute.[110]\\r\\nIn 2007, Johnson & Johnson sued Abbott Laboratories over the development and sale of the arthritis drug Humira. Johnson & Johnson claimed that Abbott used technology patented by New York University and licensed exclusively to Johnson & Johnson's Centocor division to develop Humira. Johnson & Johnson won the court case, and in 2009 Abbott was ordered to pay Johnson & Johnson $1.17?billion in lost revenues and $504?million in royalties.[111] The judge also added $175.6?million in interest to bring the total to $1.84?billion.[112] This was the largest patent-infringement award in U.S. history[111] until the 2013 decision against Teva in favor of Takeda and Pfizer for over 2.1 billion dollars.[113] In 2010 Abbott appealed the verdict[112] and in 2011 won the appeal.[114]\\r\\nTens of thousands of women worldwide have taken legal action against Johnson & Johnson after suffering serious complications following a vaginal mesh implant procedure.[115] In 2016 the U.S. states of California and Washington filed a lawsuit against the company, accusing it of deception.[115] More than 700 women began a class action against the company in the Federal Court of Australia in 2017, telling the court they \\"suffered irreparable, debilitating pain after the devices began to erode into surrounding tissue and organs, causing infections and complications.\\" The class action alleged that Johnson & Johnson, which \\"aggressively marketed\\" the implants \\"failed to properly warn patients and surgeons of the risk, or test the devices adequately.\\"[116]\\r\\nIn February 2016, J&J was ordered to pay $72 million in damages to the family of Jacqueline Fox, a 62-year-old woman who died of ovarian cancer in 2015.[117] She had been sprinkling Johnson's Baby Powder on her underwear nearly every day since she was a teenager. J&J claimed that the safety of cosmetic talc is supported by decades of scientific evidence and it plans to appeal the verdict. The British charity, Ovacome was quoted as saying that while there were 16 studies which showed that using talc increased the risk of ovarian cancer by around a third and that a 2013 review of US studies came up with similar results for genital, but not general talcum powder use, J&J were not convinced that the results were reliable. Furthermore, Ovacome said, \\"Ovarian cancer is a rare disease, and increasing a small risk by a third still [still] gives a small risk.\\"[117]\\r\\nBy March 2017, over 1,000 U.S. women had sued J&J for covering up the possible cancer risk from its Baby Powder product; the company says that 70 percent of its Baby Powder is used by adults.[118]\\r\\nOn August 21, 2017, a California jury ordered Johnson & Johnson to pay $417 million to a woman who claimed she developed ovarian cancer after using the company's talc-based products like Johnson's Baby Powder for feminine hygiene. The verdict included $70 million in compensatory damages and $347 million in punitive damages. J&J says they will appeal the verdict, believing that science supports the safety of their baby powder. [119]\\r\\nOn October 18, 2017, the Missouri Eastern District appeals court on Tuesday threw out a $72 million jury verdict. The appeals court ruled 3-0 that Jacqueline Fox's lawsuit lacked jurisdiction in Missouri because of a U.S. Supreme Court decision that imposed limits on where injury lawsuit can be filed which lawsuit's jurisdiction requires a stronger connection between the forum state and a plaintiff's claims. Fox, 62, of Birmingham, Ala., died in 2015, about four months before her trial was held in St. Louis Circuit Court. She was among 65 plaintiffs, of whom only two were from Missouri. Subsequently, it also would kill three other recent St. Louis jury verdicts of more than $200 million combined.[120]\\r\\nBy 2018, the company had become embroiled in the opioid epidemic in the United States and had become a target of lawsuits.[121]\\r\\nCoordinates: 402955N 742637W? / ?40.49861N 74.44361W? / 40.49861; -74.44361","input":"What kind of company is johnson and johnson?"},{"output":"30 August 2015","context":"Kevin De Bruyne (Dutch pronunciation: [?k?v?n d? ?br?yn?]; born 28 June 1991) is a Belgian professional footballer who plays as a midfielder for English club Manchester City and the Belgian national team.

Incoming manager Jos Mourinho, however, assured De Bruyne he was a part of Chelsea's plan for the future, and the player officially returned to Chelsea on 1 July 2013.[33]\\r\\nDe Bruyne injured a knee while scoring his first goal for Chelsea, in a pre-season friendly game against a Malaysia XI,[34] but was fit to make his competitive debut on the opening day of the 2013ÿ14 Premier League season against Hull City, and made an assist for the first goal in a 2ÿ0 win.[35]\\r\\nOn 18 January 2014, Wolfsburg signed De Bruyne for a fee of S18 million (?22 million).[36] On 25 January 2014, he made his debut for Wolfsburg in a 3ÿ1 home loss against Hannover 96.[37] On 12 April 2014, De Bruyne assisted 2 goals in their 4ÿ1 home win against 1.

De Bruyne scored the first, assisted the fourth, and provided key passes on both the second and third goals.[72] After the international break, Manchester City drew their next game, against Everton, played on 15 October 2016 with the scoreline finishing at 1ÿ1. Agero and De Bruyne both missed their penalties while Nolito came off the bench to equalise for City.[73]\\r\\nOn 1 November De Bruyne scored from a free kick in the team's 3ÿ1 win over FC Barcelona.[74]\\r\\nOn 21 January 2017, De Bruyne was involved in both of City's goals, as he netted once himself and also assisted Leroy San's, in a 2ÿ2 home draw with Tottenham Hotspur; he was subsequently named Man of the Match.[75] On 19 March 2017, De Bruyne displayed an excellent performance in a 1ÿ1 draw against Liverpool at the Etihad Stadium, where he set up a goal for Agero.[76]\\r\\nDe Bruyne set up both Agero's and Gabriel Jesus' goals, on 9 September 2017, in a 5ÿ0 home victory over Liverpool.[77] On 30 September 2017, he scored his first goal of the 2017ÿ18 Premier League season, as the Citizens overcame Chelsea with a 1ÿ0 scoreline at Stamford Bridge.[78]\\r\\nOn 22 January 2018, De Bruyne signed a new contract with City, keeping him at the club until 2023.[79]\\r\\nEarly in De Bruyne's career it was rumoured that his mother had been born in Ealing and that he was therefore eligible to play for the England national team, but in fact his mother was born in Burundi and moved to Ealing as a child.[80] Due to his mother's place of birth, he was also eligible to play for the Burundi national team.[81]\\r\\nDe Bruyne was capped by Belgium at under-18, under-19, and under-21 level.

De Bruyne attacked Courtois when training with the Belgian international team, but reconciled with Courtois after.[97] Since 2014, De Bruyne has been in a relationship with Michle Lacroix,[98] who announced on 28 September 2015 that she was pregnant with the couple's baby son.[99] Mason Milian De Bruyne was born on 10 March 2016.[100] De Bruyne and Lacroix married in June 2017.[101]\\r\\nIn 2015 De Bruyne bought his first car, a Mercedes, having previously relied on club vehicles, in preparation for the birth of his first child.[102] His autobiography, entitled Keep It Simple (ISBN?9789089314826), was published in October 2014.[102]\\r\\nGenk[115]\\r\\nVfL Wolfsburg[115][116]\\r\\nManchester City\\r\\nIndividual\\r\\nNotes\\r\\nCitations","input":"When did kevin de bruyne join manchester city?"},{"output":"tens of thousands","context":"","input":"How many chinese letters are in the alphabet?"},{"output":"two terms, if served after November 6, 1990","context":"The Governor of California is the chief executive of the California state government, commander-in-chief of the California National Guard and the California State Military Reserve, whose responsibilities also include making annual State of the State addresses to the California State Legislature, submitting the budget, and ensuring that state laws are enforced. The position was created in 1849, the year before California became a state. The current governor is Jerry Brown, a Democrat who was inaugurated January 3, 2011, and who had previously served as governor from 1975 to 1983. In October 2013, Jerry Brown surpassed Earl Warren for the longest cumulative period of time served as governor.\\r\\nGovernors are elected by popular ballot and serve terms of four years, with a limit of two terms, if served after November 6, 1990.[2] Governors take the following oath:\\r\\nI (Governor) do solemnly swear that I will support and defend the Constitution of the United States and the Constitution of the State of California against all enemies foreign and domestic, that I will bear true faith and allegiance to the Constitution of the United States and the Constitution of the State of California, that I take this obligation freely without any mental reservation or purpose of evasion and that I will well and faithfully discharge the duties upon which I am about to enter.\\r\\nGovernors take office on the first Monday after January 1 after their election.\\r\\nThere are two methods available to remove a governor before the expiration of the gubernatorial term of office.\\r\\nThe governor can be impeached for \\"misconduct in office\\" by the State Assembly and removed by a two-thirds vote of the State Senate.\\r\\nPetitions signed by California state voters equal in number to 12% of the last vote for the office of governor (with signatures from each of 5 counties equal in number to 1% of the last vote for governor in the county) can launch a gubernatorial recall election. The voters can then vote on whether or not to recall the incumbent governor, and on the same ballot they can vote a potential replacement. If a majority of the voters in the election vote to recall the governor, then the person who gains a plurality of the votes in the replacement race will become governor.\\r\\nThe 2003 California recall began with a petition drive that successfully forced sitting Democratic Governor Gray Davis into a special recall election. It marked the first time in the history of California that a governor faced a recall election. He was subsequently voted out of office, becoming the second governor in the history of the United States to be recalled after Lynn Frazier of North Dakota in 1921. He was replaced by Republican Arnold Schwarzenegger.\\r\\nThe Lieutenant Governor of California is separately elected during the same election, not jointly as the running mate of the gubernatorial candidate. California has had a governor and a lieutenant governor of different parties 26 of the past 31 years. This occasionally becomes significant, since the California Constitution provides that all the powers of the governor fall to the lieutenant governor whenever the governor is not in the state of California, with the lieutenant governor often signing or vetoing legislation, or making political appointments, whenever the governor leaves the state. The lieutenant governor is also the President of the California State Senate. In practice, there is a gentlemen's agreement for the Lieutenant Governor not to perform more than perfunctory duties while the Governor is away from the state. This agreement was violated when Mike Curb was in office, as he signed several executive orders at odds with the Brown administration when Brown was out of the state. Court rulings have upheld the lieutenant governor's right to perform the duties and assume all of the prerogatives of governor while the governor is out of the state.[3]","input":"How long can you be governor in california?"},{"output":"early stories by English writer J. R. R. Tolkien","context":"The Book of Lost Tales is a collection of early stories by English writer J. R. R. Tolkien, published as the first two volumes of Christopher Tolkien's 12-volume series The History of Middle-earth, in which he presents and analyzes the manuscripts of those stories, which were the earliest form of the complex fictional myths that would eventually comprise The Silmarillion. Each of the Tales is followed by notes and a detailed commentary by Christopher Tolkien.\\r\\nFor publication the book was split into two volumes: The Book of Lost Tales 1 (1983) and The Book of Lost Tales 2 (1984), but this is simply an editorial division. Both volumes are separated into several \\"Lost Tales\\".\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThough they cover a broadly similar history, the Tales are very different from The Silmarillion. Firstly the Tales are more complex and detailed than The Silmarillion: they are written in a less formal but more archaic style and include many obsolete words and phrases. Secondly the interaction between the different elf-races is profoundly different: the exiled Noldoli (or \\"Gnomes\\", the Noldor of the later histories) suffer decisive defeat much earlier and become slaves of the enemy they had sought to punish. Thus when Thingol feels disdain for Beren it is because the latter is a gnome (not a mortal human) and therefore a thrall of Melko (an earlier name for Melkor).\\r\\nWhile many of the names in the book are identical or close to those in the later versions, some of them bear almost no resemblance to their final forms. Tolkien changed names rather frequently, sometimes with several new variants (rejected in turn) written in a single manuscript. Confusingly, sometimes the name applied to one thing is later used to refer to something quite different, the original use abandoned. For example, the house of Elves called \\"Teleri\\" in The Book of Lost Tales is not the same as that of The Silmarillion (see Teleri). The original usage of \\"Teleri\\" would eventually change until the name became \\"Vanyar\\", while the house of Elves called \\"Solosimpi\\" would inherit the name \\"Teleri\\".\\r\\nIn the frame story of the book, a mortal Man visits the Elvish Isle of Tol Eress?a where he learns the history of its inhabitants. In the earlier versions this man is named Eriol and is of some vague north European origin. In later versions he becomes ?lfwine, an Englishman of the Middle-ages.\\r\\nThere are more changes visible within the book, and it is not internally consistent, partially because even while still writing it Tolkien began rewriting earlier parts as his ideas about the world changed. The Tales were eventually abandoned, but they were resurrected in part as the \\"Sketch of the Mythology\\" which would become the Silmarillion.\\r\\nThere is an inscription in the F?anorian characters (Tengwar, an alphabet Tolkien has devised for High-Elves) in the first pages of every History of Middle-earth volume, written by Christopher Tolkien and describing the contents of the book. The inscription in Book I reads: \\"This is the first part of the Book of the Lost Tales of Elfinesse which Eriol the Mariner learned from the Elves of Tol Eress?a, the Lonely Isle in the western ocean, and afterwards wrote in the Golden Book of Tavrobel. Herein are told the Tales of Valinor, from the Music of the Ainur to the Exile of the Noldoli and the Hiding of Valinor.\\".\\r\\nThe inscription in Book II reads: \\"This is the second part of the Book of the Lost Tales of Elfinesse which Eriol the Mariner learned from the Elves of Tol Eress?a, the Lonely Isle in the western ocean, and afterwards wrote in the Golden Book of Tavrobel.

The word \\"plank\\" depicts a component of an overall political platform, as a metaphorical reference to a basic stage made out of boards or planks of wood. The metaphor can return to its literal origin when public speaking or debates are actually held upon a physical platform.\\r\\nA party platform is sometimes referred to as a manifesto[1] or a political platform. Across the Western world, political parties are highly likely to fulfill their election promises.[2]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe first known use of the word platform was in 1535. The word platform comes from Middle French plate-forme, literally meaning \\"flat form\\".[3] The political meaning of the word to reflect \\"statement of party politics\\" is from 1803, probably originally an image of a literal platform on which politicians gather, stand, and make their appeals.[4]\\r\\nA 2017 study in the American Journal of Political Science found that for 12 countries (Austria, Bulgaria, Canada, Germany, Ireland, Italy, the Netherlands, Portugal, Spain, Sweden, United Kingdom, and United States) found that political parties in government fulfill their election promises to voters to a considerable extent.[2] The study determined that:\\r\\nParties that hold executive office after elections generally fulfill substantial percentages, sometimes very high percentages, of their election pledges, whereas parties that do not hold executive office generally find that lower percentages of their pledges are fulfilled. The fulfillment of pledges by governing executive parties varies across governments in ways that reflect power-sharing arrangements. The main power-sharing arrangement that impacts pledge fulfillment distinguishes between single-party governments and coalitions, not between governments with and without legislative majorities. We found the highest percentages of pledge fulfillment for governing parties in the United Kingdom, Sweden, Portugal, Spain, and Canada, most of which governed in single-party executives. We found lower percentages for governing parties in Germany, the Netherlands, Austria, Bulgaria, Ireland, and Italy, most of which governed in coalitions. Pledge fulfillment by U.S. presidential parties lies at the higher end of coalition governments, which suggests that U.S. presidents are more constrained than governing parties in single-party parliamentary systems, but less constrained than most governing parties in multiparty coalitions.\\r\\nOther research on the United States suggests that Democratic and Republican congresspeople voted in line with their respective party platforms 74% and 89% of the time, respectively.[5]","input":"What is the principal objective of a political party?"},{"output":"eastern Australia","context":"The Sydney funnel-web spider (Atrax robustus) is a species of venomous mygalomorph spider native to eastern Australia, usually found within a 100?km (62?mi) radius of Sydney. It is a member of a group of spiders known as Australian funnel-web spiders. Its bite is capable of causing serious injury or death in humans if left untreated.[3]\\r\\nThe Sydney funnel-web is medium to large in size, with body length ranging from 1 to 5?cm (0.4 to 2?in). Both sexes are glossy and darkly coloured, ranging from blue-black, to black, to brown or dark-plum coloured.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Reverend Octavius Pickard-Cambridge was the first to describe the Sydney funnel-web spider, from a female specimen housed in the British Museum in 1877. Establishing the genus Atrax, he named it Atrax robustus.[4] The species name is derived from the Latin robustus \\"strong/sturdy/mature\\".[5] Some years later, William Joseph Rainbow described a male Sydney funnel-web as a new speciesEuctimena tibialisfrom a spider he found under a log in Turramurra, and another from Mosman. He coined the scientific name from the Ancient Greek euktimenos \\"well built\\" and Latin tibialis \\"of the tibia\\", having noted its prominent tibial spur. In the same paper, he described a female Sydney funnel web as yet another speciesPoikilomorpha montanafrom a specimen collected from Jamison Valley and Wentworth Falls in the Blue Mountains. Its species name was derived from poikilomorphia \\"variety of form\\" referring to the eyes of different sizes, and montana \\"of the mountains\\".[6] In February 1927, a young boy died after being bitten on the hand after playing with a big black spider on the laundry steps of his home in the Sydney suburb of Thornleigh. He fell gravely ill and perished later that evening. Public interest in spiders surged and the police brought the dead spider to the Australian Museum, which Anthony Musgrave identified as Euctimena tibialis. He examined a series of male and female spiders collected around Sydney, and concluded that Euctimena tibialis was the male Atrax robustus due to anatomical similarities and after some males and females had been collected from the same locations.[7] Poikilomorpha montana was classified as the same species in 1988.[2]\\r\\nAs of January?2016[update], Atrax robustus is one of three species of the genus Atrax in the family Hexathelidae.[8] The Sydney funnel-web spider shares its name with some members of the genus Hadronyche. It remains, together with the northern tree funnel-web, the only Australian funnel-web spider known to have inflicted fatal bites on humans.[9]\\r\\nThe Sydney funnel-web is medium to large in size, with body length ranging from 1 to 5?cm (0.4 to 2?in). Both sexes are glossy and darkly coloured, ranging from blue-black, to black, to brown or dark-plum coloured. The carapace covering the cephalothorax is almost hairless and appears smooth and glossy. Another characteristic are finger-like spinnerets at the end of their abdomen.[10] The shorter-lived male is smaller than the female but longer legged.[9] The average leg length for the spider in general is six to seven centimeters.[11]\\r\\nDistribution is centred on Sydney, extending north to the Central Coast and south to the Illawarra region, and west to the Blue Mountains in New South Wales.[2]\\r\\nThe spider can be found in moist microhabitats,[12] including under logs and foliage.[11]\\r\\nSydney funnel-web spiders are mostly terrestrial spiders, favouring habitats with moist sand and clays.\\r\\nThey typically build silk-lined tubular burrow retreats with collapsed \\"tunnels\\" or open \\"funnel\\" entrances from which irregular trip-lines radiate over the ground. In some exceptions, which lack trip-lines but may have trapdoors, the silk entrance tube may be split into two openings, in a Y or T form. Sydney funnel-webs burrow in sheltered habitats where they can find a moist and humid climate, for instance under rocks, logs or borer holes in rough-barked trees.[10][13] The long-lived female funnel-webs spend most of the time in their silk-lined tubular burrow retreats. When potential prey, which includes insects, lizards or frogs, walks across the trip-lines, they rush out, subduing their prey by injecting their venom.[10][13]\\r\\nMales, recognized by the modified terminal segment of the palp, tend to wander during the warmer months of the year, looking for receptive females to mate with.[14] This makes encounters with male specimens more likely as they sometimes wander into backyards or houses, or fall into swimming pools. The spiders can survive such immersion for up to twenty-four hours, trapping air bubbles on hairs around their abdomen.[10] The spiders are mainly active at night, as typical day-time conditions would dehydrate them. During the day, they seek cover in cool, moist hideaways. After heavy rain, spider activity is increased as their burrows may be flooded.[13] When threatened or provoked, funnel-web spiders will display aggressive behaviour, rearing up on their hind legs and displaying their fangs.[13][15] When biting, the funnel-web spiders maintain a tight grip on their victim, often biting repeatedly.[15]\\r\\nFunnel-web spider venom contains a compound known as atracotoxin, an ion channel inhibitor, which makes the venom highly toxic for humans and other primates. However, it does not affect the nervous system of other mammals.[10] These spiders typically deliver a full envenomation when they bite, often striking repeatedly, due to their defensiveness and large chitinous cheliceral fangs. There has been no reported case of severe envenoming by female funnel-web spiders, which is consistent with the finding that the venom of female specimens is less potent than the venom of their male counterparts.[15][16] In the case of severe envenomation, the time to onset of symptoms is less than one hour, with a study about funnel-web spider bites finding a median time of 28 minutes. This same study revealed that children are at a particular risk of severe funnel-web envenoming, with 42% of all cases of severe envenoming being children.[16] There is at least one recorded case of a small child dying within 15 minutes of a bite from a Sydney funnel-web spider.[17]\\r\\nThe antivenom was developed by a team headed by Struan Sutherland at the Commonwealth Serum Laboratories in Melbourne.[18] Since the antivenom became available in 1981,[19] there have been no recorded fatalities from Sydney funnel-web spider bites.[10][16] In September 2012, it was reported that stocks of antivenom were running low, and members of the public were asked to catch the spiders so that they could be milked for their venom. One dose of antivenom requires around 70 milkings from a spider.[20]\\r\\nAs part of its milking programme in January 2016, the Australian Reptile Park received a male Sydney funnel-web spider with a 10-centimetre (4?in) leg span. The spider was described by the park as the largest specimen that it had seen.[11]\\r\\nThe bite of a Sydney funnel-web is initially very painful, with clear fang marks separated by several millimetres.[21] The size of fangs is responsible for the initial pain.[22] In some cases the spider will remain attached until dislodged by shaking or flicking it off.[23]\\r\\nA funnel-web bite is regarded as a medical emergency requiring immediate hospital treatment.[24]\\r\\nCurrent guidelines for antivenom recommend two vials, or four vials if symptoms of envenomation are severe. Patients are assessed every fifteen minutes, with further vials recommended if symptoms do not resolve.[25] The most vials used to treat a bite is 12. The patient was a 10-year-old boy who was bitten in February 2017 by a male funnel-web spider hiding in a shoe.[26]","input":"Where does the sydney funnel web spider live?"},{"output":"Eric Harris","context":"","input":"Who was the shooter at columbine high school?"},{"output":"two Eid holidays","context":"Eid al-Adha (Arabic: ??? ???????, translit.??ؐd al-a??, lit.?'Feast of the Sacrifice', [?i?d ?l??d????]), also called the \\"Sacrifice Feast\\", is the second of two Muslim holidays celebrated worldwide each year, and considered the holier of the two. It honors the willingness of Ibrahim (Abraham) to sacrifice his son, as an act of obedience to God's command. Before Abraham sacrificed his son, God provided a male goat to sacrifice instead. In commemoration of this, an animal is sacrificed and divided into three parts: one third of the share is given to the poor and needy; another third is given to relatives, friends and neighbors; and the remaining third is retained by the family.\\r\\nIn the Islamic lunar calendar, Eid al-Adha falls on the 10th day of Dhu al-Hijjah. In the international (Gregorian) calendar, the dates vary from year to year drifting approximately 11 days earlier each year.\\r\\nEid al-Adha is the latter of the two Eid holidays, the former being Eid al-Fitr. The word \\"Eid\\" appears once in Al-Ma'ida, the fifth sura of the Quran, with the meaning \\"solemn festival\\".[3]\\r\\nLike Eid al-Fitr, Eid al-Adha begins with a prayer of two rakats followed by a sermon (khutbah). Eid al-Adha celebrations start after the descent of the Hujjaj, the pilgrims performing the Hajj, from Mount Arafat, a hill east of Mecca. Eid sacrifice may take place until sunset on the 13th day of Dhu al-Hijjah. The days of Eid have been singled out in the Hadith as \\"days of remembrance\\" and considered the holiest days in the Islamic Calendar. The takbir (days) of Tashriq are from the Maghrib prayer of the 29th of Dhul-Qadah up to the Maghrib prayer of the 13th of Dhu al-Hijjah (thirteen days and nights).\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Arabic term \\"sacrifice feast[4]\\", ?ؐd al-a???/??ؐd ul-a?? is borrowed into Indo-Aryan languages such as Urdu, Hindi, Assamese, Bengali, Gujarati, and Austronesian languages such as Malay and Indonesian (the last often spelling it as Aidil Adha or Idul Adha). Another Arabic word for \\"sacrifice\\" is Qurbani (Arabic: ??????.) The?Semitic root?Q-R-B?(Hebrew:??-?-??) means \\"to be close to someone/something\\"; other words from the root include?qarov,?\\"close\\", and?qerovim,?\\"relatives.\\" The senses of root meaning \\"to offer\\" suggest that the act of offering brings one closer to the receiver of the offering (here, God).

The name is often simply translated into the local language, such as English Feast of the Sacrifice, German Opferfest, Dutch Offerfeest, Romanian S?rb?toarea Sacrificiului, and Hungarian ldozati nnep. In Spanish it is known as Fiesta del Cordero[14] or Fiesta del Borrego (both meaning \\"festival of the lamb\\").\\r\\nAccording to Islamic tradition, the valley of Mecca (in present-day Saudi Arabia) was a dry, rocky, and uninhabited place. God instructed Abraham to bring Hagar (Hjar), his Arabian (Adnan) wife, and Ishmael to Arabia from the land of Canaan.\\r\\nAs Abraham was preparing for his return journey back to Canaan, Hagar asked him, \\"Did God order you to leave us here? Or are you leaving us here to die?\\" Abraham did not even look back. He just nodded, afraid that he would be too sad and that he would disobey God. Hagar said, \\"Then God will not waste us; you can go\\". Though Abraham had left a large quantity of food and water with Hagar and Ishmael, the supplies quickly ran out, and within a few days the two began to feel the pangs of hunger and dehydration.\\r\\nHagar ran up and down between two hills, Safa and Marwa, seven times, in her desperate quest for water. Exhausted, she finally collapsed beside her baby Ishmael and prayed to God for deliverance. Miraculously, a spring of water gushed forth from the earth at the feet of baby Ishmael. Other accounts have the angel Jibra'il, striking the earth and causing the spring to flow in abundance. With this secure water supply, known as the Zamzam Well, they were not only able to provide for their own needs, but were also able to trade water with passing nomads for food and supplies.\\r\\nYears later, Abraham was instructed by God to return from Canaan to build a place of worship adjacent to Hagar's well (the Zamzam Well). Abraham and Ishmael constructed a stone and mortar structure?ÿ  known as the Kaaba?ÿ  which was to be the gathering place for all who wished to strengthen their faith in God. As the years passed, Ishmael was blessed with nubuwwah (prophethood) and gave the nomads of the desert his message of submission to God. After many centuries, Mecca became a thriving desert city and a major center for trade, thanks to its reliable water source, the Zamzam Well.\\r\\nOne of the main trials of Abraham's life was to face the command of God to sacrifice his dearest possession, his son. The son is not named in the Quran, but Muslims believe it to be Ishmael, though it is mentioned as Isaac in the Bible. Upon hearing this command, Abraham prepared to submit to will of God. During this preparation, Shaitan (the Devil) tempted Abraham and his family by trying to dissuade them from carrying out God's commandment, and Abraham drove Satan away by throwing pebbles at him. In commemoration of their rejection of Satan, stones are thrown at symbolic pillars during the Stoning of the Devil during Hajj rites.\\r\\nWhen Abraham attempted to cut his throat, he was astonished to see that his son was unharmed and instead, he found a ram which was slaughtered. Abraham had passed the test by his willingness to carry out God's command.[15][16]\\r\\nThis story is known as the Akedah in Judaism (Binding of Isaac) and originates in the Tora, the first book of Moses (Genesis, Ch. 22). The Quran refers to the Akedah as follows:\\r\\n100 \\"O my Lord! Grant me a righteous (son)!\\"\\r\\n101 So We gave him the good news of a boy ready to suffer and forbear.\\r\\n102 Then, when (the son) reached (the age of) (serious) work with him, he said: \\"O my son! I see in vision that I offer thee in sacrifice: Now see what is thy view!\\" (The son) said: \\"O my father! Do as thou art commanded: thou will find me, if Allah so wills one practising Patience and Constancy!\\"\\r\\n103 So when they had both submitted their wills (to Allah), and he had laid him prostrate on his forehead (for sacrifice),\\r\\n104 We called out to him \\"O Abraham!\\r\\n105 \\"Thou hast already fulfilled the vision!\\"?ÿ  thus indeed do We reward those who do right.\\r\\n106 For this was obviously a trialÿ\\r\\n107 And We ransomed him with a momentous sacrifice:\\r\\n108 And We left (this blessing) for him among generations (to come) in later times:\\r\\n109 \\"Peace and salutation to Abraham!\\"\\r\\n110 Thus indeed do We reward those who do right.\\r\\n111 For he was one of our believing Servants.\\r\\n112 And We gave him the good news of Isaac?ÿ  a prophet?ÿ  one of the Righteous.\\r\\nAbraham had shown that his love for God superseded all others: that he would lay down his own life or the lives of those dearest to him in submission to God's command. Muslims commemorate this ultimate act of sacrifice every year during Eid al-Adha. While Abraham was prepared to make an ultimate sacrifice, God ultimately prevents the sacrifice, additionally signifying that one should never sacrifice a human life, especially not in the name of God.\\r\\nDevotees offer the Eid al-Adha prayers at the mosque.\\r\\nAccording to some fiqh (traditional Islamic law) (although there is some disagreement).\\r\\nThe Eid al-Adha prayer is performed any time after the sun completely rises up to just before the entering of Zuhr time, on the 10th of Dhu al-Hijjah. In the event of a force majeure (e.g. natural disaster), the prayer may be delayed to the 11th of Dhu al-Hijjah and then to the 12th of Dhu al-Hijjah.\\r\\nIn keeping with the sunnah of Muhammad, Muslims are encouraged to prepare themselves for the occasion of Eid. Below is a list of things Muslims are recommended to do in preparation for the Eid al-Adha festival:\\r\\nThe scholars differed concerning the ruling on Eid prayers. There are three scholarly points of view:\\r\\nEid prayers must be offered in congregation. Participation of women in the prayer congregation varies from community to community.[19] It consists of two rakats (units) with seven takbirs in the first Raka'ah and five Takbirs in the second Raka'ah. For Sunni Muslims, Salat al-Eid differs from the five daily canonical prayers in that no adhan (call to prayer) or iqama (call) is pronounced for the two Eid prayers.[20][21] The salat (prayer) is then followed by the khutbah, or sermon, by the Imam.\\r\\nAt the conclusion of the prayers and sermon, Muslims embrace and exchange greetings with one other (Eid Mubarak), give gifts and visit one another. Many Muslims also take this opportunity to invite their non-Muslim friends, neighbours, co-workers and classmates to their Eid festivities to better acquaint them about Islam and Muslim culture.[22]\\r\\nThe l-hamdu is recited from the dawn of the ninth of Dhu al-Hijjah to the thirteenth, and consists of:[23]\\r\\nAllah is the greatest, Allah is the greatest,\\r\\nThere is no god but Allah\\r\\nAllah is greatest, Allah is greatest\\r\\nand to Allah goes all praise.\\r\\nMultiple variations of this recitation exist across the Muslim world.\\r\\nMen, women, and children are expected to dress in their finest clothing to perform Eid prayer in a large congregation in an open waqf (\\"stopping\\") field called Eidgah or mosque. Affluent Muslims who can afford it sacrifice their best halal domestic animals (usually a cow, but can also be a camel, goat, sheep, or ram depending on the region) as a symbol of Abraham's willingness to sacrifice his only son. The sacrificed animals, called a??iya (Arabic: ??????), known also by the Perso-Arabic term qurbni, have to meet certain age and quality standards or else the animal is considered an unacceptable sacrifice. In Pakistan alone nearly ten million animals are slaughtered on Eid days costing over US$2.0 billion.[24]\\r\\nThe meat from the sacrificed animal is preferred to be divided into three parts. The family retains one third of the share; another third is given to relatives, friends, and neighbors; and the remaining third is given to the poor and needy. Though the division is purely optional wherein either all the meat may be kept with oneself or may be given away to poor or needy, the preferred method as per sunnah of Muhammad is dividing it in three parts.\\r\\nThe regular charitable practices of the Muslim community are demonstrated during Eid al-Adha by concerted efforts to see that no impoverished person is left without an opportunity to partake in the sacrificial meal during these days. Hajj is also performed in Saudi Arabia before Eid ul Adha and millions of Muslims perform Hajj. On the event of Hajj lots of Muslims slaughter animals and divide a major part of the meat for poor people.\\r\\nDuring Eid al-Adha, distributing meat amongst the people, chanting the takbir out loud before the Eid prayers on the first day and after prayers throughout the four days of Eid, are considered essential parts of this important Islamic festival. In some countries, families that do not own livestock can make a contribution to a charity that will provide meat to those who are in need.\\r\\nWhile Eid al-Adha is always on the same day of the Islamic calendar, the date on the Gregorian calendar varies from year to year since the Islamic calendar is a lunar calendar and the Gregorian calendar is a solar calendar. The lunar calendar is approximately eleven days shorter than the solar calendar. Each year, Eid al-Adha (like other Islamic holidays) falls on one of about two to four different Gregorian dates in different parts of the world, because the boundary of crescent visibility is different from the International Date Line.\\r\\nThe following list shows the official dates of Eid al-Adha for Saudi Arabia as announced by the Supreme Judicial Council. Future dates are estimated according to the Umm al-Qura calendar of Saudi Arabia.[2] The Umm al-Qura is just a guide for planning purposes and not the absolute determinant or fixer of dates. Confirmations of actual dates by moon sighting are applied on the 29th day of the lunar month prior to Dhu al-Hijjah[25] to announce the specific dates for both Hajj rituals and the subsequent Eid festival. The three days after the listed date are also part of the festival. The time before the listed date the pilgrims visit the Mount Arafat and descend from it after sunrise of the listed day.\\r\\nIn many countries, the start of any lunar Hijri month varies based on the observation of new moon by local religious authorities, so the exact day of celebration varies by locality.\\r\\n^a The son is not named in the Quran, but most modern Muslims adhere to the view that it was Ismail (Ishmael). Sayings attributed to Muhammad and Islamic commentaries differ on whether Abraham's older son Ishmael, or his younger son, Ishaq, was asked to be sacrificed in the vision. A chain of narration from Yunnus b. Abd al-Ala attributed to Abdallah b. Abbas: \\"The Prophet in a conversation in which he said, 'Then we ransomed him with a tremendous victim.' And he also said, 'He is Isaac.'\\" [26] The Sunni commentary Tafsir Ibn Kathir: \\"Ibn Jarir narrated that Ibn 'Abbas said, 'The one who was ransomed was Ismail, peace be upon him.

This continued into the 1930s, when Rowntree's shifted focus and production onto its Black Magic and Dairy Box brands. With the promotion of alternative products the Kit Cat brand decreased and was eventually discontinued.[4] The original four-finger bar was developed after a worker at Rowntree's York Factory put a suggestion in a recommendation box for a snack that \\"a man could take to work in his pack\\".[5] The bar launched on 29 August 1935, under the title of Rowntree's Chocolate Crisp (priced at 2d), and was sold in London and throughout Southern England.[6]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe product's official title of Rowntree's Chocolate Crisp was renamed Kit Kat Chocolate Crisp in 1937, the same year that Kit Kat began to incorporate \\"Break\\" into its recognisable advertising strategy[definition needed][4] The colour scheme and first flavour variation to the brand came in 1942, owing to World War II, when food shortages prompted an alteration in the recipe.

The brand further expanded in the 1970s when Rowntree created a new distribution factory in Germany to meet European demand, and established agreements to distribute the brand in the USA and Japan through the Hershey and Fujiya companies, respectively.[4]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn June 1988, Swiss company Nestl acquired Kit Kat through the purchase of Rowntree's. This gave Nestl global control over the brand, except in the US,[8] and production and distribution increased with new facilities in Japan and additional manufacturing operations set up in Malaysia, India and China.[4]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Hershey Company has a licence to produce Kit Kat bars in the United States which dates from 1970, when Hershey executed a licensing agreement with Rowntree. Nestl, which has a substantial presence in the US, had to honour the licensing agreement when it bought Rowntree in 1988 which allowed Hershey to retain the Kit Kat licence so long as Hershey was not sold. As Kit Kat is one of Hershey's top five brands in the US market, the Kit Kat licence was a key factor in Hershey's failed attempt to attract a serious buyer in 2002.[9][10]\\r\\n\\r\\nVariants in the traditional chocolate bar first appeared in 1996 when Kit Kat Orange, the first flavour variant, was introduced in the United Kingdom. Its success was followed by several varieties including mint and caramel, and in 1999 Kit Kat Chunky was launched and received favourably by international consumers. Variations on the traditional Kit Kat have continued to develop throughout the 2000s. In 2000, Nestl acquired Fujiya's share of the brand in Japan, and also expanded its marketplace in Japan, Russia, Turkey, and Venezuela, in addition to markets in Eastern and Central Europe.[4] Throughout the decade Kit Kat has introduced dozens of flavours and line extensions within specific consumer markets, and celebrated its 75th anniversary on 10 October 2009.[citation needed]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe traditional bar has four fingers which each measure approximately 1 centimetre (0.4?in) by 9 centimetres (3.5?in). A two-finger bar was launched in the 1930s, and has remained the company's best-selling biscuit brand ever since.[6] The 1999 Kit Kat Chunky (known as Big Kat and Kit Kat Extra Crispy in the US) has one large finger approximately 2.5 centimetres (1?in) wide. Kit Kat bars contain varying numbers of fingers depending on the market, ranging from the half-finger sized Kit Kat Petit in Japan, to the three-fingered variants in Arabia, to the twelve-finger family-size bars in Australia and France. Kit Kat bars are sold individually and in bags, boxes and multi-packs. In Ireland, France, the UK and America Nestl also produces a Kit Kat ice cream, and in Australia and Malaysia, Kit Kat Drumsticks.[citation needed]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 2010, a new S5?million manufacturing line was opened by Nestl in York. This will produce more than a billion Kit Kat bars each year.[11]\\r\\n\\r\\nKit Kat bars are produced in 16 countries by Nestl: Brazil, Mexico, United Kingdom, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, South Africa, Germany, Russia, Japan, China, Malaysia, Thailand, India, Turkey, United Arab Emirates, Bulgaria and Algeria. Kit Kat bars in the United States are produced under licence by The Hershey Company, a Nestl competitor, due to a prior licensing agreement with Rowntree.\\r\\nThe year 2003 was a turning point for the Kit Kat bar as well as the confectionery industry in general. The popularity of low carb diets and the push to healthier eating stifled sales growth in many parts of the world. In addition, fierce competition from Cadbury's newly formed Dairy Milk superbrand also contributed to sales of the Kit Kat decreasing considerably in its home market of the UK, and threatened to depose it from its No.1 position.[12][13] The solution adopted by Nestl and others was to increase dramatically the number of new and unique variations of their confections and market them as limited or special editions, whereby they would usually only be available for a few months at a time so as not to impact the sales of their permanent edition counterparts.[14] The strategy initially reversed the decline of the Kit Kat[15] and has been adopted worldwide by Nestl, Hershey, Mars and others with similar success.[16][17]\\r\\n\\r\\nThis has resulted in many new flavours and varieties of the Kit Kat and other confections appearing globally since then. While some flavours have been hits, many have flopped, alienating some consumers in the process, causing Nestl to scale back on new releases.[citation needed]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn September 2006, Nestl announced that they would be cutting 645 jobs in their York factory and moving Smarties production to their Hamburg factory in which two thirds of production was already taking place. They stated that this move would allow for a S20 million investment to modernise the antiquated York factory and improve Kit Kat production.[18]\\r\\n\\r\\nAs dark chocolate has seen increased demand and favour worldwide because of its purported health benefits, September 2006 saw the launch of the four-finger Kit Kat Fine Dark in the United Kingdom as a permanent edition, as well as new packaging for the entire brand.[citation needed] Hershey had sold the four-finger Kit Kat Dark in the US several years previously as a limited edition, and has begun doing so again.[19]\\r\\n\\r\\nNestl now manufactures two finger Kit Kats with natural flavourings, and for the first time, Kit Kats in this format are suitable for vegans.[citation needed] It is not known at this date whether or not other varieties will follow suit. In 2014, Kit Kat was ranked the third best selling chocolate bar in the United Kingdom, after Dairy Milk and Galaxy.[20]\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen first introduced, the original Rowntree's Chocolate Crisp bar had a red wrapper, which briefly became blue between 1945ÿ1947. As a result of milk shortages after the end of World War II, the milk chocolate coating was suspended and a dark chocolate was used instead during that period.[citation needed]\\r\\n\\r\\nSince its introduction in the 1970s, the Hershey's Kit Kat packaging and advertising in the United States differed from the branding used in every other country where it was sold. In 2002, Hershey Kit Kats adopted the slanted ellipse logo used worldwide by Nestl, though the ellipse was red and the text white. The US version of \\"Kit Kat Chunky\\" is known as \\"Big Kat\\".\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the United Kingdom, the product has traditionally been wrapped in silver foil and an outer paper band. In 2001, flow wrap plastic was substituted as the confectionery's packaging.[21]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn Norway, a similar product is manufactured by Mondelz International and sold as Kvikk Lunsj; Kvikk Lunsj XXL is similar to a Kit Kat Chunky.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter launching in the 1930s, Rowntree's Chocolate Crisp was originally advertised as \\"the biggest little meal\\" and \\"the best companion to a cup of tea\\". During World War II, Kit Kat was depicted as a valuable wartime foodstuff, with the slogan \\"what active people need\\". 'Kitty the Kat' arrived in the late 1940s to emphasise the \\"rich full cream milk\\" qualities of the bar and, thanks to contemporary improvements in production methods, also highlighted the new and improved 'snap' by responding to a biscuit being broken off screen. The first Kit Kat poster appeared in 1951, and the first colour TV advertisement appeared in 1969.\\r\\n\\r\\nSince 1958, the slogan for the Kit Kat in the UK and elsewhere has been \\"Have a break... have a Kit Kat\\". However, in 1995, Nestl sought to trademark the \\"Have a break\\" portion. After a ten-year legal battle, which was contested by rival Mars, the European Court of Justice ruled on 7 July 2005 to send the case back to the British courts.[22] In 2004, Nestl UK used the slogan \\"Make the most of your break\\",[23] but later returned to the original slogan.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe United States also used the short-lived slogan, \\"Tastes So Good, You'll Roar\\", in the early 1980s. The TV commercial most known from this slogan involves a young man biting into one of the Kit Kat bars in a grocery store, and roaring like a lion so loudly the whole store shakes violently, knocking items from the shelves. Another short-lived US slogan was \\"That's What You Want\\", whose television adverts showed people pulling unlikely foodstuffs from their pockets or purses, before rejecting them in favour of a Kit Kat.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe \\"classic\\" American version of the \\"Gimme a Break\\" Kit Kat jingle (in use in the US since 1986) was written by Ken Shuldman (copy) and Michael A. Levine (music) for the DDB Advertising Agency. Versions of the original have been covered by Carrie Underwood, Shawn Colvin, and many studio singers, as well as people who have appeared on-camera in the commercials. The jingle was cited in a study by University of Cincinnati researcher James J. Kellaris as one of the top ten \\"earworms\\" ÿ bits of melody that become stuck in your head. Another version of the advertising jingle 'Gimme a break' created for Kit Kat \\"Factory\\" commercial in the US was an original recording by Andrew W.K. W.K. was hired to write a new musical version for their \\"Gimme a break\\" slogan. Variations on the Andrew W.K. advertisement included executive dance routines in corporate offices and a network newsroom. However, the \\"classic\\" song has also been used again since the newer version first aired in 2004.\\r\\n\\r\\nA 1989 United Kingdom advertisement for Kit Kat, in which a zoo photographer \\"takes a break\\" from waiting for pandas to appear in an enclosure and misses them performing a dance routine, came in 30th in Channel 4's \\"100 Greatest Adverts\\" poll in 2000.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Maltese tour boat MV Lady Davinia had a distinctive red and white Kit Kat paint scheme before she sank in 2008.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn late 2004 through to the end of 2006, Nestl Rowntree sponsored the English football club York City F.C.. As a result, the club's home-ground, Bootham Crescent, was renamed to KitKat Crescent.[24]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn a 2012 advertising campaign in the UK and Ireland, several new flavours of Chunky Kit Kat were marketed, with consumers being asked to vote for their favourite. Selecting from white chocolate, double chocolate, peanut butter, and orange, Peanut butter was the winner by having 47% of votes. A similar campaign occurred in 2013 with mint, coconut, hazelnut and chocolate fudge.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn September 2013, it was announced that version 4.4 of Google's Android mobile operating system would be named \\"KitKat\\".[25] Google licensed the name from Nestl, with no money changing hands.[26] A promotion ran in numerous countries with specially branded Android Kit Kat bars to win Nexus 7 devices and Google Play Store credit.[27]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn December 2009, it was announced that the four finger variety of Kit Kat would use Fairtrade chocolate (at least in Britain and Ireland) from January 2010.[28] It has also been announced that the Fairtrade Kit Kat promotion will be extended to the finger edition as of January 2010.[29]\\r\\n\\r\\nDuring the first three weeks of Big Brother Series 7, Channel 4 conducted a promotion in conjunction with Nestl to distribute 100 \\"golden tickets\\" randomly throughout Kit Kats, in a style reminiscent of the story Charlie and the Chocolate Factory. Members of the public finding these tickets were permitted to use them to give themselves a chance to become a Big Brother housemate and bypass the standard auditions process.\\r\\n\\r\\nGolden ticket holders were invited to a television show where one of them, Susie Verrico, was chosen to enter the House by Aisleyne Horgan-Wallace, picking a ball out of a machine at random.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis contest caused some controversy, with the Advertising Standards Authority saying that the terms and conditions of the draw should have been made clearer in related advertisements, and that an independent adjudicator should have been present before and during the draw.[30]\\r\\n\\r\\nMany varieties of Kit Kat have existed, either permanently or as limited editions, such as those sold to commemorate festivals such as St. Valentine's Day.[citation needed] In Japan, Nestl has introduced over 200 different flavours since 2000,[31] including ginger ale, soy sauce, creme brulee, green tea, sake, and banana.[32] The flavours are designed to appeal to younger buyers,[33] and are often bought as good-luck gifts as the brand name echoes the Japanese phrase \\"Kitto Katsu\\", roughly translating as \\"surely win.\\"[31]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Kit Kat Orange was the first flavour variant to be introduced in the United Kingdom, in 1996 and 1998 in Ireland. It was followed in 1997 by the Kit Kat Dark and Kit Kat Mint.[citation needed] All three were available as permanent editions of the two-finger multipack in the United Kingdom, along with the Kit Kat Original, the Kit Kat White, and from 2012 the Kit Kat Cookies & Cream.\\r\\n\\r\\nA wide variety of promotional items exist, ranging from traditional merchandise (such as mugs, pens, oven gloves and tea-towels) to less common items such as coats for small dogs. Recently in Japan,[when?] Kit Kats have come packaged with CD singles, and a special limited edition double pack of Kit Kat Crispy Monogatari came bundled with a mini book featuring six short stories, one of which was written by Koji Suzuki, author of the Ring cycle series. In Japan, Kit Kats are also available in jars that are dispensed from vending machines.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe 'standard' Kit Kat finger bars can come in a variety of presentations and nutritional values. The bars can come in a miniature form of two finger mini bars, or a larger standard four, or in some cases, three, fingered bars.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe standard size has been upgraded in several cases up to a 'monster Size' bar, which can include up to five or eight fingers. Large single-fingered \\"Chunky Kit Kats\\" were launched in the United Kingdom in 1998 and have been sold in a variety of flavours. The market for Chunky Kit Kats has also expanded to Canada.\\r\\n\\r\\nOther forms and shapes include \\"Choc'n'Go\\" individually wrapped fingers from France, a twelve-finger \\"Family Block which is available in New Zealand, \\" in Australia, round bite-sized \\"Pop Choc\\" pieces, square \\"Kubes\\", praline-filled \\"Senses\\", a yoghurt with Kit Kat pieces, and a Kit Kat ice cream cone.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the 1980s, a Kit Kat with five shorter fingers was sold in vending machines in the UK.[34]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Japanese Bake 'N Tasty Mini Kit Kats Custard Pudding Flavour was launched in 2014. The bar must be baked in an oven before consumption, and the surface sugar caramelises in the process.[35]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 2015, a new luxury and giftable variant of Kit Kat called Kit Kat Rubies was launched in Malaysia. Comes with the box of 20 small bars, the Kit Kat Rubies bar made with the premium chocolate truffle cream and imported roasted hazelnut pieces.[36]\\r\\n\\r\\nAs of 2017, U.S. variants include the standard and king-size four-finger bars, standard bars covered with white or dark chocolate, snack-size orange-covered bars for Halloween, bagged wrapped one-finger miniatures (original and assorted), unwrapped minis, a redesigned Big Kat, and a king-size Big Kat (two of the new Big Kat bars).[37]\\r\\n\\r\\nKit Kat has opened a Chocolatory in the Melbourne Central Shopping Centre in Melbourne, Australia. The dedicated shop allows customers to use touch screens to craft their own Kit Kat from a selection of chocolates and ingredients which are then created for them on site while they wait.[38]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn March 2010, Kit Kat was targeted for a boycott by Greenpeace for using palm oil, which the environmental organisation claimed resulted in destruction of forest habitats for orangutans in Indonesia.[39] A YouTube video by Greenpeace went viral[40] and Nestl announced a partnership with The Forest Trust to establish \\"responsible sourcing guidelines\\" and ensure that its products did not have a deforestation footprint. They aimed to achieve a fully sustainable method of palm oil harvesting by 2015.[41]\\r\\n\\r\\nKit Kat Milk Chocolate is made for the North American market with the ingredient PGPR (polyglycerol polyricinoleate, E476, AKA Palsgaard PGPR 4150),[42] which is used to reduce the amount of cocoa butter needed and as an emulsifier.[43] The FDA has determined it to be safe for humans in amounts up to 7.5 milligrams per kilogram of body weight.  \\"Liver and kidney enlargement was noticed at much higher doses.\\"[44]\\r\\n\\r\\nOriginal Kit Kat ingredients unless otherwise stated, listed by decreasing weight: milk chocolate (sugar, milk ingredients, cocoa butter, cocoa mass, whey powder, lactose, soya lecithin, polyglycerol polyricinoleate, natural flavour), wheat flour, sugar, modified palm oil, cocoa, sodium bicarbonate, soya lecithin, yeast,  and natural flavour.\\r\\n\\r\\nMilk chocolate (66%) (sugar, cocoa butter, cocoa mass, dried whole milk, cocoa mass, lactose and proteins from whey, whey powder, emulsifier (sunflower lecithin), butterfat, flavouring), wheat flour, sugar, vegetable fat, cocoa mass, yeast, raising agent (sodium bicarbonate), salt, emulsifier (soya lecithin), flavourings.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 2006, the UK four-finger Kit Kat contained 233 dietary calories (kcal) (975 kilojoules).

The Battle of Dagorlad was fought there, at the end of the Second Age, when the Last Alliance met the forces of Mordor with many casualties on both sides amongst Elves, Men, and Orcs. Through the years, the marshland began to encroach upon parts of the battlefield, and engulfed the dead that lay there.\\r\\nThe Marshes are also known as 'The Mere of Dead Faces'; they are described in The Passage of the Marshes in The Two Towers as \\"dreary and wearisome.

He later went to University of Nebraska. He played basketball and studied sociology. He was a key member of the 1995-96 team which won the NIT defeating St. Josephs in the finals.[3] He finished his Nebraska career ranked third all-time in assists (432), fourth in three-pointers made (145) and attempted (407), fifth in steals (154) and seventh in scoring (1,577). Declaring for the NBA draft after his junior season, he led the Cornhuskers in assists in each of his three seasons and finished his career tied with Dave Hoppen for most games with 30 or more points (7).\\r\\nLue opted for early entry into the 1998 NBA draft. He was selected 23rd overall by the Denver Nuggets but was traded on draft night to the Los Angeles Lakers with Tony Battie in exchange for Nick Van Exel. His first three years with the Lakers were disappointing. His playing time was limited and he suffered from injuries in 2000. However, Lue excelled in the 2001 playoffs. Due to his quickness, he was specifically used to guard Allen Iverson during Game 1 of the NBA Finals. The Lakers would lose Game 1, but would sweep the next four games and go on to get a 4ÿ1 series victory over Iverson's 76ers, giving them the second of three consecutive titles.\\r\\nIn the off-season of 2001, Lue signed with the Washington Wizards, where he got considerably more playing time and subsequently became a better point guard. He played with the Orlando Magic in 2003ÿ04 where he got to play a lot of minutes alongside Tracy McGrady, however the team had the worst record in the NBA that season: 21ÿ61. After the season Lue, along with Juwan Howard and McGrady were traded to the Houston Rockets for Steve Francis, Cuttino Mobley and Kelvin Cato. In Houston, Lue did not get much playing time because of the number of point guards the Rockets had on their roster. He was traded mid-season to the Atlanta Hawks for Jon Barry.

A parsec is defined as the distance at which one astronomical unit subtends an angle of one arcsecond,[1] which corresponds to 7005648000000000000?648000/ astronomical units. One parsec is equal to about 3.26 light-years (30?trillion km or 19?trillion miles) in length. The nearest star, Proxima Centauri, is about 1.3 parsecs (4.2 light-years) from the Sun.[2] Most of the stars visible to the unaided eye in the night sky are within 500 parsecs of the Sun.[citation needed]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe parsec unit was probably first suggested in 1913 by the British astronomer Herbert Hall Turner.[3] Named as a portmanteau of the parallax of one arcsecond, it was defined so as to make calculations of astronomical distances quick and easy for astronomers from only their raw observational data. Partly for this reason, it is the unit preferred in astronomy and astrophysics, though the light-year remains prominent in popular science texts and common usage. Although parsecs are used for the shorter distances within the Milky Way, multiples of parsecs are required for the larger scales in the universe, including kiloparsecs (kpc) for the more distant objects within and around the Milky Way, megaparsecs (Mpc) for mid-distance galaxies, and gigaparsecs (Gpc) for many quasars and the most distant galaxies.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn August 2015, the IAU passed Resolution B2, which as part of the definition of a standardized absolute and apparent bolometric magnitude scale, mentioned an existing explicit definition of the parsec as exactly 7005648000000000000?648000/ astronomical units, or approximately 7016308567758149137?3.08567758149137G1016 metres (based on the IAU 2012 exact SI definition of the astronomical unit). This corresponds to the small-angle definition of the parsec found in many contemporary astronomical references.[4][5]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe parsec is defined as being equal to the length of the longer leg of an extremely elongated imaginary right triangle in space. The two dimensions on which this triangle is based are its shorter leg, of length one astronomical unit (the average Earth-Sun distance), and the subtended angle of the vertex opposite that leg, measuring one arc second. Applying the rules of trigonometry to these two values, the unit length of the other leg of the triangle (the parsec) can be derived.\\r\\n\\r\\nOne of the oldest methods used by astronomers to calculate the distance to a star is to record the difference in angle between two measurements of the position of the star in the sky. The first measurement is taken from the Earth on one side of the Sun, and the second is taken approximately half a year later, when the Earth is on the opposite side of the Sun. The distance between the two positions of the Earth when the two measurements were taken is twice the distance between the Earth and the Sun. The difference in angle between the two measurements is twice the parallax angle, which is formed by lines from the Sun and Earth to the star at the distant vertex. Then the distance to the star could be calculated using trigonometry.[6] The first successful published direct measurements of an object at interstellar distances were undertaken by German astronomer Friedrich Wilhelm Bessel in 1838, who used this approach to calculate the 3.5-parsec distance of 61 Cygni.[7]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe parallax of a star is defined as half of the angular distance that a star appears to move relative to the celestial sphere as Earth orbits the Sun. Equivalently, it is the subtended angle, from that star's perspective, of the semimajor axis of the Earth's orbit. The star, the Sun and the Earth form the corners of an imaginary right triangle in space: the right angle is the corner at the Sun, and the corner at the star is the parallax angle. The length of the opposite side to the parallax angle is the distance from the Earth to the Sun (defined as one astronomical unit (au), and the length of the adjacent side gives the distance from the sun to the star. Therefore, given a measurement of the parallax angle, along with the rules of trigonometry, the distance from the Sun to the star can be found. A parsec is defined as the length of the side adjacent to the vertex occupied by a star whose parallax angle is one arcsecond.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe use of the parsec as a unit of distance follows naturally from Bessel's method, because the distance in parsecs can be computed simply as the reciprocal of the parallax angle in arcseconds (i.e. if the parallax angle is 1 arcsecond, the object is 1?pc from the Sun; if the parallax angle is 0.5 arcseconds, the object is 2?pc away; etc.). No trigonometric functions are required in this relationship because the very small angles involved mean that the approximate solution of the skinny triangle can be applied.\\r\\n\\r\\nThough it may have been used before, the term parsec was first mentioned in an astronomical publication in 1913. Astronomer Royal Frank Watson Dyson expressed his concern for the need of a name for that unit of distance. He proposed the name astron, but mentioned that Carl Charlier had suggested siriometer and Herbert Hall Turner had proposed parsec.[3] It was Turner's proposal that stuck.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the diagram above (not to scale), S represents the Sun, and E the Earth at one point in its orbit. Thus the distance ES is one astronomical unit (au). The angle SDE is one arcsecond (1/3600 of a degree) so by definition D is a point in space at a distance of one parsec from the Sun. Through trigonometry, the distance SD is calculated as follows:\\r\\n\\r\\nBecause the astronomical unit is defined to be 7011149597870700000?149597870700?m,[8] the following can be calculated:\\r\\n\\r\\nA corollary states that a parsec is also the distance from which a disc one astronomical unit in diameter must be viewed for it to have an angular diameter of one arcsecond (by placing the observer at D and a diameter of the disc on ES).\\r\\n\\r\\nThe length of the parsec used in IAU 2015 Resolution B2[9] (exactly 7005648000000000000?648000/ astronomical units) corresponds exactly to that derived using the small-angle calculation. This differs from the classic inverse-tangent definition by about 200?km, i.e. only after the 11th significant figure. As the astronomical unit was defined by the IAU (2012) as an exact SI length in metres, so now the parsec corresponds to an exact SI length in metres. To the nearest meter, the small-angle parsec corresponds to 30,856,775,814,913,673 m.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe parallax method is the fundamental calibration step for distance determination in astrophysics; however, the accuracy of ground-based telescope measurements of parallax angle is limited to about 0.01?arcseconds, and thus to stars no more than 100?pc distant.[10] This is because the Earth's atmosphere limits the sharpness of a star's image.[11] Space-based telescopes are not limited by this effect and can accurately measure distances to objects beyond the limit of ground-based observations. Between 1989 and 1993, the Hipparcos satellite, launched by the European Space Agency (ESA), measured parallaxes for about 7005100000000000000?100000 stars with an astrometric precision of about 0.97?milliarcseconds, and obtained accurate measurements for stellar distances of stars up to 1000?pc away.[12][13]\\r\\n\\r\\nESA's Gaia satellite, which launched on 19 December 2013, is intended to measure one billion stellar distances to within 20?microarcseconds, producing errors of 10% in measurements as far as the Galactic Centre, about 8000?pc away in the constellation of Sagittarius.[14]\\r\\n\\r\\nDistances expressed in fractions of a parsec usually involve objects within a single star system. So, for example:\\r\\n\\r\\nDistances expressed in parsecs (pc) include distances between nearby stars, such as those in the same spiral arm or globular cluster. A distance of 1000 parsecs (3262 light-years) is commonly denoted by the kiloparsec (kpc). Astronomers typically use kiloparsecs to express distances between parts of a galaxy, or within groups of galaxies. So, for example:\\r\\n\\r\\nA distance of one?million parsecs is commonly denoted by the megaparsec (Mpc). Astronomers typically express the distances between neighbouring galaxies and galaxy clusters in megaparsecs.\\r\\n\\r\\nGalactic distances are sometimes given in units of Mpc/h (as in \\"50/h?Mpc\\", also written \\"50 Mpc h?1\\"). h is a parameter in the range 0.5 < h < 0.75 reflecting the uncertainty in the value of the Hubble constant H for the rate of expansion of the universe: h = H/100?km/s/Mpc. The Hubble constant becomes relevant when converting an observed redshift z into a distance d using the formula d  c/H G z.[15]\\r\\n\\r\\nOne gigaparsec (Gpc) is one billion parsecs  one of the largest units of length commonly used. One gigaparsec is about 3.26?billion light-years, or roughly 1/14 of the distance to the horizon of the observable universe (dictated by the cosmic background radiation). Astronomers typically use gigaparsecs to express the sizes of large-scale structures such as the size of, and distance to, the CfA2 Great Wall; the distances between galaxy clusters; and the distance to quasars.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor example:\\r\\n\\r\\nTo determine the number of stars in the Milky Way, volumes in cubic kiloparsecs[a] (kpc3) are selected in various directions. All the stars in these volumes are counted and the total number of stars statistically determined. The number of globular clusters, dust clouds, and interstellar gas is determined in a similar fashion. To determine the number of galaxies in superclusters, volumes in cubic megaparsecs[a] (Mpc3) are selected. All the galaxies in these volumes are classified and tallied. The total number of galaxies can then be determined statistically. The huge Bo?tes void is measured in cubic megaparsecs.[18]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn physical cosmology, volumes of cubic gigaparsecs[a] (Gpc3) are selected to determine the distribution of matter in the visible universe and to determine the number of galaxies and quasars. The Sun is the only star in its cubic parsec,[a] (pc3) but in globular clusters the stellar density could be from 100 to 1000 per cubic parsec.","input":"How many astronomical units are in one parsec?"},{"output":"Les Twins","context":"World of Dance is an American reality competition series, hosted by Jenna Dewan Tatum and executive produced by Jennifer Lopez.

The installation is located in Montgomery, Alabama, US. Occupying the site of the first Wright Flying School, it was named in honor of Second Lieutenant William C. Maxwell, a native of Atmore, Alabama.\\r\\nThe base is the headquarters of Air University (AU), a major component of Air Education and Training Command (AETC), and is the U.S. Air Force's center for Joint Professional Military Education (PME). The host wing for Maxwell-Gunter is the 42d Air Base Wing (42 ABW).\\r\\nThe Air Force Reserve Command's 908th Airlift Wing (908 AW) is a tenant unit and the only operational flying unit at Maxwell. The 908 AW and its subordinate 357th Airlift Squadron (357 AS) operates eight C-130H Hercules aircraft for theater airlift in support of combatant commanders worldwide. As an AFRC airlift unit, the 908th is operationally gained by the Air Mobility Command (AMC).\\r\\nGunter Annex is a separate installation under the 42 ABW. Originally known as Gunter Field, it later became known as Gunter Air Force Station (Gunter AFS) when its runways were closed and its operational flying activity eliminated. It was later renamed Gunter Air Force Base (Gunter AFB) during the 1980s. As a hedge against future Base Realignment and Closure (BRAC) closure actions, Gunter AFB was consolidated under Maxwell AFB in March 1992 to create a combined installation known as Maxwell/Gunter AFB.\\r\\nMaxwell AFB is also the site of Federal Prison Camp, Montgomery, a minimum security facility for male inmates.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nToward the end of February 1910, the Wright Brothers decided to open one of the world's earliest flying schools at the site that would subsequently become Maxwell AFB. The Wrights taught the principles of flying, including take-offs, balancing, turns, and landings. The Wright Flying School closed on May 26, 1910.[1]\\r\\nThe field served as a repair depot during World War I. In fact, the depot built the first plane made in Montgomery and exhibited it at the field on September 20, 1918. Repair activity at the depot was sharply curtailed at the end of the war.\\r\\nThe Aviation Repair Depot's land was leased by the U.S. Army during World War I, and later purchased on January 11, 1920 for $34,327. Diminished postwar activity caused the U.S. War Department in 1919 to announce that it planned to close thirty-two facilities around the country, including the Aviation Repair Depot. In 1919, the Aviation Repair Depot had a $27,000 monthly civilian payroll in 1919, and was a vital part of the city's economy. The loss of the field would have been a serious blow to the local Montgomery economy. The field remained open into the early 1920s only because the War Department was slow in closing facilities. After this initial reprieve, the War Department announced in 1922 that facilities on the original closure list would indeed close in the very near future. City officials were not surprised to hear that Aviation Repair Depot remained on the list, because 350 civilian employees had been laid off in June 1921. On November 8, 1922, the War Department redesignated the depot as Maxwell Field in honor of Atmore, Alabama native, Second Lieutenant William C. Maxwell. On 12 August 1920, engine trouble forced Lieutenant Maxwell to attempt to land his DH-4 in a sugarcane field in the Philippines. Maneuvering to avoid a group of children playing below, he struck a flagpole hidden by the tall sugarcane and was killed instantly. On the recommendation of his former commanding officer, Major Roy C. Brown, the Montgomery Air Intermediate Depot, Montgomery, Alabama, was renamed Maxwell Field.[2] In 1923, it was one of three U.S. Army Air Service aviation depots. Maxwell Field repaired aircraft engines in support of flying training missions such as those at Taylor Field, southeast of Montgomery.\\r\\nMaxwell Field, as most Army air stations and depots developed during World War I, was on leased properties with temporary buildings being the mainstay of construction. These temporary buildings/shacks were built to last two to five years. By the mid-1920s, these dilapidated wartime buildings had become a national disgrace. Congressional investigations also showed that the manning strength of the U.S. Army's air arm was seriously deficient. These critical situations eventually led to the Air Corps Act of 1926 and the two major programs that dramatically transformed Army airfields. The Air Corps Act changed the name and status of the Army Air Service to the U.S. Army Air Corps and authorized a five-year expansion program. In the late 1920s and early 1930s, this program and its companion, the 1926 Army Housing Program, produced well-designed, substantial, permanent buildings and infrastructure at all Army airfields retained after World War I.\\r\\nTaking up the cause of Maxwell Field was freshman Congressman J. Lister Hill, a World War I veteran who served with the 17th and 71st U.S. Infantry Regiments. He, as well as other Montgomery leaders, recognized the historical significance of the Wright Brothers first military flying school and the potential of Maxwell Field to the local economy. In 1925 Hill, a member of the House Military Affairs Committee, affixed an amendment to a military appropriations bill providing $200,000 for the construction of permanent buildings at Maxwell Field. This amendment did not have the approval of the War Department nor the Army Air Corps, but as a result of this massive spending on Maxwell Field, the War Department kept it open. Hill recognized that to keep Maxwell Field open, it needed to be fiscally or militarily valuable to the War Department.\\r\\nIn September 1927, Hill met with Major General Mason M. Patrick, chief of the Army Air Corps, and his assistant, Brigadier General James E. Fechet, to discuss the placement of an attack group at Maxwell Field. Both made it clear that Maxwell Field was too close to Montgomery and was not a suitable location for an attack group. In fact, they asked Hill as \\"a friend of the Air Corps\\" not to \\"embarrass\\" the Corps by asking that the group be placed there. They warned that if he persisted, they would \\"very much oppose\\" the effort. However, General Patrick not wanting to alienate the new and up and coming Congressman (who was also a member of the House Military Affairs Committee) sought to appease Hill by offering to create an observation squadron at Maxwell Field. Hill welcomed the gesture; however, the creation of an observation squadron fell short of the long term on-going mission sought by Hill for Maxwell Field.\\r\\nHill continued to argue for the attack group to be placed at Maxwell Field. He argued that because of the permanent buildings scheduled to be built, it would be fiscally advantageous for the placement of the attack group at Maxwell Field. Hill's arguments were an extension of ones that had been presented to him by Major Roy S. Brown, former commandant of Maxwell Field from 1922-1925. In 1927, Major Brown was the commander of the Air Corps Tactical School located at Langley Field, Virginia. Major Brown urged Hill to keep his name out of it because of the easily traceable insider information. Hill, frustrated with the lack of positive response from Generals Patrick and Fechet, moved up the chain of command and passed on the correspondence he had with General Fechet to Secretary of War Dwight Davis, Assistant Secretary of War for Air F. Trubee Davison, and Army Chief of Staff Charles P. Summerall. His request to them was given the answer: that they would give the matter \\"full consideration.\\"\\r\\nThe depot's first official flying mission was carried out after that. Observation missions originated there in 1927ÿ1929. Pilots from the field were also involved in completing the first leg of a test designed to establish an airmail route between the Gulf Coast and the northern Great Lakes area. The successful test played a major role in the eventual establishment of permanent airmail service in the Southeast.\\r\\nBy early 1928, the decision of basing a new Army Air Corps attack group had come down to Shreveport, Louisiana, and Montgomery. Both cities vied for the federal money to be spent in their respective local areas, but Shreveport the more economically developed city than its counterpart Montgomery won the day. In April 1928 Hill, via his contacts in the War Department, found out that Montgomery would not be getting the attack group. Flexing his congressional muscle, Hill persuaded Assistant Secretary Davidson and now chief of the Air Corps Major General Fechet to hold off the official announcement until Montgomery had a second look by the War Department. During the interim Montgomery leaders had set forth actions to acquire over 600 acres (2?km2) for Maxwell Fields expansion in hopes of wooing the War Department into placing the attack group in Montgomery.\\r\\nIn May 1928 General Benjamin Foulois, General Fechet's assistant, during an inspection visit with Third Army commander General Frank Parker to Maxwell Field mentioned that the Air Corps Tactical School would be moving from Langley Field to a still undecided location. During his stay General Foulois met with local Chamber of Commerce chairman Jesse Hearin and Maxwell Field post commandant, Major Walter R. Weaver. Hearin and Weaver touted the feasibility of Maxwell Field and the Montgomery area for the placement of the attack group at Maxwell Field. However, General Foulois guided the conversation towards the impending movement of the Air Corps Tactical School and he favored Maxwell Field for the new home. Hearin immediately worked up an option on another one thousand acres (4?km2) for the Air Corps Tactical School should Montgomery not be favored with the attack group.\\r\\nIn July 1928, word \\"via rumor\\" of the decision for the establishment of an attack group came out that Shreveport was indeed the victor of the final decision. In December 1928, after much debate and political maneuvering it was announced officially by the Assistant Secretary of War that Shreveport would be getting the attack group and that the Army Air Corps Tactical School (ACTS) would be coming to Maxwell Field. The move to Maxwell Field from Langley Field was initially expected to increase Maxwell Field's population by eighty officers and 300 enlisted. It was expected that the ACTS would be to the Army Air Corps what Fort Benning, Georgia was to the infantry.\\r\\nOn January 15, 1929, it was announced that the ACTS would be twice as large as originally planned. On February 11, it was announced that $1,644,298 had been allowed for ACTS construction. This was not including an additional $324,000 the Secretary of War had approved previously for non-commissioned officer barracks and a school building after a conference with Congressman Hill. On March 12, a conference between a Major Kennedy, Chief of Buildings and Grounds of the Army Air Corps and commandant of the ACTS, and Congressman Lister Hill to determine the locations of the buildings and types of construction. In March 1929, personnel at Maxwell provided flood relief to citizens of Montgomery. This was the first time at which food and supplies were airdropped by U.S. military forces during a major civilian emergency.\\r\\nOn July 9, 1929, Captain Walter J. Reed and a battery of attorneys checked titles for the land. The War Department also announced the same day that the plan had changed to where the ACTS would now be four times as large as originally planned with 200 officers and 1,000 enlisted men. At the time, this made Maxwell Field the largest (as far as personnel) Army Air Corps installation in the southeast. Approximately 300 signatures to the deed of the land occupied by the Air Corps Tactical School were signed, of which one was signed by a minor. Chairman of the Montgomery Chamber of Commerce James Hearin said, \\"...several cases had to be taken to court.\\" Despite the obvious rush for signatures, by October 5, deeds to the land were signed and mailed to the War Department.\\r\\nOn December 17, 1929, Congressman Lister Hill introduced a bill to appropriate $320,000 for the acquiring of 1,075 acres (4?km2) of land in Montgomery County as a part of an expansion program for Maxwell Field. This was a particularly bold move at the time by Hill because of the stock market crash. Effects of the crash had yet to take place; however, the panic caused by the crash had certainly captured Montgomerys attention.\\r\\nOn January 25, 1930, President Herbert Hoover asked Congress to re-appropriate an additional $100,000 for the main school building at Maxwell Field. President Hoovers policy was to speed public works to offset unemployment. In February 1930, Congressman Hills resolution was passed in the House of Representatives and 80 acres (320,000?m2) were to be added to Maxwell Field for expansion purposes. George B. Ford and Frederick Law Olmsted, Jr., were hired by the Army Quartermaster Corps and they designed the overall layout of ACTS at Maxwell. Ford used an approach that clustered similar functions together. This technique provided plenty of open space and gave each cluster a distinct appearance.\\r\\nOn September 17, 1931, the first ACTS training occurred at Maxwell Field. Forty-one students met at 8:40?a.m. in the operations office conference room for general instruction. Classes were divided into sections, with some pilots sent on check flights, while others were sent out to become familiar with the surrounding countryside to become familiar with emergency landing field locations.\\r\\nOn the morning of September 22, 1931, opening exercises of the Air Corps Tactical School were held. On September 24, the Air Corps Tactical School was officially launched. The address was made by Major General James E. Fechet, chief of the Army Air Corps also attending were Congressman Lister Hill and commandant of the Air Corps Tactical School, Major John F. Curry. General Fechet, along with announcing his impending retirement, declared that the forty-one student officers could be future generals of the Air Corps. At a later luncheon, General Fechet also lauded Montgomerys attitude toward the Air Corps.\\r\\nThe 1931-1932 faculty included Army Air Corps (AC), Army Infantry (Inf), Army Chemical Warfare Service (CWS), and Army Field Artillery (FA) instructors. Initially, the school's curriculum reflected the dominating influence of Brigadier General Billy Mitchell. Mitchell was a strong believer in the importance of gaining and maintaining air superiority during a conflict. He argued strongly for pursuit (e.g., \\"fighter\\") aircraft in combination with bombers and regarded enemy pursuit forces as the most serious threat to successful bombing operations and felt that the task of American pursuit was not necessarily to escort bombers, but to also seek out and attack enemy fighters. During the first five years of the school's operation, Mitchell's beliefs formed the basis for instruction at the tactical school. However, by the mid-1930s the school's emphasis had shifted from pursuit to bombardment aviation.\\r\\nOn July 16, 1933, Congressman Lister Hill secured approval from the War Department for $1,650,075 for immediate spending at Maxwell Field. Hills request was justified by increased enrollment at the Air Corps Tactical School and the desperate need for employment for the local Montgomery population. At the start of October 1933 bids opened for four construction projects that were to start immediately; 1933-1934 construction at Maxwell Field later employed an average of 500 plus workers.\\r\\nThe Air Corps Tactical School opened July 15, 1931. The school evolved into the Army Air Corps (later, U.S. Air Force's) first tactical center until the imminence of American involvement in World War II forced a suspension of classes in June 1940 that resulted in permanent closure of the school. One of the school's notable achievements was its development of two aerial acrobatic teams: the \\"Three Men on a Flying Trapeze\\", put together by then-Captain Claire L. Chennault in 1932, and the Skylarks in 1935.\\r\\nIn 1940, it was announced that the installation was to be converted into a pilot-training center. On 8 July 1940 the Army Air Corps redesignated its training center at Maxwell Field, Alabama as the Southeast Air Corps Training Center. The Southeast Air Corps Training Center at Maxwell handled flying training (basic, primary and advanced) at airfields in the Eastern United States.\\r\\nAn Air Force Pilot School (preflight) was also activated which instructed Aviation Cadets in the mechanics and physics of flight and required the cadets to pass courses in mathematics and the hard sciences. Then the cadets were taught to apply their knowledge practically by teaching them aeronautics, deflection shooting, and thinking in three dimensions. In June 1941, the Army Air Corps became the U.S. Army Air Forces, and on 8 January 1943, the War Department constituted and redesignated the school as the 74th Flying Training Wing (preflight).\\r\\nDuring following years, Maxwell was home to six different schools that trained U.S. military aviators and their support teams for wartime service. As World War II progressed, the number of required pilot trainees declined, and the Army Air Forces decided not to send more aircrew trainees to Maxwell Field. The following known sub-bases and auxiliaries were constructed to support the flying school:\\r\\nOn 31 July 1943, the Southeast Air Corps Training Center was redesignated as the Eastern Flying Training Command. Also in July, the Army Air Forces announced a specialized school for pilots of four-engine aircraft. The first B-24 Liberator landed at the field later that month and in early 1945, B-29 Superfortress bomber training replaced the B-24 program.\\r\\nTraining at Maxwell continued until 15 December 1945, when the Eastern Flying Training Command was inactivated and was consolidated into the Central Flying Training Command at Randolph Field, Texas.\\r\\nAir University, an institution providing continuing military education for Army Air Forces personnel, was established at Maxwell in 1946, prior to the U.S. Air Force becoming an independent service the following year. Today, it remains the main focus of base activities at Maxwell. In 1992, the 3800th Air Base Wing (3800 ABW) was disbanded and the 502d Air Base Wing (502 BW) took over as the host wing, which two years later gave way to the current 42d Air Base Wing.\\r\\nAs home of the Air University, Maxwell became the postgraduate academic center of the U.S. Air Force. Air University evolved first as an institution influenced by air power as shaped in World War II, then by the Cold War under the threat of nuclear annihilation, and by air power as applied during the Cold War's Korean and Vietnam conflicts. In the early twenty-first century, the emphasis shifted to air power's role in confronting international and transnational terrorism by both state-sponsored and non-state actors. AU grew materially from inadequate quarters, classrooms, and instructional technology into a campus that is as modern and up-to-date as those of any other in the U. S. armed forces. Construction of Maxwell's Academic Circle, Air University's primary education complex, began in the 1950s. Its centerpiece was the Air University Library, eventually one of several major libraries on a military installation.\\r\\nOver the years, other activities were established or relocated to Maxwell AFB, to include Headquarters, Civil Air Patrol - USAF; the Air Force Reserve's 908th Tactical Air Support Group (908 TASG), which evolved into the present day 908th Airlift Wing; the Ira C. Eaker Center for Professional Development; the Air Force Financial Systems Operation office (SAF/FM); the Center for Aerospace Doctrine, Research and Education (CADRE); and the Air Force Historical Research Agency, a support organization and repository for air power scholars and AU students. In 1994, Air Force Officer Training School (OTS) was also relocated from Lackland AFB/Medina Annex, Texas to Maxwell AFB, joining the national headquarters of the Air Force's other non-Academy officer accession source, Air Force ROTC.[3]\\r\\nMaxwell AFB appears in the video game Tom Clancy's EndWar as a possible battlefield.[4]\\r\\n?This article incorporates?public domain material from the Air Force Historical Research Agency website http://www.afhra.af.mil/.","input":"What air force base is in montgomery alabama?"},{"output":"the elimination of poverty and racial injustice","context":"The Great Society was a set of domestic programs in the United States launched by Democratic President Lyndon B. Johnson in 1964ÿ65. The main goal was the elimination of poverty and racial injustice. President Johnson first used the term \\"Great Society\\" during a speech at Ohio University, then unveiled the program in greater detail at an appearance at University of Michigan.\\r\\nNew major spending programs that addressed education, medical care, urban problems, rural poverty, and transportation were launched during this period. The program and its initiatives were subsequently promoted by him and fellow Democrats in Congress in the 1960s and years following. The Great Society in scope and sweep resembled the New Deal domestic agenda of Franklin D. Roosevelt.\\r\\nSome Great Society proposals were stalled initiatives from John F. Kennedy's New Frontier.[citation needed] Johnson's success depended on his skills of persuasion, coupled with the Democratic landslide in the 1964 election that brought in many new liberals to Congress, making the House of Representatives in 1965 the most liberal House since 1938.[1]\\r\\nAnti-war Democrats complained that spending on the Vietnam War choked off the Great Society. While some of the programs have been eliminated or had their funding reduced, many of them, including Medicare, Medicaid, the Older Americans Act and federal education funding, continue to the present. The Great Society's programs expanded under the administrations of Republican Presidents Richard Nixon and Gerald Ford.[2]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nUnlike the old New Deal, which was a response to a severe financial and economic calamity, the Great Society initiatives came during a period of rapid economic growth. Kennedy proposed an across-the-board tax cut lowering the top marginal income tax rate in the United States by 20%, from 91% to 71%, which was enacted in February 1964, three months after Kennedy's assassination, under Johnson. The tax cut also significantly reduced marginal rates in the lower brackets as well as for corporations. The gross national product rose 10% in the first year of the tax cut, and economic growth averaged a rate of 4.5% from 1961 to 1968.[3]\\r\\nJohnson's tax cut measure triggered[citation needed] what one historian described as \\"the greatest prosperity of the postwar years.\\" GNP increased by 7% in 1964, 8% in 1965, and 9% in 1966. The unemployment rate fell below 5%, and by 1966 the number of families with incomes of $7,000 a year or more had reached 55%, compared with 22% in 1950. In 1968, when John Kenneth Galbraith published a new edition of The Affluent Society, the average income of the American family stood at $8,000, double what it had been a decade earlier.[4]\\r\\nDisposable personal income rose 15% in 1966 alone. Federal revenues increased dramatically from $94 billion in 1961 to $150 billion in 1967. As the Baby Boom generation aged, two and a half times more Americans would enter the labor force between 1965 and 1980 than between 1950 and 1965.\\r\\nSocial crisis confronted the nation. Racial segregation persisted in the Southern United States. The Civil Rights Movement was gathering momentum, and in 1964, urban riots began within black neighborhoods in New York City and Los Angeles. By 1968 hundreds[citation needed] of cities had major African-American riots that caused a severe conservative political backlash. Foreign affairs were generally quiet except for the Vietnam War, which escalated from limited involvement in 1963 to a large-scale military operation in 1968 that soon overshadowed the Great Society.\\r\\nJohnson's first public reference to the \\"Great Society\\" took place during a speech to students on May 7, 1964, at Ohio University in Athens, Ohio:\\r\\nAnd with your courage and with your compassion and your desire, we will build a Great Society. It is a society where no child will go unfed, and no youngster will go unschooled.[5]\\r\\nHe later formally presented his specific goals for the Great Society in another speech at the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor, Michigan, on May 22, 1964.\\r\\nWe are going to assemble the best thought and broadest knowledge from all over the world to find these answers. I intend to establish working groups to prepare a series of conferences and meetingson the cities, on natural beauty, on the quality of education, and on other emerging challenges. From these studies, we will begin to set our course toward the Great Society.[6]\\r\\nKennedy had employed several task forces composed of scholars and experts to craft New Frontier legislation and to deal with foreign affairs. The reliance on experts appealed to Johnson, in part because the task forces would work in secret and outside of the existing governmental bureaucracy and directly for the White House staff. Almost immediately after the Ann Arbor speech, 14 separate task forces began studying nearly all major aspects of United States society under the guidance of presidential assistants Bill Moyers and Richard N. Goodwin.\\r\\nThe average task force had five to seven members and generally was composed of governmental experts and academics.[7] Only one of the task forces on the 1965 legislative program addressed foreign affairs and foreign economic policy. The rest were charged with domestic policy (agriculture, anti-recession policy, civil rights, education, efficiency and economy, health, income maintenance policy, intergovernmental fiscal cooperation, natural resources, pollution of the environment, preservation of natural beauty, transportation, and urban problems).\\r\\nAfter the task force reports were submitted to the White House, Moyers began a second round of review. The recommendations were circulated among the agencies concerned and were evaluated by new committees composed mostly of government officials. Experts on relations with Congress were also drawn into the deliberations to get the best advice on persuading the Congress to pass the legislation. In late 1964 Johnson reviewed these initial Great Society proposals at his ranch with Moyers and Budget Director Kermit Gordon. Many of them were included in Johnsons State of the Union Address delivered on January 4, 1965.\\r\\nThe task-force approach, combined with Johnson's electoral victory in 1964 and his talents in obtaining congressional approval, were widely credited with the success of the legislation agenda in 1965. Critics later cited the task forces as a factor in a perceived elitist approach to Great Society programs. Also, because many of the initiatives did not originate from outside lobbying, some programs had no political constituencies that would support their continued funding.\\r\\nWith the exception of the Civil Rights Act of 1964,[8] the Great Society agenda was not a widely discussed issue during the 1964 presidential election campaign. Johnson won the election with 61% of the vote, and he carried all but six states. Democrats gained enough seats to control more than two-thirds of each chamber in the Eighty-ninth Congress, with a 68ÿ32 margin in the Senate and a 295ÿ140 margin in the House of Representatives.[4]\\r\\nThe political realignment allowed House leaders to alter rules that had allowed Southern Democrats to kill New Frontier and civil rights legislation in committee, which aided efforts to pass Great Society legislation. In 1965, the first session of the Eighty-Ninth Congress created the core of the Great Society. It began by enacting long-stalled legislation such as Medicare and federal aid to education and then moved into other areas, including high-speed mass transit, rental supplements, truth in packaging, environmental safety legislation, new provisions for mental health facilities, the Teacher Corps, manpower training, the Head Start program, aid to urban mass transit, a demonstration cities program, a housing act that included rental subsidies, and an act for higher education.[4] The Johnson Administration submitted 87 bills to Congress, and Johnson signed 84, or 96%, arguably the most successful legislative agenda in US congressional history.[9]\\r\\nHistorian Alan Brinkley has suggested that the most important domestic achievement of the Great Society may have been its success in translating some of the demands of the civil rights movement into law.[10] Four civil rights acts were passed, including three laws in the first two years of Johnson's presidency. The Civil Rights Act of 1964[8] forbade job discrimination and the segregation of public accommodations.\\r\\nThe Voting Rights Act of 1965 assured minority registration and voting. It suspended use of literacy or other voter-qualification tests that had sometimes served to keep African-Americans off voting lists and provided for federal court lawsuits to stop discriminatory poll taxes. It also reinforced the Civil Rights Act of 1964[8] by authorizing the appointment of federal voting examiners in areas that did not meet voter-participation requirements. The Immigration and Nationality Services Act of 1965 abolished the national-origin quotas in immigration law. The Civil Rights Act of 1968 banned housing discrimination and extended constitutional protections to Native Americans on reservations.\\r\\nThe most ambitious and controversial part of the Great Society was its initiative to end poverty. The Kennedy Administration had been contemplating a federal effort against poverty. Johnson, who, as a teacher, had observed extreme poverty in Texas among Mexican-Americans, launched an \\"unconditional war on poverty\\" in the first months of his presidency with the goal of eliminating hunger, illiteracy, and unemployment from American life. The centerpiece of the War on Poverty was the Economic Opportunity Act of 1964, which created an Office of Economic Opportunity (OEO) to oversee a variety of community-based antipoverty programs.\\r\\nFederal funds were provided for special education schemes in slum areas, including help in paying for books and transport, while financial aid was also provided for slum clearances and rebuilding city areas. In addition, the Appalachian Regional Development Act of 1965 created jobs in one of the most impoverished regions of the country.[citation needed] The Economic Opportunity Act of 1964 provided various methods through which young people from poor homes could receive job training and higher education.[11]\\r\\nThe OEO reflected a fragile consensus among policymakers that the best way to deal with poverty was not simply to raise the incomes of the poor but to help them better themselves through education, job training, and community development. Central to its mission was the idea of \\"community action\\", the participation of the poor in framing and administering the programs designed to help them.\\r\\nThe War on Poverty began with a $1 billion appropriation in 1964 and spent another $2 billion in the following two years. It gave rise to dozens of programs, among them the Job Corps, whose purpose was to help disadvantaged youth develop marketable skills; the Neighborhood Youth Corps, established to give poor urban youths work experience and to encourage them to stay in school; Volunteers in Service to America (VISTA), a domestic version of the Peace Corps, which placed concerned citizens with community-based agencies to work towards empowerment of the poor; the Model Cities Program for urban redevelopment; Upward Bound, which assisted poor high school students entering college; legal services for the poor; and the Food Stamp Act of 1964 (which expanded the federal food stamp program).[12]\\r\\nPrograms included the Community Action Program, which initiated local Community Action Agencies charged with helping the poor become self-sufficient; and Project Head Start, which offered preschool education for poor children. In addition, funding was provided for the establishment of community health centers to expand access to health care,[13] while major amendments were made to Social Security in 1965 and 1967 which significantly increased benefits, expanded coverage, and established new programs to combat poverty and raise living standards.[14] In addition, average AFDC payments were 35% higher in 1968 than in 1960, but remained insufficient and uneven.[15]\\r\\nThe most important educational component of the Great Society was the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965, designed by Commissioner of Education Francis Keppel. It was signed into law on April 11, 1965, less than three months after it was introduced. It ended a long-standing political taboo by providing significant federal aid to public education, initially allocating more than $1 billion to help schools purchase materials and start special education programs to schools with a high concentration of low-income children. During its first year of operation, the Act authorized a $1.1 billion program of grants to states, for allocations to school districts with large numbers of children of low income families, funds to use community facilities for education within the entire community, funds to improve educational research and to strengthen state departments of education, and grants for purchase of books and library materials.[16] The Act also established Head Start, which had originally been started by the Office of Economic Opportunity as an eight-week summer program, as a permanent program.\\r\\nThe Higher Education Facilities Act of 1963, which was signed into law by Johnson a month after becoming president,[17] authorized several times more college aid within a five-year period than had been appropriated under the Land Grant College in a century. It provided better college libraries, ten to twenty new graduate centers, several new technical institutes, classrooms for several hundred thousand students, and twenty-five to thirty new community colleges a year.[18]\\r\\nThis major piece of legislation was followed by the Higher Education Act of 1965, which increased federal money given to universities, created scholarships and low-interest loans for students, and established a national Teacher Corps to provide teachers to poverty-stricken areas of the United States. The Act also began a transition from federally funded institutional assistance to individual student aid.\\r\\nIn 1964, basic improvements in the National Defense Education Act were achieved, and total funds available to educational institutions were increased. The yearly limit on loans to graduate and professional students was raised from $1,000 to $2,500, and the aggregate limit was raised from $5,000 to $10,000. The program was extended to include geography, history, reading, English, and civics, and guidance and counselling programs were extended to elementary and public junior high schools.[12]\\r\\nThe Bilingual Education Act of 1968 offered federal aid to local school districts in assisting them to address the needs of children with limited English-speaking ability until it expired in 2002.[19]\\r\\nThe Great Society programs also provided support for postgraduate clinical training for both nurses and physicians committed to work with disadvantaged patients in rural and urban health clinics.[20]\\r\\nThe Social Security Act of 1965 authorized Medicare and provided federal funding for many of the medical costs of older Americans.[21] The legislation overcame the bitter resistance, particularly from the American Medical Association, to the idea of publicly funded health care or \\"socialized medicine\\" by making its benefits available to everyone over sixty-five, regardless of need, and by linking payments to the existing private insurance system.\\r\\nIn 1966 welfare recipients of all ages received medical care through the Medicaid program. Medicaid was created on July 30, 1965 under Title XIX of the Social Security Act of 1965. Each state administers its own Medicaid program while the federal Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) monitors the state-run programs and establishes requirements for service delivery, quality, funding, and eligibility standards.\\r\\nA number of improvements were made to the Social Security program in terms of both coverage and adequacy of benefits. The Tax Adjustment Act of 1966 included a provision for special payments under the social security program to certain uninsured individuals aged 72 and over. The Social Security Amendments of 1965 included a 7% increase in cash benefits, a liberalization of the definition of disability, a liberalization of the amount a person can earn and still get full benefits (the so-called retirement test), payment of benefits to eligible children aged 18ÿ21 who are attending school, payment of benefits to widows at age 60 on an actuarially reduced basis, coverage of self-employed physicians, coverage of tips as wages, liberalization of insured-status requirements for persons already aged 72 or over, an increase to $6,600 the amount of earnings counted for contribution and benefit purposes (the contribution and benefit base), and an increase in the contribution rate schedule.[14]\\r\\nThe Social Security Amendments of 1967 included a 13% increase in old-age, survivors, and disability insurance benefits, with a minimum monthly benefit of $55 for a person retiring at or after age-65 (or receiving disability benefits), an increase from $35 to $40 in the special age-72 payments, an increase from $1,500 to $1,680 in the amount a person may earn in a year and still get full benefits for that year, monthly cash benefits for disabled widows and disabled dependent widowers at age 50 at reduced rates, a liberalization of the eligibility requirements for benefits for dependents and Survivors of women workers, and an alternative insured-status test for workers disabled before age 31.[14]\\r\\nAdditionally, new guidelines for determining eligibility for disability insurance benefits, additional non-contributory wage credits for servicemen, broadened coverage of clergy and members of religious orders who have not taken a vow of poverty, and an increase in the contribution and benefit base from $6,600 to $7,800, beginning in 1968. In addition, the Social Security Amendments of 1967 provided the first major amendments of Medicare. These social security amendments extended the coverage of the program to include certain services previously excluded, simplified reimbursement procedures under both the hospital and medical insurance plans, and facilitated the administrative procedures concerning general enrollment periods.[14]\\r\\nThe Food Stamp Act of 1964 made the program permanent, while the Social Security Amendments of 1967 specified that at least 6% of monies for maternal and child health should be spent on family planning. By 1967, the federal government began requiring state health departments to make contraceptives available to all adults who were poor. Meal programs for low-income senior citizens began in 1965, with the federal government providing funding for \\"congregate meals\\" and \\"home-delivered meals.\\"[22] The Child Nutrition Act, passed in 1966, made improvements to nutritional assistance to children such as in the introduction of the School Breakfast Program.[23]\\r\\nIn September 1965, Johnson signed the National Foundation on the Arts and Humanities Act into law, creating both the National Endowment for the Arts and National Endowment for the Humanities as separate, independent agencies. Lobbying for federally funded arts and humanities support began during the Kennedy Administration. In 1963 three scholarly and educational organizationsthe American Council of Learned Societies (ACLS), the Council of Graduate Schools in America, and the United Chapters of Phi Beta Kappajoined together to establish the National Commission on the Humanities. In June 1964, the commission released a report that suggested that the emphasis placed on science endangered the study of the humanities from elementary schools through postgraduate programs. In order to correct the balance, it recommended \\"the establishment by the President and the Congress of the United States of a National Humanities Foundation.\\"[24]\\r\\nIn August 1964, Representative William S. Moorhead of Pennsylvania proposed legislation to implement the commission's recommendations. Support from the White House followed in September, when Johnson lent his endorsement during a speech at Brown University. In March 1965, the White House proposed the establishment of a National Foundation on the Arts and Humanities and requested $20 million in start-up funds. The commission's report had generated other proposals, but the White House's approach eclipsed them. The administration's plan, which called for the creation of two separate agencies each advised by a governing body, was the version that the Congress approved. Richard Nixon dramatically expanded funding for NEH and NEA.[24]\\r\\nAfter the First National Conference on Long-Range Financing of Educational Television Stations in December 1964 called for a study of the role of noncommercial education television in society, the Carnegie Corporation agreed to finance the work of a 15-member national commission. Its landmark report, Public Television: A Program for Action, published on January 26, 1967, popularized the phrase \\"public television\\" and assisted the legislative campaign for federal aid. The Public Broadcasting Act of 1967, enacted less than 10 months later, chartered the Corporation for Public Broadcasting as a private, non-profit corporation.\\r\\nThe law initiated federal aid through the CPB for the operation, as opposed to the funding of capital facilities, of public broadcasting. The CPB initially collaborated with the pre-existing National Educational Television system, but in 1969 decided to start the Public Broadcasting Service (PBS). A public radio study commissioned by the CPB and the Ford Foundation and conducted from 1968 to 1969 led to the establishment of National Public Radio, a public radio system under the terms of the amended Public Broadcasting Act.\\r\\nTwo long-planned national cultural and arts facilities received federal funding that would allow for their completion through Great Society legislation. A National Cultural Center, suggested during the Franklin Roosevelt Administration and created by a bipartisan law signed by Dwight Eisenhower, was transformed into the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts, a living memorial to the assassinated president. Fundraising for the original cultural center had been poor prior to legislation creating the Kennedy Center, which passed two months after the president's death and provided $23 million for construction. The Kennedy Center opened in 1971.[25]\\r\\nIn the late 1930s the U.S. Congress mandated a Smithsonian Institution art museum for the National Mall, and a design by Eliel Saarinen was unveiled in 1939, but plans were shelved during World War II. A 1966 act of the U.S. Congress established the Hirshhorn Museum and Sculpture Garden as part of the Smithsonian Institution with a focus on modern art, in contrast to the existing National Art Gallery. The museum was primarily federally funded, although New York financier Joseph Hirshhorn later contributed $1 million toward building construction, which began in 1969. The Hirshhorn opened in 1974.[26]\\r\\nTransportation initiatives started during President Johnson's term in office included the consolidation of transportation agencies into a cabinet-level position under the Department of Transportation.[27] The department was authorized by Congress on October 15, 1966 and began operations on April 1, 1967. Congress passed a variety of legislation to support improvements in transportation including The Urban Mass Transportation Act of 1964 which provided $375 million for large-scale urban public or private rail projects in the form of matching funds to cities and states and created the Urban Mass Transit Administration (now the Federal Transit Administration), High Speed Ground Transportation Act of 1965 which resulted in the creation of high-speed rail between New York and Washington, and the National Traffic and Motor Vehicle Safety Act of 1966a bill largely taken credit for by Ralph Nader, whose book Unsafe at Any Speed he claims helped inspire the legislation.\\r\\nIn 1964, Johnson named Assistant Secretary of Labor Esther Peterson to be the first presidential assistant for consumer affairs.\\r\\nThe Cigarette Labeling and Advertising Act of 1965 required packages to carry warning labels. The Motor Vehicle Safety Act of 1966 set standards through creation of the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. The Fair Packaging and Labeling Act requires products identify manufacturer, address, clearly mark quantity and servings. The statute also authorized the HEW and the FTC to establish and define voluntary standard sizes. The original would have mandated uniform standards of size and weight for comparison shopping, but the final law only outlawed exaggerated size claims.\\r\\nThe Child Safety Act of 1966 prohibited any chemical so dangerous that no warning can make it safe. The Flammable Fabrics Act of 1967 set standards for children's sleepwear, but not baby blankets.\\r\\nThe Wholesome Meat Act of 1967 required inspection of meat which must meet federal standards. The Truth-in-Lending Act of 1968 required lenders and credit providers to disclose the full cost of finance charges in both dollars and annual percentage rates, on installment loan and sales. The Wholesome Poultry Products Act of 1968 required inspection of poultry which must meet federal standards. The Land Sales Disclosure Act of 1968 provided safeguards against fraudulent practices in the sale of land. The Radiation Safety Act of 1968 provided standards and recalls for defective electronic products.\\r\\nJoseph A. Califano, Jr. has suggested that the Great Society's main contribution to the environment was an extension of protections beyond those aimed at the conservation of untouched resources.[28] In a message he transmitted to Congress, President Johnson said:\\r\\nThe air we breathe, our water, our soil and wildlife, are being blighted by poisons and chemicals which are the by-products of technology and industry. The society that receives the rewards of technology, must, as a cooperating whole, take responsibility for [their] control. To deal with these new problems will require a new conservation. We must not only protect the countryside and save it from destruction, we must restore what has been destroyed and salvage the beauty and charm of our cities. Our conservation must be not just the classic conservation of protection [against] development, but a creative conservation of restoration and innovation.\\r\\nAt the behest of Secretary of the Interior Stewart Udall, the Great Society included several new environmental laws to protect air and water. Environmental legislation enacted included:\\r\\nIn 1964, the quality of the housing program was improved by requiring minimum standards of code enforcement, providing assistance to dislocated families and small businesses and authorizing below market interest loans for rehabilitating housing in urban renewal areas.[12] The Housing and Urban Development Act of 1965 included important elements such as rent subsidies for low-income families, rehabilitation grants to enable low-income homeowners in urban renewal areas to improve their homes instead of relocating elsewhere, and improved and extended benefits for relocation payments.[16] The Demonstration Cities Act of 1966 established a new program for comprehensive neighborhood renewal, with an emphasis on strategic investments in housing renovation, urban services, neighborhood facilities, and job creation activities.[30][31]\\r\\nA number of measures were introduced to improve socio-economic conditions in rural areas. Under Title III of the 1964 Economic Opportunity Act, Special Programs to Combat Rural Poverty, the Office for Economic Opportunity was authorized to act as a lender of last resort for rural families who needed money to help them permanently increase their earning capacity. Loans could be made to purchase land, improve the operation of family farms, allow participation in cooperative ventures, and finance non-agricultural business enterprises, while local cooperatives which served low-income rural families could apply for another category of loans for similar purposes.[32]\\r\\nTitle III also made loans and grants available to local groups to improve housing, education, and child care services for migrant farm workers, while Titles I and II also included potentially important programs for rural development. Title I established the Job Corps which enrolled school dropouts in community service projects: 40% of the corpsmen were to work in a Youth Conservation Corps to carry out resource conservation, beautification, and development projects in the National Forests and countryside. Arguably more important for rural areas were the Community Action Programs authorized by Title II. Federal money was allocated to States according to their needs for job training, housing, health, and welfare assistance, and the States were then to distribute their shares of the Community Action grants on the basis of proposals from local public or non-profit private groups.[32]\\r\\nThe Public Works and Economic Development Act of 1965 reorganized the Areas Redevelopment Administration (ARA) into the Economic Development Administration (EDA), and authorized $3.3 billion over 5 years while specifying seven criteria for eligibility. The list included low median family income, but the 6% or higher unemployment applied to the greatest number of areas, while the Act also mentioned outmigration from rural areas as a criterion. In an attempt to go beyond what one writer described as \\"ARAs failed scattershot approach\\" of providing aid to individual counties and inspired by the European model of regional development, the EDA encouraged counties to form Economic Development Districts (EDDs) as it was recognized that individual distressed counties (called RAs or Redevelopment Areas) lacked sufficient resources for their own development.[32]\\r\\nEDDs encompassed from 5 to 15 counties and both planned and implemented development with EDA funding and technical assistance, and each EDD had a \\"growth center\\" (another concept borrowed from Europe) called a redevelopment center if it was located in an RA or development center if in another county. With the exception of the growth centers, EDD counties were ineligible for assistance unless they were RAs, but they were all expected to benefit from \\"coordinated districtwide development planning.\\"[32]\\r\\nThe Amendments made to the 1931 Davis-Bacon Act in 1964 extended the prevailing wage provisions to cover fringe benefits,[33] while several increases were made to the federal minimum wage.[34] The Service Contract Act of 1965 provided for minimum wages and fringe benefits as well as other conditions of work for contractors under certain types of service contracts.[35] A comprehensive minimum rate hike was also signed into law that extended the coverage of the Fair Labor Standards Act to about 9.1 million additional workers.[33]\\r\\nDespite conservatives who attacked Johnson's Great Society making major gains in Congress in the 1966 midterm elections, and with anger and frustration mounting over the Vietnam War, Johnson was still able to secure the passage of additional programs during his last two years in office. Laws were passed to extend the Food Stamp Program, to expand consumer protection, to improve safety standards, to train health professionals, to assist handicapped Americans, and to further urban programs.[36]\\r\\nIn 1968, a new Fair Housing Act was passed, which banned racial discrimination in housing[37] and subsidized the construction or rehabilitation of low-income housing units.[38] That same year, a new program for federally funded job retraining for the hardcore unemployed in fifty cities was introduced, together with the strongest federal gun control bill (relating to the transportation of guns across State lines) in American history up until that point.[39]\\r\\nBy the end of the Johnson Administration, 226 out of 252 major legislative requests (over a four-year period) had been met, federal aid to the poor had risen from $9.9 billion in 1960 to $30 billion by 1968, one million Americans had been retrained under previously non-existent federal programs, and two million children had participated in the Head Start program.\\r\\nInterpretations of the War on Poverty remain controversial. The Office of Economic Opportunity was dismantled by the Nixon and Ford administrations, largely by transferring poverty programs to other government departments.[40] Funding for many of these programs were further cut in President Ronald Reagan's Gramm-Latta Budget in 1981.[citation needed]\\r\\nAlan Brinkley has suggested that \\"the gap between the expansive intentions of the War on Poverty and its relatively modest achievements fueled later conservative arguments that government is not an appropriate vehicle for solving social problems.\\"[10] One of Johnson's aides, Joseph A. Califano, Jr., has countered that \\"from 1963 when Lyndon Johnson took office until 1970 as the impact of his Great Society programs were felt, the portion of Americans living below the poverty line dropped from 22.2 percent to 12.6 percent, the most dramatic decline over such a brief period in this century.\\"[28]\\r\\nThe percentage of African Americans below the poverty line dropped from 55 percent in 1960 to 27 percent in 1968.[41] From 1964 to 1967, federal expenditures on education rose from $4 billion to $12 billion, while spending on health rose from $5 billion to $16 billion. By that time, the federal government was spending $4,000 per annum on each poor family of four, four times as much as in 1961.[42]","input":"What was the cause of the great society?"},{"output":"eliminating open defecation through the construction of household-owned and community-owned toilets and establishing an accountable mechanism of monitoring toilet use","context":"?? ??? ???????? ?? ??\\r\\nSwachh Bharat Abhiyan (SBA) (or Swachh Bharat Mission (SBM) or Clean India Mission in English) is a campaign in India that aims to clean up the streets, roads and infrastructure of India's cities, smaller towns, and rural areas. The objectives of Swachh Bharat include eliminating open defecation through the construction of household-owned and community-owned toilets and establishing an accountable mechanism of monitoring toilet use. Run by the Government of India, the mission aims to achieve an Open-Defecation Free (ODF) India by 2 October 2019, the 150th anniversary of the birth of Mahatma Gandhi, by constructing 12 million toilets in rural India at a projected cost of ?1.96 lakh crore (US$30 billion).[1]\\r\\nThe campaign was officially launched on 2 October 2014 at Rajghat, New Delhi by Prime Minister Narendra Modi.

Five states, 149 districts and 2.08 lakh villages were declared Open Defecation Free (ODF) till August 2017. The cities and towns which have been declared ODF stood at 22 per cent and the urban wards which have achieved 100 per cent door-to-door solid waste collection stood at 50 per cent. The number of Swachhagrahi volunteers working across urban local bodies rose to 20,000, and those working in rural India rose to more than a lakh. The number of schools with separate toilet facilities for girls rose from 0.4 million (37 per cent) to almost one million (91 per cent).[32]\\r\\nAs per an independent survey released by Quality Council of India in August 2017, overall national rural \\"household access to toilet\\" coverage increased to 62.45 per cent and usage of 91.29 per cent, with Haryana topping the national ranking with 99 per cent of households in rural areas covered and usage of 100 per cent.[33]\\r\\nThe Ministry of Railways is planning to have the facility of cleaning on demand, clean bed-rolls from automatic laundries, bio-toilets, dustbins in all non-AC coaches.[34] The Centre may use its Digital India project in conjunction with the Swachh Bharat Abhiyan to have solar-powered trash cans, such as those in many US cities, which send alerts to sanitation crew once they are full.[35]\\r\\nThe Government has appointed PWD with the responsibility to dispose off waste from Government offices.[36]\\r\\nA Swachh Bharat Run was organized at the Rashtrapati Bhavan, the official home of the President of India, located Rajpath, New Delhi, on 2 October 2014. According to a statement from the Rashtrapati Bhavan around 1500 people participated and the event was flagged off by President Pranab Mukherjee. Participants in the run included officers[vague] and their families.[37]\\r\\nThe government will be launching a nationwide real-time monitoring system for toilets constructed under the Swachh Bharat Abhiyan. For this the government of India is bringing awareness to the people through advertisements.

The Swachh Bharat app Tumblr feed[41] provides updates from individual groups, corporations and Twitter users in general about group cleaning events, the status of cleanliness across India, and opinions on the objectives of the Clean India mission.[original research?] A recent study by the Public Affairs Centre finds that participation of beneficiaries in their toilet construction ensures better usage.[42]\\r\\nSwachh Sarvekshan 2017 was conducted between 4 January 2017 and 7 February 2017.[43] The results of top 25 cities are as follows:\\r\\nThe Government of India released a Cleanliness Ranking on 15 February 2016.[45][46][47]\\r\\nThe Swachh Sarvekshan-2016 ranks 73 cities on cleanliness and sanitation.

Villages that achieved this status received monetary rewards and high publicity under a program called Nirmal Gram Puraskar.[52][53][54]\\r\\nNirmal Bharat Abhiyan was restructured by Cabinet approval on 24 September 2014 as Swachh Bharat Abhiyan.[8]\\r\\nMajor activities covered under Nirmal Bharat Abhiyan were:[55][51]\\r\\nA randomized study of eighty villages in rural (Madhya Pradesh) was conducted to determine if India's Total Sanitation Campaign's (TSC) effort to eliminate open defecation was effective in reducing diarrhea and other gastrointestinal diseases in children. Results showed that the TSC programme did modestly increase the number of households with latrines, and had a small effect in reducing open defecation. However, there was no improvement in the health of children. Although the authors point out that their results are limited as to place (rural Madhya Pradesh), type of intervention (TSC), and type of measures (self-reported open defecation and child health), they conclude: \\"these findings highlight the challenges associated with achieving large enough improvement in access to sanitation and correspondingly large reductions in the practice of open defecation to deliver health benefits within large-scale rural sanitation programs.\\"[56] However, this study may not be used to judge the effectiveness of community-led total sanitation (CLTS) overall, as the presence of subsidies may fundamentally change the effectiveness of the process.[57]\\r\\n Media related to Swachh Bharat Abhiyan at Wikimedia Commons","input":"What is the main objective of swachh bharat abhiyan?"},{"output":"January 1, 2012","context":"Pit Bulls & Parolees is an American reality television series on Animal Planet which confronts the misunderstandings of the Pit Bull breed. The series debuted on October 30, 2009. It features the Villalobos Rescue Center and was originally located in Agua Dulce, California; however, the organization has relocated to the New Orleans, Louisiana area.\\r\\nIt is the United States' largest pit bull animal shelter.[1]\\r\\nFounder Tia Torres appeared on The Daily Show with Jon Stewart on September 24, 2014 and stated that her organization has approximately 400 dogs and that the notoriety of the show has resulted in \\"four times\\" as many dogs being directed to her organization.[2]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nPit Bulls & Parolees depicts the day-to-day operations at the Villalobos Rescue Center (VRC), including rescues of abused, neglected, and abandoned dogs, and the center's efforts to adopt out dogs to new owners. The center's founder, Tia Maria Torres, agreed to be on the show to help pay part of Villalobos' then $25,000 per month bills. Since moving the entire rescue group, including all the dogs, parolees who wanted to go, and her family to New Orleans, the expenses have tripled. They are now $80,000 per month.[3] The show's main focus is the interaction between Tia, her dogs, and the parolees who work for her, during daily care and training duties, and pit bull rescue missions.\\r\\nTia states in the show: \\"My mission is to rescue; my hope is that one day I won't have to.\\"[4]\\r\\nThe show also depicts the interactions between Tia, her daughters (Tania and Mariah), and twin sons (Kanani and Keli'i). All four help run the center,[5] with Villalobos' staff of volunteers and employees, many of whom are the eponymous parolees.[3]\\r\\nIn 2011, Torres had planned to move Villalobos to a small town called Tehachapi, California, around 75 miles north of where it had operated in Agua Dulce. It appeared to be an ideal place for VRC to relocate with the overabundance of Pit Bulls in Kern County and a prison facility in town, with newly released inmates looking for work. VRC secured all the proper permits; yet, at the final moment, Kern County did not grant permission for the rescue to conduct their business in the remote area of \\"Old West Ranch,\\" Tehachapi. Losing all of her personal savings spent on the Tehachapi project and hundreds of man hours, VRC was forced to remain at the Agua Dulce location.\\r\\nAs the rules regarding kennel permits were becoming increasingly strict and expensive in Los Angeles County, the rescue announced on November 13, 2011, that they would be moving the facility out of California in order to survive financially. After considering various locations, it was the memories of VRC's rescue efforts during Hurricane Katrina that led the non-profit group to choose Louisiana for their new home. It took almost a year to make the entire move complete; on January 1, 2012, Tia Torres arrived with the last group of dogs, making the state of Louisiana their one and only permanent location. The new rescue and adoption facility is located in the Upper 9th Ward of New Orleans, Louisiana, with various other \\"satellite\\" locations scattered throughout the South Louisiana area.[6]","input":"When did pitbulls and parolees move to louisiana?"},{"output":"October 27, 1904","context":"","input":"When was the first subway built in new york city?"},{"output":"Hurricane","context":"","input":"Was sandy a tropical storm or a hurricane?"},{"output":"George Michael","context":"\\"Careless Whisper\\" is a song by English singer-songwriter George Michael (sometimes credited to \\"Wham! featuring George Michael\\" in Japan, Canada and the United States). It was released on 24 July 1984, by Epic Records in the United Kingdom, Japan and other countries, and by Columbia Records in North America. The song was George Michael's first solo single, although he was still performing in Wham! at the time (the song is included on Wham!'s album Make It Big).\\r\\nThe song features a prominent saxophone riff, and has been covered by a number of artists since its first release. It was released as a single and became a huge commercial success on both sides of the Atlantic and on both sides of the Pacific. It reached number one in nearly 25 countries, selling about 6 million copies worldwide ÿ 2 million of them in the United States.[2]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nUnlike most of the other Wham! singles (except \\"Wham Rap! (Enjoy What You Do)\\" and \\"Club Tropicana\\"), it was co-written by bandmate Andrew Ridgeley. The two had written it together as developing artists three years earlier in Watford, England.[3]\\r\\nI was on my way to DJ at the Bel Air when I wrote \\"Careless Whisper\\". I have always written on buses, trains and in cars. It always happens on journeys. With \\"Careless Whisper\\" I remember EXACTLY where it first came to me, where I came up with the sax line. I can remember very vaguely where I was when I wrote things after Wham! got off the ground--but with \\"Careless Whisper\\" I remember exactly the time and place. I know it sounds really weird and a kind of romantic thing to say--but I remember exactly where it happened, where I was sitting on the bus, how I continued and everything. I remember I was handing the money over to the guy on the bus and I got this line, the sax line: der-der-der-der, der-der-der-der. Then he moved away and I continued writing it in my head. I wrote it totally in my head. I worked on it for about three months in my head...[4]\\r\\nMichael and Ridgeley both wrote the song when they were 17, taking inspiration from stories from Michaels early romantic overtures.[5] Michael explained in his autobiography, Bare, that much of the song's content is based on events from his childhood.\\r\\n\\"When I was twelve, thirteen, I used to have to chaperone my sister, who was two years older, to an ice rink at Queensway in London,\\" he detailed. \\"There was a girl there with long blond hair whose name was Jane. I was a fat boy in glasses and I had a big crush on her -though I didn't stand a chance. My sister used to go and do what she wanted when we got to the skating rink and I would spend the afternoon swooning over this girl Jane.\\"[5]\\r\\n\\"A few years later, when I was sixteen, I had my first relationship with a girl called Helen,\\" Michael continued. \\"It had just started to cool off a bit when I discovered that the blonde girl from Queensway had moved in just around the corner from my school. She had moved in right next to where I used to stand and wait for my next-door neighbor, who used to give me a lift home from school. And one day I saw her walk down the path next to me and I thought ÿ now where did SHE come from? She didn't know it was me. It was a few years later and I looked a lot different. Then we played a school disco with The Executive and she saw me singing and decided she fancied me. By this time she was that much older and a big buxom thing ÿ and eventually I started seeing her. She invited me in one day when I was waiting for my lift and I was...in heaven.\\"[5]\\r\\nMichael observed that after he stopped wearing glasses, he began getting invited to parties. \\"And the girl who didn't even see me when I was twelve invited me in,\\" he noted. \\"So I went out with her for a couple of months but I didn't stop seeing Helen. I thought I was being smart ÿ I had gone from being a total loser to being a two-timer. And I remember my sisters used to give me a hard time because they found out and they really liked the first girl. The whole idea of \\"Careless Whisper\\" was the first girl finding out about the second ÿ which she never did. But I started another relationship with a girl called Alexis without finishing the one with Jane. It all got a bit complicated. Jane found out about her and got rid of me...The whole time I thought I was being cool, being this two-timer, but there really wasn't that much emotion involved. I did feel guilty about the first girl ÿ and I have seen her since ÿ and the idea of the song was about her. \\"Careless Whisper\\" was us dancing, because we danced a lot, and the idea was ÿ we are dancing...but she knows...and it's finished.\\"[5]\\r\\nThe song went through at least two rounds of production. The first was during a trip Michael made to Muscle Shoals, Alabama, where he went to work with producer Jerry Wexler at Muscle Shoals Sound Studio. Michael was unhappy with the version that was originally produced and decided to re-record and produce the song himself, this time coming up with the version that was finally released. The version Wexler produced, was released later in the year, as a (4:41) B-side \\"Special Version\\" on 12\\" in the UK and Japan.\\r\\nThe record label Innervision were going to put out the Jerry Wexler version of \\"Careless Whisper\\" after the Club Fantastic Megamix as far back as 1983. Dick Leahy said that while he could not stop the release of the Club Fantastic Megamix, he could stop the release of this single on the basis that as a publisher they \\"have the right to grant the first license of the recording of a tune of which he controls the copyright\\". He was unable to do anything about the Club Fantastic Megamix because it was already released material. He said: \\"We knew how big that song could be so it was necessary to upset a few people to stop it.\\"[6]\\r\\nThe officially released single, a mid-tempo sentimental ballad with a saxophone solo by Steve Gregory, was issued in August 1984, entering the UK Singles Chart at number 12. Within two weeks, it was at number one, ending a nine-week run at the top for \\"Two Tribes\\" by Frankie Goes to Hollywood. It stayed at number one for three weeks, going on to become the fifth best-selling single of 1984 in the United Kingdom; it was outsold only by the two Frankie Goes to Hollywood tracks \\"Two Tribes\\" and \\"Relax,\\" Stevie Wonder with \\"I Just Called to Say I Love You,\\" and Band Aid's \\"Do They Know It's Christmas?\\" The song also topped the charts in 25 other countries, including the Billboard Hot 100 in the United States in February 1985 under the credit \\"Wham! featuring George Michael.\\" Spending three weeks at the top in America, the song was later named Billboard's number-one song of 1985.\\r\\nOn the subject of his personal opinion of the song, Michael said in 1991 that it \\"was not an integral part of my emotional development\\"[6] which he found sad because of the song meaning so much to so many people. He went on to say: \\"It disappoints me that you can write a lyric very flippantlyand not a particularly good lyricand it can mean so much to so many people. That's disillusioning for a writer.\\"[6]\\r\\nThe official music video shows the guilt felt by a man (portrayed by Michael) over an affair, and his acknowledgement that his partner (Lisa Stahl) is going to find out. It was filmed on location in Miami, Florida, in 1984 and features such locales as Coconut Grove and Watson Island. The final part of the video shows Michael leaning out of a balcony at the last floor of Miami's Grove Towers.[7][8]\\r\\nAccording to producer Jon Roseman, production of the video was \\"A fucking disaster\\".[9] According to Michael's co-star Lisa Stahl, \\"They lost footage of our kissing scene so we had to reshoot it, which I didn't complain about... Then George decided he didn't like his hair so he flew his sister over from England to cut it and we had to reshoot more scenes.

It is the successor to OS X Yosemite and focuses mainly on performance, stability and security.[2] Following the Northern California landmark-based naming scheme introduced with OS X Mavericks, El Capitan was named after a rock formation in Yosemite National Park, signifying its goal to be a refined version of Yosemite. El Capitan is the final version to be released under the name OS X; its successor, Sierra, was announced as macOS Sierra. El Capitan received far superior reviews when compared to Yosemite.\\r\\nThe first beta of OS X El Capitan was released to developers shortly following the 2015 WWDC keynote on June 8, 2015.[3] The first public beta was made available on July 9, 2015.[4] There were multiple betas released after the keynote. OS X El Capitan was released to end users on September 30, 2015, as a free upgrade through the Mac App Store.[5]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nAll Macintosh computers that can run Mountain Lion, Mavericks, or Yosemite can run El Capitan,[6] although not all of its features will work on older computers.[7] For example, Apple notes that the newly available Metal API is available on \\"all Macs since 2012\\".[8]\\r\\nThese computers can run El Capitan, provided they have at least 2GB of RAM:[7][9][10]\\r\\nOf these computers, the following models were equipped with 1GB RAM as the standard option on the base model when they were shipped originally. They can only run OS X El Capitan if they have at least 2GB of RAM.\\r\\nThe following computers support features such as Handoff, Instant Hotspot, AirDrop between Mac computers and iOS devices, as well as the new Metal API:[11]\\r\\nThe upgrade varies in size depending upon which Apple Mac computer it is being installed on, in most scenarios it will require about 6 GB of disk space.[12]\\r\\nOS X El Capitan includes features to improve the security, performance, design and usability of OS X. Compared to OS X Yosemite, Apple says that opening PDFs is four times faster, app switching and viewing messages in Mail is twice as fast and launching apps is 40% faster.[13][14] The maximum amount of memory that could be allocated to the graphics processor has been increased from 1024 MB to 1536 MB on Macs with an Intel HD 4000 GPU.[15] OS X El Capitan supports Metal, Apple's graphics API introduced in iOS 8 to speed up performance in games and professional applications.[16] Apple's typeface San Francisco replaces Helvetica Neue as the system typeface.[17] OS X El Capitan also adopts LibreSSL in replacement of OpenSSL used in previous versions.[18]\\r\\nOS X El Capitan introduces new window management features such as creating a full-screen split view by pressing the green button on left upper corner of the window or Control+Cmd+F keyboard shortcut, then snapping any supported other window to that full screen application. This feature is slightly similar to, although less extensive than, the snap-assist feature in Windows 7 (and later) and several Linux desktop environments, such as GNOME.[19] OS X El Capitan improves Mission Control to incorporate this feature across multiple spaces. It also enables users to spot the pointer more easily by enlarging it by shaking the mouse or swiping a finger back and forth on the trackpad.[20]\\r\\nOS X El Capitan adds multi-touch gestures to applications like Mail and Messages that allow a user to delete or mark emails or conversations by swiping a finger on a multi-touch device, such as a trackpad. OS X also analyzes the contents of individual emails in Mail and uses the gathered information in other applications, such as Calendar. For example, an invitation in Mail can automatically be added as a Calendar event.\\r\\nApple Maps in El Capitan shows public transit information similar to Maps in iOS 9.[13] This feature was limited to a handful of cities upon launch: Baltimore, Berlin, Chicago, London, Los Angeles, Mexico City, New York City, Paris, Philadelphia, San Francisco, Shanghai, Toronto and Washington D.C.\\r\\nThe Notes application receives an overhaul, similar to Notes in iOS 9. Both applications have more powerful text-processing capabilities, such as to-do lists (like in the Reminders application), inline webpage previews, photos and videos, digital sketches, map locations and other documents and media types. Notes replaces traditional IMAP-based syncing with iCloud, which offers better end-to-end encryption and faster syncing.[21]\\r\\nSafari in El Capitan lets users pin tabs for frequently accessed websites to the tab bar, similar to Firefox and Google Chrome. Users are able to quickly identify and mute tabs that play audio without having to search for individual tabs. Safari supports AirPlay video streaming to an Apple TV without the need to broadcast the entire webpage. Safari extensions are now hosted and signed by Apple as part of the updated Apple Developer program and they received native support for content blocking, allowing developers to block website components (such as advertisements) without JavaScript injection.[22] The app also allows the user to customize the font and background of the Reader mode.[23]\\r\\nSpotlight is improved with more contextual information such as the weather, stocks, news and sports scores. It is also able to process queries in natural language. For example, users can type \\"Show me pictures that I took in Yosemite National Park in July 2014\\" and Spotlight will use that request to bring up the corresponding info.[24] The app could now be resized and moved across the screen.[25]\\r\\nPhotos introduced editing extensions which allows Photos to use editing tools from other apps.[26]\\r\\nOS X El Capitan has a new security feature called System Integrity Protection (SIP,[27] sometimes referred to as \\"rootless\\"[28][29]) that protects certain system processes, files and folders from being modified or tampered with by other processes even when executed by the root user or by a user with root privileges (sudo). Apple says that the root user can be a significant risk factor to the system's security, especially on systems with a single user account on which that user is also the administrator. System Integrity Protection is enabled by default, but can be disabled.[30][31]\\r\\nUpon release, OS X El Capitan was met with universal acclaim from both users and critics, with praise mostly going towards the overall functionality of the new features and improved stability. Dieter Bohn of The Verge awarded the operating system a score of 8.5 out of 10;[32] while Jason Snell of Macworld was also positive, rating it 4.5 out of 5.[33]\\r\\nAfter the 10.11.4 update, many users started reporting that their MacBooks were freezing, requiring a hard reboot.[34] This issue mostly affects Early 2015 MacBook Pro computers, although many others have reported freezes in other models.[35] Several users created videos in YouTube which showed the freezes.[36][37][38] Soon after this, Apple released the 10.11.5 update, which contained stability improvements. Apple later acknowledged these problems, recommending their users to update to the last point release.[39]\\r\\nAfter the December 13, 2016 release of Security Update 2016-003, users reported problems with the WindowServer process becoming unresponsive, causing the GUI to freeze and sometimes necessitating a hard reboot to fix.[40] In response, on January 17, 2017, Apple released Security Update 2016-003 Supplemental (10.11.6) to fix \\"a kernel issue that may cause your Mac to occasionally become unresponsive\\" and at the same time released an updated version of Security Update 2016-003 which includes the fix released in the supplemental.[41] Users who have not previously installed Security Update 2016-003 are advised to install the updated version to reach build 15G1217, while users who have already installed the December 13, 2016 Security Update 2016-003 only need to install the supplemental update.","input":"What is the latest version of osx el capitan?"},{"output":"2 November 1936","context":"BBC Television is a service of the British Broadcasting Corporation.

As well as being a broadcaster, the corporation also produces a large number of its own programmes in-house and thereby ranks as one of the world's largest television production companies.\\r\\n\\r\\nJohn Logie Baird set up the Baird Television Development Company in 1926; on 30 September 1929 he made the first experimental television broadcast for the BBC from its studio in Long Acre in the Covent Garden area of London via the BBC's London transmitter. Baird used his electromechanical system with a vertically-scanned image of 30 lines, which is just enough resolution for a close-up of one person, and a bandwidth low enough to use existing radio transmitters. The simultaneous transmission of sound and pictures was achieved on 30 March 1930, by using the BBC's new twin transmitter at Brookmans Park. By late 1930, thirty minutes of morning programmes were broadcast from Monday to Friday, and thirty minutes at midnight on Tuesdays and Fridays after BBC radio went off the air. Baird's broadcasts via the BBC continued until June 1932.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe BBC began its own regular television programming from the basement of Broadcasting House, London, on 22 August 1932. The studio moved to larger quarters in 16 Portland Place, London, in February 1934, and continued broadcasting the 30-line images, carried by telephone line to the medium wave transmitter at Brookmans Park, until 11 September 1935, by which time advances in all-electronic television systems made the electromechanical broadcasts obsolete.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter a series of test transmissions and special broadcasts that began in August 1936, the BBC Television Service officially launched on 2 November 1936 from a converted wing of Alexandra Palace in London.[5][6] \\"Ally Pally\\" housed two studios, various scenery stores, make-up areas, dressing rooms, offices, and the transmitter itself, which then broadcast on the VHF band. BBC television initially used two systems on alternate weeks: the 240-line Baird intermediate film system and the 405-line Marconi-EMI system. The use of both formats made the BBC's service the world's first regular high-definition television service; it broadcast from Monday to Saturday between 15:00 and 16:00, and 21:00 and 22:00.[7] The first programme broadcast ÿ and thus the first ever, on a dedicated TV channel ÿ was \\"Opening of the BBC Television Service\\" at 15:00.[8] The first major outside broadcast was the coronation of King George VI and Queen Elizabeth in May 1937.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe two systems were to run on a trial basis for six months; early television sets supported both resolutions. However, the Baird system, which used a mechanical camera for filmed programming and Farnsworth image dissector cameras for live programming, proved too cumbersome and visually inferior, and ended with closedown (at 22:00) on Saturday 13 February 1937.[9]\\r\\n\\r\\nInitially, the station's range was officially a 40 kilometres radius of the Alexandra Palace transmitterin practice, however, transmissions could be picked up a good deal further away, and on one occasion in 1938 were picked up by engineers at RCA in New York, who were experimenting with a British television set.[a]  The service was reaching an estimated 25,000ÿ40,000 homes before the outbreak of World War II which caused the service to be suspended in September 1939.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn 1 September 1939, two days before Britain declared war on Germany, the station was taken off air with little warning;[10] the government was concerned that the VHF transmissions would act as a beacon to enemy aircraft homing in on London. Also, many of the television service's technical staff and engineers would be needed for the war effort, in particular on the radar programme. The last programme transmitted was a Mickey Mouse cartoon, Mickey's Gala Premier (1933), which was followed by test transmissions; this account refuted the popular memory according to which broadcasting was suspended before the end of the cartoon.[10]\\r\\n\\r\\nAccording to figures from Britain's Radio Manufacturers Association, 18,999 television sets had been manufactured from 1936 to September 1939, when production was halted by the war.\\r\\n\\r\\nBBC Television returned on 7 June 1946 at 15:00. Jasmine Bligh, one of the original announcers, made the first announcement, saying, 'Good afternoon everybody. How are you? Do you remember me, Jasmine Bligh?'. The Mickey Mouse cartoon of 1939 was repeated twenty minutes later.[11] Alexandra Palace was the home base of the channel until the early 1950s when the majority of production moved into the newly acquired Lime Grove Studios.\\r\\n\\r\\nPostwar broadcast coverage was extended to Birmingham in 1949 with the opening of the Sutton Coldfield transmitting station, and by the mid-1950s most of the country was covered, transmitting a 405-line interlaced image on VHF.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen the ITV was launched in 1955, the BBC Television Service (renamed \\"BBC tv\\" in 1960) showed popular programming, including comedies, drama, documentaries, game shows, and soap operas, covering a wide range of genres and regularly competed with ITV to become the channel with the highest ratings for that week. The channel also introduced the science fiction show Doctor Who on 23 November 1963 - at 17:16 -  which went on to become one of Britain's most iconic and beloved television programmes.\\r\\n\\r\\nBBC TV was renamed BBC1 in 1964, after the launch of BBC2 (now BBC Two), the third television station (ITV was the second) for the UK; its remit, to provide more niche programming. The channel was due to launch on 20 April 1964, but was put off the air by a massive power failure that affected much of London, caused by a fire at Battersea Power Station. A videotape made on the opening night was rediscovered in 2003 by a BBC technician.[citation needed] In the end the launch went ahead the following night, hosted by Denis Tuohy holding a candle. BBC2 was the first British channel to use UHF and 625-line pictures, giving higher definition than the existing VHF 405-line system.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn 1 July 1967, BBC Two became the first television channel in Europe to broadcast regularly in colour, using the West German PAL system that was in use for decades until being gradually superseded by digital systems.[12] (BBC One and ITV began 625-line colour broadcasts simultaneously on 15 November 1969). Unlike other terrestrial channels, BBC Two does not have soap opera or standard news programming, but a range of programmes intended to be eclectic and diverse (although if a programme has high audience ratings it is often eventually repositioned to BBC One). The different remit of BBC2 allowed its first controller, Sir David Attenborough to commission the first heavyweight documentaries and documentary series such as Civilisation, The Ascent of Man and Horizon.\\r\\n\\r\\nDavid Attenborough was later granted sabbatical leave from his job as Controller to work with the BBC Natural History Unit which had existed since the 1950s. This unit is now famed throughout the world for producing high quality programmes with Attenborough such as Life on Earth, The Private Life of Plants, The Blue Planet, The Life of Mammals, Planet Earth and Frozen Planet.\\r\\n\\r\\nNational and regional variations also occur within the BBC One and BBC Two schedules. England's BBC One output is split up into fifteen regions (such as South West and East), which exist mainly to produce local news programming, but also occasionally opt out of the network to show programmes of local importance (such as major local events). The other nations of the United Kingdom (Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland) have been granted more autonomy from the English network; for example, programmes are mostly introduced by local announcers, rather than by those in London. BBC One and BBC Two schedules in the other UK nations can vary immensely from BBC One and BBC Two in England.\\r\\n\\r\\nProgrammes, such as the politically fuelled Give My Head Peace (produced by BBC Northern Ireland) and the soap opera River City (produced by BBC Scotland), have been created specifically to cater for some viewers in their respective nations. BBC Scotland produces daily programmes for its Gaelic-speaking viewers, including current affairs, political and children's programming such as the popular Erpa and D a-nis?. BBC Wales also produces a large amount of Welsh language programming for S4C, particularly news, sport and other programmes, especially the soap opera Pobol y Cwm ('People of the Valley') briefly shown on BBC2 across the UK with subtitles in the 1990s.[13] The UK nations also produce a number of programmes that are shown across the UK, such as BBC Scotland's comedy series Chewin' the Fat, and BBC Northern Ireland's talk show Patrick Kielty Almost Live.\\r\\n\\r\\nDuring the 1980s, the BBC came under pressure to commission more programmes from independent British production companies, and following the Broadcasting Act 1990 it was legally required to source 25% of its output from such companies by the terms of the Act. This eventually led to the creation of the \\"WoCC\\" (Window of Creative Competition) for independent production companies to pitch programmes to the BBC.[14]\\r\\n\\r\\nProgrammes have also been imported mainly from English-speaking countries: notablethough no longer shownexamples include The Simpsons from the United States and Neighbours from Australia. Programming from countries outside the English-speaking world consisted of feature films, shown in the original language with subtitles instead of being dubbed, with dubbing only used for cartoons and children's programmes.[15] These included programmes from Eastern Europe, including The Singing Ringing Tree from East Germany, although voice-over translation was used instead of dubbing for budgetary reasons.[16]\\r\\n\\r\\nCeefax, the first teletext service, launched on 23 September 1974. This service allowed BBC viewers to view textual information such as the latest news on their television. CEEFAX did not make a full transition to digital television, instead being gradually replaced by the new interactive BBCi service before being fully closed down on 22 October 2012.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn March 2003 the BBC announced that from the end of May 2003 (subsequently deferred to 14 July) it intended to transmit all eight of its domestic television channels (including the 15 regional variations of BBC 1) unencrypted from the Astra 2D satellite. This move was estimated to save the BBC S85?million over the next five years.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhile the \\"footprint\\" of the Astra 2D satellite was smaller than that of Astra 2A, from which it was previously broadcast encrypted, it meant that viewers with appropriate equipment were able to receive BBC channels \\"free-to-air\\" over much of Western Europe. Consequently, some rights concerns have needed to be resolved with programme providers such as Hollywood studios and sporting organisations, which have expressed concern about the unencrypted signal leaking out. This led to some broadcasts being made unavailable on the Sky Digital platform, such as Scottish Premier League and Scottish Cup football, while on other platforms such broadcasts were not disrupted. Later, when rights contracts were renewed, this problem was resolved.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe BBC Television department headed by Jana Bennett was absorbed into a new, much larger group; BBC Vision, in late 2006.[17] The new group was part of larger restructuring within the BBC with the onset of new media outlets and technology.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 2008, the BBC began experimenting with live streaming of certain channels in the UK, and in November 2008, all standard BBC television channels were made available to watch online via BBC iPlayer.[18]\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen Tony Hall became Director General in April 2013, he reverted the division to its original name of BBC Television. As Television it was responsible for the commissioning, scheduling and broadcasting of all programming on the BBC's television channels and online, as well as producing content for broadcast.[19]\\r\\n\\r\\nFollowing the 2016 Licence Fee settlement, BBC Television was split into two divisions, with in-house television production being separated into a new division called BBC Studios controlled by Mark Linsey and the remaining parts of television (channels and genre commissioning, BBC Sport, BBC Three and BBC iPlayer) being renamed as BBC Content, controlled by Charlotte Moore.[4][20] As a result, the BBC Television division is now known internally as BBC Content and \\"BBC Television\\" as an entity has ceased to exist.[4][21][22]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe BBC domestic television channels do not broadcast advertisements; they are instead funded by a television licence fee which TV viewers are required to pay annually.  This includes viewers who watch real-time streams or catch up services of the BBC's channels online or via their mobile phone. The BBC's international television channels are funded by advertisements and subscription.\\r\\n\\r\\nThese channels are also available outside the UK in neighbouring countries e.g. Belgium and the Netherlands.\\r\\n\\r\\nA high definition simulcast, BBC Three HD, launched on 10 December 2013.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe BBC's wholly owned commercial subsidiary, BBC Studios, also operates several international television channels under BBC branding:\\r\\n\\r\\nThe BBC also co-owns the following channels in joint ventures with other broadcasters:\\r\\n\\r\\nNews channel that targets Persian-speaking countries including Iran, Afghanistan and Tajikistan in the Persian/Dari/Tajiki language.\\r\\n\\r\\nBBC Japan was a general entertainment channel, which operated between December 2004 and April 2006. It ceased operations after its Japanese distributor folded.","input":"When was the first tv broadcast in the uk?"},{"output":"usually cleared the next day","context":"A cashier's check (or cashier's cheque) is a check guaranteed by a bank, drawn on the bank's own funds and signed by a cashier.[1] Cashier's checks are treated as guaranteed funds because the bank, rather than the purchaser, is responsible for paying the amount. They are commonly required for real estate and brokerage transactions.\\r\\n\\r\\nCashier's checks deposited into a bank account are usually cleared the next day. The customer can request \\"next-day availability\\" when depositing a cashier's check in person.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen cashiers checks took weeks to clear the banks they were often forged in fraud schemes. The recipient of the check would deposit it in their account and withdraw funds under next-day availability, assuming it was legitimate. The bank might not be informed the check was fraudulent until, perhaps, weeks after the customer had withdrawn funds made available by the fraudulent deposit, by which time the customer would be legally liable for the cash already withdrawn.[2]\\r\\n\\r\\nA customer asks a bank for a cashier's check, and the bank debits the amount from the customer's account immediately, and assumes the responsibility for covering the cashier's check. That is in contrast with a personal check, in which the bank does not debit the amount from the customer's account until the check is deposited or cashed by the recipient.\\r\\n\\r\\nA cashier's check is not the same as a teller's check, also known as a banker's draft, which is a check provided to a customer of a bank or acquired from a bank for remittance purposes and drawn by the bank, and drawn on another bank or payable through or at a bank.[3] A cashier's check is also different from a certified check, which is a personal check written by the customer and drawn on the customer's account, on which the bank certifies that the signature is genuine and that the customer has sufficient funds in the account to cover the check.[4] Also, it should not be confused with a counter check, which is a non-personalized check provided by the bank for the convenience of a customer in making withdrawals or payments but is not guaranteed and is functionally equivalent to a personal check.[5]\\r\\n\\r\\nCashier's checks feature the name of the issuing bank in a prominent location, usually the upper left-hand corner or upper centre of the check. In addition, they are generally produced with enhanced security features, including watermarks, security thread, color-shifting ink, and special bond paper. These are designed to decrease the vulnerability to counterfeit items. To be recognized as a cashier's check, words to that effect must be included in a prominent place on the front of the item.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe payee's name, the written and numeric amount to be tendered, the remitter's information, and other tracking information (such as the branch of issue), are printed on the front of the check. The check is generally signed by one or two bank employees or officers; however, some banks issue cashier's checks featuring a facsimile signature of the bank's chief executive officer or other senior official.\\r\\n\\r\\nSome banks contract out the maintenance of their cashier's check accounts and check issuing. One leading contractor is Integrated Payment Systems, which issues cashier's checks and coordinates redemption of the items for many banks, in addition to issuing money orders and other payment instruments.  In theory, checks issued by a financial institution but drawn on another institution, as is often the case with credit unions, are teller's checks.\\r\\n\\r\\nDue to an increase in fraudulent activities, starting in 2006 many banks insist upon waiting for a cashier's check to clear the originating institution before making funds available for withdrawal. Personal checks will thus have the same utility in such transactions.[6]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the United States, under Article 3 of the Uniform Commercial Code, a cashier's check is effective as a note of the issuing bank. Also, according to Regulation CC (Reg CC) of the Federal Reserve, cashier's checks are recognized as \\"guaranteed funds\\" and amounts under $5,000 are not subject to deposit hold, except in the case of new accounts.  The length of a hold varies (2 days to 2 weeks) depending on the bank. It is not clear what length of time may pass before a bank can be held responsible for accepting a bad cashier's check.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn Canada, bank drafts do not carry any different legal weight as opposed to a standard check, but are provided as a service to clients as a payment instrument with guaranteed funds. Drafts (or money orders depending on the issuing institution) usually have better security features than standard checks, and as such are often preferred when the receiver is concerned about receiving fraudulent payment instruments. However, bank drafts can also be subject to counterfeiting, and as such can be held or verified by depositing institutions in accordance with their hold funds policy, prior to providing access to the funds.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe term money order is used non-uniformly in Canada, with some institutions offering both money orders and bank drafts depending on the amount, with others only offering one or the other for any amount. Generally, both bank drafts and money orders are treated the same in regards to guaranteed funds and hold policies.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn many nations Money orders are a popular alternative to cashier's checks and are considered safer than personal bank checks. However, in the United States, they are generally not recognized as \\"guaranteed funds\\" under Reg CC[7] and are limited to a specified maximum amount ($1,000 or less under U.S. law for domestic postal money orders).\\r\\n\\r\\nBecause of US regulatory requirements associated with the Patriot Act and the Bank Secrecy Act due to updated concerns over money laundering, most insurance and brokerage firms will no longer accept money orders as payment for insurance premiums or as deposits into brokerage accounts.\\r\\n\\r\\nCounterfeit money orders and cashier's checks have been used in certain scams to steal from those who sell their goods online on sites such as eBay and Craigslist.[6]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe counterfeit cashier's check scam is a scheme where the victim is sent a cashier's check or money order for payment on an item for sale on the Internet. When the money order is taken to the bank it may not be detected as counterfeit for 10 business days or more, but the bank will deposit the money into the account and state that it has been \\"verified\\" or is \\"clear\\" in about 24 hours. This gives the victim a false feeling of security that the money order was real, so they proceed with the transaction. When the bank eventually discovers that the money order is counterfeit and reverses the account credit many days later, the customer will usually have already mailed the item. In many cases the \\"check\\" or \\"money order\\" is for more than the amount owed, and the victim is asked to refund the difference in cash.[8][2]","input":"How long does it take for cashier's check to clear?"},{"output":"The printing press was invented in the Holy Roman Empire by the German Johannes Gutenberg around 1440, based on existing screw presses","context":"A printing press is a device for applying pressure to an inked surface resting upon a print medium (such as paper or cloth), thereby transferring the ink. This was a dramatic improvement on earlier printing methods in which the cloth, paper or other medium was brushed or rubbed repeatedly to achieve the transfer of ink, and greatly accelerated production. Typically used for texts, the invention and spread of the printing press was one of the most influential events in the second millennium.[1][2]\\r\\nThe printing press was invented in the Holy Roman Empire by the German Johannes Gutenberg around 1440, based on existing screw presses. Gutenberg, a goldsmith by profession, developed a printing system, by adapting existing technologies to printing purposes, as well as making inventions of his own. His newly devised hand mould made possible the precise and rapid creation of metal movable type in large quantities. Movable type had been hitherto unknown in Europe. In East Asia, where it was invented, the usefulness of movable type was limited by the complexity of the writing system and, without the hand mould, the production of sorts (individual letters of type) was slow. In Europe, the two inventions, the hand mould and the printing press, together drastically reduced the cost of printing books and other documents, particularly in short print runs.\\r\\nThe printing press spread within several decades to over two hundred cities in a dozen European countries.[3] By 1500, printing presses in operation throughout Western Europe had already produced more than twenty million volumes.[3] In the 16th century, with presses spreading further afield, their output rose tenfold to an estimated 150 to 200 million copies.[3] The operation of a press became synonymous with the enterprise of printing, and lent its name to a new branch of media, \\"the press\\".[4]\\r\\nIn Renaissance Europe, the arrival of mechanical movable type printing introduced the era of mass communication, which permanently altered the structure of society. The relatively unrestricted circulation of information and (revolutionary) ideas transcended borders, captured the masses in the Reformation and threatened the power of political and religious authorities. The sharp increase in literacy broke the monopoly of the literate elite on education and learning and bolstered the emerging middle class. Across Europe, the increasing cultural self-awareness of its peoples led to the rise of proto-nationalism, and accelerated by the development of European vernacular languages, to the detriment of Latin's status as lingua franca.[5] In the 19th century, the replacement of the hand-operated Gutenberg-style press by steam-powered rotary presses allowed printing on an industrial scale.[6]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe rapid economic and socio-cultural development of late medieval society in Europe created favorable intellectual and technological conditions for Gutenberg's invention: the entrepreneurial spirit of emerging capitalism increasingly made its impact on medieval modes of production, fostering economic thinking and improving the efficiency of traditional work-processes. The sharp rise of medieval learning and literacy amongst the middle class led to an increased demand for books which the time-consuming hand-copying method fell far short of accommodating.[7]\\r\\nTechnologies preceding the press that led to the press's invention included: manufacturing of paper, development of ink, woodblock printing, and distribution of eye-glasses.[8] At the same time, a number of medieval products and technological processes had reached a level of maturity which allowed their potential use for printing purposes. Gutenberg took up these far-flung strands, combined them into one complete and functioning system, and perfected the printing process through all its stages by adding a number of inventions and innovations of his own:\\r\\nThe screw press which allowed direct pressure to be applied on flat-plane was already of great antiquity in Gutenberg's time and was used for a wide range of tasks.[9] Introduced in the 1st century AD by the Romans, it was commonly employed in agricultural production for pressing wine grapes and (olive) oil fruit, both of which formed an integral part of the mediterranean and medieval diet.[10] The device was also used from very early on in urban contexts as a cloth press for printing patterns.[11] Gutenberg may have also been inspired by the paper presses which had spread through the German lands since the late 14th century and which worked on the same mechanical principles.[12]\\r\\nGutenberg adopted the basic design, thereby mechanizing the printing process.[13] Printing, however, put a demand on the machine quite different from pressing. Gutenberg adapted the construction so that the pressing power exerted by the platen on the paper was now applied both evenly and with the required sudden elasticity. To speed up the printing process, he introduced a movable undertable with a plane surface on which the sheets could be swiftly changed.[14]\\r\\nThe concept of movable type was not new in the 15th century; movable type printing had been invented in China during the Song dynasty, and was later used in Korea during the Goryeo Dynasty, where metal movable-type printing technology was developed in 1234.[15][16] In Europe, sporadic evidence that the typographical principle, the idea of creating a text by reusing individual characters, was well understood and employed in pre-Gutenberg Europe had been cropping up since the 12th century and possibly before. The known examples range from Germany (Prfening inscription) to England (letter tiles) to Italy.[17] However, the various techniques employed (imprinting, punching and assembling individual letters) did not have the refinement and efficiency needed to become widely accepted.\\r\\nGutenberg greatly improved the process by treating typesetting and printing as two separate work steps. A goldsmith by profession, he created his type pieces from a lead-based alloy which suited printing purposes so well that it is still used today.[18] The mass production of metal letters was achieved by his key invention of a special hand mould, the matrix.[19] The Latin alphabet proved to be an enormous advantage in the process because, in contrast to logographic writing systems, it allowed the type-setter to represent any text with a theoretical minimum of only around two dozen different letters.[20]\\r\\nAnother factor conducive to printing arose from the book existing in the format of the codex, which had originated in the Roman period.[21] Considered the most important advance in the history of the book prior to printing itself, the codex had completely replaced the ancient scroll at the onset of the Middle Ages (500 AD).[22] The codex holds considerable practical advantages over the scroll format; it is more convenient to read (by turning pages), is more compact, less costly, and, in particular, unlike the scroll, both recto and verso could be used for writing ? and printing.[23]\\r\\nA fourth development was the early success of medieval papermakers at mechanizing paper manufacture. The introduction of water-powered paper mills, the first certain evidence of which dates to 1282,[24] allowed for a massive expansion of production and replaced the laborious handcraft characteristic of both Chinese[25] and Muslim papermaking.[26] Papermaking centres began to multiply in the late 13th century in Italy, reducing the price of paper to one sixth of parchment and then falling further; papermaking centers reached Germany a century later.[27]\\r\\nDespite this it appears that the final breakthrough of paper depended just as much on the rapid spread of movable-type printing.[28] It is notable that codices of parchment, which in terms of quality is superior to any other writing material,[29] still had a substantial share in Gutenberg's edition of the 42-line Bible.[30] After much experimentation, Gutenberg managed to overcome the difficulties which traditional water-based inks caused by soaking the paper, and found the formula for an oil-based ink suitable for high-quality printing with metal type.[31]\\r\\nA printing press, in its classical form, is a standing mechanism, ranging from 5 to 7 feet (1.5 to 2.1?m) long, 3 feet (0.91?m) wide, and 7 feet (2.1?m) tall. Type, small metal letters that have a raised letter on one end, is arranged into pages and placed in a frame to make a forme, which itself is placed onto a flat stone, 'bed,' or 'coffin.' The text is inked using two balls, pads mounted on handles. The balls were made of dog skin leather, because it has no pores[33], and stuffed with sheep's wool and were inked. This ink was then applied to the text evenly. One damp piece of paper was then taken from a heap of paper and placed on the tympan. The paper was damp as this lets the type 'bite' into the paper better. Small pins hold the paper in place. The paper is now held between a frisket and tympan (two frames covered with paper or parchment).\\r\\nThese are folded down, so that the paper lies on the surface of the inked type. The bed is rolled under the platen, using a windlass mechanism. A small rotating handle is used called the 'rounce' to do this, and the impression is made with a screw that transmits pressure through the platen. To turn the screw the long handle attached to it is turned. This is known as the bar or 'Devil's Tail.' In a well-set-up press, the springiness of the paper, frisket, and tympan caused the bar to spring back and raise the platen, the windlass turned again to move the bed back to its original position, the tympan and frisket raised and opened, and the printed sheet removed. Such presses were always worked by hand. After around 1800, iron presses were developed, some of which could be operated by steam power.\\r\\nJohannes Gutenberg's work on the printing press began in approximately 1436 when he partnered with Andreas Dritzehna man who had previously instructed in gem-cuttingand Andreas Heilmann, owner of a paper mill.[34] However, it was not until a 1439 lawsuit against Gutenberg that an official record existed; witnesses' testimony discussed Gutenberg's types, an inventory of metals (including lead), and his type molds.[34]\\r\\nHaving previously worked as a professional goldsmith, Gutenberg made skillful use of the knowledge of metals he had learned as a craftsman. He was the first to make type from an alloy of lead, tin, and antimony, which was critical for producing durable type that produced high-quality printed books and proved to be much better suited for printing than all other known materials. To create these lead types, Gutenberg used what is considered one of his most ingenious inventions,[34] a special matrix enabling the quick and precise molding of new type blocks from a uniform template. His type case is estimated to have contained around 290 separate letter boxes, most of which were required for special characters, ligatures, punctuation marks, and so forth.[35]\\r\\nGutenberg is also credited with the introduction of an oil-based ink which was more durable than the previously used water-based inks. As printing material he used both paper and vellum (high-quality parchment). In the Gutenberg Bible, Gutenberg made a trial of coloured printing for a few of the page headings, present only in some copies.[36] A later work, the Mainz Psalter of 1453, presumably designed by Gutenberg but published under the imprint of his successors Johann Fust and Peter Sch?ffer, had elaborate red and blue printed initials.[37]\\r\\nThe Printing Revolution occurred when the spread of the printing press facilitated the wide circulation of information and ideas, acting as an \\"agent of change\\" through the societies that it reached. (Eisenstein (1980))\\r\\nThe invention of mechanical movable type printing led to a huge increase of printing activities across Europe within only a few decades. From a single print shop in Mainz, Germany, printing had spread to no less than around 270 cities in Central, Western and Eastern Europe by the end of the 15th century.[39] As early as 1480, there were printers active in 110 different places in Germany, Italy, France, Spain, the Netherlands, Belgium, Switzerland, England, Bohemia and Poland.[3] From that time on, it is assumed that \\"the printed book was in universal use in Europe\\".[3]\\r\\nIn Italy, a center of early printing, print shops had been established in 77 cities and towns by 1500. At the end of the following century, 151 locations in Italy had seen at one time printing activities, with a total of nearly three thousand printers known to be active. Despite this proliferation, printing centres soon emerged; thus, one third of the Italian printers published in Venice.[40]\\r\\nBy 1500, the printing presses in operation throughout Western Europe had already produced more than twenty million copies.[3] In the following century, their output rose tenfold to an estimated 150 to 200 million copies.[3]\\r\\nEuropean printing presses of around 1600 were capable of producing about 1,500 impressions per workday.[41] By comparison, book printing in East Asia, did not use presses and was solely done by block printing.[42]\\r\\nOf Erasmus's work, at least 750,000 copies were sold during his lifetime alone (1469ÿ1536).[43] In the early days of the Reformation, the revolutionary potential of bulk printing took princes and papacy alike by surprise. In the period from 1518 to 1524, the publication of books in Germany alone skyrocketed sevenfold; between 1518 and 1520, Luther's tracts were distributed in 300,000 printed copies.[44]\\r\\nThe rapidity of typographical text production, as well as the sharp fall in unit costs, led to the issuing of the first newspapers (see Relation) which opened up an entirely new field for conveying up-to-date information to the public.[45]\\r\\nIncunable are surviving pre-16th century print works which are collected by many of the libraries in Europe and North America.[46]\\r\\nThe printing press was also a factor in the establishment of a community of scientists who could easily communicate their discoveries through the establishment of widely disseminated scholarly journals, helping to bring on the scientific revolution.[citation needed] Because of the printing press, authorship became more meaningful and profitable. It was suddenly important who had said or written what, and what the precise formulation and time of composition was. This allowed the exact citing of references, producing the rule, \\"One Author, one work (title), one piece of information\\" (Giesecke, 1989; 325). Before, the author was less important, since a copy of Aristotle made in Paris would not be exactly identical to one made in Bologna. For many works prior to the printing press, the name of the author has been entirely lost.[citation needed]\\r\\nBecause the printing process ensured that the same information fell on the same pages, page numbering, tables of contents, and indices became common, though they previously had not been unknown.[citation needed] The process of reading also changed, gradually moving over several centuries from oral readings to silent, private reading.[citation needed] Over the next 200 years, the wider availability of printed materials led to a dramatic rise in the adult literacy rate throughout Europe.[47]\\r\\nThe printing press was an important step towards the democratization of knowledge.[48][49] Within 50 or 60 years of the invention of the printing press, the entire classical canon had been reprinted and widely promulgated throughout Europe (Eisenstein, 1969; 52). Now that more people had access to knowledge both new and old, more people could discuss these works. Furthermore, now that book production was a more commercial enterprise, the first copyright laws were passed to protect what we now would call intellectual property rights.[citation needed] On the other hand, the printing press was criticized for allowing the dissemination of information which may have been incorrect.[50][51]\\r\\nA second outgrowth of this popularization of knowledge was the decline of Latin as the language of most published works, to be replaced by the vernacular language of each area, increasing the variety of published works. The printed word also helped to unify and standardize the spelling and syntax of these vernaculars, in effect 'decreasing' their variability. This rise in importance of national languages as opposed to pan-European Latin is cited[who?] as one of the causes of the rise of nationalism in Europe.\\r\\nA third consequence of popularization of printing was on the economy. Printing press was associated with higher levels of city growth.[52] Publication of trade related manuals and books teaching techniques like double-entry bookkeeping, increased reliability of trade and led to decline of merchant guilds and rise of individual traders.[53]\\r\\nFor years, book printing was considered a true art form. Typesetting, or the placement of the characters on the page, including the use of ligatures, was passed down from master to apprentice. In Germany, the art of typesetting was termed the \\"black art\\", in allusion to the ink-covered printers. It has largely been replaced by computer typesetting programs, which make it easy to get similar results more quickly and with less physical labor. Some practitioners continue to print books the way Gutenberg did. For example, there is a yearly convention of traditional book printers in Mainz, Germany.\\r\\nSome theorists, such as McLuhan, Eisenstein, Kittler, and Giesecke, see an \\"alphabetic monopoly\\" as having developed from printing, removing the role of the image from society. Other authors stress that printed works themselves are a visual medium. Certainly, modern developments in printing have revitalized the role of illustrations.\\r\\nAt the dawn of the Industrial Revolution, the mechanics of the hand-operated Gutenberg-style press were still essentially unchanged, although new materials in its construction, amongst other innovations, had gradually improved its printing efficiency. By 1800, Lord Stanhope had built a press completely from cast iron which reduced the force required by 90%, while doubling the size of the printed area.[54] With a capacity of 480 pages per hour, it doubled the output of the old style press.[55] Nonetheless, the limitations inherent to the traditional method of printing became obvious.\\r\\nTwo ideas altered the design of the printing press radically: First, the use of steam power for running the machinery, and second the replacement of the printing flatbed with the rotary motion of cylinders. Both elements were for the first time successfully implemented by the German printer Friedrich Koenig in a series of press designs devised between 1802 and 1818.[56] Having moved to London in 1804, Koenig soon met Thomas Bensley and secured financial support for his project in 1807.[54] Patented in 1810, Koenig had designed a steam press \\"much like a hand press connected to a steam engine.\\"[54] The first production trial of this model occurred in April 1811. He produced his machine with assistance from German engineer Andreas Friedrich Bauer.\\r\\nKoenig and Bauer sold two of their first models to The Times in London in 1814, capable of 1,100 impressions per hour. The first edition so printed was on 28 November 1814. They went on to perfect the early model so that it could print on both sides of a sheet at once. This began the long process of making newspapers available to a mass audience (which in turn helped spread literacy), and from the 1820s changed the nature of book production, forcing a greater standardization in titles and other metadata. Their company Koenig & Bauer AG is still one of the world's largest manufacturers of printing presses today.\\r\\nThe steam powered rotary printing press, invented in 1843 in the United States by Richard M. Hoe,[57] allowed millions of copies of a page in a single day. Mass production of printed works flourished after the transition to rolled paper, as continuous feed allowed the presses to run at a much faster pace.\\r\\nBy the late 1930s or early 1940s, rotary presses had increased substantially in efficiency: a model by Platen Printing Press was capable of performing 2,500 to 3,000 impressions per hour.[citation needed]\\r\\nAlso, in the middle of the 19th century, there was a separate development of jobbing presses, small presses capable of printing small-format pieces such as billheads, letterheads, business cards, and envelopes. Jobbing presses were capable of quick set-up (average setup time for a small job was under 15 minutes) and quick production (even on treadle-powered jobbing presses it was considered normal to get 1,000 impressions per hour [iph] with one pressman, with speeds of 1,500 iph often attained on simple envelope work).[citation needed] Job printing emerged as a reasonably cost-effective duplicating solution for commerce at this time.\\r\\nModel of the Common Press, used from 1650 to 1850\\r\\nPrinting press from 1811\\r\\nStanhope press from 1842\\r\\nImprenta Press V John Sherwin from 1860\\r\\nAt the same time, then, as the printing press in the physical, technological sense was invented, 'the press' in the extended sense of the word also entered the historical stage. The phenomenon of publishing was born.\\r\\nGutenberg's invention took full advantage of the degree of abstraction in representing language forms that was offered by the alphabet and by the Western forms of script that were current in the fifteenth century.\\r\\nThe most momentous development in the history of the book until the invention of printing was the replacement of the roll by the codex; this we may define as a collection of sheets of any material, folded double and fastened together at the back or spine, and usually protected by covers. (p. 1)\\r\\nIn the West, the only inhibiting expense in the production of writings for an increasingly literate market was the manual labor of the scribe himself. With his mechanization by movable-type printing in the 1440s, the manufacture of paper, until then relatively confined, began to spread very widely. The Paper Revolution of the thirteenth century thus entered a new era.\\r\\nDespite all that has been said above, even the strongest supporters of papyrus would not deny that parchment of good quality is the finest writing material ever devised by man. It is immensely strong, remains flexible indefinitely under normal conditions, does not deteriorate with age, and possesses a smooth, even surface which is both pleasant to the eye and provides unlimited scope for the finest writing and illumination.\\r\\nFrom old price tables it can be deduced that the capacity of a printing press around 1600, assuming a fifteen-hour workday, was between 3,200 and 3,600 impressions per day.\\r\\nThe outstanding difference between the two ends of the Old World was the absence of screw-presses from China, but this is only another manifestation of the fact that this basic mechanism was foreign to that culture.\\r\\nIn East Asia, both woodblock and movable type printing were manual reproduction techniques, that is hand printing.\\r\\nChinese paper was suitable only for calligraphy or block-printing; there were no screw-based presses in the east, because they were not wine-drinkers, didnt have olives, and used other means to dry their paper.\\r\\nOn the effects of the printing press\\r\\nTechnology of printing","input":"When was the printing press invented and by who?"},{"output":"October 1983","context":"The first version of Microsoft Word was developed by Charles Simonyi and Richard Brodie, former Xerox programmers hired by Bill Gates and Paul Allen in 1981. Both programmers worked on Xerox Bravo, the first WYSIWYG (What You See Is What You Get) word processor. The first Word version, Word 1.0, was released in October 1983 for Xenix and MS-DOS; it was followed by four very similar versions that were not very successful. The first Windows version was released in 1989, with a slightly improved interface. When Windows 3.0 was released in 1990, Word became a huge commercial success. Word for Windows 1.0 was followed by Word 2.0 in 1991 and Word 6.0 in 1993. Then it was renamed to Word 95 and Word 97, Word 2000 and Word for Office XP (to follow Windows commercial names). With the release of Word 2003, the numbering was again year-based. Since then, Word 2007, Word 2010, Word 2013, and most recently, Word 2016 have been released for Windows.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1986, an agreement between Atari and Microsoft brought Word to the Atari ST.[1] The Atari ST version was a translation of Word 1.05 for the Apple Macintosh; however, it was released under the name Microsoft Write (the name of the word processor included with Windows during the 80s and early 90s).[2][3] Unlike other versions of Word, the Atari version was a one time release with no future updates or revisions. The release of Microsoft Write was one of two major PC applications that were released for the Atari ST (the other application being WordPerfect). Microsoft Write was released for the Atari ST in 1988.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 2014 the source code for Word for Windows in the version 1.1a was made available to the Computer History Museum and the public for educational purposes.[4][5]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe first Microsoft Word was released in 1983. It featured graphics video mode and mouse support in a WYSIWYG interface. It could run in text mode or graphics mode but the visual difference between the two was minor. In graphics mode, the document and interface were rendered in a fixed font size monospace character grid with italic, bold and underline features that was not available in text mode. It had support for style sheets in separate files (.STY).\\r\\n\\r\\nThe first version of Word was a 16 bits PC-DOS/MS-DOS application. A Macintosh 68000 version named Word 1.0 was released in 1985 and a Microsoft Windows was released in 1989. The three products shared the same Microsoft Word name, the same version numbers but were very different products built on different code bases. Three product lines co-existed: Word 1.0 to Word 5.0 for Macintosh, Word 1.0 to Word 2.0 for Windows and Word 1.0 to Word 5.5 for DOS.\\r\\n\\r\\nWord 1.1 for DOS was released in 1984 and added the Print Merge support, equivalent to the Mail Merge feature in newer Word systems.\\r\\n\\r\\nWord 2.0 for DOS was released in 1985 and featured Extended Graphics Array (EGA) support.\\r\\n\\r\\nWord 3.0 for DOS, released in 1986 added support for revision marks (equivalent to the Track changes features in more recent Word versions), search/replace by style and macros stored as key stroke sequences.\\r\\n\\r\\nWord 4.0 for DOS was released in 1987.\\r\\n\\r\\nWord 5.0 for DOS, released in 1989, added support for bookmarks and cross-references and conditions and loops in macros, remaining backwards compatible with Word 3.0 macros. The macro language differed from the WinWord 1.0 WordBasic macro language.\\r\\n\\r\\nWord 5.5 for DOS, released in 1990 significantly changed the user interface, with popup menus and dialog boxes. Even in graphics mode, these Graphical User Interface (GUI) elements got the monospace ASCII art look and feel found in text mode programs like Microsoft QuickBasic.\\r\\n\\r\\nWord 6.0 for DOS, the last Word for DOS version, was released in 1993, at the same time as Word 6.0 for Windows (16 bits) and Word 6.0 for Macintosh. Although Macintosh and Windows versions shared the same code base, the Word for DOS was different. The Word 6.0 for DOS macro language was compatible with the Word 3.x-5.x macro language while Word 6.0 for Windows and Word 6.0 for Macintosh inherited WordBasic from the Word 1.0/2.0 for Windows code base. The DOS and Windows versions of Word 6.0 had different file formats.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe first version of Word for Windows was released in November 1989 at a price of US$498, but was not very popular as Windows users still comprised a minority of the market.[6] The next year, Windows 3.0 debuted, followed shortly afterwards by WinWord 1.1 which was updated for the new OS. The failure of WordPerfect to produce a Windows version proved a fatal mistake. The following year, in 1991, WinWord 2.0 was released which had further improvements and finally solidified Word's marketplace dominance. WinWord 6.0 came out in 1993 and was designed for the newly released Windows 3.1.[7]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe early versions of Word also included copy protection mechanisms that tried to detect debuggers, and if one was found, it produced the message \\"The tree of evil bears bitter fruit. Only the Shadow knows. Now trashing program disk.\\" and performed a zero seek on the floppy disk (but did not delete its contents).[8][9][10]\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter MacWrite, Word for Macintosh never had any serious rivals, although programs such as Nisus Writer provided features such as non-continuous selection, which were not added until Word 2002 in Office XP. \\r\\nWord 5.1 for the Macintosh, released in 1992, was a very popular word processor, owing to its elegance, relative ease of use and feature set. However, version 6.0 for the Macintosh, released in 1994, was widely derided, unlike the Windows version. It was the first version of Word based on a common code base between the Windows and Mac versions; many accused it of being slow, clumsy and memory intensive.\\r\\n\\r\\nWith the release of Word 6.0 in 1993 Microsoft again attempted to synchronize the version numbers and coordinate product naming across platforms; this time across the three versions for DOS, Macintosh, and Windows (where the previous version was Word for Windows 2.0). There may have also been thought given to matching the current version 6.0 of WordPerfect for DOS and Windows, Word's major competitor. However, this wound up being the last version of Word for DOS. In addition, subsequent versions of Word were no longer referred to by version number, and were instead named after the year of their release (e.g. Word 95 for Windows, synchronizing its name with Windows 95, and Word 98 for Macintosh), once again breaking the synchronization.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen Microsoft became aware of the Year 2000 problem, it released the entire DOS port of Microsoft Word 5.5 instead of getting people to pay for the update. As of January 2018, it is still available for download from Microsoft's web site.[11]\\r\\n\\r\\nWord 6.0 was the second attempt to develop a common code base version of Word. The first, code-named Pyramid, had been an attempt to completely rewrite the existing product. It was abandoned when Chris Peters replaced Jeff Raikes at the lead developer of the Word project[12] and determined it would take the development team too long to rewrite and then catch up with all the new capabilities that could have been added in the same time without a rewrite. Therefore, Word 6.0 for Windows and Macintosh were both derived from Word 2.0 for Windows code base. The Word 3.0 to 5.0 for Windows version numbers were skipped (outside of DBCS locales) in order to keep the version numbers consistent between Macintosh and Windows versions. Supporters of Pyramid claimed that it would have been faster, smaller, and more stable than the product that was eventually released for Macintosh, and which was compiled using a beta version of Visual C++ 2.0 that targets the Macintosh, so many optimizations have to be turned off (the version 4.2.1 of Office is compiled using the final version), and sometimes use the Windows API simulation library included.[13] Pyramid would have been truly cross-platform, with machine-independent application code and a small mediation layer between the application and the operating system.\\r\\n\\r\\nMore recent versions of Word for Macintosh are no longer ported versions of Word for Windows.\\r\\n\\r\\nLater versions of Word have more capabilities than merely word processing. The drawing tool allows simple desktop publishing operations, such as adding graphics to documents.\\r\\n\\r\\nWord 95 was released as part of Office 95 and was numbered 7.0, consistently with all Office components. It ran exclusively on the Win32 platform, but, otherwise had few new features. The file format did not change.\\r\\n\\r\\nWord 97 had the same general operating performance as later versions such as Word 2000. This was the first copy of Word featuring the Office Assistant, \\"Clippit\\", which was an animated helper used in all Office programs. This was a takeover from the earlier launched concept in  Microsoft Bob. Word 97 introduced the macro programming language Visual Basic for Applications (VBA) which remains in use in Word 2016.\\r\\n\\r\\nWord 98 for the Macintosh gained many features of Word 97, and was bundled with the Macintosh Office 98 package. Document compatibility reached parity with Office 97 and Word on the Mac became a viable business alternative to its Windows counterpart. Unfortunately, Word on the Mac in this and later releases also became vulnerable to future macro viruses that could compromise Word (and Excel) documents, leading to the only situation where viruses could be cross-platform. A Windows version of this was only bundled with the Japanese/Korean Microsoft Office 97 Powered By Word 98 and could not be purchased separately. It was then released in the same period as well.\\r\\n\\r\\nWord 2001 was bundled with the Macintosh Office for that platform, acquiring most, if not all, of the feature set of Word 2000. Released in October 2000, Word 2001 was also sold as an individual product. The Macintosh version, Word X, released in 2001, was the first version to run natively on (and required) Mac OS X.\\r\\n\\r\\nWord 2002 was bundled with Office XP and was released in 2001. It had many of the same features as Word 2000, but had a major new feature called the 'Task Panes', which gave quicker information and control to a lot of features that were before only available in modal dialog boxes. One of the key advertising strategies for the software was the removal of the Office Assistant in favor of a new help system, although it was simply disabled by default.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor the 2003 version, the Office programs, including Word, were rebranded to emphasize the unity of the Office suite, so that Microsoft Word officially became Microsoft Office Word.\\r\\n\\r\\nA new Macintosh version of Office was released in May 2004. Substantial cleanup of the various applications (Word, Excel, PowerPoint) and feature parity with Office 2003 (for Microsoft Windows) created a very usable release. Microsoft released patches through the years to eliminate most known macro vulnerabilities from this version. While Apple released Pages and the open source community created NeoOffice, Word remains the most widely used word processor on the Macintosh.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe release includes numerous changes, including a new XML-based file format, a redesigned interface, an integrated equation editor and bibliographic management. Additionally, an XML data bag was introduced, accessible via the object model and file format, called Custom XML ÿ this can be used in conjunction with a new feature called Content Controls to implement structured documents. It also has contextual tabs, which are functionality specific only to the object with focus, and many other features like Live Preview (which enables you to view the document without making any permanent changes), Mini Toolbar, Super-tooltips, Quick Access toolbar, SmartArt, etc.\\r\\n\\r\\nWord 2007 uses a new file format called docx. Word 2000ÿ2003 users on Windows systems can install a free add-on called the \\"Microsoft Office Compatibility Pack\\" to be able to open, edit, and save the new Word 2007 files.[14] Alternatively, Word 2007 can save to the old doc format of Word 97-2003.[15][16]\\r\\n\\r\\nWord 2008 was released on January 15, 2008. It includes some new features from Word 2007, such as a ribbon-like feature that can be used to select page layouts and insert custom diagrams and images. Word 2008 also features native support for the new Office Open XML format, although the old doc format can be set as a default.[17]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe release of Word 2013 has brought Word a cleaner look and this version focuses further on Cloud Computing with documents being saved automatically to OneDrive (previously Skydrive). If enabled, documents and settings roam with the user. Other notable features are a new read mode which allows for horizontal scrolling of pages in columns, a bookmark to find where the user left off reading their document and opening PDF documents in Word just like Word content. The version released for the Windows 8 operating system is modified for use with a touchscreen and on tablets. It is the first version of Word to not run on Windows XP or Windows Vista.[18]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 2016, Microsoft Word 16 was released. It is the modern newest version of the word processing application. New features include the tell me, share and faster shape formatting option too. Other useful features include the work together in real time which allows users to store documents on Share Point or OneDrive, improved version history and smart lookup tool as well. As normal, several editions of the program were released as well, including one for home and one for business.","input":"When was the first version of word released?"},{"output":"13,385,378 m3 (472,370,319 cu ft)","context":"The Boeing Everett Factory, in Everett, Washington, is an airplane assembly building owned by Boeing.

It purchased 780 acres north of the then little-used Paine Field, which was operated by the US Army in World War II. Boeing has had an Everett presence since 1943.[3]\\r\\nIn 1968 it began offering factory tours with the first roll out of the 747.[4] Over 150,000 people visit the Everett Site each year.[2] The factory includes a Boeing Employees' Credit Union branch and several cafs.

The Boeing 747 was one of the first wide-body aircraft to be produced and was the first jet to use a wide-body configuration for carrying passengers. Because of the vast size of the 747, the Boeing Everett Factory was designed and built to accommodate the assembly of these large planes as there was not enough room at the Boeing facilities in Seattle.

Worldwide, various events are held to demonstrate support for environmental protection. First celebrated in 1970, Earth Day events in more than 193 countries[1] are now coordinated globally by the Earth Day Network.[2]\\r\\nOn Earth Day 2016, the landmark Paris Agreement was signed by the United States, China, and some 120 other countries.[3][4][5] This signing satisfied a key requirement for the entry into force of the historic draft climate protection treaty adopted by consensus of the 195 nations present at the 2015 United Nations Climate Change Conference in Paris.\\r\\nIn 1969 at a UNESCO Conference in San Francisco, peace activist John McConnell proposed a day to honor the Earth and the concept of peace, to first be celebrated on March 21, 1970, the first day of spring in the northern hemisphere. This day of nature's equipoise was later sanctioned in a proclamation written by McConnell and signed by Secretary General U Thant at the United Nations. A month later a separate Earth Day was founded by United States Senator Gaylord Nelson as an environmental teach-in first held on April 22, 1970. Nelson was later awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom award in recognition of his work.[6] While this April 22 Earth Day was focused on the United States, an organization launched by Denis Hayes, who was the original national coordinator in 1970, took it international in 1990 and organized events in 141 nations.[7][8]\\r\\nNumerous communities celebrate Earth Week, an entire week of activities focused on the environmental issues that the world faces. In 2017, the March for Science occurred on Earth Day (April 22, 2017) and was followed by the People's Climate Mobilization (April 29, 2017).\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nOn January 28, 1969, a well drilled by Union Oil Platform A off the coast of Santa Barbara, California, blew out. More than three million gallons of oil spewed, killing over 10,000 seabirds, dolphins, seals, and sea lions. As a reaction to this natural disaster, activists were mobilized to create environmental regulation, environmental education, and Earth Day. Among the proponents of Earth Day were the people in the front lines of fighting this disaster, Selma Rubin, Marc McGinnes, and Bud Bottoms, founder of Get Oil Out.[9] According to Kate Wheeling, Denis Hayes told her that Senator Gaylord Nelson from Wisconsin saw the Santa Barbara Channel 800 square-mile oil slick from an airplane, which gave him the impetus to organize Earth Day.[10]\\r\\nOn the first anniversary of the oil blowout, January 28,1970, Environmental Rights Day is celebrated, where the Declaration of Environmental Rights is read. It had been written by Rod Nash during a boat trip across the Santa Barbara Channel while carrying a copy of Thomas Jefferson's Declaration of Independence.[11] The organizers of Environmental Rights Day, led by Marc McGinnes, had been working closely over a period of several months with Congressman Pete McCloskey (R-CA) to consult on the creation of the National Environmental Policy Act, the first of many new environmental protection laws sparked by the national outcry about the blowout/oil spill and on the Declaration of Environmental Rights. Both McCloskey (Earth Day co-chair with Senator Gaylord Nelson) and Earth Day organizer Denis Hayes, along with Senator Alan Cranston, Paul Ehrlich, David Brower and other prominent leaders, endorsed the Declaration and spoke about it at the Environmental Rights Day conference. According to Francis Sarguis, \\"the conference was sort of like the baptism for the movement.\\"[12] Nash, Garrett Hardin, McGinnes and others went on to develop the first undergraduate Environmental Studies program of its kind at the University of California at Santa Barbara.[13]\\r\\nThe first Earth Day celebrations took place in two thousand colleges and universities, roughly ten thousand primary and secondary schools, and hundreds of communities across the United States. More importantly, it \\"brought 20 million Americans out into the spring sunshine for peaceful demonstrations in favor of environmental reform.\\"[14] It now is observed in 192 countries, and coordinated by the nonprofit Earth Day Network, chaired by the first Earth Day 1970 organizer Denis Hayes, according to whom Earth Day is now \\"the largest secular holiday in the world, celebrated by more than a billion people every year.\\"[15] Walt Kelly created an anti-pollution poster featuring his comic strip character Pogo with the quotation \\"We have met the enemy and he is us\\" to promote the 1970 Earth Day. Environmental groups have sought to make Earth Day into a day of action to change human behavior and provoke policy changes.[16]\\r\\nIn the winter of 1969ÿ1970, a group of students met at Columbia University to hear Denis Hayes talk about his plans for Earth Day. Among the group were Fred Kent, Pete Grannis, and Kristin and William Hubbard. This group agreed to head up the New York City activities within the national movement. Fred Kent took the lead in renting an office and recruiting volunteers. \\"The big break came when Mayor Lindsay agreed to shut down Fifth Avenue for the event. A giant cheer went up in the office on that day,\\" according to Kristin Hubbard (now Kristin Alexandre). 'From that time on we used Mayor Lindsay's offices and even his staff. I was Speaker Coordinator but had tremendous help from Lindsay staffer Judith Crichton.\\"\\r\\nIn addition to shutting down Fifth Avenue, Mayor John Lindsay made Central Park available for Earth Day. In Union Square, New York Times estimated crowds of up to 20,000 people at any given time and, perhaps, as many as over 100,000 over the course of the day.[17] Since Manhattan was also the home of NBC, CBS, ABC, The New York Times, Time, and Newsweek, it provided the best possible anchor for national coverage from their reporters throughout the country.[18]\\r\\nU.S. Senator Edmund Muskie was the keynote speaker on Earth Day in Fairmount Park in Philadelphia. Other notable attendees included consumer protection activist and presidential candidate Ralph Nader; Landscape Architect Ian McHarg; Nobel prize-winning Harvard Biochemist, George Wald; U.S. Senate Minority Leader, Hugh Scott; and poet, Allen Ginsberg.\\r\\nMobilizing 200 million people in 141 countries and lifting the status of environmental issues onto the world stage, Earth Day activities in 1990 gave a huge boost to recycling efforts worldwide and helped pave the way for the 1992 United Nations Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro. Unlike the first Earth Day in 1970, this 20th Anniversary was waged with stronger marketing tools, greater access to television and radio, and multimillion-dollar budgets.[19]\\r\\nTwo separate groups formed to sponsor Earth Day events in 1990: The Earth Day 20 Foundation, assembled by Edward Furia (Project Director of Earth Week in 1970), and Earth Day 1990, assembled by Denis Hayes (National Coordinator for Earth Day 1970). Senator Gaylord Nelson, the original founder of Earth Day, was honorary chairman for both groups. The two did not combine forces over disagreements about leadership of combined organization and incompatible structures and strategies.[19] Among the disagreements, key Earth Day 20 Foundation organizers were critical of Earth Day 1990 for including on their board Hewlett-Packard, a company that at the time was the second-biggest emitter of chlorofluorocarbons in Silicon Valley and refused to switch to alternative solvents.[19] In terms of marketing, Earth Day 20 had a grassroots approach to organizing and relied largely on locally based groups like the National Toxics Campaign, a Boston-based coalition of 1,000 local groups concerned with industrial pollution. Earth Day 1990 employed strategies including focus group testing, direct mail fund raising, and email marketing.[19]\\r\\nThe Earth Day 20 Foundation highlighted its April 22 activities in George, Washington, near the Columbia River with a live satellite phone call with members of the historic Earth Day 20 International Peace Climb who called from their base camp on Mount Everest to pledge their support for world peace and attention to environmental issues.[20] The Earth Day 20 International Peace Climb was led by Jim Whittaker, the first American to summit Mt. Everest (many years earlier), and marked the first time in history that mountaineers from the United States, Soviet Union, and China had roped together to climb a mountain, let alone Mt. Everest.[20] The group also collected more than two tons of trash (transported down the mountain by support groups along the way) that was left behind on Mount Everest from previous climbing expeditions. The master of ceremonies for the Columbia Gorge event was the TV star, John Ratzenberger, from \\"Cheers\\", and the headlining musician was the \\"Father of Rock and Roll,\\" Chuck Berry.[20]\\r\\nWarner Bros. Records released an Earth Day-themed single in 1990 entitled \\"Tomorrow's World\\", written by Kix Brooks (who would later become one-half of Brooks & Dunn) and Pam Tillis.[21] The song featured vocals from Lynn Anderson, Butch Baker, Shane Barmby, Billy Hill, Suzy Bogguss, Kix Brooks, T. Graham Brown, The Burch Sisters, Holly Dunn, Foster & Lloyd, Vince Gill, William Lee Golden, Highway 101, Shelby Lynne, Johnny Rodriguez, Dan Seals, Les Taylor, Pam Tillis, Mac Wiseman, and Kevin Welch. It charted at number 74 on the Hot Country Songs chart dated May 5, 1990.[22]\\r\\nEarth Day 2000 combined the ambitious spirit of the first Earth Day with the international grassroots activism of Earth Day 1990. This was the first year that Earth Day used the Internet as its principal organizing tool, and it proved invaluable nationally and internationally. Kelly Evans, a professional political organizer, served as executive director of the 2000 campaign. The event ultimately enlisted more than 5,000 environmental groups outside the United States, reaching hundreds of millions of people in a record 183 countries.[23] Leonardo DiCaprio was the official host for the event,[23] and about 400,000 participants stood in the cold rain during the course of the day.\\r\\nTo turn Earth Day into a sustainable annual event rather than one that occurred every 10 years, Nelson and Bruce Anderson, New Hampshire's lead organizers in 1990, formed Earth Day USA. Building on the momentum created by thousands of community organizers around the world, Earth Day USA coordinated the next five Earth Day celebrations through 1995, including the launch of EarthDay.org. Following the 25th Anniversary in 1995, the coordination baton was handed to Earth Day Network.\\r\\nAs the millennium approached, Hayes agreed to spearhead another campaign, this time focusing on global warming and pushing for clean energy. The April 22 Earth Day in 2000 combined the big-picture feistiness of the first Earth Day with the international grassroots activism of Earth Day 1990. For 2000, Earth Day had the internet to help link activists around the world. By the time April 22 came around, 5,000 environmental groups around the world were on board reaching out to hundreds of millions of people in a record 184 countries. Events varied: A talking drum chain traveled from village to village in Gabon, Africa, for example, while hundreds of thousands of people gathered on the National Mall in Washington, D.C., USA.\\r\\nEarth Day 2007 was one of the largest Earth Days to date, with many people participating in the activities in thousands of places including Kiev, Ukraine; Caracas, Venezuela; Tuvalu; Manila, Philippines; Togo; Madrid, Spain; London; and New York.\\r\\nFor Earth Day 2017, the Earth Day Network created four toolkits to aid organizations wanting to hold teach-ins to celebrate the theme \\"Environmental and Climate Literacy.\\"[24] The four toolkits are:\\r\\n2017 also saw the Earth Day Network co-organize the March for Science rally and teach-in at the National Mall in Washington D.C.[24]\\r\\nAccording to Nelson, the moniker \\"Earth Day\\" was \\"an obvious and logical name\\" suggested by a lot of other people in the fall of 1969, including, he writes, both \\"a friend of mine who had been in the field of public relations\\" and \\"a New York advertising executive,\\" Julian Koenig.[25] Koenig, who had been on Nelson's organizing committee in 1969, has said that the idea came to him by the coincidence of his birthday with the day selected, April 22; \\"Earth Day\\" rhyming with \\"birthday,\\" the connection seemed natural.[26][27] Other names circulated during preparationsNelson himself continued to call it the National Environment Teach-In, but national coordinator Denis Hayes used the term Earth Day in his communications and press coverage of the event was \\"practically unanimous\\" in its use of \\"Earth Day,\\" so the name stuck.[25] The introduction of the name \\"Earth Day\\" was also claimed by John McConnell (see \\"Equinox Earth Day,\\" below).[28]\\r\\nThe first Canadian Earth Day was held on Thursday, September 11, 1980, and was organized by Paul D. Tinari, then a graduate student in Engineering Physics/Solar Engineering at Queen's University. Flora MacDonald, then MP for Kingston and the Islands and former Canadian Secretary of State for External Affairs, officially opened Earth Day Week on September 6, 1980 with a ceremonial tree planting and encouraged MPs and MPPs across the country to declare a cross-Canada annual Earth Day. The principal activities taking place on the first Earth Day included educational lectures given by experts in various environmental fields, garbage and litter pick-up by students along city roads and highways as well as tree plantings to replace the trees killed by Dutch Elm Disease.[29][30]\\r\\nThe equinoctial Earth Day is celebrated on the March equinox (around March 20) to mark the precise moment of astronomical spring in the Northern Hemisphere, and of astronomical autumn in the Southern Hemisphere. An equinox in astronomy is that point in time (not a whole day) when the Sun is directly above the Earth's equator, occurring around March 20 and September 23 each year. In most cultures, the equinoxes and solstices are considered to start or separate the seasons.\\r\\nJohn McConnell[31] first introduced the idea of a global holiday called \\"Earth Day\\" at the 1969 UNESCO Conference on the Environment. The first Earth Day proclamation was issued by San Francisco Mayor Joseph Alioto on March 21, 1970. Celebrations were held in various cities, such as San Francisco and in Davis, California with a multi-day street party. UN Secretary-General U Thant supported McConnell's global initiative to celebrate this annual event; and on February 26, 1971, he signed a proclamation to that effect, saying:\\r\\nMay there be only peaceful and cheerful Earth Days to come for our beautiful Spaceship Earth as it continues to spin and circle in frigid space with its warm and fragile cargo of animate life.[32]\\r\\nUnited Nations secretary-general Kurt Waldheim observed Earth Day with similar ceremonies on the March equinox in 1972, and the United Nations Earth Day ceremony has continued each year since on the day of the March equinox (the United Nations also works with organizers of the April 22 global event). Margaret Mead added her support for the equinox Earth Day, and in 1978 declared:\\r\\n\\"Earth Day is the first holy day which transcends all national borders, yet preserves all geographical integrities, spans mountains and oceans and time belts, and yet brings people all over the world into one resonating accord, is devoted to the preservation of the harmony in nature and yet draws upon the triumphs of technology, the measurement of time, and instantaneous communication through space.\\r\\nEarth Day draws on astronomical phenomena in a new way ÿ which is also the most ancient way ÿ by using the vernal Equinox, the time when the Sun crosses the equator making the length of night and day equal in all parts of the Earth. To this point in the annual calendar, EARTH DAY attaches no local or divisive set of symbols, no statement of the truth or superiority of one way of life over another. But the selection of the March Equinox makes planetary observance of a shared event possible, and a flag which shows the Earth, as seen from space, appropriate.\\"[33]\\r\\nAt the moment of the equinox, it is traditional to observe Earth Day by ringing the Japanese Peace Bell, which was donated by Japan to the United Nations.[34] Over the years, celebrations have occurred in various places worldwide at the same time as the UN celebration. On March 20, 2008, in addition to the ceremony at the United Nations, ceremonies were held in New Zealand, and bells were sounded in California, Vienna, Paris, Lithuania, Tokyo, and many other locations. The equinox Earth Day at the UN is organized by the Earth Society Foundation.[35]\\r\\nEarth Day ringing the peace bell is celebrated around the world in many towns, ringing the Peace Bell in Vienna,[36] Berlin, and elsewhere. A memorable event took place at the UN in Geneva, celebrating a Minute for Peace ringing the Japanese Shinagawa Peace Bell with the help of the Geneva Friendship Association and the Global Youth Foundation,[37] directly after in deep mourning about the Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant catastrophe 10 days before.\\r\\nBeside the Spring Equinox for the Northern Hemisphere, the observance of the Spring Equinox for the Southern Hemisphere in September is of equal importance. The International Day of Peace[38] is celebrated on September 21, and can thus be considered to accord with the original intentions of John McConnell, U Thant and others.\\r\\nIn 1968, Morton Hilbert and the U.S. Public Health Service organized the Human Ecology Symposium, an environmental conference for students to hear from scientists about the effects of environmental degradation on human health.[39] This was the beginning of Earth Day. For the next two years, Hilbert and students worked to plan the first Earth Day.[40] In April 1970along with a federal proclamation from U.S. Sen. Gaylord Nelsonthe first Earth Day was held.[41]\\r\\nProject Survival, an early environmentalism-awareness education event, was held at Northwestern University on January 23, 1970. This was the first of several events held at university campuses across the United States in the lead-up to the first Earth Day. Also, Ralph Nader began talking about the importance of ecology in 1970.\\r\\nThe 1960s had been a very dynamic period for ecology in the US. Pre-1960 grassroots activism against DDT in Nassau County, New York, and widespread opposition to open-air nuclear weapons tests with their global nuclear fallout, had inspired Rachel Carson to write her influential bestseller, Silent Spring (1962).\\r\\nNelson chose the date in order to maximize participation on college campuses for what he conceived as an \\"environmental teach-in\\". He determined the week of April 19ÿ25 was the best bet as it did not fall during exams or spring breaks.[42] Moreover, it did not conflict with religious holidays such as Easter or Passover, and was late enough in spring to have decent weather. More students were likely to be in class, and there would be less competition with other mid-week eventsso he chose Wednesday, April 22. The day also fell after the anniversary of the birth of noted conservationist John Muir. The National Park Service, John Muir National Historic Site, has a celebration every year on or around Earth Day (April 21, 22 or 23), called Birthday-Earth Day, in recognition of Earth Day and John Muir's contribution to the collective consciousness of environmentalism and conservation.[43]\\r\\nUnbeknownst to Nelson,[44] April 22, 1970, was coincidentally the 100th anniversary of the birth of Vladimir Lenin, when translated to the Gregorian calendar (which the Soviets adopted in 1918). Time reported that some suspected the date was not a coincidence, but a clue that the event was \\"a Communist trick\\", and quoted a member of the Daughters of the American Revolution as saying, \\"subversive elements plan to make American children live in an environment that is good for them.\\"[45] J. Edgar Hoover, director of the U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation, may have found the Lenin connection intriguing; it was alleged the FBI conducted surveillance at the 1970 demonstrations.[46] The idea that the date was chosen to celebrate Lenin's centenary still persists in some quarters,[47][48] an idea borne out by the similarity with the subbotnik instituted by Lenin in 1920 as days on which people would have to do community service, which typically consisted in removing rubbish from public property and collecting recyclable material. Subbotniks were also imposed on other countries within the compass of Soviet power, including Eastern Europe, and at the height of its power the Soviet Union established a nationwide subbotnik to be celebrated on Lenin's birthday, April 22, which had been proclaimed a national holiday celebrating communism by Nikita Khrushchev in 1955.\\r\\nThere are many songs that are performed on Earth Day, that generally fall into two categories.

It separates the Colorado Plateau in the west from the interior of the North American craton on the east.[1] The rift extends from central Colorado in the north to the state of Chihuahua, Mexico in the south.[2] The rift zone consists of four basins that have an average width of 50 kilometers.[1] The rift can be observed on location at Rio Grande National Forest, White Sands National Monument, Santa Fe National Forest, and Cibola National Forest, among other locations.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Rio Grande Rift has been an important site for humans for a long time, because it provides a north-south route that follows a major river. The Rio Grande follows the course of the rift from southern Colorado to El Paso, where it turns southeast and flows toward the Gulf of Mexico. Important cities, including Albuquerque, Santa Fe, Taos, Espa?ola, Las Cruces, El Paso, and Ciudad Jurez lie within the rift.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Rio Grande Rift represents the easternmost manifestation of widespread extension in the western U.S. during the past 35 million years. The rift consists of three major basins and many smaller basins, less than 100?km2. The three major basins (from northernmost to southernmost) are the San Luis, Espa?ola, and Albuquerque basins. Further south, the rift is defined by a network of smaller, less topographically distinct alternating basins and ranges. The distinction between these smaller basins and those of the Basin and Range Province becomes blurred in northern Mexico.[3]\\r\\n\\r\\nBasin size generally decreases to the north in the rift, though the Espa?ola covers approximately 120?km north-south and 40?km east-west, and the San Luis is roughly 120?km by 80?km. These basins may contain smaller units within them, such as the Alamosa basin within the San Luis, which is bounded by the San Juan and Tusas mountains on the west and the Sangre de Cristo Mountains in the east.[4] The Albuquerque basin is the largest of the three basins, spanning 160?km north-south and 86?km east-west at its widest points. It is the oldest of the three major basins, and contains 7,350?m of Paleogene clastic sediments deposited on Precambrian basement. The southernmost Albuquerque basin contains pre-rift volcanic deposits, while the central and northern portions contain volcanics erupted during rifting.[3]\\r\\n\\r\\n  The southernmost Rio Grande Rift broadens, becoming more complex in structure and physiographically indistinguishable from the adjoining Basin and Range province.[5]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn cross-section, the geometry of the basins within the rift are asymmetrical half-grabens, with major fault boundaries on one side and a downward hinge on the other. Which side of the basin has the major fault or the hinge alternates along the rift. The alternation between these half-grabens occurs along transfer faults, which trend across the rift to connect the major basin-bounding faults and occur between basins or, in places, within basins. The Precambrian basement changes relief sharply in this area, from 8,700?m below sea level at the bottom of the Albuquerque basin to 3,300?m above sea level in the nearby Sandia Mountains, which flanks the Albuquerque basin to the east. Flanking mountains are generally taller along the east side of the rift (although some of this relief may be Laramide in origin).[1]  The thickness of the crust increases to the north beneath the rift, where it may be as much as 5?km thicker than it is in the south. The crustal thickness underneath the rift is on average 30ÿ35?km, thinner by 10ÿ15?km than the Colorado Plateau on the west and the Great Plains to the east.[6]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe rift is presently nearly tectonically quiescent,[clarification needed][citation needed] but significant deformation and faulting with offsets of many kilometers were responsible for its formation starting about 35?Ma.[7]  The largest-scale manifestation of rifting involves a pure-shear rifting mechanism, in which both sides of the rift pull apart evenly and slowly, with the lower crust and upper mantle (the lithosphere) stretching like taffy.[8][9][10]  This extension is associated with very low seismic velocities in the upper mantle above approximately 400?km depth associated with relatively hot mantle and low degrees of partial melting.[11] This intrusion of the asthenosphere into the lithosphere and continental crust is thought to be responsible for nearly all of the volcanism associated with the Rio Grande rift.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe sedimentary fill of the basins consists largely of alluvial fan and mafic volcanic flows. The most alkalic lavas erupted outside the rift.[12] The sediments that were deposited during rifting are commonly known as the Santa Fe Group. This group contains sandstones, conglomerates, and volcanics. Aeolian deposits are also present in some basins.[1][2]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Rio Grande Rift is intersected in northern New Mexico by the NE-SW trending Jemez Lineament which extends well into Arizona, defined by aligned volcanic fields and several calderas in the area, including the Valles Caldera National Preserve in the Jemez Mountains. The significance of the Jemez Lineament is unclear; it is not obviously related to the formation of the Rio Grande rift, but may be a hotspot trail. Also on the Colorado Plateau but further north lies the San Juan volcanic field in the San Juan Mountains of Colorado.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe youngest eruptions in the rift region are in the Valley of Fires, New Mexico and are approximately 5,400?years old.[13][14]  The Socorro, New Mexico region of the central rift hosts an inflating mid-crustal sill-like magma body at a depth of 19?km that is responsible for anomalously high earthquake activity in the vicinity, including the largest rift-associated earthquakes in historic times (two events of approximately magnitude 5.8) in July and November 1906.[15][16][17]  Earth and space-based geodetic measurements indicate ongoing surface uplift above the \\"Socorro Magma Body\\". Archived from the original on 2010-06-15.? at approximately 2?mm/year.[18]\\r\\n\\r\\n.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Rio Grande rift's tectonic evolution is fairly complex.  The fundamental change in the western margin of the North American plate from one of subduction to a transform boundary occurred during Cenozoic time.  The Farallon plate continued to be subducted beneath western North America for at least 100?million years during Late Mesozoic and early Cenozoic time.  Compressional and transpressional deformation incurred by the Laramide Orogeny lasted until about 40?Ma in New Mexico.[20][21][22] This deformation may have been a result of the coupling between the subducting Farallon plate and the overlying North American plate. Crustal thickening occurred due to Laramide compression. After the Laramide Orogeny and until 20?Ma, a major period of volcanic activity occurred throughout the southwestern United States.  Injection of hot magmas weakened the lithosphere and allowed for later extension of the region.[23] \\r\\nCenozoic extension started about 30?million years ago (Ma).  There are two phases of extension observed: late Oligocene and middle Miocene.[24] The first period of extension produced broad,  shallow basins bounded by low-angle faults.  The crust may have been extended as much as 50% during this episode. Widespread magmatism in mid-Cenozoic time suggests that the lithosphere was hot,  the brittle-ductile transition was relatively shallow.[23] There is evidence that the  second period of extension began earlier in the central and northern Rio Grande Rift than in the south.[1]\\r\\n\\r\\nIt has been suggested that the Colorado Plateau acts as a semi-independent microplate [25] and one way of explaining the creation of the Rio Grande Rift is by the simple rotation of the Colorado Plateau 1-1.5 degrees in a clockwise direction relative to the North American craton.[1]","input":"What is currently happening in the rio grande rift zone?"},{"output":"Eleven","context":"Eleven goaltenders have scored a total of fourteen goals in National Hockey League (NHL) games. A goalkeeper can score by either shooting the puck into the net, or being awarded the goal as the last player on his team to touch the puck when an opponent scored an own goal. A goal scored by shooting the puck is particularly challenging as the goaltender has to aim for a six-foot-wide net that is close to 180 feet away, while avoiding opposing defencemen; in the case of own goals, the combined circumstance of the own goal itself in addition to the goaltender being the last player to touch the puck makes it a very rare occurrence. Of the fourteen goals, seven were scored by shooting the puck and seven were the result of own goals.\\r\\nGoaltenders have participated in the offence, albeit in a limited way, since the earliest days of the sport. Before the creation of the NHL in 1917, there were some instances recorded of goaltenders rushing down the ice to participate in the play, occasionally scoring a goal. This practice has since been outlawed (goalies are not allowed to cross the centre red line to play the puck) after the Toronto Maple Leafs' Gary Smith was injured on such a rush in the 1966ÿ67 NHL season. During the history of the league, there had been some near-misses by goaltenders, including attempts by Chuck Rayner by aiming at the empty net, or joining the attack. In 1977, Rogatien Vachon briefly became the first goaltender to score a goal after being credited following an own goal by the opponent, before it was given instead to a teammate by later video review.\\r\\nBilly Smith of the New York Islanders became the first goaltender to score an NHL goal on November 28, 1979, when he was given credit following an own goal. Ron Hextall of the Philadelphia Flyers became the second goalkeeper to score, and the first to score by taking a shot. Martin Brodeur has scored the most NHL goals by a goaltender, with two in the regular season and one in the playoffs. The most recent goal credited to a goaltender was awarded to Mike Smith of the Phoenix Coyotes on October 19, 2013, scored via a shot on goal.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nUnder modern rules, the only realistic chance for the goaltender to score exists when the opposing goaltender is pulled for an extra attacker, leaving the six-foot-wide net at the other end of the rink empty. It is assumed that the opposing goaltender, if in net, would not commit a blunder. Furthermore, the goaltender is prohibited from travelling to the other side of rink; specifically, he is not allowed to cross the centre red line in order to participate in a play, where the position of the puck is prescribed as the \\"determining factor\\" by Rule 27 of the Official NHL Rule Book.[1] The result is that the goaltender cannot participate in play in the opponent's zone, and must take a shot from his side of the rink. Coaches generally discourage any player from shooting at an empty net from their own side of the red line because if the shot goes wide, it results in an icing infraction. This brings the face off back in the defensive zone and prohibits the offending team from making any substitutions. In practice, a shot from the goaltender is taken from the side of his net, because further travel risks turning the puck over. Due to the distance between the two nets, the puck has to be shot with a trajectory and speed that prevents the opposing team from stopping it while it travels. All NHL goaltenders who have scored a goal by shooting the puck have done so with an empty net; the goals credited to goaltenders that did not shoot the puck were all the result of own goals by the opposing team who had their crease vacated.\\r\\nRule 27.7 was instituted in the 1966ÿ67 season, after the Toronto Maple Leafs' Gary Smith had been knocked out by Montreal Canadiens defenceman J. C. Tremblay's bodycheck as the former was crossing the centre red line carrying the puck. Prior to the institution of the rule, the only recorded instances of goaltenders scoring goals involved them rushing to the other end of the rink, and they occurred generally in the early days of ice hockey, around 1900.[2] Furthermore, prior to 1931, empty-net situations did not arise as it was not customary to pull the goaltender late in the game for an extra attacker in an effort to tie the game up. This technique is credited to Art Ross, coach of the Boston Bruins, who pulled Tiny Thompson in game two of the semifinals playoff series against the Montreal Canadiens.[3] An instance of an attempted empty-net goal was recorded in 1947, when New York Rangers goaltender Chuck Rayner missed the net \\"by a whisper\\" which was vacated when the Toronto Maple Leafs had pulled Turk Broda.[2]\\r\\nBilly Smith of the New York Islanders, in the 1979ÿ80 season, was the first goaltender to be credited with a goal in the NHL when Rob Ramage of the Colorado Rockies put the puck into his own empty net.[4] Smith was the last Islander to have touched the puck, and by NHL rule 78.4, an unassisted goal is awarded to the last player on the scoring team who had contacted the puck, in the event of an own goal.[5]\\r\\nHowever, the participation of goaltenders in offence began long before Billy Smith's goal. The first recorded goal in competitive play, scored by a goaltender, was in 1905. According to a Montreal Star report, poor officiating resulted in only the goaltenders left on the ice in a February 18 game between the Montreal Westmounts and Quebec Bulldogs of Canadian Amateur Hockey League (CAHL). Fred Brophy (Montreal) and Hall of Famer Paddy Moran (Quebec) exchanged scoring attempts, before Brophy beat Moran, while the latter and most of the spectators \\"convulsed in laughter\\".[6] Brophy repeated the feat a year later on March 7, 1906, by skating the length of the ice to score on goaltender Nathan Frye of the Montreal Victorias of the Eastern Canada Amateur Hockey Association (ECAHA).[2]\\r\\nThe first goaltender credited with an assist in the NHL was Georges Vezina in the 1917ÿ18 season, after a puck rebounded off his leg pad to a teammate who skated the length of the ice to score.[7] In the 1935ÿ36 season, Tiny Thompson became the first goaltender to gain an assist after making an intentional pass.[8] During the Second World War, while playing for the All-Star Canadian Army team, goaltender Chuck Rayner carried the puck down the ice and beat the opposing goaltender, Art Jones. In the NHL, he made numerous unsuccessful attempts to duplicate this feat;[9] as a member of the New York Rangers, Rayner attempted to score both by aiming at an empty net and by rushing down the rink. There are at least two recorded instances of him skating to the other side of the ice after making a save,[10] and he was experimentally used on the point during power-plays in late 1940s.[11]\\r\\nIn the 1976ÿ77 season, Los Angeles Kings goaltender Rogie Vachon briefly became the first goaltender to be credited with a goal when the opposing New York Islanders scored on themselves during a delayed penalty; however, after video review, the goal was given to Vic Venasky as it was determined that he was the last Kings player to touch the puck before it went in the net.[12] A similar case occurred in 1987 when the Islanders' Brent Sutter scored on his own net during a delayed penalty; the cross-town rival Rangers' Bob Froese was credited with the goal, briefly becoming the second goaltender to have been credited with an NHL goal. Later video review concluded that Froese had not touched the puck at all, and the goal was awarded to David Shaw.[13]\\r\\nThe first goaltender to score a goal by intentionally shooting the puck into the opponent's net was the Philadelphia Flyers' Ron Hextall, who on December 8, 1987, scored on an empty net after Boston pulled their goaltender, Rejean Lemelin, for a sixth attacker late in the third period.[14] The most recent goaltender to have scored a goal by deliberately shooting the puck into his opponents' net was Mike Smith, in 2013.\\r\\nOf the fourteen goals scored by NHL goaltenders, seven were shot into the opposing team's net by the goaltender. Two goaltenders have scored a goal and earned a shutout in the same game. Damian Rhodes, playing for the Ottawa Senators, was credited with a goal in a 6ÿ0 win over the New Jersey Devils on January 2, 1999, and Jose Theodore, playing for the Montreal Canadiens, shot the puck into the New York Islanders' empty net in a 3ÿ0 victory on January 2, 2001,[15] exactly two years later. Theodore's shot was the only backhand of the seven. In addition to being the first goaltender to be credited with a goal, Billy Smith was the only goaltender to have scored in a game that he lost.[15]\\r\\nChris Mason and Damian Rhodes are the only goalies to be credited with a goal in both the AHL and the NHL.[16] Of the 14 goals, the New Jersey Devils franchise has been involved in six of them, three goals for (highest total) and three goals against (highest total), including the first ever goaltender goal when scored on in their previous incarnation as the Colorado Rockies.\\r\\nWhile both Ron Hextall and Martin Brodeur have scored more than one goal, Hextall is the only goaltender to score twice by directly shooting the puck into the opponent's net. Brodeur's second and third goals were own goals by the other team, where Brodeur received credit for touching the puck last. Brodeur's second goal is the only game-winning goal scored by a goaltender.[17] Hextall and Brodeur both scored in a playoff game as well as a regular season game.[15] Hextall's second goal is the only goal scored by a goaltender while his team was short handed,[18] and Evgeni Nabokov and Martin Brodeur are the only goalies who scored on a power play.[19] Martin Brodeur is the only goalie to score against another goalie, when he scored against Dan Ellis, although Ellis was on his way to the bench for an extra attacker on a delayed penalty call and failed to make it back to the net in time to prevent the puck from entering the goal. Brodeur is also the only goalie who has both scored an empty net goal while the opposing goalie was on the bench, as well as having been the goalie on the bench when another goalie was credited with a goal.\\r\\nMike Smith was the latest goaltender to score a goal in the NHL, which he managed to do in a 5ÿ2 victory of the Phoenix Coyotes over the Detroit Red Wings on October 19, 2013. He scored the goal with only 1/10 of a second left in the third period.

Hawaiian, along with English, is an official language of the State of Hawaii. King Kamehameha III established the first Hawaiian-language constitution in 1839 and 1840.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor various reasons, including territorial legislation establishing English as the official language in schools, the number of native speakers of Hawaiian gradually decreased during the period from the 1830s to the 1950s. Hawaiian was essentially displaced by English on six of seven inhabited islands. In 2001, native speakers of Hawaiian amounted to under 0.1% of the statewide population. Linguists were unsure that Hawaiian and other endangered languages would survive.[5][6]\\r\\n\\r\\nNevertheless, from around 1949 to the present day, there has been a gradual increase in attention to and promotion of the language. Public Hawaiian-language immersion preschools called Pnana Leo were started in 1984; other immersion schools followed soon after that. The first students to start in immersion preschool have now graduated from college and many are fluent Hawaiian speakers. The federal government has acknowledged this development. For example, the Hawaiian National Park Language Correction Act of 2000 changed the names of several national parks in Hawai?i, observing the Hawaiian spelling.[7] However, the language is still classified as critically endangered by UNESCO.[8]\\r\\n\\r\\nA pidgin or creole language spoken in Hawai?i is Hawaiian Pidgin (or Hawaii Creole English, HCE). It should not be mistaken for the Hawaiian language nor for a dialect of English.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Hawaiian alphabet has 13 letters: five vowels (each with a long pronunciation and a short one) and eight consonants, one of which is the glottal stop called ?okina.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Hawaiian language takes its name from the largest island in the Hawaiian state, Hawaii (Hawai?i in the Hawaiian language). The island name was first written in English in 1778 by British explorer James Cook and his crew members. They wrote it as \\"Owhyhee\\" or \\"Owhyee\\". Explorers Mortimer (1791) and Otto von Kotzebue (1821) used that spelling.[9]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe initial \\"O\\" in the name is a reflection of the fact that unique identity is predicated in Hawaiian by using a copula form, o, immediately before a proper noun.[10] Thus, in Hawaiian, the name of the island is expressed by saying O Hawai?i, which means \\"[This] is Hawai?i.\\"[11] The Cook expedition also wrote \\"Otaheite\\" rather than \\"Tahiti.\\"[12]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe spelling \\"why\\" in the name reflects the [hw] pronunciation of wh in 18th-century English (still used in parts of the English-speaking world). Why was pronounced [hwai]. The spelling \\"hee\\" or \\"ee\\" in the name represents the sounds [hi], or [i].[13]\\r\\n\\r\\nPutting the parts together, O-why-(h)ee reflects [o-hwai-i], a reasonable approximation of the native pronunciation, [o h?w?i?i].\\r\\n\\r\\nAmerican missionaries bound for Hawai?i used the phrases \\"Owhihe Language\\" and \\"Owhyhee language\\" in Boston prior to their departure in October 1819 and during their five-month voyage to Hawai?i.[14] They still used such phrases as late as March 1822.[15] However, by July 1823, they had begun using the phrase \\"Hawaiian Language.\\"[16]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn Hawaiian, ?lelo Hawai?i means \\"Hawaiian language\\", as adjectives follow nouns.[17]\\r\\n\\r\\nHawaiian is a Polynesian member of the Austronesian language family.[18] It is closely related to other Polynesian languages, such as Samoan, Marquesan, Tahitian, Mori, Rapa Nui (the language of Easter Island) and Tongan.[citation needed]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nAccording to Schtz (1994), the Marquesans colonized the archipelago in roughly 300 CE[19] followed by later waves of immigration from the Society Islands and Samoa-Tonga. Their languages, over time, became the Hawaiian language within the Hawaiian Islands.[20] Kimura and Wilson (1983) also state: \\r\\n\\"Linguists agree that Hawaiian is closely related to Eastern Polynesian, with a particularly strong link in the Southern Marquesas, and a secondary link in Tahiti, which may be explained by voyaging between the Hawaiian and Society Islands.\\"[21]\\r\\nThe genetic history of the Hawaiian language is demonstrated primarily through the application of lexicostatistics, which involves quantitative comparison of lexical cognates, and the comparative method.[22][23] Both the number of cognates and the phonological similarity of cognates are measures of language relationship.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe following table provides a limited lexicostatistical data set for ten numbers.[24] The asterisk (*) is used to show that these are hypothetical, reconstructed forms. In the table, the year date of the modern forms is rounded off to 2000 CE to emphasize the 6000-year time lapse since the PAN era.[citation needed]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nNote: For the number \\"10\\", the Tongan form in the table is part of the word /ho?o-fulu/ ('ten'). The Hawaiian cognate is part of the word /ana-hulu/ ('ten days'); however, the more common word for \\"10\\" used in counting and quantifying is /?umi/, a different root.[citation needed]\\r\\n\\r\\nApplication of the lexicostatistical method to the data in the table will show the four languages to be related to one another, with Tagalog having 100% cognacy with PAN, while Hawaiian and Tongan have 100% cognacy with each other, but 90% with Tagalog and PAN. This is because the forms for each number are cognates, except the Hawaiian and Tongan words for the number \\"1\\", which are cognate with each other, but not with Tagalog and PAN. When the full set of 200 meanings is used, the percentages will be much lower. For example, Elbert found Hawaiian and Tongan to have 49% (98  200) shared cognacy.[25] This points out the importance of data-set size for this method, where less data leads to cruder results, while more data leads to better results.[25][citation needed]\\r\\n\\r\\nApplication of the comparative method will show partly different genetic relationships. It will point out sound changes,[26] such as:\\r\\n\\r\\nThis method will recognize sound change #1 as a shared innovation of Hawaiian and Tongan. It will also take the Hawaiian and Tongan cognates for \\"1\\" as another shared innovation. Due to these exclusively shared features, Hawaiian and Tongan are found to be more closely related to one another than either is to Tagalog or PAN.[citation needed]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe forms in the table show that the Austronesian vowels tend to be relatively stable, while the consonants are relatively volatile. It is also apparent that the Hawaiian words for \\"3\\", \\"5\\", and \\"8\\" have remained essentially unchanged for 6000 years.[citation needed]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1778, British explorer James Cook made Europe's initial, recorded first contact with Hawai?i, beginning a new phase in the development of Hawaiian. During the next forty years, the sounds of Spanish (1789), Russian (1804), French (1816), and German (1816) arrived in Hawai?i via other explorers and businessmen. Hawaiian began to be written for the first time, largely restricted to isolated names and words, and word lists collected by explorers and travelers.[27]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe early explorers and merchants who first brought European languages to the Hawaiian islands also took on a few native crew members who brought the Hawaiian language into new territory.[28] Hawaiians took these nautical jobs because their traditional way of life changed due to plantations, and although there were not enough of these Hawaiian-speaking explorers to establish any viable speech communities abroad, they still had a noticeable presence.[29] One of them, a boy in his teens known as Obookiah (?pkaha?ia), had a major impact on the future of the language. He sailed to New England, where he eventually became a student at the Foreign Mission School in Cornwall, Connecticut. He inspired New Englanders to support a Christian mission to Hawai?i, and provided information on the Hawaiian language to the American missionaries there prior to their departure for Hawai?i in 1819.[30]\\r\\n\\r\\nLike all natural spoken languages, the Hawaiian language was originally just an oral language. The native people of the Hawaiian language relayed religion, traditions, history, and views of their world through stories that were handed down from generation to generation. One form of storytelling most commonly associated with the Hawaiian islands is hula. Nathaniel B. Emerson notes that \\"It kept the communal imagination in living touch with the nation's legendary past\\".[31]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe islanders' connection with their stories is argued to be one reason why Captain James Cook received a pleasant welcome. Marshall Sahlins has observed that Hawaiian folktales began bearing similar content to those of the Western world in the eighteenth century.[32] He argues this was caused by the timing of Captain Cook's arrival, which was coincidentally when the indigenous Hawaiians were celebrating the Makahiki festival. The islanders' story foretold of the god Lono's return at the time of the Makahiki festival.[33]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1820, Protestant missionaries from New England arrived in Hawai?i. \\r\\n\\r\\nAdelbert von Chamisso might have consulted with a native speaker of Hawaiian in Berlin, Germany, before publishing his grammar of Hawaiian (ber die Hawaiische Sprache) in 1837.[34] When Hawaiian King David Kalkaua took a trip around the world, he brought his native language with him. When his wife, Queen Kapi?olani, and his sister, Princess (later Queen) Lili?uokalani, took a trip across North America and on to the British Islands, in 1887, Lili?uokalani's composition Aloha ?Oe was already a famous song in the U.S.[35]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1834, the first Hawaiian-language newspapers were published by missionaries working with locals. The missionaries also played a significant role in publishing a vocabulary (1836)[36] grammar (1854)[37] and dictionary (1865)[38] of Hawaiian. Literacy in Hawaiian was widespread among the local population, especially ethnic Hawaiians. Use of the language among the general population might have peaked around 1881. Even so, some people worried, as early as 1854, that the language was \\"soon destined to extinction.\\"[39]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe decline of the Hawaiian language dates back to a coup that overthrew the Hawaiian monarchy and dethroned the existing Hawaiian queen. Thereafter, a law was instituted that banned the Hawaiian language from being taught.[40] The law cited as banning the Hawaiian language is identified as Act 57, sec. 30 of the 1896 Laws of the Republic of Hawai?i:\\r\\n\\r\\nThe English Language shall be the medium and basis of instruction in all public and private schools, provided that where it is desired that another language shall be taught in addition to the English language, such instruction may be authorized by the Department, either by its rules, the curriculum of the school, or by direct order in any particular instance. Any schools that shall not conform to the provisions of this section shall not be recognized by the Department.\\r\\nThis law established English as the medium of instruction for the government-recognized schools both \\"public and private\\". While it did not ban or make illegal the Hawaiian language in other contexts, its implementation in the schools had far-reaching effects. The banishment was only two years removed from acknowledgement as a legitimate sovereign government.  From July 1894 to January 1895, 19 nations, including the United States, recognized Hawai'i as an independent country.[42]  Those who had been pushing for English-only schools took this law as licence to extinguish the native language at the early education level. While the law stopped short of making Hawaiian illegal (it was still the dominant language spoken at the time), many children who spoke Hawaiian at school, including on the playground, were disciplined. This included corporal punishment and going to the home of the offending child to strongly advise them to stop speaking it in their home. Moreover, the law specifically provided for teaching languages \\"in addition to the English language,\\" reducing Hawaiian to the status of a foreign language, subject to approval by the Department. Hawaiian was not taught initially in any school, including the all-Hawaiian Kamehameha Schools. This is largely because when these schools were founded, like Kamehameha Schools founded in 1887 (nine years before this law), Hawaiian was being spoken in the home. Once this law was enacted, individuals at these institutions took it upon themselves to enforce a ban on Hawaiian. Beginning in 1900, Mary Kawena Pukui, who was later the co-author of the HawaiianÿEnglish Dictionary, was punished for speaking Hawaiian by being rapped on the forehead, allowed to eat only bread and water for lunch, and denied home visits on holidays.[43] Winona Beamer was expelled from Kamehameha Schools in 1937 for chanting Hawaiian.[44]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1949, the legislature of the Territory of Hawai?i commissioned Mary Pukui and Samuel Elbert to write a new dictionary of Hawaiian, either revising the Andrews-Parker work or starting from scratch.[45] Pukui and Elbert took a middle course, using what they could from the Andrews dictionary, but making certain improvements and additions that were more significant than a minor revision. The dictionary they produced, in 1957, introduced an era of gradual increase in attention to the language and culture.\\r\\n\\r\\nEfforts to promote the language have increased in recent decades. Hawaiian-language \\"immersion\\" schools are now open to children whose families want to reintroduce Hawaiian language for future generations.[46] The ?Aha Pnana Leos Hawaiian language preschools in Hilo, Hawaii, have received international recognition.[47] The local National Public Radio  station features a short segment titled \\"Hawaiian word of the day\\" and a Hawaiian language news broadcast. Honolulu television station KGMB ran a weekly Hawaiian language program, ?ha?i ?lelo Ola, as recently as 2010.[48] Additionally, the Sunday editions of the Honolulu Star-Advertiser, the largest newspaper in Hawaii, feature a brief article called Kauakukalahale written entirely in Hawaiian by teachers, students, and community members.\\r\\n\\r\\nToday, the number of native speakers of Hawaiian, which was under 0.1% of the statewide population in 1997, has risen to 2,000, out of 24,000 total who are fluent in the language, according to the US 2011 census. On six of the seven permanently inhabited islands, Hawaiian has been largely displaced by English, but on Ni?ihau, native speakers of Hawaiian have remained fairly isolated and have continued to use Hawaiian almost exclusively.[49][40][50]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe isolated island of Ni?ihau, located off the southwest coast of Kauai, is the one island where Hawaiian is still spoken as the language of daily life.[49]\\r\\nElbert & Pukui (1979:23) states that \\"[v]ariations in Hawaiian dialects have not been systematically studied\\", and that \\"[t]he dialect of Ni?ihau is the most aberrant and the one most in need of study\\". They recognized that Ni?ihauans can speak Hawaiian in substantially different ways. Their statements are based in part on some specific observations made by Newbrand (1951). (See Hawaiian phonological processes)\\r\\n\\r\\nHawaiians had no written language prior to Western contact, except for petroglyph symbols.\\r\\nThe modern Hawaiian alphabet, ka pؐ?p Hawai?i, is based on the Latin script. Hawaiian words end only[52] in vowels, and every consonant must be followed by a vowel. The Hawaiian alphabetical order has all of the vowels before the consonants,[53] as in the following chart.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis writing system was developed by American Protestant missionaries during 1820ÿ1826.[54] It was the first thing they ever printed in Hawai?i, on January 7, 1822, and it originally included the consonants B, D, R, T, and V, in addition to the current ones (H, K, L, M, N, P, W), and it had F, G, S, Y and Z for \\"spelling foreign words\\". The initial printing also showed the five vowel letters (A, E, I, O, U) and seven of the short diphthongs (AE, AI, AO, AU, EI, EU, OU).[55]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1826, the developers voted to eliminate some of the letters which represented functionally redundant allophones (called \\"interchangeable letters\\"), enabling the Hawaiian alphabet to approach the ideal state of one-symbol-one-phoneme, and thereby optimizing the ease with which people could teach and learn the reading and writing of Hawaiian.[56] For example, instead of spelling one and the same word as pule, bule, pure, and bure (because of interchangeable p/b and l/r), the word is spelled only as pule.\\r\\n\\r\\nHowever, hundreds of words were very rapidly borrowed into Hawaiian from English, Greek, Hebrew, Latin, and Syriac.[57][58][59] Although these loan words were necessarily Hawaiianized, they often retained some of their \\"non-Hawaiian letters\\" in their published forms. For example, Brazil fully Hawaiianized is Palakila, but retaining \\"foreign letters\\" it is Barazila.[60] Another example is Gibraltar, written as Kipalaleka or Gibaraleta.[61] While [z] and [] are not regarded as Hawaiian sounds, [b], [?], and [t] were represented in the original alphabet, so the letters (b, r, and t) for the latter are not truly \\"non-Hawaiian\\" or \\"foreign\\", even though their post-1826 use in published matter generally marked words of foreign origin.\\r\\n\\r\\n?Okina (?oki 'cut' + -na '-ing') is the modern Hawaiian name for the symbol (a letter) that represents the glottal stop.[62] It was formerly known as ?u?ina ('snap'[63][64]).\\r\\n\\r\\nFor examples of the ?okina, consider the Hawaiian words Hawai?i and O?ahu (often simply Hawaii and Oahu in English orthography). In Hawaiian, these words can be pronounced [h????i.?i] and [o???.hu], and can be written with an ?okina where the glottal stop is pronounced.[65][66]\\r\\n\\r\\nElbert & Pukui's Hawaiian Grammar says \\"The glottal stop, , is made by closing the glottis or space between the vocal cords, the result being something like the hiatus in English oh-oh.\\"[67]\\r\\n\\r\\nAs early as 1823, the missionaries made some limited use of the apostrophe to represent the glottal stop,[68] but they did not make it a letter of the alphabet. In publishing the Hawaiian Bible, they used it to distinguish ko?u ('my') from kou ('your').[69] In 1864, William DeWitt Alexander published a grammar of Hawaiian in which he made it clear that the glottal stop (calling it \\"guttural break\\") is definitely a true consonant of the Hawaiian language.[70] He wrote it using an apostrophe. In 1922, the Andrews-Parker dictionary of Hawaiian made limited use of the opening single quote symbol, called \\"reversed apostrophe\\" or \\"inverse comma\\", to represent the glottal stop.[71] Subsequent dictionaries have preferred to use that symbol. Today, many native speakers of Hawaiian do not bother, in general, to write any symbol for the glottal stop. Its use is advocated mainly among students and teachers of Hawaiian as a second language, and among linguists.[72]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe ?okina is written in various ways for electronic uses:\\r\\n\\r\\nBecause many people who want to write the ?okina are not familiar with these specific characters and/or do not have access to the appropriate fonts and input and display systems, it is sometimes written with more familiar and readily available characters:\\r\\n\\r\\nA modern Hawaiian name for the macron symbol is kahak (kaha 'mark' + k 'long').[76] It was formerly known as mekona (Hawaiianization of macron). It can be written as a diacritical mark which looks like a hyphen or dash written above a vowel, i.e.,   ؐ   and   ؐ  . It is used to show that the marked vowel is a \\"double\\", or \\"geminate\\", or \\"long\\" vowel, in phonological terms.[77] (See: Vowel length)\\r\\n\\r\\nAs early as 1821, at least one of the missionaries, Hiram Bingham, was using macrons (and breves) in making handwritten transcriptions of Hawaiian vowels.[78] The missionaries specifically requested their sponsor in Boston to send them some type (fonts) with accented vowel characters, including vowels with macrons, but the sponsor made only one response and sent the wrong font size (pica instead of small pica).[71] Thus, they could not print , , ؐ, , nor  (at the right size), even though they wanted to.\\r\\n\\r\\nDue to extensive allophony, Hawaiian has more than 13 phones. Although vowel length is phonemic, long vowels are not always pronounced as such,[77] even though under the rules for assigning stress in Hawaiian, a long vowel will always receive stress.[79][80]\\r\\n\\r\\nHawaiian is known for having very few consonant phonemes?ÿ eight: /p, k ~ t, ?, h, m, n, l, w ~ v/. It is notable that Hawaiian has allophonic variation of [t] with [k],[81][82][83][84] [w] with [v],[85] and (in some dialects) [l] with [n].[86] The [t]ÿ[k] variation is quite unusual among the world's languages, and is likely a product both of the small number of consonants in Hawaiian, and the recent shift of historical *t to modern [t]ÿ[k], after historical *k had shifted to [?]. In some dialects, /?/ remains as [k] in some words. These variations are largely free, though there are conditioning factors. /l/ tends to [n] especially in words with both /l/ and /n/, such as in the island name Lna?i ([la??n??i]ÿ[na??n??i]), though this is not always the case: ?ele?ele or ?ene?ene \\"black\\". The [k] allophone is almost universal at the beginnings of words, whereas [t] is most common before the vowel /i/. [v] is also the norm after /i/ and /e/, whereas [w] is usual after /u/ and /o/. After /a/ and initially, however, [w] and [v] are in free variation.[87]\\"A consonant occurs only before a vowel; thus two consonants never occur in succession and a syllable always ends with a vowel\\".[67]\\r\\n\\r\\nHawaiian has five short and five long vowels, plus diphthongs.\\r\\n\\r\\nHawaiian has five pure vowels.  The short vowels are /u, i, o, e, a/, and the long vowels, if they are considered separate phonemes rather than simply sequences of like vowels, are /u?, i?, o?, e?, a?/. When stressed, short /e/ and /a/ tend to become [?] and [?], while when unstressed they are [e] and [?]. /e/ also tends to become [?] next to /l/, /n/, and another [?], as in Pele [p?l?]. Some grammatical particles vary between short and long vowels. These include a and o \\"of\\", ma \\"at\\", na and no \\"for\\". Between a back vowel /o/ or /u/ and a following non-back vowel (/a e i/), there is an epenthetic [w], which is generally not written. Between a front vowel /e/ or /i/ and a following non-front vowel (/a o u/), there is an epenthetic [j] (a y sound), which is never written.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe short-vowel diphthongs are /iu, ou, oi, eu, ei, au, ai, ao, ae/. In all except perhaps /iu/, these are falling diphthongs. However, they are not as tightly bound as the diphthongs of English, and may be considered vowel sequences. (The second vowel in such sequences may receive the stress, but in such cases it is not counted as a diphthong.) In fast speech, /ai/ tends to [ei] and /au/ tends to [ou], conflating these diphthongs with /ei/ and /ou/.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere are only a limited number of vowels which may follow long vowels, and some authors treat these sequences as diphthongs as well: /o?u, e?i, a?u, a?i, a?o, a?e/.\\r\\n\\r\\nHawaiian syllable structure is (C)V. All CV syllables occur except for w;[88] wu occurs only in two words borrowed from English.[89][90] As shown by Schtz,[57][91][92] Hawaiian word-stress is predictable in words of one to four syllables, but not in words of five or more syllables. Hawaiian phonological processes include palatalization and deletion of consonants, as well as raising, diphthongization, deletion, and compensatory lengthening of vowels.[82][93] Phonological reduction (or \\"decay\\") of consonant phonemes during the historical development of the language has resulted in the phonemic glottal stop.[94][95] Ultimate loss (deletion) of intervocalic consonant phonemes has resulted in Hawaiian long vowels and diphthongs.[95][96][97][98]\\r\\n\\r\\nHawaiian is an analytic language with verbÿsubjectÿobject word order. While there is no use of inflection for verbs, in Hawaiian, like other Austronesian personal pronouns,  declension is found in the differentiation between a- and o-class genitive case personal pronouns in order to indicate inalienable possession in a binary possessive class system. Also like many Austronesian languages, Hawaiian pronouns employ separate words for inclusive and exclusive we (clusivity), and distinguish singular, dual, and plural. The grammatical function of verbs is marked by adjacent particles (short words) and by their relative positions, that indicate tenseÿaspectÿmood.\\r\\n\\r\\nSome examples of verb phrase patterns:\\r\\n\\r\\n[[67]]\\r\\n\\r\\nNouns can be marked with articles:\\r\\n\\r\\nka and ke are singular definite articles. ke is used before words beginning with a-, e-, o- and k-, and with some words beginning ?- and p-. ka is used in all other cases. n is the plural definite article.\\r\\n\\r\\nTo show part of a group, the word kekahi is used. To show a bigger part, mau is inserted to pluralize the subject.\\r\\n\\r\\nExamples:","input":"How many consonants are in the hawaiian language?"},{"output":"Clinton","context":"The impeachment of Bill Clinton was initiated in December 1998 by the House of Representatives and led to a trial in the Senate for the impeachment of Bill Clinton, the 42nd President of the United States, on two charges, one of perjury and one of obstruction of justice.[1] These charges stemmed from a sexual harassment lawsuit filed against Clinton by Paula Jones. Clinton was subsequently acquitted of these charges by the Senate on February 12, 1999.[2] Two other impeachment articles ÿ a second perjury charge and a charge of abuse of power ÿ failed in the House.\\r\\nGovernor of Arkansas\\r\\n42nd President of the United States\\r\\nPolicies\\r\\nAppointments\\r\\nFirst term\\r\\nSecond term\\r\\nPost-presidency\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nLeading to the impeachment, Independent Counsel Ken Starr turned over documentation to the House Judiciary Committee. Chief Prosecutor David Schippers and his team reviewed the material and determined there was sufficient evidence to impeach the president. As a result, four charges were considered by the full House of Representatives; two passed, making Clinton the second president to be impeached, after Andrew Johnson in 1868, and only the third against whom articles of impeachment had been brought before the full House for consideration (Richard Nixon resigned from the presidency in 1974, while an impeachment process against him was underway).\\r\\nThe trial in the United States Senate began right after the seating of the 106th Congress, in which the Republican Party held 55 Senate seats. A two-thirds vote (67 senators) was required to remove Clinton from office. 50 senators voted to remove Clinton on the obstruction of justice charge and 45 voted to remove him on the perjury charge; no member of his own Democratic Party voted guilty on either charge. Clinton, like Johnson a century earlier, was acquitted on all charges.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1994, Paula Jones filed a lawsuit accusing Clinton of sexual harassment when he was governor of Arkansas. Clinton attempted to delay a trial until after he left office, but in May 1997 the Supreme Court unanimously ordered the case to proceed and shortly thereafter the pre-trial discovery process commenced. Jones' attorneys wanted to prove that Clinton had engaged in a pattern of behavior with women that lent support to her claims. In late 1997, Linda Tripp began secretly recording conversations with her friend Monica Lewinsky, a former intern and Department of Defense employee, in which Lewinsky divulged that she had had a sexual relationship with the President. Tripp shared this information with Paula Jones' lawyers, who put Lewinsky on their witness list in December 1997. According to the Starr report, after Lewinsky appeared on the witness list Clinton began taking steps to conceal their relationship, including suggesting she file a false affidavit, suggesting she use cover stories, concealing gifts he had given her, and helping her obtain a job to her liking.\\r\\nClinton gave a sworn deposition on January 17, 1998 where he denied having a \\"sexual relationship\\", \\"sexual affair\\" or \\"sexual relations\\" with Lewinsky. He also denied that he was ever alone with her. His lawyer, Robert Bennet, stated with Clinton present that Lewinsky's affidavit showed that there was no sex in any manner, shape or form between Clinton and Lewinsky. The Starr Report states that the following day, Clinton \\"coached\\" his secretary Betty Curie into repeating his denials should she be called to testify.\\r\\nAfter rumors of the scandal reached the news, Clinton publicly stated, \\"I did not have sexual relations with that woman, Miss Lewinsky.\\" [3] Months later, Clinton admitted that his relationship with Lewinsky was \\"wrong\\" and \\"not appropriate.\\" Lewinsky engaged in oral sex with Clinton several times.[4][5]\\r\\nThe judge in the Jones case later ruled the Lewinsky matter immaterial, and threw out the case in April 1998 on the grounds that Jones had failed to show any damages. On appeal, Clinton agreed to settle the case for $850,000 while still admitting no wrongdoing.[when?]\\r\\nThe charges arose from an investigation by Ken Starr, an Independent Counsel. Originally dealing with Whitewater, Starr, with the approval of United States Attorney General Janet Reno, conducted a wide-ranging investigation of alleged abuses, including the Whitewater affair, the firing of White House travel agents, and the alleged misuse of FBI files. On January 12, 1998 Linda Tripp, who had been working with the Jones lawyers, informed Starr that Lewinsky was preparing to commit perjury in the Jones case and had asked Tripp to do the same. She also said Clintons friend Vernon Jordan was assisting Lewinsky. Based on the connection to Jordan, who was under scrutiny in the Whitewater probe, Starr obtained approval from Reno to expand his investigation into whether Lewinsky and others were breaking the law.\\r\\nA much-quoted statement from Clinton's grand jury testimony showed him questioning the precise use of the word \\"is\\". Contending that his statement that \\"there's nothing going on between us\\" had been truthful because he had no ongoing relationship with Lewinsky at the time he was questioned, Clinton said, \\"It depends upon what the meaning of the word 'is' is. If theif heif 'is' means is and never has been, that is notthat is one thing. If it means there is none, that was a completely true statement\\".[6] Starr obtained further evidence of inappropriate behavior by seizing the computer hard drive and email records of Monica Lewinsky. Based on the president's conflicting testimony, Starr concluded that Clinton had committed perjury. Starr submitted his findings to Congress in a lengthy document (the so-called Starr Report), and simultaneously posted the report, which included descriptions of encounters between Clinton and Lewinsky, on the Internet.[7] Starr was criticized by Democrats for spending $70?million on an investigation that substantiated only perjury and obstruction of justice.[8] Critics of Starr also contend that his investigation was highly politicized because it regularly leaked tidbits of information to the press in violation of legal ethics, and because his report included lengthy descriptions which were humiliating yet irrelevant to the legal case.[9][10]\\r\\nSince Ken Starr had already completed an extensive investigation, the House Judiciary Committee conducted no investigations of its own into Clinton's alleged wrongdoing, and it held no serious impeachment-related hearings before the 1998 mid-term elections. Nevertheless, impeachment was one of the major issues in the election.\\r\\nIn November 1998, the Democrats picked up five seats in the House although the Republicans still maintained majority control.[11] The results were a particular embarrassment for House Speaker Newt Gingrich, who, before the election, had been reassured by private polling that Clinton's scandal would result in Republican gains of up to thirty House seats.[11] Shortly after the elections, Gingrich, who had been one of the leading advocates for impeachment,[12] announced he would resign from Congress as soon as he was able to find somebody to fill his vacant seat;[11] Gingrich fulfilled this pledge, and officially resigned from Congress on January 3, 1999.[13]\\r\\nImpeachment proceedings were initiated during the post-election, \\"lame duck\\" session of the outgoing 105th United States Congress. Unlike the case of the 1974 impeachment process against Richard Nixon, the committee hearings were perfunctory but the floor debate in the whole House was spirited on both sides. The Speaker-designate, Representative Bob Livingston, chosen by the Republican Party Conference to replace Gingrich as House Speaker, announced the end of his candidacy for Speaker and his resignation from Congress from the floor of the House after his own marital infidelity came to light.[14] In the same speech, Livingston also encouraged Clinton to resign. Clinton chose to remain in office and urged Livingston to reconsider his resignation.[15] Many other prominent Republican members of Congress (including Dan Burton[14] of Indiana, Helen Chenoweth[14] of Idaho and Henry Hyde[14] of Illinois, the chief House manager of Clinton's trial in the Senate) had infidelities exposed about this time, all of whom voted for impeachment. Publisher Larry Flynt offered a reward for such information, and many supporters of Clinton accused Republicans of hypocrisy.[14]\\r\\nOn the passage of H. Res. 611, Clinton was impeached on December 19, 1998, by the House of Representatives on grounds of perjury to a grand jury (by a 228ÿ206 vote)[16] and obstruction of justice (by a 221ÿ212 vote).[17] Two other articles of impeachment failed ÿ a second count of perjury in the Jones case (by a 205ÿ229 vote)[18] and one accusing Clinton of abuse of power (by a 148ÿ285 vote).[19] Clinton thus became the second U.S. president to be impeached, following Andrew Johnson in 1868. (Clinton was the third sitting president against whom the House of Representatives initiated impeachment proceedings since 1789. Articles of impeachment against Richard Nixon were passed by the House Judiciary Committee in 1974 and reported to the full House, but Nixon resigned the Presidency before the impeachment resolutions could be considered.)\\r\\nFive Democrats (Virgil Goode of Virginia, Ralph Hall of Texas, Paul McHale of Pennsylvania, Charles Stenholm of Texas and Gene Taylor of Mississippi) voted in favor of three of the four articles of impeachment, but only Taylor voted for the abuse of power charge. Five Republicans (Amo Houghton of New York, Peter King of New York, Connie Morella of Maryland, Chris Shays of Connecticut and Mark Souder of Indiana) voted against the first perjury charge. Eight more Republicans (Sherwood Boehlert of New York, Michael Castle of Delaware, Phil English of Pennsylvania, Nancy Johnson of Connecticut, Jay Kim of California, Jim Leach of Iowa, John McHugh of New York and Ralph Regula of Ohio), but not Souder, voted against the obstruction charge. Twenty-eight Republicans voted against the second perjury charge, sending it to defeat, and eighty-one voted against the abuse of power charge.\\r\\nArticle I charged that Clinton lied to the grand jury concerning:[20]\\r\\nArticle III charged Clinton with attempting to obstruct justice in the Jones case by:[21]\\r\\nThe Senate trial began on January 7, 1999, with Chief Justice of the United States William Rehnquist presiding. The first day consisted of formal presentation of the charges against Clinton, and of Rehnquist swearing in all arguants in the trial.\\r\\nThirteen House Republicans from the Judiciary Committee served as \\"managers\\", the equivalent of prosecutors:\\r\\nClinton was defended by Cheryl Mills. Clinton's counsel staff included Charles Ruff, David E. Kendall, Dale Bumpers, Bruce Lindsey, Nicole Seligman, Lanny A. Breuer and Gregory B. Craig.[22]\\r\\nA resolution on rules and procedure for the trial was adopted unanimously on the following day; however, senators tabled the question of whether to call witnesses in the trial. The trial remained in recess while briefs were filed by the House (January 11) and Clinton (January 13).\\r\\nThe managers presented their case over three days, from January 14 to 16, with discussion of the facts and background of the case; detailed cases for both articles of impeachment (including excerpts from videotaped grand jury testimony that Clinton had made the previous August); matters of interpretation and application of the laws governing perjury and obstruction of justice; and argument that the evidence and precedents justified removal of the President from office by virtue of \\"willful, premeditated, deliberate corruption of the nation's system of justice through perjury and obstruction of justice.\\"[23] The defense presentation took place from January 19ÿ21. Clinton's defense counsel argued that Clinton's grand jury testimony had too many inconsistencies to be a clear case of perjury, that the investigation and impeachment had been tainted by partisan political bias, that the President's approval rating of more than 70 percent indicated that his ability to govern had not been impaired by the scandal, and that the managers had ultimately presented \\"an unsubstantiated, circumstantial case that does not meet the constitutional standard to remove the President from office.\\"[23] January 22 and 23 were devoted to questions from members of the Senate to the House managers and Clinton's defense counsel. Under the rules, all questions (over 150) were to be written down and given to Rehnquist to read to the party being questioned.\\r\\nOn January 25, Sen. Robert Byrd of West Virginia moved for dismissals of both articles of impeachment for lack of merit. On the following day, Rep. Bryant moved to call witnesses to the trial, a question that the Senate had scrupulously avoided to that point. In both cases, the Senate voted to deliberate on the question in private session, rather than public, televised procedure. On January 27, the Senate voted on both motions in public session; the motion to dismiss failed on a nearly party line vote of 56ÿ44, while the motion to depose witnesses passed by the same margin. A day later, the Senate voted down motions to move directly to a vote on the articles of impeachment and to suppress videotaped depositions of the witnesses from public release, Feingold again voting with the Republicans.\\r\\nOver three days, February 1ÿ3, House managers took videotaped closed-door depositions from Monica Lewinsky, Clinton's friend Vernon Jordan, and White House aide Sidney Blumenthal. On February 4, however, the Senate voted 70ÿ30 that excerpting these videotapes would suffice as testimony, rather than calling live witnesses to appear at trial. The videos were played in the Senate on February 6, featuring 30 excerpts of Lewinsky discussing her affidavit in the Paula Jones case, the hiding of small gifts Clinton had given her, and his involvement in procurement of a job for Lewinsky.\\r\\nOn February 8, closing arguments were presented with each side allotted a three-hour time slot. On the President's behalf, White House Counsel Charles Ruff declared:\\r\\nThere is only one question before you, albeit a difficult one, one that is a question of fact and law and constitutional theory. Would it put at risk the liberties of the people to retain the President in office? Putting aside partisan animus, if you can honestly say that it would not, that those liberties are safe in his hands, then you must vote to acquit.[23]\\r\\nChief Prosecutor Henry Hyde countered:\\r\\nA failure to convict will make the statement that lying under oath, while unpleasant and to be avoided, is not all that serious...We have reduced lying under oath to a breach of etiquette, but only if you are the President...And now let us all take our place in history on the side of honor, and, oh, yes, let right be done.\\"[23]\\r\\nOn February 9, after voting against a public deliberation on the verdict, the Senate began closed-door deliberations instead. On February 12, the Senate emerged from its closed deliberations and voted on the articles of impeachment. A two-thirds vote, 67 votes, would have been necessary to convict and remove the President from office. The perjury charge was defeated with 45 votes for conviction and 55 against.[24] (Senator Arlen Specter of Pennsylvania voted \\"not proved\\" for both charges,[25] which was considered by Chief Justice Rehnquist to constitute a vote of \\"not guilty\\".) The obstruction of justice charge was defeated with 50 for conviction and 50 against.[26]\\r\\nAll 45 Democrats in the Senate voted \\"not guilty\\" on both charges. The five Republican senators who voted against conviction on both charges were John Chafee of Rhode Island, Susan Collins of Maine, Jim Jeffords of Vermont, Olympia Snowe of Maine, and Arlen Specter of Pennsylvania. Specter, who said he was not prepared to cast a guilty or not guilty vote, voted \\"not proved\\", which was counted as a not guilty vote.[27] The additional five Republican senators who voted \\"not guilty\\" only on the perjury charge were Slade Gorton of Washington, Richard Shelby of Alabama, Ted Stevens of Alaska, Fred Thompson of Tennessee, and John Warner of Virginia.\\r\\nNotes: D = Democrat; R = Republican\\r\\n* = Specter announced his vote as \\"not proved,\\" a verdict used in Scots law. His vote was recorded as \\"not guilty\\" at the direction of the Chief Justice.\\r\\nIn April 1999, about two months after being acquitted by the Senate, Clinton was cited by Federal District Judge Susan Webber Wright for civil contempt of court for his \\"willful failure\\" to obey her repeated orders to testify truthfully in the Paula Jones sexual harassment lawsuit. For this citation, Clinton was assessed a $90,000 fine, and the matter was referred to the Arkansas Supreme Court to see if disciplinary action would be appropriate.[28]\\r\\nRegarding Clinton's January 17, 1998, deposition where he was placed under oath, the judge wrote:\\r\\nSimply put, the president's deposition testimony regarding whether he had ever been alone with Ms. (Monica) Lewinsky was intentionally false, and his statements regarding whether he had ever engaged in sexual relations with Ms. Lewinsky likewise were intentionally false....[28]\\r\\nOn the day before leaving office in January 2001, President Clinton agreed to a five-year suspension of his Arkansas law license as part of an agreement with the independent counsel[clarification needed] to end the investigation.[29] Clinton was automatically suspended from the United States Supreme Court bar as a result of his law license suspension. However, as is customary, he was allowed 40 days to appeal an otherwise-automatic disbarment. The former President resigned from the Supreme Court bar during the 40 day appeals period.[30]\\r\\nEventually, the court dismissed the Paula Jones harassment lawsuit, before trial, on the grounds that Jones failed to demonstrate any damages. However, while the dismissal was on appeal, Clinton entered into an out-of-court settlement by agreeing to pay Jones $850,000.[31][32]\\r\\nPolls conducted during 1998 and early 1999 showed that only about one-third of Americans supported Clinton's impeachment or conviction. However, one year later, when it was clear that House impeachment would not lead to the ousting of the President, half of Americans said in a CNN/USA Today/Gallup poll that they supported impeachment but 57% approved of the Senate's decision to keep him in office and two thirds of those polled said the impeachment was harmful to the country.[33]\\r\\nWhile Clinton's job approval rating rose during the Lewinsky scandal and subsequent impeachment, his poll numbers with regard to questions of honesty, integrity and moral character declined.[34] As a result, \\"moral character\\" and \\"honesty\\" weighed heavily in the next presidential election. According to The Daily Princetonian, after the 2000 presidential election, \\"post-election polls found that, in the wake of Clinton-era scandals, the single most significant reason people voted for Bush was for his moral character.\\"[35][36][37] According to an analysis of the election by Stanford University:\\r\\nA more political explanation is the belief in Gore campaign circles that disapproval of President Clinton's personal behavior was a serious threat to the vice president's prospects. Going into the election the one negative element in the public's perception of the state of the nation was the belief that the country was morally on the wrong track, whatever the state of the economy or world affairs. According to some insiders, anything done to raise the association between Gore and Clinton would have produced a net loss of supportthe impact of Clinton's personal negatives would outweigh the positive impact of his job performance on support for Gore. Thus, hypothesis four suggests that a previously unexamined variable played a major role in 2000the retiring president's personal approval.[38]\\r\\nThe Stanford analysis, however, presented different theories and mainly argued that Gore had lost because he decided to distance himself from Clinton during the campaign. The writers of it concluded:[38]\\r\\nWe find that Gores oft-criticized personality was not a cause of his under-performance. Rather, the major cause was his failure to receive a historically normal amount of credit for the performance of the Clinton administration...[and] failure to get normal credit reflected Gores peculiar campaign which in turn reflected fear of association with Clinton's behavior.[38]\\r\\nAccording to the America's Future Foundation:\\r\\nIn the wake of the Clinton scandals, independents warmed to Bush's promise to 'restore honor and dignity to the White House.' According to Voter News Service, the personal quality that mattered most to voters was 'honesty.' Voters who chose 'honesty' preferred Bush over Gore by over a margin of five to one. Forty Four percent of Americans said the Clinton scandals were important to their vote. Of these, Bush reeled in three out of every four.[39]\\r\\nPolitical commentators, however, have argued that Gore's refusal to have Clinton campaign with him was a bigger liability to Gore than Clinton's scandals.[38][40][41][42][43] The 2000 US Congressional election also saw the Democrats gain more seats in Congress.[44] As a result of this gain, control of the US Senate was split 50-50 between both parties,[45] and Democrats would regain control over the US Senate after Republican Senator Jim Jeffords defected from his party in the spring of 2001 and agreed to caucus with the Democrats.[46]\\r\\nAl Gore reportedly confronted Clinton after the election, and \\"tried to explain that keeping Clinton under wraps [during the campaign] was a rational response to polls showing swing voters were still mad as hell over the Year of Monica.\\" According to the AP, \\"during the one-on-one meeting at the White House, which lasted more than an hour, Gore used uncommonly blunt language to tell Clinton that his sex scandal and low personal approval ratings were a hurdle he could not surmount in his campaign...[with] the core of the dispute was Clinton's lies to Gore and the nation about his affair with White House intern Monica Lewinsky.\\"[47][48][49] Clinton, however, was unconvinced by Gore's argument and insisted to Gore that he would have won the election if he had embraced the administration and its good economic record.[47][48][49]\\r\\nOf the 13 members of the House who managed Clinton's trial in the Senate, one lost to a Democrat in his 2000 bid for re-election (James E. Rogan, to Adam Schiff). Charles Canady retired from Congress in 2000, following through on a previous term limits pledge to voters, and Bill McCollum ran unsuccessfully for the U.S. Senate. Asa Hutchinson, after being re-elected in 2000, left Congress after being appointed head of the Drug Enforcement Administration by President George W. Bush. In 2014 Hutchinson was elected governor of Arkansas. In 2002, two former House managers lost their seats after redistricting placed them in the same district as another incumbent (Bob Barr lost to John Linder in a Republican primary, and George Gekas lost to Democrat Tim Holden), while two more ran for the U.S. Senate (Lindsey Graham successfully, Ed Bryant unsuccessfully). The other five remained in the House well into the 2000s (decade), and two (Jim Sensenbrenner and Steve Chabot) are still members (although Chabot lost his seat to Steve Driehaus in the 2008 elections; Chabot defeated Driehaus in a 2010 rematch). In 2009, Sensenbrenner served again as a manager for the impeachment of Judge Samuel B. Kent of Texas[50] as well as serving in 2010 as Republican lead manager in the impeachment of Judge Thomas Porteous of Louisiana.[51]","input":"Who was the second president to be impeached?"},{"output":"Byzantine","context":"Hagia Sophia (/?h?i? so??fi??/; from the Greek ʽ?ϫ ҷ?ϫ, pronounced?[a??ia so?fia], \\"Holy Wisdom\\"; Latin: Sancta Sophia or Sancta Sapientia; Turkish: Ayasofya) is a former Greek Orthodox Christian patriarchal basilica (church), later an Ottoman imperial mosque and now a museum (Ayasofya Mzesi) in Istanbul, Turkey. From the date of its construction in 537 AD until 1453, it served as an Eastern Orthodox cathedral and the seat of the Patriarch of Constantinople,[1] except between 1204 and 1261, when it was converted by the Fourth Crusaders to a Roman Catholic cathedral under the Latin Empire. The building was later converted into an Ottoman mosque from 29 May 1453 until 1931. It was then secularized and opened as a museum on 1 February 1935.[2] Famous in particular for its massive dome, it is considered the epitome of Byzantine architecture[3] and is said to have \\"changed the history of architecture\\".[4] It remained the world's largest cathedral for nearly a thousand years, until Seville Cathedral was completed in 1520.\\r\\nThe current building was originally constructed as a church between 532 and 537 on the orders of the Byzantine Emperor Justinian I and was the third Church of the Holy Wisdom to occupy the site, the prior one having been destroyed by rioters in the Nika Revolt. It was designed by the Greek geometers Isidore of Miletus and Anthemius of Tralles.[5] The church was dedicated to the Wisdom of God, the Logos, the second person of the Trinity,[6] its patronal feast taking place on 25 December, the commemoration of the birth of the incarnation of the Logos in Christ.[6] Although sometimes referred to as Sancta Sophia (as though it were named after Sophia the Martyr), sophia being the phonetic spelling in Latin of the Greek word for wisdom, its full name in Greek is ϫ?? ? ʽ?ϫ?  ɚ? ҷ?ϫ?, Naos ts Hagias tou Theou Sophias, \\"Shrine of the Holy Wisdom of God\\".[7][8] The church contained a large collection of relics and featured, among other things, a 15-metre (49?ft) silver iconostasis.[citation needed] The focal point of the Eastern Orthodox Church for nearly one thousand years, the building witnessed the excommunication of Patriarch Michael I Cerularius on the part of Humbert of Silva Candida, the papal envoy of Pope Leo IX in 1054, an act that is commonly considered the start of the EastÿWest Schism.\\r\\nIn 1453, Constantinople was conquered by the Ottoman Empire under Mehmed the Conqueror, who ordered this main church of Orthodox Christianity converted into a mosque. Although some parts of the city of Constantinople were falling into disrepair, the cathedral was maintained with an amount of money set aside for this purpose. Nevertheless, the Christian cathedral made a strong impression on the new Ottoman rulers and they decided to convert it into a mosque.[9][10] The bells, altar, iconostasis, and other relics were destroyed and the mosaics depicting Jesus, his Mother Mary, Christian saints, and angels were also destroyed or plastered over. Islamic featuressuch as the mihrab, minbar, and four minaretswere added. It remained a mosque until 1931 when it was closed to the public for four years. It was re-opened in 1935 as a museum by the Republic of Turkey. Hagia Sophia was, as of 2014[update], the second-most visited museum in Turkey, attracting almost 3.3 million visitors annually.[11] According to data released by the Turkish Culture and Tourism Ministry, Hagia Sophia was Turkey's most visited tourist attraction in 2015.[12]\\r\\nFrom its initial conversion until the construction of the nearby Sultan Ahmed Mosque (Blue Mosque of Istanbul) in 1616, it was the principal mosque of Istanbul. The Byzantine architecture of the Hagia Sophia served as inspiration for many other Ottoman mosques, such as the aforementioned mosque, the ?ehzade Mosque, the Sleymaniye Mosque, the Rstem Pasha Mosque and the K?l?? Ali Pasha Complex.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe first church on the site was known as the ՚? ?ٰҿ?ϫ (Megl Ekkls, \\"Great Church\\"), or in Latin Magna Ecclesia,[13][14] because of its larger dimensions in comparison to the contemporary churches in the City.[6] Inaugurated on 15 February 360 (during the reign of Constantius II) by the Arian bishop Eudoxius of Antioch,[15] it was built next to the area where the imperial palace was being developed. The nearby Hagia Eirene (\\"Holy Peace\\") church was completed earlier and served as cathedral until the Great Church was completed. Both churches acted together as the principal churches of the Byzantine Empire.\\r\\nWriting in 440, Socrates of Constantinople claimed that the church was built by Constantius II, who was working on it in 346.[15] A tradition which is not older than the 7th or 8th century, reports that the edifice was built by Constantine the Great.[15] Zonaras reconciles the two opinions, writing that Constantius had repaired the edifice consecrated by Eusebius of Nicomedia, after it had collapsed.[15] Since Eusebius was bishop of Constantinople from 339 to 341, and Constantine died in 337, it seems possible that the first church was erected by the latter.[15] The edifice was built as a traditional Latin colonnaded basilica with galleries and a wooden roof. It was preceded by an atrium. It was claimed to be one of the world's most outstanding monuments at the time.\\r\\nThe Patriarch of Constantinople John Chrysostom came into a conflict with Empress Aelia Eudoxia, wife of the emperor Arcadius, and was sent into exile on 20 June 404. During the subsequent riots, this first church was largely burned down.[15] Nothing remains of the first church today.\\r\\nA second church on the site was ordered by Theodosius II, who inaugurated it on 10 October 415. The basilica with a wooden roof was built by architect Rufinus. A fire started during the tumult of the Nika Revolt and burned the second Hagia Sophia to the ground on 13ÿ14 January 532.\\r\\nSeveral marble blocks from the second church survive to the present; among them are reliefs depicting 12 lambs representing the 12 apostles. Originally part of a monumental front entrance, they now reside in an excavation pit adjacent to the museum's entrance after they were discovered in 1935 beneath the western courtyard by A. M. Schneider. Further digging was forsaken for fear of impinging on the integrity of the building.\\r\\nOn 23 February 532, only a few weeks after the destruction of the second basilica, Emperor Justinian I decided to build a third and entirely different basilica, larger and more majestic than its predecessors.\\r\\nJustinian chose physicist Isidore of Miletus and mathematician Anthemius of Tralles as architects; Anthemius, however, died within the first year of the endeavor. The construction is described in the Byzantine historian Procopius' On Buildings (Peri ktismatn, Latin: De aedificiis). Columns and other marbles were brought from all over the empire, throughout the Mediterranean. The idea of these columns being spoils from cities such as Rome and Ephesus is a later invention.[16] Even though they were made specifically for Hagia Sophia, the columns show variations in size.[17] More than ten thousand people were employed. This new church was contemporaneously recognized as a major work of architecture. The theories of Heron of Alexandria may have been utilized to address the challenges presented by building such an expansive dome over so large a space.[citation needed] The emperor, together with the Patriarch Menas, inaugurated the new basilica on 27 December 537 ÿ 5 years and 10 months after construction start ÿ with much pomp.[18][19][20] The mosaics inside the church were, however, only completed under the reign of Emperor Justin II (565ÿ578).\\r\\nHagia Sophia was the seat of the Orthodox patriarch of Constantinople and a principal setting for Byzantine imperial ceremonies, such as coronations. Like other churches throughout Christendom, the basilica offered sanctuary from persecution to outlaws.\\r\\nEarthquakes in August 553 and on 14 December 557 caused cracks in the main dome and eastern half-dome. The main dome collapsed completely during a subsequent earthquake on 7 May 558,[21] destroying the ambon, altar, and ciborium. The collapse was due mainly to the unfeasibly high bearing load and to the enormous shear load of the dome, which was too flat.[18] These caused the deformation of the piers which sustained the dome.[18] The emperor ordered an immediate restoration. He entrusted it to Isidorus the Younger, nephew of Isidore of Miletus, who used lighter materials and elevated the dome by \\"30 feet\\"[18] (about 6.25 meters or 20.5 feet)[clarification needed] ÿ giving the building its current interior height of 55.6 meters (182?ft).[22] Moreover, Isidorus changed the dome type, erecting a ribbed dome with pendentives, whose diameter lay between 32.7 and 33.5?m.[18] Under Justinian's orders, eight Corinthian columns were disassembled from Baalbek, Lebanon, and shipped to Constantinople around 560.[23] This reconstruction, giving the church its present 6th-century form, was completed in 562. The Byzantine poet Paul the Silentiary composed a long epic poem (still extant), known as Ekphrasis, for the rededication of the basilica presided over by Patriarch Eutychius on 23 December 562.\\r\\nIn 726, the emperor Leo the Isaurian issued a series of edicts against the veneration of images, ordering the army to destroy all icons ÿ ushering in the period of Byzantine iconoclasm. At that time, all religious pictures and statues were removed from the Hagia Sophia. After a brief reprieve under Empress Irene (797ÿ802), the iconoclasts made a comeback. The Emperor Theophilus (829ÿ842) had two-winged bronze doors with his monograms installed at the southern entrance of the church.\\r\\nThe basilica suffered damage, first in a great fire in 859, and again in an earthquake on 8 January 869, that made one of the half-domes collapse. Emperor Basil I ordered the church repaired.\\r\\nAfter the great earthquake of 25 October 989, which collapsed the Western dome arch, Emperor Basil II asked for the Armenian architect Trdat, creator of the cathedrals of Ani and Argina, to direct the repairs.[24] He erected again and reinforced the fallen dome arch, and rebuilt the west side of the dome with 15 dome ribs.[25] The extent of the damage required six years of repair and reconstruction; the church was re-opened on 13 May 994. At the end of the reconstruction, the church's decorations were renovated, including the addition of four immense paintings of cherubs; a new depiction of Christ on the dome; a burial cloth of Christ shown on Fridays, and on the apse a new depiction of the Virgin Mary holding Jesus, between the apostles Peter and Paul.[26] On the great side arches were painted the prophets and the teachers of the church.[26]\\r\\nIn his book De caerimoniis aulae Byzantinae (\\"Book of Ceremonies\\"), Emperor Constantine VII (913ÿ919) wrote a detailed account of the ceremonies held in the Hagia Sophia by the emperor and the patriarch.\\r\\nUpon the capture of Constantinople during the Fourth Crusade, the church was ransacked and desecrated by the Crusaders, as described by the Byzantine historian Niketas Choniates. During the Latin occupation of Constantinople (1204ÿ1261) the church became a Roman Catholic cathedral. Baldwin I of Constantinople was crowned emperor on 16 May 1204 in Hagia Sophia, at a ceremony which closely followed Byzantine practices. Enrico Dandolo, the Doge of Venice who commanded the sack and invasion of the city by the Latin Crusaders in 1204, is buried inside the church, probably in the upper Eastern gallery. In the 19th century, an Italian restoration team placed a cenotaph marker near the probable location, which is still visible today. The marker is frequently mistaken by tourists as being a medieval marker of the actual tomb of the doge. The real tomb was destroyed by the Ottomans after the conquest of Constantinople in 1453 and subsequent conversion of Hagia Sophia into a mosque.[27]\\r\\nAfter the recapture in 1261 by the Byzantines, the church was in a dilapidated state. In 1317, emperor Andronicus II ordered four new buttresses (Pyramdas, Greek: \\"ϫ?Ѵϫ?\\") to be built in the eastern and northern parts of the church, financing them with the inheritance of his deceased wife, Irene.[28] New cracks developed in the dome after the earthquake of October 1344, and several parts of the building collapsed on 19 May 1346; consequently, the church was closed until 1354, when repairs were undertaken by architects Astras and Peralta.\\r\\nConstantinople fell to the attacking Ottoman forces on the 29th of May in 1453. In accordance with the traditional custom at the time, Sultan Mehmet II allowed his troops and his entourage three full days of unbridled pillage and looting in the city shortly after it was captured. Once the three days passed, he would then claim its remaining contents for himself.[29][30] Hagia Sophia was not exempted from the pillage and looting and specifically became its focal point as the invaders believed it to contain the greatest treasures and valuables of the city.[31] Shortly after Constantinople's defenses collapsed and the Ottoman troops entered the city victoriously, the pillagers and looters made their way to the Hagia Sophia and battered down its doors before storming in.[32] All throughout the period of the siege of Constantinople, the trapped worshippers of the city participated in the Divine Liturgy and the Prayer of the Hours at the Hagia Sophia and the church formed a safe-haven and a refuge for many of those who were unable to contribute to the city's defense, which comprised women, children, the elderly and the sick and the wounded.[33][34] Being hopelessly trapped in the church, the many congregants and yet more refugees inside became spoils-of-war to be divided amongst the triumphant invaders. The building was significantly desecrated and looted to a large extent, with the helpless occupants who sought shelter within the church being either enslaved, physically and sexually violated or simply slaughtered.[31] While most of the elderly and the infirm/wounded and sick were killed, a vast number of women and girls were raped and the remainder (mainly teenage males and young boys) were chained up and sold off into slavery.[32] The church's priests and religious personnel continued to perform Christian rites, prayers and ceremonies until finally being forced to stop by the invaders.[32] When Sultan Mehmet II and his accompanying entourage entered the church, he insisted that it should be converted into a mosque at once. One of the ulama present then climbed up the church's pulpit and recited out the Shahada, thus marking the beginning of the gradual conversion of the church into a mosque.[28][35]\\r\\nAs described by several Western visitors (such as the C܇rdoban nobleman Pero Tafur[36] and the Florentine Cristoforo Buondelmonti),[37] the church was in a dilapidated state, with several of its doors fallen from their hinges; Mehmed II ordered a renovation as well as the conversion. Mehmet attended the first Friday prayer in the mosque on 1 June 1453.[38] Aya Sofya became the first imperial mosque of Istanbul.[39] To the corresponding Waqf were endowed most of the existing houses in the city and the area of the future Topkap? Palace.[28] From 1478, 2,360 shops, 1,300 houses, 4 caravanserais, 30 boza shops, and 23 shops of sheep heads and trotters gave their income to the foundation.[40] Through the imperial charters of 1520 (AH 926) and 1547 (AH 954) shops and parts of the Grand Bazaar and other markets were added to the foundation.[28]\\r\\nBefore 1481 a small minaret was erected on the southwest corner of the building, above the stair tower.[28] Later, the subsequent sultan, Bayezid II (1481ÿ1512), built another minaret at the northeast corner.[28] One of these collapsed after the earthquake of 1509,[28] and around the middle of the 16th century they were both replaced by two diagonally opposite minarets built at the east and west corners of the edifice.[28]\\r\\nIn the 16th century the sultan Suleiman the Magnificent (1520ÿ1566) brought back two colossal candlesticks from his conquest of Hungary. They were placed on either side of the mihrab. During the reign of Selim II (1566ÿ1574), the building started showing signs of fatigue and was extensively strengthened with the addition of structural supports to its exterior by Ottoman architect Mimar Sinan, who was also an earthquake engineer.[41] In addition to strengthening the historic Byzantine structure, Sinan built the two additional large minarets at the western end of the building, the original sultan's lodge and the Trbe (mausoleum) of Selim II to the southeast of the building in 1576-7 / AH 984. In order to do that, parts of the Patriarchate at the south corner of the building were pulled down the previous year.[28] Moreover, the golden crescent was mounted on the top of the dome,[28] while a respect zone 35 ar?in (about 24?m) wide was imposed around the building, pulling down all the houses which in the meantime had nested around it.[28] Later his trbe hosted also 43 tombs of Ottoman princes.[28] In 1594 / AH 1004 Mimar (court architect) Davud A?a built the trbe of Murad III (1574ÿ1595), where the Sultan and his Valide, Safiye Sultan were later buried.[28] The octagonal mausoleum of their son Mehmed III (1595ÿ1603) and his Valide was built next to it in 1608 / AH 1017 by royal architect Dalgi? Mehmet A?a.[42] His son Mustafa I (1617ÿ1618; 1622ÿ1623) converted the baptistery into his trbe.[42]\\r\\nMurad III had also two large alabaster Hellenistic urns transported from Pergamon and placed on two sides of the nave.[28]\\r\\nIn 1717, under Sultan Ahmed III (1703ÿ1730), the crumbling plaster of the interior was renovated, contributing indirectly to the preservation of many mosaics, which otherwise would have been destroyed by mosque workers.[42] In fact, it was usual for them to sell mosaics stones ÿ believed to be talismans ÿ to the visitors.[42] Sultan Mahmud I ordered the restoration of the building in 1739 and added a medrese (a Koranic school, now the library of the museum), an Imaret (soup kitchen for distribution to the poor) and a library, and in 1740 a ?adirvan (fountain for ritual ablutions), thus transforming it into a klliye, i.e. a social complex. At the same time, a new sultan's lodge and a new mihrab were built inside.\\r\\nRestoration of the Hagia Sophia was ordered by Sultan Abdlmecid and completed by eight hundred workers between 1847 and 1849, under the supervision of the Swiss-Italian architect brothers Gaspare and Giuseppe Fossati. The brothers consolidated the dome and vaults, straightened the columns, and revised the decoration of the exterior and the interior of the building. The mosaics in the upper gallery were exposed and cleaned, although many were recovered \\"for protection against further damage\\". The old chandeliers were replaced by new pendant ones. New gigantic circular-framed disks or medallions were hung on columns. These were inscribed with the names of Allah, Muhammad, the first four caliphs Abu Bakr, Umar, Uthman and Ali, and the two grandchildren of Muhammad: Hassan and Hussain, by the calligrapher Kazasker Mustafa ?zzed Effendi (1801ÿ1877). In 1850 the architects Fossati built a new sultan's lodge or loge in a Neo-Byzantine style connected to the royal pavilion behind the mosque. They also renovated the minbar and mihrab. Outside the main building, the minarets were repaired and altered so that they were of equal height.[43][44] A timekeeper's building and a new madrasah were built. When the restoration was finished, the mosque was re-opened with ceremonial pomp on 13 July 1849.[citation needed]\\r\\nIn 1935, the first Turkish President and founder of the Republic of Turkey, Mustafa Kemal Atatrk, transformed the building into a museum. The carpets were removed and marble floor decorations such as the Omphalion appeared for the first time in centuries, while the white plaster covering many of the mosaics was removed. Nevertheless, the condition of the structure deteriorated, and the World Monuments Fund placed Hagia Sophia on 1996 World Monuments Watch, and again in 1998. The building's copper roof had cracked, causing water to leak down over the fragile frescoes and mosaics. Moisture entered from below as well. Rising ground water had raised the level of humidity within the monument, creating an unstable environment for stone and paint. The WMF secured a series of grants from 1997 to 2002 for the restoration of the dome. The first stage of work involved the structural stabilization and repair of the cracked roof, which was undertaken with the participation of the Turkish Ministry of Culture. The second phase, the preservation of the dome's interior, afforded the opportunity to employ and train young Turkish conservators in the care of mosaics. By 2006, the WMF project was complete, though many other areas of Hagia Sophia continue to require significant stability improvement, restoration and conservation.[45] Haghia Sophia is currently (2014) the second most visited museum in Turkey, attracting almost 3.3 million visitors annually.[11]\\r\\nAlthough use of the complex as a place of worship (mosque or church) was strictly prohibited,[46] in 2006 the Turkish government allowed the allocation of a small room in the museum complex to be used as a prayer room for Christian and Muslim museum staff,[47] and since 2013 from the minarets of the museum the muezzin sings the call to prayer twice per day, in the afternoon.[48]\\r\\nIn 2007, Greek American politician Chris Spirou launched an international organization \\"Free Agia Sophia Council\\" championing the cause of restoring the building to its original function as a Christian church.[49][50][51] Since the early 2010s, several campaigns and government high officials, notably Turkey's deputy prime minister Blent Ar?n? in November 2013, have been demanding that Hagia Sophia be converted into a mosque again.[52][53][54] In 2015, in retaliation for the acknowledgment by Pope Francis of the Armenian Genocide, the Mufti of Ankara, Mefail H?zl?, stated that he believes the conversion of Hagia Sophia into a mosque will be accelerated.[55][56]\\r\\nOn July 1, 2016, Muslim prayers were held again in the Hagia Sophia for the first time in 85 years.[57]\\r\\nOn May 13, 2017, a large group of people organized by the Anatolia Youth Association (AGD), gathered in front of Hagia Sophia and prayed the morning prayer with a call for the reconversion of the museum into a mosque.[58] On June 21, 2017, Presidency of Religious Affairs (Diyanet) organized a special program, which included the recitation of the Quran and prayers in Hagia Sofia, to mark the Laylat al-Qadr, the program was broadcast live by state-run television TRT.[59]\\r\\nIn March 31, 2018, Turkish president Recep Tayyip Erdo?an recited the first verse of the Quran in the Hagia Sophia, dedicating the prayer to the souls of all who left us this work as inheritance, especially Istanbuls conqueror.[60]\\r\\n[61]\\r\\nHagia Sophia is one of the greatest surviving examples of Byzantine architecture.[3] Its interior is decorated with mosaics and marble pillars and coverings of great artistic value. The temple itself was so richly and artistically decorated that Justinian proclaimed, \\"Solomon, I have outdone thee!\\" (?ٻҰ?  ҷ?). Justinian himself had overseen the completion of the greatest cathedral ever built up to that time, and it was to remain the largest cathedral for 1,000 years up until the completion of the cathedral in Seville in Spain.[62]\\r\\nJustinian's basilica was at once the culminating architectural achievement of late antiquity and the first masterpiece of Byzantine architecture. Its influence, both architecturally and liturgically, was widespread and enduring in the Eastern Orthodox, Roman Catholic, and Muslim worlds alike.\\r\\nThe vast interior has a complex structure. The nave is covered by a central dome which at its maximum is 55.6?m (182?ft 5?in) from floor level and rests on an arcade of 40 arched windows. Repairs to its structure have left the dome somewhat elliptical, with the diameter varying between 31.24 and 30.86?m (102?ft 6?in and 101?ft 3?in).\\r\\nAt the western entrance side and eastern liturgical side, there are arched openings extended by half domes of identical diameter to the central dome, carried on smaller semi-domed exedras; a hierarchy of dome-headed elements built up to create a vast oblong interior crowned by the central dome, with a clear span of 76.2?m (250?ft).[3]\\r\\nInterior surfaces are sheathed with polychrome marbles, green and white with purple porphyry, and gold mosaics. The exterior, clad in stucco, was tinted yellow and red during restorations in the 19th century at the direction of the Fossati architects.\\r\\nThe Imperial Gate was the main entrance between the exo- and esonarthex. It was reserved exclusively for the Emperor. The Byzantine mosaic above the portal depicts Christ and an unnamed emperor. A long ramp from the northern part of the outer narthex leads up to the upper gallery.\\r\\nThe upper gallery is laid out in a horseshoe shape that encloses the nave until the apse. Several mosaics are preserved in the upper gallery, an area traditionally reserved for the Empress and her court. The best-preserved mosaics are located in the southern part of the gallery.\\r\\nThe upper gallery contains runic graffiti presumed to be from the Varangian Guard.[citation needed]\\r\\nThe dome of Hagia Sophia has spurred particular interest for many art historians, architects and engineers because of the innovative way the original architects envisioned it. The dome is carried on four spherical triangular pendentives, one of the first large-scale uses of them. The pendentives are the corners of the square base of the dome, which curve upwards into the dome to support it, restraining the lateral forces of the dome and allowing its weight to flow downwards.[63][64] It was the largest pendentive dome in the world until the completion of St. Peter's Basilica, and has a much lower height than any other dome of such a large diameter.\\r\\nThe weight of the dome remained a problem for most of the building's existence. The original cupola collapsed entirely after the earthquake of 558; in 563 a new dome was built by Isidore the younger, a nephew of Isidore of Miletus. Unlike the original, this included 40 ribs and was raised 20 feet, in order to lower the lateral forces on the church walls. A larger section of the second dome collapsed as well, in two episodes, so that today only two sections of the present dome, in the north and south side, still date from the 562 reconstructions. Of the whole dome's 40 ribs, the surviving north section contains eight ribs, while the south section includes six ribs.[65]\\r\\nAlthough this design stabilizes the dome and the surrounding walls and arches, the actual construction of the walls of Hagia Sophia weakened the overall structure. The bricklayers used more mortar than brick, which is more effective if the mortar was allowed to settle as the building would have been more flexible; however, the builders raced to complete the building and left no time for the mortar to cure before they began the next layer. When the dome was erected, its weight caused the walls to lean outward because of the wet mortar underneath. When Isidore the Younger rebuilt the fallen cupola, he had first to build up the interior of the walls to make them vertical again. Additionally, the architect raised the height of the rebuilt dome by approximately six?m (20 feet) so that the lateral forces would not be as strong and its weight would be transmitted more effectively down into the walls. Moreover, he shaped the new cupola like a scalloped shell or the inside of an umbrella, with ribs that extend from the top down to the base. These ribs allow the weight of the dome to flow between the windows, down the pendentives, and ultimately to the foundation.[66]\\r\\nHagia Sophia is famous for the light that reflects everywhere in the interior of the nave, giving the dome the appearance of hovering above. This effect was achieved by inserting forty windows around the base of the original structure. Moreover, the insertion of the windows in the dome structure lowers its weight.[66]\\r\\nThe minarets were an Ottoman addition and not part of the original church's Byzantine design. They were built for notification of invitations for prayers and announcements. Mehmed had built a minaret made from wood over one of the half domes soon after Hagia Sophia's conversion from a cathedral to a mosque. This minaret does not exist today. One of the minarets (at southwest) was built from red brick and can be dated back from the Fatih Sultan Mehmed period or Beyaz?d II period. The other three were built from white limestone and sandstone, of which the slender northeast column was erected by Sultan Bayezid II during the Selim II period, while the two identical larger minarets to the west were erected by Sultan Selim II and designed by the famous Ottoman architect Mimar Sinan. Both are 60 meters in height, and with their thick and massif patterns, complete Hagia Sophia's main structure. Many ornaments and details were added to these minarets on repairs during the 15th, 16th, and 19th centuries, which reflect each period's characteristics and ideals.[67][68]\\r\\nNumerous buttresses have been added throughout the centuries. The flying buttresses to the west of the building, although thought to have been constructed by the Crusaders upon their visit to Constantinople, are actually built during the Byzantine era. This shows that the Byzantines had prior knowledge of flying buttresses which can also be seen at Hosios Loukas in Central Greece, the Rotunda of Galerius in Thessaloniki, and San Vitale in Ravenna.[66] Other buttresses were constructed during the Ottoman times under the guidance of the architect Sinan. A total of 24 buttresses were added.[69]\\r\\nOriginally, under Justinian's reign, the interior decorations consisted of abstract designs on marble slabs on the walls and floors, as well as mosaics on the curving vaults. Of these mosaics, one can still see the two archangels Gabriel and Michael in the spandrels of the bema. There were already a few figurative decorations, as attested by the eulogy of Paul the Silentiary. The spandrels of the gallery are revetted in opus sectile, showing patterns and figures of flowers and birds in precisely cut pieces of white marble set against a background of black marble. In later stages, figurative mosaics were added, which were destroyed during the iconoclastic controversy (726ÿ843). Present mosaics are from the post-iconoclastic period.\\r\\nApart from the mosaics, a large number of figurative decorations were added during the second half of the 9th century: an image of Christ in the central dome; Orthodox saints, prophets and Church Fathers in the tympana below; historical figures connected with this church, such as Patriarch Ignatius; some scenes from the gospel in the galleries. Basil II let artists paint on each of the four pendentives a giant six-winged Cherub.[26] The Ottomans covered their face with a golden halo,[26] but in 2009 one of them was restored to the original state.[70]\\r\\nThe Loge of the Empress is located in the centre of the upper enclosure, or gallery, of the Hagia Sophia. From there the empress and the court-ladies would watch the proceedings down below. A round green stone marks the spot where the throne of the empress stood.[71][72]\\r\\nTwo huge marble lustration (ritual purification) urns were brought from Pergamon during the reign of Sultan Murad III. From the Hellenistic period, they are carved from single blocks of marble.[28]\\r\\nThe Marble Door inside the Hagia Sophia is located in the southern upper enclosure or gallery. It was used by the participants in synods, who entered and left the meeting chamber through this door. It is said[by whom?] that each side is symbolic and that one side represents heaven while the other represents hell. Its panels are covered in fruits and fish motives. The door opens into a space that was used as a venue for solemn meetings and important resolutions of patriarchate officials.[73]\\r\\nThe Nice Door is the oldest architectural element found in the Hagia Sophia dating back to the 2nd century BC. The decorations are of reliefs of geometric shapes as well as plants that are believed to have come from a pagan temple in Tarsus, Mersin now modern-day Turkey. It was incorporated into the building by Emperor Theophilos in 838AD where it is placed in the south exit in the inner narthex.[74]\\r\\nThe Emperor Door is the door that would be used solely by the Emperor as well as his personal bodyguard and retinue. It is the largest door in the Hagia Sophia and has been dated to the 6th century. It is about 7 meters long and Eastern Roman sources say it was made with wood from Noah's Ark.[75]\\r\\nAt the northwest of the building, there is a column with a hole in the middle covered by bronze plates. This column goes by different names; the perspiring column, the wishing column, the sweating column or the crying column. The column is said to be damp when touched and have supernatural powers.[76] The legend states that since St. Gregory the Miracle Worker appeared near the column in the year 1200, it has been moist. It is believed that touching the moisture cures many illnesses.[77][78]\\r\\nThe first mosaics which adorned the church were only completed during the reign of Justin II[79]. Many of the non-figurative mosaics in the church come from this period. Most of the mosaics, however, were completed after the end of the Byzantine Iconoclasm of 800 AD.\\r\\nDuring the Sack of Constantinople in 1204, the Latin Crusaders vandalized valuable items in every important Byzantine structure of the city, including the golden mosaics of the Hagia Sophia. Many of these items were shipped to Venice, whose Doge, Enrico Dandolo, had organized the invasion and sack of Constantinople after an agreement with Prince Alexios Angelos, the son of a deposed Byzantine emperor.\\r\\nFollowing the building's conversion into a mosque in 1453, many of its mosaics were covered with plaster, due to Islam's ban on representational imagery. This process was not completed at once, and reports exist from the 17th century in which travelers note that they could still see Christian images in the former church. In 1847ÿ49, the building was restored by two Swiss-Italian Fossati brothers, Gaspare and Giuseppe, and Sultan Abdlmecid allowed them to also document any mosaics they might discover during this process which were later archived in Swiss libraries.[80] This work did not include repairing the mosaics and after recording the details about an image, the Fossatis painted it over again. The Fossatis restored the mosaics of the two hexapteryga (singular Greek: ?ϫ?, pr. hexapterygon, six-winged angel; it is uncertain whether they are seraphim or cherubim) located on the two east pendentives, covering their faces again before the end of the restoration.[81] The other two placed on the west pendentives are copies in paint created by the Fossatis since they could find no surviving remains of them.[81] As in this case, the architects reproduced in paint damaged decorative mosaic patterns, sometimes redesigning them in the process. The Fossati records are the primary sources about a number of mosaic images now believed to have been completely or partially destroyed in the 1894 Istanbul earthquake. These include a mosaic over a now-unidentified Door of the Poor, a large image of a jewel-encrusted cross, and a large number of images of angels, saints, patriarchs, and church fathers. Most of the missing images were located in the building's two tympana.\\r\\nOne mosaic they documented is Christ Pantocrator in a circle, which would indicate it to be a ceiling mosaic, possibly even of the main dome which was later covered and painted over with Islamic calligraphy that expounds God as the light of the universe. The drawings of the Hagia Sophia mosaics are today kept in the Cantonal Archive of Ticino.[82]\\r\\nA large number of mosaics were uncovered in the 1930s by a team from the Byzantine Institute of America led by Thomas Whittemore. The team chose to let a number of simple cross images remain covered by plaster but uncovered all major mosaics found.\\r\\nBecause of its long history as both a church and a mosque, a particular challenge arises in the restoration process. Christian iconographic mosaics can be uncovered, but often at the expense of important and historic Islamic art. Restorers have attempted to maintain a balance between both Christian and Islamic cultures. In particular, much controversy rests upon whether the Islamic calligraphy on the dome of the cathedral should be removed, in order to permit the underlying Pantocrator mosaic of Christ as Master of the World, to be exhibited (assuming the mosaic still exists).[83]\\r\\nThe Imperial Gate mosaic is located in the tympanum above that gate, which was used only by the emperors when entering the church. Based on style analysis, it has been dated to the late 9th or early 10th century. The emperor with a nimbus or halo could possibly represent emperor Leo VI the Wise or his son Constantine VII Porphyrogenitus bowing down before Christ Pantocrator, seated on a jeweled throne, giving His blessing and holding in His left hand an open book.[84] The text on the book reads as follows: \\"Peace be with you. I am the light of the world\\". (John 20:19; 20:26; 8:12) On each side of Christ's shoulders is a circular medallion: on His left the Archangel Gabriel, holding a staff, on His right His Mother Mary.[85]\\r\\nThe southwestern entrance mosaic, situated in the tympanum of the southwestern entrance, dates from the reign of Basil II.[86] It was rediscovered during the restorations of 1849 by the Fossatis. The Virgin sits on a throne without a back, her feet resting on a pedestal, embellished with precious stones. The Child Christ sits on her lap, giving His blessing and holding a scroll in His left hand. On her left side stands emperor Constantine in ceremonial attire, presenting a model of the city to Mary. The inscription next to him says: \\"Great emperor Constantine of the Saints\\". On her right side stands emperor Justinian I, offering a model of the Hagia Sophia. The medallions on both sides of the Virgin's head carry the monograms MP and , an abbreviation of \\"Mtr\\" and \\"Theou\\", meaning \\"Mother of God\\".[87]\\r\\nThe Virgin and Child mosaic was the first of the post-iconoclastic mosaics. It was inaugurated on 29 March 867 by Patriarch Photius and the emperors Michael III and Basil I. This mosaic is situated in a high location on the half dome of the apse. Mary is sitting on a throne without a back, holding the Child Jesus on her lap. Her feet rest on a pedestal. Both the pedestal and the throne are adorned with precious stones. The portraits of the archangels Gabriel and Michael (largely destroyed) in the bema of the arch also date from the 9th century. The mosaics are set against the original golden background of the 6th century. These mosaics were believed to be a reconstruction of the mosaics of the 6th century that were previously destroyed during the iconoclastic era by the Byzantines of that time, as represented in the inaugural sermon by the patriarch Photios. However, no record of figural decoration of Hagia Sophia exists before this time.[88]\\r\\nThe Emperor Alexander mosaic is not easy to find for the first-time visitor, located on the second floor in a dark corner of the ceiling. It depicts Emperor Alexander in full regalia, holding a scroll in his right hand and a globus cruciger in his left. A drawing by the Fossatis showed that the mosaic survived until 1849 and that Thomas Whittemore, founder of the Byzantine Institute of America who was granted permission to preserve the mosaics, assumed that it had been destroyed in the earthquake of 1894. Eight years after his death, the mosaic was discovered in 1958 largely through the researches of Robert Van Nice. Unlike most of the other mosaics in Hagia Sophia, which had been covered over by ordinary plaster, the Alexander mosaic was simply painted over and reflected the surrounding mosaic patterns and thus was well hidden. It was duly cleaned by the Byzantine Institute's successor to Whittemore, Paul A. Underwood.[89][90]\\r\\nThe Empress Zoe mosaic on the eastern wall of the southern gallery date from the 11th century. Christ Pantocrator, clad in the dark blue robe (as is the custom in Byzantine art), is seated in the middle against a golden background, giving His blessing with the right hand and holding the Bible in His left hand. On either side of His head are the monograms IC and XC, meaning Isous Christos. He is flanked by Constantine IX Monomachus and Empress Zoe, both in ceremonial costumes. He is offering a purse, as a symbol of donation, he made to the church, while she is holding a scroll, symbol of the donations she made. The inscription over the head of the emperor says: \\"Constantine, pious emperor in Christ the God, king of the Romans, Monomachus\\". The inscription over the head of the empress reads as follows: \\"Zo?, the very pious Augusta\\". The previous heads have been scraped off and replaced by the three present ones. Perhaps the earlier mosaic showed her first husband Romanus III Argyrus or her second husband Michael IV. Another theory is that this mosaic was made for an earlier emperor and empress, with their heads changed into the present ones.[91]\\r\\nThe Comnenus mosaic, also located on the eastern wall of the southern gallery, dates from 1122. The Virgin Mary is standing in the middle, depicted, as usual in Byzantine art, in a dark blue gown. She holds the Child Christ on her lap. He gives His blessing with His right hand while holding a scroll in His left hand. On her right side stands emperor John II Comnenus, represented in a garb embellished with precious stones. He holds a purse, symbol of an imperial donation to the church. Empress Irene stands on the left side of the Virgin, wearing ceremonial garments and offering a document. Their eldest son Alexius Comnenus is represented on an adjacent pilaster. He is shown as a beardless youth, probably representing his appearance at his coronation aged seventeen. In this panel, one can already see a difference with the Empress Zoe mosaic that is one century older. There is a more realistic expression in the portraits instead of an idealized representation. The Empress is shown with plaited blond hair, rosy cheeks, and grey eyes, revealing her Hungarian descent. The emperor is depicted in a dignified manner.[92]\\r\\nThe De?sis mosaic (?ҿ?, \\"Entreaty\\") probably dates from 1261. It was commissioned to mark the end of 57 years of Roman Catholic use and the return to the Orthodox faith. It is the third panel situated in the imperial enclosure of the upper galleries. It is widely considered the finest in Hagia Sophia, because of the softness of the features, the humane expressions and the tones of the mosaic. The style is close to that of the Italian painters of the late 13th or early 14th century, such as Duccio. In this panel the Virgin Mary and John the Baptist (Ioannes Prodromos), both shown in three-quarters profile, are imploring the intercession of Christ Pantocrator for humanity on Judgment Day. The bottom part of this mosaic is badly deteriorated.[93] This mosaic is considered as the beginning of the Renaissance in Byzantine pictorial art.[94]\\r\\nThe northern tympanum mosaics feature various saints. They have been able to survive due to the very high and unreachable location. They depict Saints John Chrysostom and Ignatius the Younger standing, clothed in white robes with crosses, and holding richly jeweled Holy Bibles. The names of each saint are given around the figures in Greek, in order to enable an identification for the visitor. The other mosaics in the other tympana have not survived probably due to the frequent earthquakes as opposed to any deliberate destruction by the Ottoman conquerors.[95]\\r\\n\\r\\nThis features four unidentical angel figures. It is believed that these on headed six winged angels, also known as seraphim, protect the lords throne in heaven. There are angels in the east composed in mosaics as where the ones in the west were damaged during the Eastern Roman Period, they have been renewed as fresco. During the ottoman period the angels faces were covered with metallic lids in the shape of stars, but were removed to reveal the faces in 2009 during renovations.

It is named after the engineer Gustave Eiffel, whose company designed and built the tower.\\r\\nConstructed from 1887ÿ89 as the entrance to the 1889 World's Fair, it was initially criticized by some of France's leading artists and intellectuals for its design, but it has become a global cultural icon of France and one of the most recognisable structures in the world.[3] The Eiffel Tower is the most-visited paid monument in the world; 6.91?million people ascended it in 2015.\\r\\nThe tower is 324 metres (1,063?ft) tall, about the same height as an 81-storey building, and the tallest structure in Paris. Its base is square, measuring 125 metres (410?ft) on each side. During its construction, the Eiffel Tower surpassed the Washington Monument to become the tallest man-made structure in the world, a title it held for 41 years until the Chrysler Building in New York City was finished in 1930. Due to the addition of a broadcasting aerial at the top of the tower in 1957, it is now taller than the Chrysler Building by 5.2 metres (17?ft). Excluding transmitters, the Eiffel Tower is the second-tallest structure in France after the Millau Viaduct.\\r\\nThe tower has three levels for visitors, with restaurants on the first and second levels. The top level's upper platform is 276?m (906?ft) above the ground ÿ the highest observation deck accessible to the public in the European Union. Tickets can be purchased to ascend by stairs or lift (elevator) to the first and second levels. The climb from ground level to the first level is over 300 steps, as is the climb from the first level to the second. Although there is a staircase to the top level, it is usually accessible only by lift.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe design of the Eiffel Tower was the product of Maurice Koechlin and mile Nouguier, two senior engineers working for the Compagnie des tablissements Eiffel, after discussion about a suitable centrepiece for the proposed 1889 Exposition Universelle, a world's fair to celebrate the centennial of the French Revolution. Eiffel openly acknowledged that inspiration for a tower came from the Latting Observatory built in New York City in 1853.[4] In May 1884, working at home, Koechlin made a sketch of their idea, described by him as \\"a great pylon, consisting of four lattice girders standing apart at the base and coming together at the top, joined together by metal trusses at regular intervals\\".[5] Eiffel initially showed little enthusiasm, but he did approve further study, and the two engineers then asked Stephen Sauvestre, the head of company's architectural department, to contribute to the design. Sauvestre added decorative arches to the base of the tower, a glass pavilion to the first level, and other embellishments.\\r\\nThe new version gained Eiffel's support: he bought the rights to the patent on the design which Koechlin, Nougier, and Sauvestre had taken out, and the design was exhibited at the Exhibition of Decorative Arts in the autumn of 1884 under the company name. On 30 March 1885, Eiffel presented his plans to the Socit des Ingnieurs Civils; after discussing the technical problems and emphasising the practical uses of the tower, he finished his talk by saying the tower would symbolise,\\r\\nNot only the art of the modern engineer, but also the century of Industry and Science in which we are living, and for which the way was prepared by the great scientific movement of the eighteenth century and by the Revolution of 1789, to which this monument will be built as an expression of France's gratitude.[6]\\r\\nLittle progress was made until 1886, when Jules Grvy was re-elected as president of France and douard Lockroy was appointed as minister for trade. A budget for the exposition was passed and, on 1 May, Lockroy announced an alteration to the terms of the open competition being held for a centrepiece to the exposition, which effectively made the selection of Eiffel's design a foregone conclusion, as entries had to include a study for a 300?m (980?ft) four-sided metal tower on the Champ de Mars.[6] (A 300-meter tower was then considered a herculean engineering effort). On 12 May, a commission was set up to examine Eiffel's scheme and its rivals, which, a month later, decided that all the proposals except Eiffel's were either impractical or lacking in details.\\r\\nAfter some debate about the exact location of the tower, a contract was signed on 8 January 1887. This was signed by Eiffel acting in his own capacity rather than as the representative of his company, and granted him 1.5 million francs toward the construction costs: less than a quarter of the estimated 6.5 million francs. Eiffel was to receive all income from the commercial exploitation of the tower during the exhibition and for the next 20 years. He later established a separate company to manage the tower, putting up half the necessary capital himself.[7]\\r\\nThe proposed tower had been a subject of controversy, drawing criticism from those who did not believe it was feasible and those who objected on artistic grounds. These objections were an expression of a long-standing debate in France about the relationship between architecture and engineering. It came to a head as work began at the Champ de Mars: a \\"Committee of Three Hundred\\" (one member for each metre of the tower's height) was formed, led by the prominent architect Charles Garnier and including some of the most important figures of the arts, such as Adolphe Bouguereau, Guy de Maupassant, Charles Gounod and Jules Massenet. A petition called \\"Artists against the Eiffel Tower\\" was sent to the Minister of Works and Commissioner for the Exposition, Charles Alphand, and it was published by Le Temps on 14 February 1887:\\r\\nWe, writers, painters, sculptors, architects and passionate devotees of the hitherto untouched beauty of Paris, protest with all our strength, with all our indignation in the name of slighted French taste, against the erection  of this useless and monstrous Eiffel Tower  To bring our arguments home, imagine for a moment a giddy, ridiculous tower dominating Paris like a gigantic black smokestack, crushing under its barbaric bulk Notre Dame, the Tour Saint-Jacques, the Louvre, the Dome of les Invalides, the Arc de Triomphe, all of our humiliated monuments will disappear in this ghastly dream. And for twenty years  we shall see stretching like a blot of ink the hateful shadow of the hateful column of bolted sheet metal.[8]\\r\\nGustave Eiffel responded to these criticisms by comparing his tower to the Egyptian pyramids: \\"My tower will be the tallest edifice ever erected by man. Will it not also be grandiose in its way? And why would something admirable in Egypt become hideous and ridiculous in Paris?\\"[9] These criticisms were also dealt with by douard Lockroy in a letter of support written to Alphand, ironically saying,[10] \\"Judging by the stately swell of the rhythms, the beauty of the metaphors, the elegance of its delicate and precise style, one can tell this protest is the result of collaboration of the most famous writers and poets of our time\\", and he explained that the protest was irrelevant since the project had been decided upon months before, and construction on the tower was already under way.\\r\\nIndeed, Garnier was a member of the Tower Commission that had examined the various proposals, and had raised no objection. Eiffel was similarly unworried, pointing out to a journalist that it was premature to judge the effect of the tower solely on the basis of the drawings, that the Champ de Mars was distant enough from the monuments mentioned in the protest for there to be little risk of the tower overwhelming them, and putting the aesthetic argument for the tower: \\"Do not the laws of natural forces always conform to the secret laws of harmony?\\"[11]\\r\\nSome of the protesters changed their minds when the tower was built; others remained unconvinced.[12] Guy de Maupassant supposedly ate lunch in the tower's restaurant every day because it was the one place in Paris where the tower was not visible.[13]\\r\\nBy 1918, it had become a symbol of Paris and of France after Guillaume Apollinaire wrote a nationalist poem in the shape of the tower (a calligram) to express his feelings about the war against Germany.[14] Today, it is widely considered to be a remarkable piece of structural art, and is often featured in films and literature.\\r\\nWork on the foundations started on 28 January 1887.[15] Those for the east and south legs were straightforward, with each leg resting on four 2?m (6.6?ft) concrete slabs, one for each of the principal girders of each leg. The west and north legs, being closer to the river Seine, were more complicated: each slab needed two piles installed by using compressed-air caissons 15?m (49?ft) long and 6?m (20?ft) in diameter driven to a depth of 22?m (72?ft)[16] to support the concrete slabs, which were 6?m (20?ft) thick. Each of these slabs supported a block of limestone with an inclined top to bear a supporting shoe for the ironwork.\\r\\nEach shoe was anchored to the stonework by a pair of bolts 10?cm (4?in) in diameter and 7.5?m (25?ft) long. The foundations were completed on 30 June, and the erection of the ironwork began. The visible work on-site was complemented by the enormous amount of exacting preparatory work that took place behind the scenes: the drawing office produced 1,700 general drawings and 3,629 detailed drawings of the 18,038 different parts needed.[17] The task of drawing the components was complicated by the complex angles involved in the design and the degree of precision required: the position of rivet holes was specified to within 0.1?mm (0.0039?in) and angles worked out to one second of arc. The finished components, some already riveted together into sub-assemblies, arrived on horse-drawn carts from a factory in the nearby Parisian suburb of Levallois-Perret and were first bolted together, with the bolts being replaced with rivets as construction progressed. No drilling or shaping was done on site: if any part did not fit, it was sent back to the factory for alteration. In all, 18,038 pieces were joined together using 2.5?million rivets.[15]\\r\\nAt first the legs were constructed as cantilevers, but about halfway to the first level, construction was paused in order to create a substantial timber scaffold. This renewed concerns about the structural integrity of the tower, and sensational headlines such as \\"Eiffel Suicide!\\" and \\"Gustave Eiffel Has Gone Mad: He Has Been Confined in an Asylum\\" appeared in the tabloid press.[18] At this stage, a small \\"creeper\\" crane designed to move up the tower was installed in each leg. They made use of the guides for the lifts which were to be fitted in the four legs. The critical stage of joining the legs at the first level was completed by the end of March 1888.[15] Although the metalwork had been prepared with the utmost attention to detail, provision had been made to carry out small adjustments in order to precisely align the legs; hydraulic jacks were fitted to the shoes at the base of each leg, capable of exerting a force of 800 tonnes, and the legs were intentionally constructed at a slightly steeper angle than necessary, being supported by sandboxes on the scaffold. Although construction involved 300 on-site employees,[15] only one person died thanks to Eiffel's stringent safety precautions and the use of movable gangways, guardrails and screens.\\r\\nThe start of the erection of the metalwork.\\r\\n7 December 1887: Construction of the legs with scaffolding.\\r\\n20 March 1888: Completion of the first level.\\r\\n15 May 1888: Start of construction on the second stage.\\r\\n21 August 1888: Completion of the second level.\\r\\n26 December 1888: Construction of the upper stage.\\r\\n15 March 1889: Construction of the cupola.\\r\\nEquipping the tower with adequate and safe passenger lifts was a major concern of the government commission overseeing the Exposition. Although some visitors could be expected to climb to the first level, or even the second, lifts clearly had to be the main means of ascent.[19]\\r\\nConstructing lifts to reach the first level was relatively straightforward: the legs were wide enough at the bottom and so nearly straight that they could contain a straight track, and a contract was given to the French company Roux, Combaluzier & Lepape for two lifts to be fitted in the east and west legs.[20] Roux, Combaluzier & Lepape used a pair of endless chains with rigid, articulated links to which the car was attached. Lead weights on some links of the upper or return sections of the chains counterbalanced most of the car's weight. The car was pushed up from below, not pulled up from above: to prevent the chain buckling, it was enclosed in a conduit. At the bottom of the run, the chains passed around 3.9?m (12?ft 10?in) diameter sprockets. Smaller sprockets at the top guided the chains.[20]\\r\\nInstalling lifts to the second level was more of a challenge because a straight track was impossible. No French company wanted to undertake the work. The European branch of Otis Brothers & Company submitted a proposal but this was rejected: the fair's charter ruled out the use of any foreign material in the construction of the tower. The deadline for bids was extended but still no French companies put themselves forward, and eventually the contract was given to Otis in July 1887.[21] Otis were confident they would eventually be given the contract and had already started creating designs.\\r\\nThe car was divided into two superimposed compartments, each holding 25 passengers, with the lift operator occupying an exterior platform on the first level. Motive power was provided by an inclined hydraulic ram 12.67?m (41?ft 7?in) long and 96.5?cm (38.0?in) in diameter in the tower leg with a stroke of 10.83?m (35?ft 6?in): this moved a carriage carrying six sheaves. Five fixed sheaves were mounted higher up the leg, producing an arrangement similar to a block and tackle but acting in reverse, multiplying the stroke of the piston rather than the force generated. The hydraulic pressure in the driving cylinder was produced by a large open reservoir on the second level. After being exhausted from the cylinder, the water was pumped back up to the reservoir by two pumps in the machinery room at the base of the south leg. This reservoir also provided power to the lifts to the first level.\\r\\nThe original lifts for the journey between the second and third levels were supplied by Lon Edoux. A pair of 81?m (266?ft) hydraulic rams were mounted on the second level, reaching nearly halfway up to the third level. One lift car was mounted on top of these rams: cables ran from the top of this car up to sheaves on the third level and back down to a second car. Each car only travelled half the distance between the second and third levels and passengers were required to change lifts halfway by means of a short gangway. The 10-ton cars each held 65 passengers.[22]\\r\\nThe main structural work was completed at the end of March 1889 and, on 31 March, Eiffel celebrated by leading a group of government officials, accompanied by representatives of the press, to the top of the tower.[12] Because the lifts were not yet in operation, the ascent was made by foot, and took over an hour, with Eiffel stopping frequently to explain various features. Most of the party chose to stop at the lower levels, but a few, including the structural engineer, mile Nouguier, the head of construction, Jean Compagnon, the President of the City Council, and reporters from Le Figaro and Le Monde Illustr, completed the ascent. At 2:35?pm, Eiffel hoisted a large Tricolour to the accompaniment of a 25-gun salute fired at the first level.[23]\\r\\nThere was still work to be done, particularly on the lifts and facilities, and the tower was not opened to the public until nine days after the opening of the exposition on 6 May; even then, the lifts had not been completed. The tower was an instant success with the public, and nearly 30,000 visitors made the 1,710-step climb to the top before the lifts entered service on 26 May.[24] Tickets cost 2 francs for the first level, 3 for the second, and 5 for the top, with half-price admission on Sundays,[25] and by the end of the exhibition there had been 1,896,987 visitors.[3]\\r\\nAfter dark, the tower was lit by hundreds of gas lamps, and a beacon sent out three beams of red, white and blue light. Two searchlights mounted on a circular rail were used to illuminate various buildings of the exposition. The daily opening and closing of the exposition were announced by a cannon at the top.\\r\\nOn the second level, the French newspaper Le Figaro had an office and a printing press, where a special souvenir edition, Le Figaro de la Tour, was made. There was also a patisserie.\\r\\nAt the top, there was a post office where visitors could send letters and postcards as a memento of their visit. Graffitists were also catered for: sheets of paper were mounted on the walls each day for visitors to record their impressions of the tower. Gustave Eiffel described some of the responses as vraiment curieuse (\\"truly curious\\").[26]\\r\\nFamous visitors to the tower included the Prince of Wales, Sarah Bernhardt, \\"Buffalo Bill\\" Cody (his Wild West show was an attraction at the exposition) and Thomas Edison.[24] Eiffel invited Edison to his private apartment at the top of the tower, where Edison presented him with one of his phonographs, a new invention and one of the many highlights of the exposition.[27] Edison signed the guestbook with this message:\\r\\nTo M Eiffel the Engineer the brave builder of so gigantic and original specimen of modern Engineering from one who has the greatest respect and admiration for all Engineers including the Great Engineer the Bon Dieu, Thomas Edison.\\r\\nEiffel had a permit for the tower to stand for 20 years. It was to be dismantled in 1909, when its ownership would revert to the City of Paris. The City had planned to tear it down (part of the original contest rules for designing a tower was that it should be easy to dismantle) but as the tower proved to be valuable for communication purposes, it was allowed to remain after the expiry of the permit.\\r\\nEiffel made use of his apartment at the top of the tower to carry out meteorological observations, and also used the tower to perform experiments on the action of air resistance on falling bodies.[28]\\r\\nFor the 1900 Exposition Universelle, the lifts in the east and west legs were replaced by lifts running as far as the second level constructed by the French firm Fives-Lille. These had a compensating mechanism to keep the floor level as the angle of ascent changed at the first level, and were driven by a similar hydraulic mechanism to the Otis lifts, although this was situated at the base of the tower. Hydraulic pressure was provided by pressurised accumulators located near this mechanism.[21] At the same time the lift in the north pillar was removed and replaced by a staircase to the first level. The layout of both first and second levels was modified, with the space available for visitors on the second level. The original lift in the south pillar was removed 13 years later.\\r\\nOn 19 October 1901, Alberto Santos-Dumont, flying his No.6 airship, won a 100,000-franc prize offered by Henri Deutsch de la Meurthe for the first person to make a flight from St. Cloud to the Eiffel Tower and back in less than half an hour.[29]\\r\\nMany innovations took place at the Eiffel Tower in the early 20th century. In 1910, Father Theodor Wulf measured radiant energy at the top and bottom of the tower. He found more at the top than expected, incidentally discovering what are known today as cosmic rays.[30] Just two years later, on 4 February 1912, Austrian tailor Franz Reichelt died after jumping from the first level of the tower (a height of 57 metres) to demonstrate his parachute design.[31] In 1914, at the outbreak of World War?I, a radio transmitter located in the tower jammed German radio communications, seriously hindering their advance on Paris and contributing to the Allied victory at the First Battle of the Marne.[32] From 1925 to 1934, illuminated signs for Citro?n adorned three of the tower's sides, making it the tallest advertising space in the world at the time.[citation needed] In April 1935, the tower was used to make experimental low-resolution television transmissions, using a shortwave transmitter of 200 watts power. On 17 November, an improved 180-line transmitter was installed.[33]\\r\\nOn two separate but related occasions in 1925, the con artist Victor Lustig \\"sold\\" the tower for scrap metal.[34] A year later, in February 1926, pilot Leon Collet was killed trying to fly under the tower. His aircraft became entangled in an aerial belonging to a wireless station.[35] A bust of Gustave Eiffel by Antoine Bourdelle was unveiled at the base of the north leg on 2 May 1929.[36] In 1930, the tower lost the title of the world's tallest structure when the Chrysler Building in New York City was completed.[37] In 1938, the decorative arcade around the first level was removed.[38]\\r\\nUpon the German occupation of Paris in 1940, the lift cables were cut by the French. The tower was closed to the public during the occupation and the lifts were not repaired until 1946.[39] In 1940, German soldiers had to climb the tower to hoist a swastika-centered Reichskriegsflagge,[40] but the flag was so large it blew away just a few hours later, and was replaced by a smaller one.[41] When visiting Paris, Hitler chose to stay on the ground. When the Allies were nearing Paris in August 1944, Hitler ordered General Dietrich von Choltitz, the military governor of Paris, to demolish the tower along with the rest of the city. Von Choltitz disobeyed the order.[42] On 25 June, before the Germans had been driven out of Paris, the German flag was replaced with a Tricolour by two men from the French Naval Museum, who narrowly beat three men led by Lucien Sarniguet, who had lowered the Tricolour on 13 June 1940 when Paris fell to the Germans.[39]\\r\\nA fire started in the television transmitter on 3 January 1956, damaging the top of the tower. Repairs took a year, and in 1957, the present radio aerial was added to the top.[43] In 1964, the Eiffel Tower was officially declared to be a historical monument by the Minister of Cultural Affairs, Andr Malraux.[44] A year later, an additional lift system was installed in the north pillar.[45]\\r\\nAccording to interviews, in 1967, Montreal Mayor Jean Drapeau negotiated a secret agreement with Charles de Gaulle for the tower to be dismantled and temporarily relocated to Montreal to serve as a landmark and tourist attraction during Expo 67. The plan was allegedly vetoed by the company operating the tower out of fear that the French government could refuse permission for the tower to be restored in its original location.[46]\\r\\nIn 1982, the original lifts between the second and third levels were replaced after 97 years in service. These had been closed to the public between November and March because the water in the hydraulic drive tended to freeze. The new cars operate in pairs, with one counterbalancing the other, and perform the journey in one stage, reducing the journey time from eight minutes to less than two minutes. At the same time, two new emergency staircases were installed, replacing the original spiral staircases. In 1983, the south pillar was fitted with an electrically driven Otis lift to serve the Jules Verne restaurant.[citation needed] The Fives-Lille lifts in the east and west legs, fitted in 1899, were extensively refurbished in 1986. The cars were replaced, and a computer system was installed to completely automate the lifts. The motive power was moved from the water hydraulic system to a new electrically driven oil-filled hydraulic system, and the original water hydraulics were retained solely as a counterbalance system.[45] A service lift was added to the south pillar for moving small loads and maintenance personnel three years later.\\r\\nRobert Moriarty flew a Beechcraft Bonanza under the tower on 31 March 1984.[47] In 1987, A.J. Hackett made one of his first bungee jumps from the top of the Eiffel Tower, using a special cord he had helped develop. Hackett was arrested by the police.[48] On 27 October 1991, Thierry Devaux, along with mountain guide Herv Calvayrac, performed a series of acrobatic figures while bungee jumping from the second floor of the tower.[49] Facing the Champ de Mars, Devaux used an electric winch between figures to go back up to the second floor. When firemen arrived, he stopped after the sixth jump.[citation needed]\\r\\nFor its \\"Countdown to the Year 2000\\" celebration on 31 December 1999, flashing lights and high-powered searchlights were installed on the tower. Fireworks were set off all over it. An exhibition above a cafeteria on the first floor commemorates this event. The searchlights on top of the tower made it a beacon in Paris's night sky, and 20,000 flashing bulbs gave the tower a sparkly appearance for five minutes every hour on the hour.[50]\\r\\nThe lights sparkled blue for several nights to herald the new millennium On 31 December 2000. The sparkly lighting continued for 18 months until July 2001. The sparkling lights were turned on again on 21 June 2003, and the display was planned to last for 10 years before they needed replacing.[51]\\r\\nThe tower received its 200,000,000th guest on 28 November 2002.[52] The tower has operated at its maximum capacity of about 7?million visitors since 2003.[53] In 2004, the Eiffel Tower began hosting a seasonal ice rink on the first level.[54] A glass floor was installed on the first level during the 2014 refurbishment.[55]\\r\\nThe puddled iron (wrought iron) of the Eiffel Tower weighs 7,300 tons,[56] and the addition of lifts, shops and antennae have brought the total weight to approximately 10,100?tons.[57] As a demonstration of the economy of design, if the 7,300?tons of metal in the structure were melted down, it would fill the square base, 125 metres (410?ft) on each side, to a depth of only 6.25?cm (2.46?in) assuming the density of the metal to be 7.8?tons per cubic metre.[58] Additionally, a cubic box surrounding the tower (324?m x 125?m x 125?m) would contain 6,200?tons of air, weighing almost as much as the iron itself. Depending on the ambient temperature, the top of the tower may shift away from the sun by up to 18?cm (7?in) due to thermal expansion of the metal on the side facing the sun.[59]\\r\\nWhen it was built, many were shocked by the tower's daring form. Eiffel was accused of trying to create something artistic with no regard to the principles of engineering. However, Eiffel and his team ÿ experienced bridge builders ÿ understood the importance of wind forces, and knew that if they were going to build the tallest structure in the world, they had to be sure it could withstand them. In an interview with the newspaper Le Temps published on 14 February 1887, Eiffel said:\\r\\nIs it not true that the very conditions which give strength also conform to the hidden rules of harmony?  Now to what phenomenon did I have to give primary concern in designing the Tower? It was wind resistance. Well then! I hold that the curvature of the monument's four outer edges, which is as mathematical calculation dictated it should be  will give a great impression of strength and beauty, for it will reveal to the eyes of the observer the boldness of the design as a whole.[60]\\r\\nHe used graphical methods to determine the strength of the tower and empirical evidence to account for the effects of wind, rather than a mathematical formula. Close examination of the tower reveals a basically exponential shape.[61] All parts of the tower were over-designed to ensure maximum resistance to wind forces. The top half was even assumed to have no gaps in the latticework.[62] In the years since it was completed, engineers have put forward various mathematical hypotheses in an attempt to explain the success of the design. The most recent, devised in 2004 after letters sent by Eiffel to the French Society of Civil Engineers in 1885 were translated into English, is described as a non-linear integral equation based on counteracting the wind pressure on any point of the tower with the tension between the construction elements at that point.[61]\\r\\nThe Eiffel Tower sways by up to 9?centimetres (3.5?in) in the wind.[63]\\r\\nWhen originally built, the first level contained three restaurantsone French, one Russian and one Flemishand an \\"Anglo-American Bar\\". After the exposition closed, the Flemish restaurant was converted to a 250-seat theatre. A promenade 2.6-metre (8?ft 6?in) wide ran around the outside of the first level. At the top, there were laboratories for various experiments, and a small apartment reserved for Gustave Eiffel to entertain guests, which is now open to the public, complete with period decorations and lifelike mannequins of Eiffel and some of his notable guests.[64]\\r\\nIn May 2016, an apartment was created on the first level to accommodate four competition winners during the UEFA Euro 2016 football tournament in Paris in June. The apartment has a kitchen, two bedrooms, a lounge, and views of Paris landmarks including the Seine, the Sacre Coeur, and the Arc de Triomphe.[65]\\r\\nThe arrangement of the lifts has been changed several times during the tower's history. Given the elasticity of the cables and the time taken to align the cars with the landings, each lift, in normal service, takes an average of 8 minutes and 50 seconds to do the round trip, spending an average of 1 minute and 15 seconds at each level. The average journey time between levels is 1 minute. The original hydraulic mechanism is on public display in a small museum at the base of the east and west legs. Because the mechanism requires frequent lubrication and maintenance, public access is often restricted. The rope mechanism of the north tower can be seen as visitors exit the lift.[citation needed]\\r\\nGustave Eiffel engraved on the tower the names of 72 French scientists, engineers and mathematicians in recognition of their contributions to the building of the tower. Eiffel chose this \\"invocation of science\\" because of his concern over the artists' protest. At the beginning of the 20th century, the engravings were painted over, but they were restored in 1986ÿ87 by the Socit Nouvelle d'exploitation de la Tour Eiffel, a company operating the tower.[66]\\r\\nThe tower is painted in three shades: lighter at the top, getting progressively darker towards the bottom to perfectly complement the Parisian sky.[67] It was originally reddish brown; this changed in 1968 to a bronze colour known as \\"Eiffel Tower Brown\\".[68]\\r\\nThe only non-structural elements are the four decorative grill-work arches, added in Sauvestre's sketches, which served to make the tower look more substantial and to make a more impressive entrance to the exposition.[69]\\r\\nOne of the great Hollywood movie clichs is that the view from a Parisian window always includes the tower. In reality, since zoning restrictions limit the height of most buildings in Paris to seven storeys, only a small number of tall buildings have a clear view of the tower.[citation needed]\\r\\nMaintenance of the tower includes applying 60?tons of paint every seven years to prevent it from rusting. The tower has been completely repainted at least 19 times since it was built. Lead paint was still being used as recently as 2001 when the practice was stopped out of concern for the environment.[51]\\r\\nThe nearest Paris Mtro station is Bir-Hakeim and the nearest RER station is Champ de Mars-Tour Eiffel.[70] The tower itself is located at the intersection of the quai Branly and the Pont d'Ina.\\r\\nMore than 250?million people have visited the tower since it was completed in 1889.[3] In 2015, there were 6.91?million visitors.[71] The tower is the most-visited paid monument in the world.[72] An average of 25,000 people ascend the tower every day which can result in long queues.[73] Tickets can be purchased online to avoid the long queues.\\r\\nThe tower has two restaurants: Le 58 Tour Eiffel on the first level, and Le Jules Verne, a gourmet restaurant with its own lift on the second level. This restaurant has one star in the Michelin Red Guide. It is run by the multi-Michelin star chef Alain Ducasse[74] and owes its name to the famous science-fiction writer Jules Verne. Additionally, there is a champagne bar at the top of the Eiffel Tower.\\r\\nAs one of the most iconic landmarks in the world, the Eiffel Tower has been the inspiration for the creation of many replicas and similar towers. An early example is Blackpool Tower in England. The mayor of Blackpool, Sir John Bickerstaffe, was so impressed on seeing the Eiffel Tower at the 1889 exposition that he commissioned a similar tower to be built in his town. It opened in 1894 and is 158.1?metres (518?ft) tall.[75] Tokyo Tower in Japan, built as a communications tower in 1958, was also inspired by the Eiffel Tower.[76]\\r\\nThere are various scale models of the tower in the United States, including a half-scale version at the Paris Las Vegas, Nevada, one in Paris, Texas built in 1993, and two 1:3 scale models at Kings Island, Ohio, and Kings Dominion, Virginia, amusement parks opened in 1972 and 1975 respectively. Two 1:3 scale models can be found in China, one in Durango, Mexico that was donated by the local French community, and several across Europe.[77]\\r\\nIn 2011, the TV show Pricing the Priceless on the National Geographic Channel speculated that a full-size replica of the tower would cost approximately US$480?million to build.[78]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe tower has been used for making radio transmissions since the beginning of the 20th century. Until the 1950s, sets of aerial wires ran from the cupola to anchors on the Avenue de Suffren and Champ de Mars. These were connected to longwave transmitters in small bunkers. In 1909, a permanent underground radio centre was built near the south pillar, which still exists today. On 20 November 1913, the Paris Observatory, using the Eiffel Tower as an aerial, exchanged wireless signals with the United States Naval Observatory, which used an aerial in Arlington, Virginia. The object of the transmissions was to measure the difference in longitude between Paris and Washington, D.C.[79] Today, radio and digital television signals are transmitted from the Eiffel Tower.\\r\\nA television antenna was first installed on the tower in 1957, increasing its height by 18.7?m (61.4?ft). Work carried out in 2000 added a further 5.3?m (17.4?ft), giving the current height of 324?m (1,063?ft).[51] Analogue television signals from the Eiffel Tower ceased on 8 March 2011.\\r\\nThe tower and its image have long been in the public domain.[80] In June 1990 a French court ruled that a special lighting display on the tower in 1989 to mark the tower's 100th anniversary was an \\"original visual creation\\" protected by copyright. The Court of Cassation, France's judicial court of last resort, upheld the ruling in March 1992.[81] The Socit d'Exploitation de la Tour Eiffel (SETE) now considers any illumination of the tower to be a separate work of art that falls under copyright.[82] As a result, the SNTE alleges that it is illegal to publish contemporary photographs of the lit tower at night without permission in France and some other countries for commercial use.[83][84]\\r\\nThe imposition of copyright has been controversial. The Director of Documentation for what was then called the Socit Nouvelle d'exploitation de la Tour Eiffel (SNTE), Stphane Dieu, commented in 2005: \\"It is really just a way to manage commercial use of the image, so that it isn't used in ways [of which] we don't approve\\".[85] SNTE made over ?1?million from copyright fees in 2002.[86] However, it could also be used to restrict the publication of tourist photographs of the tower at night, as well as hindering non-profit and semi-commercial publication of images of the illuminated tower.[80]\\r\\nFrench doctrine and jurisprudence allows pictures incorporating a copyrighted work as long as their presence is incidental or accessory to the subject being represented,[87] a reasoning akin to the de minimis rule. Therefore, SETE may be unable to claim copyright on photographs of Paris which happen to include the lit tower.\\r\\nThe Eiffel Tower was the world's tallest structure when completed in 1889, a distinction it retained until 1929 when the Chrysler Building in New York City was topped out.[88] The tower has lost its standing both as the world's tallest structure and the world's tallest lattice tower but retains its status as the tallest freestanding (non-guyed) structure in France.","input":"Who was involved in building the eiffel tower?"},{"output":"in  Fayette County, Kentucky, 4 miles west of downtown Lexington","context":"Blue Grass Airport (IATA: LEX, ICAO: KLEX, FAA LID: LEX) is a public airport in  Fayette County, Kentucky, 4 miles west of downtown Lexington.

The contest was inaugurated by the American Basketball Association (ABA) at its All-Star Game in 1976 in Denver, the same year the slam dunk was legalized in the NCAA. As a result of the ABAÿNBA merger later that year there would not be another slam dunk contest at the professional level until 1984. The contest has adopted several formats over the years, including, until 2014, the use of fan voting, via text-messaging, to determine the winner of the final round.\\r\\nThe very first slam dunk contest was won by Larry Nance Sr. of the Suns at the 1984 NBA All-Star Game. The current champion of the NBA Dunk Contest is Donovan Mitchell of the Utah Jazz.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nOn January 27, 1976 at McNichols Sports Arena during halftime of the 1976 ABA All Star Game the first-ever Slam Dunk Contest was held, which was won by Julius Erving of the New York Nets over David Thompson of the Denver Nuggets, Artis Gilmore of the Kentucky Colonels, and George Gervin and Larry Kenon of the San Antonio Spurs. There was a format each competitor had to follow in which they must attempt 5 dunks in a row under two minutes. One from a standing position, one from a distance of ten feet away from the basket (which is basically the bottom of the semi circle that surrounds the free throw line in the Key. The next 3 were freelance positions, one coming in from the left side of the basket, one coming in from the right side of the basket and finally from either corner down the baseline to the basket. They were judged on artistic ability, imagination, body flow as well as fan response.\\r\\nArtis Gilmore went first followed by George Gervin, Larry Kenon, David Thompson and finally Julius Erving. George Gervin and David Thompson both missed a dunk during their routines which counted as a zero (scores were not announced to the audience). David Thompson did a 360 degree dunk to finish his routine. All competitors had to perform a dunk from 10 feet, but Julius Erving started marking his steps from the free throw line (15 feet away). He then completed a dunk from the free throw line.\\r\\nThis was a season long event [1] similar to 1977ÿ1978 NBA Horse event. There were 22 competitors throughout the event (nearly one for each team at the time), including future Hall of Famers Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, David Thompson, Alex English, Moses Malone, George Gervin, and Elvin Hayes and took place in multiple venues throughout the season. Darnell Hillman was named the winner that season, beating out the Golden State Warriors' Larry McNeill in the championship round on June 5, 1977 in Portland.[2]\\r\\nThe NBA reintroduced the Slam Dunk Contest in 1984 at its birthplace in Denver. Phoenix's Larry Nance defeated the original Dunk contest winner Julius Erving in the final round. Dominique Wilkins won the contest the following year, but in 1986 his Atlanta Hawks teammate Spud Webb made history when he defeated Wilkins in the final, preventing him from retaining his title. Standing a mere 5 feet 7?inches tall, Webb became the shortest player ever to win the contest, a distinction that he still holds. Chicago's Michael Jordan won back-to-back dunk contest victories in 1987 and in 1988. His victory over Wilkins in 1988 in Chicago finished with a perfect 50 dunk from the free-throw line for his third dunk to win the contest. However, the announcers did note that Wilkins was given abnormally low score for his breathtaking third dunk, a 45, allowing Jordan to win it by 2 with his perfect 50. To this day, the allegations of \\"home cooking\\" still float around surrounding the event (it was held on Jordan's home court; one of the judges was former Chicago Bears star Gale Sayers; and another judge, former NBA star Tom Hawkins, is a Chicago native) and is considered arguably the most controversial of the slam dunk competitions. The following year in Houston, New York's Kenny \\"Sky\\" Walker, a last-minute replacement whose father died just days beforehand, upset Portland's Clyde Drexler, the hometown favorite and Houston native who was seen as the favorite, being that Michael Jordan and Dominique Wilkins were not competing. 1986 champ Spud Webb finished 3rd, while Shelton Jones finished 4th. Though Jordan & Wilkins still played in the All-Star Game, Jordan chose not to compete due to a minor injury, and Wilkins did not compete in the competition due to a hand injury.[1]\\r\\nIn 1990, Dominique Wilkins of the Atlanta Hawks edged out Kenny Smith of the Sacramento Kings to win his second Slam Dunk Contest (first won in 1985 over Michael Jordan). Kenny Smith scored high points for originality with his signature dunk ÿ he started by turning his back to the basket, bouncing the ball backward between his legs and off the backboard, then turning and grabbing it in the air and reverse dunking it. After 1990, interest in the Slam Dunk Contest began to wane and lasted throughout the 1990s. Initially, it was because many players lost interest in competing; some cited concerns of injuries, while others felt that the full repertoire of humanly possible dunks had already been exhausted.[citation needed] With most of the superstars ÿ Jordan, Wilkins, Drexler, etc. ÿ choosing not to participate, lesser-known players began to compete, leading to either watered-down competitions or surprises. Fans[who?] complained that players were beginning to win contests with boring or unoriginal dunks (witness the relatively forgettable early-'90s wins by the likes of Cedric Ceballos and Brent Barry). Harold Miner was a standout in 1993, winning the contest with a reverse power dunk, reaching between his legs and down to his feet in mid-air before sending the ball down. In 1994 and 1997 respectively, Isaiah Rider and Kobe Bryant won the contest. Rider would win with a spectacular, between-the-legs dunk, reminiscent of the Orlando Woolridge effort in the 1984 contest, but wasn't able to repeat in 1995, missing the same dunk on several tries, opening the way for Miner to grab his second slam dunk title in three years. In 1998, the Slam Dunk Contest was replaced with the WNBA-NBA 2Ball Contest. In 1999, there was no All-Star Game due to the NBA lockout.\\r\\nAfter a one-All Star Weekend layoff (the NBA did not have an All Star Weekend during the labor-shortened 1999 season), the NBA decided to bring the Slam Dunk Contest back for the 2000 All-Star Weekend in Oakland, California. It would prove to be one of the most electrifying dunk contests in the league's history,[citation needed] featuring a great showdown between eventual winner Vince Carter of the Toronto Raptors, his cousin and then-teammate Tracy McGrady, and the Houston Rockets' Steve Francis. Carter won after performing a number of very impressive dunks, including two reverse 360 windmills, a honey dip, and a between-the-legs dunk off a bounced alley-oop from McGrady. The next four contests did not feature superstars like Carter and Bryant, and despite innovative efforts by the likes of Desmond Mason and Jason Richardson, the lack of A-list superstars willing to participate hurt the appeal of the contest.\\r\\nIn 2005, the Slam Dunk Contest returned to its birthplace in Denver. With the spectacular dunks of prior contests, there was buzz[citation needed] that the dunk competition could regain the popularity it had in the 1980s. The Phoenix Suns' Amar'e Stoudemire alley-ooping 360 off a soccer-style header from teammate Steve Nash; J. R. Smith putting it around his back and dunking, and the new champion, Josh Smith alley-ooping over Kenyon Martin all wowed the crowd with their maneuvers. With the change in the rules requiring an additional teammate starting in the second round, they proved there were indeed many ways to dunk a basketball that had not been done before. Amar'e Stoudemire received rave reviews, as did Smith when he did a tribute dunk to Dominique Wilkins while donning Wilkins' jersey.\\r\\nAgain in 2006, the Dunk Contest in Houston revitalized the interests of audiences as 5'9\\" Nate Robinson of the New York Knicks took the title with a great dunk-off. One of his most exciting dunks was a high-flying dunk over former Slam Dunk Contest winner, 5'7\\" Spud Webb. The 2006 Slam Dunk Contest was also the first Dunk Contest in history to have a \\"Dunk Off\\", the equivalent to a Dunk Contest overtime, between Knicks point guard Nate Robinson and shooting guard Andre Iguodala of the Philadelphia 76ers. Many fans argue that Iguodala should have won the contest, as it took Robinson fourteen attempts before finally completing his dunk. Iguodala pulled off a dunk where he started out of bounds from the right side of the baseline while teammate Allen Iverson bounced the ball off the back of the right side of the backboard. Iguodala caught the ball in mid-air behind the backboard, spun around to the other side while ducking his head (to avoid colliding with the backboard) and dunked it with his right hand.\\r\\nOn February 17, 2007, the contest was held in Las Vegas. Judges for the event were all past winners: Michael Jordan, Dominique Wilkins, Kobe Bryant, Julius Erving, and Vince Carter. The title was taken by the Boston Celtics' Gerald Green, who, among other dunks, jumped over reigning champ Nate Robinson while covering his face ÿ a homage to 1991 winner, Dee Brown, whose jersey Green had worn. He also scored a perfect fifty with his last slam, a windmill over a table. Other noteworthy dunks include a dunk by Orlando Magic center Dwight Howard, who, while making his dunk, stuck a sticker with his smiling face on the backboard a reported 12'6\\" from the ground, two and a half feet beyond the regulation NBA rim.[2]\\r\\nOn February 16, 2008, the contest was held in New Orleans. Judges for the event included Darryl Dawkins, Dominique Wilkins, Karl Malone, Julius Erving, and Magic Johnson. The title was taken by Orlando Magic center Dwight Howard. Howard's most noteworthy dunk came during the first round, his second dunk overall, when he took off his jersey to reveal a Superman shirt and cape.[3] With teammate Jameer Nelson's assistance he would make a leaping dunk from just in front of the free-throw line after a running start, throwing the ball through the rim from a few feet away.[4] Other noteworthy dunks included the first round slam by Jamario Moon while the previous year's winner, Gerald Green, relied heavily on theatrics by blowing out a cupcake with a birthday candle on the rim before dunking (a jam he termed \\"The Birthday Cake\\"). For the first time ever, fan voting determined the outcome of the final round of the contest; Howard beat Green for the trophy by claiming 78% of the fans' votes.\\r\\nNate Robinson won the 2009 contest on February 14 in Phoenix, Arizona. The 5'9\\" guard dressed all in green as \\"Krypto-Nate\\" (a portmanteau of 'Nate' and Kryptonite) and jumped over 6'11\\" Dwight Howard characterized as Superman. He defeated Howard in the finals by a fan vote of 52ÿ48 percent. J. R. Smith and Rudy Fernndez also competed.\\r\\nNate Robinson won the 2010 contest on February 13 in Dallas, becoming the first 3-time Slam Dunk champion. Robinson took on Shannon Brown of the Los Angeles Lakers, Gerald Wallace of the Charlotte Bobcats, and DeMar DeRozan of the Toronto Raptors. DeRozan earned his spot in the competition by defeating Los Angeles Clippers guard Eric Gordon in the inaugural Sprite Slam Dunk-In held the night before the actual dunk contest. Robinson and DeRozan advanced to the final round, where Robinson's double-pump reverse dunk helped seal a 51% to 49% victory.\\r\\nBlake Griffin won the 2011 slam dunk contest by jumping and dunking over the hood of a Kia sedan on February 19 in Los Angeles. JaVale McGee of the Washington Wizards, DeMar DeRozan of the Toronto Raptors, and Serge Ibaka of the Oklahoma City Thunder all competed against Griffin. Griffin and McGee advanced to the final round, where Griffin stole the show, winning the contest with 68% of the vote.\\r\\nJeremy Evans won the 2012 Sprite Slam Dunk Contest by performing a dunk over Kevin Hart on February 25 in Orlando, Florida with 29% of the votes. Joining Evans were Chase Budinger of the Houston Rockets, Paul George of the Indiana Pacers, and Derrick Williams of the Minnesota Timberwolves. While George awed the crowd with a dunk with the lights turned off, Evans had perhaps the dunk of the contest by jumping teammate Gordon Hayward, catching two balls from Hayward, and dunking it.\\r\\nTerrence Ross won the 2013 Sprite Slam Dunk Contest after a tomahawk dunk in tribute to former Toronto Raptors player Vince Carter, as well as a between-the-legs dunk performed while jumping over a ball boy. Ross took on Jeremy Evans of the Utah Jazz, Eric Bledsoe of the Los Angeles Clippers, Kenneth Faried of the Denver Nuggets, Gerald Green of the Indiana Pacers, and James White of the New York Knicks. Evans advanced to the final round to defend his title of slam dunk champion, but was thwarted by Ross. Ross carried the momentum of his near-perfect first round, in which he scored a 99 out of a possible 100, with a stellar final round. Ross won the competition decisively, earning 58% of the vote.\\r\\nTeam East, composed of dunkers Paul George, defending champion Terrence Ross, and John Wall won the 2014 Sprite Slam Dunk Contest in commanding fashion. Under the new team format, they dominated the Freestyle Round, capping it off with a pass off the backboard from Ross to Wall, then off the shot clock from Wall to George for the finish. In the Battle Round, Ross defeated Damian Lillard with a through the legs dunk from rapper Drake, George took down Harrison Barnes with a 360-degree, through the legs finish, and Wall defeated Ben McLemore by jumping over the Wizards' mascot G-Man and throwing down a reverse on the first try. Though Team East are the official winners, Wall was voted by fans as the Dunker of the Night.\\r\\nTo the delight of NBA fans, the 2015 contest was changed back to its original format, as the Freestyle Round as well as the teams were taken out. The 4 dunkers competing were all up-and-coming players: The Bucks' Giannis Antetokounmpo, the Timberwolves' Zach LaVine, the Magic's Victor Oladipo, and the Nets' Mason Plumlee. LaVine took home the hardware with dunks that included a between-the-legs reverse, a behind-the-back slam in which he caught it in midair, a between-the-legs lefthanded dunk, and finished with a between-the-legs dunk as he caught it off the pole behind the backboard. Similar to Howard with Superman, LaVine did his first dunk with a cultural homage, wearing Michael Jordan's jersey from Space Jam.[5]\\r\\nMany people, including 2010 winner Nate Robinson, thought that the 2011 contest was rigged to allow up-and-coming star Blake Griffin to win and that runner-up JaVale McGee deserved to win.[6][7][8][9] It was even disputed if Griffin even legitimately qualified for the finals since his final dunk got a perfect score but was basically a copy of DeMar DeRozan's first dunk with a lower degree of difficulty. Ben Maller of Fox Sports Radio reported that a media advisory sent out by the NBA over an hour before the 2011 Slam Dunk Contest began already referring to Blake Griffin as the winner.[10]It is widely accepted in various respected internet chatboxes that Griffin, Kia, and the NBA colluded to fix the contest.[11][12]\\r\\nThere have been 25 players crowned the best dunkers in the NBA. Nate Robinson is the only player to win the event three times. Five are two-time winners: Dominique Wilkins, Michael Jordan, Harold Miner, Jason Richardson and Zach LaVine.\\r\\nSlam Dunk Contest champions by franchise\\r\\nBold denotes winner(s) of that year.\\r\\n1984\\r\\n1985\\r\\naErving and Nance received first-round byes as they were the finalists from the previous year.\\r\\n1986\\r\\naWilkins received a first-round bye as he was the previous year's champion.\\r\\nbStansbury defeated Kersey in a dunk-off to break their tie.\\r\\n1987\\r\\n1988\\r\\nRon Harper (Cleveland) was to participate but withdrew due to injury.\\r\\n1989\\r\\na Drexler did not attempt his final dunk, as victory was out of reach.\\r\\n1990\\r\\n1991\\r\\nBeginning with this year, final round competitors were allowed three dunks, with the two highest scores comprising the total.\\r\\n1992\\r\\na Johnson did not attempt his final dunk, as victory was out of reach.\\r\\n1993\\r\\nThe two highest score dunks of three in each round constituted the competitor's score.\\r\\nShawn Kemp (Seattle) was scheduled to compete but was injured.\\r\\n1994\\r\\nIn the first round, each competitor was allowed 90 seconds to do as many dunks as he chooses with one overall score.

One is that players who often compete in these contests are seen as dunkers only (with the obvious exceptions of Michael Jordan, Kobe Bryant, and Julius Erving), which is why notable high flying athletes like Shawn Marion and LeBron James have sometimes refused to participate.[citation needed] High-profile players such as Dwyane Wade and Charles Barkley have also declined to participate citing it as an unnecessary risk to injury.[citation needed] In the 2000 NBA Slam Dunk Contest, Tracy McGrady injured his wrist while performing a dunk.[citation needed] Also in the 1995 NBA Slam Dunk Contest, Tony Dumas hurt his knee while performing his \\"Texas Twister\\" dunk.[citation needed] Although a longtime critic, LeBron James said he would perform in the 2010 Slam Dunk Contest. This decision was made after watching the 2009 dunk contest when Dwight Howard and Nate Robinson went at it. However, he withdrew his statement once the All-Star Weekend came around.[citation needed]\\r\\nThe 2006 NBA Slam Dunk Competition between Nate Robinson and Andre Iguodala drew much criticism because players were not penalized for missing a dunk attempt. Consequently, Robinson attempted a single dunk 14 times before completing it.[14] Prior to the 2007 competition, the NBA changed a few rules to prevent excessive dunk attempts. Each participant has two minutes to complete their dunk. At the end of the two minutes allotted, they then have their number of dunk attempts limited to two.","input":"Who won the 2016 nba slam dunk contest?"},{"output":"sturgeon","context":"","input":"What is the largest fish in lake erie?"},{"output":"?2.50 per line","context":"EuroMillions is a transnational lottery requiring 7 correct numbers to win the jackpot [1].

Though physiographically a part of the continent of North America, Greenland has been politically and culturally associated with Europe (specifically Norway and Denmark, the colonial powers, as well as the nearby island of Iceland) for more than a millennium.[9] The majority of its residents are Inuit, whose ancestors began migrating from the Canadian mainland in the 13th century, gradually settling across the island.\\r\\nGreenland is the world's largest island. Australia and Antarctica, although larger, are generally considered to be continental landmasses rather than islands.[10] Three-quarters of Greenland is covered by the only permanent ice sheet outside Antarctica. With a population of about 56,480[6] (2013), it is the least densely populated territory in the world.[11] About a third of the population live in Nuuk, the capital and largest city. The Arctic Umiaq Line ferry acts as a lifeline for western Greenland, connecting the various cities and settlements.\\r\\nGreenland has been inhabited off and on for at least the last 4,500 years by Arctic peoples whose forebears migrated there from what is now Canada.[12][13] Norsemen settled the uninhabited southern part of Greenland beginning in the 10th century, having previously settled Iceland to escape persecution from the King of Norway and his central government. These Norsemen would later set sail from Greenland and Iceland, with Leif Erikson becoming the first known European to reach North America nearly 500 years before Columbus reached the Caribbean islands. Inuit peoples arrived in the 13th century. Though under continuous influence of Norway and Norwegians, Greenland was not formally under the Norwegian crown until 1262. The Norse colonies disappeared in the late 15th?century when Norway was hit by the Black Death and entered a severe decline. Soon after their demise, beginning in 1499, the Portuguese briefly explored and claimed the island, naming it Terra do Lavrador (later applied to Labrador in Canada).[14]\\r\\nIn the early 18th century, Scandinavian explorers reached Greenland again. To strengthen trading and power, Denmark-Norway affirmed sovereignty over the island. Because of Norway's weak status, it lost sovereignty over Greenland in 1814 when the union was dissolved. Greenland became a Danish colony in 1814, and was made a part of the Danish Realm in 1953 under the Constitution of Denmark.\\r\\nIn 1973, Greenland joined the European Economic Community with Denmark. However, in a referendum in 1982, a majority of the population voted for Greenland to withdraw from the EEC, which was effected in 1985. Greenland contains the world's largest and most northernly national park, Northeast Greenland National Park (Kalaallit Nunaanni nuna eqqissisimatitaq). Established in 1974 and expanded to its present size in 1988, it protects 972,001 square kilometres (375,292?sq?mi) of the interior and northeastern coast of Greenland and is bigger than all but twenty-nine countries in the world. Greenland is divided into five municipalities ÿ Sermersooq, Kujalleq, Qeqertalik, Qeqqata, and Avannaata.[15]\\r\\nIn 1979, Denmark granted home rule to Greenland, and in 2008, Greenlanders voted in favor of the Self-Government Act, which transferred more power from the Danish government to the local Greenlandic government. Under the new structure, in effect since 21 June 2009,[16] Greenland can gradually assume responsibility for policing, judicial system, company law, accounting, and auditing; mineral resource activities; aviation; law of legal capacity, family law and succession law; aliens and border controls; the working environment; and financial regulation and supervision, while the Danish government retains control of foreign affairs and defence. It also retains control of monetary policy, providing an initial annual subsidy of DKK 3.4?billion, which is planned to diminish gradually over time. Greenland expects to grow its economy based on increased income from the extraction of natural resources. The capital, Nuuk, held the 2016 Arctic Winter Games. At 70%, Greenland has one of the highest shares of renewable energy in the world, mostly coming from hydropower.[17][additional citation(s) needed]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe early Viking settlers named the island as Greenland. In the Icelandic sagas, the Norwegian-born Icelander Erik the Red was said to be exiled from Iceland for manslaughter. Along with his extended family and his thralls (i.e. slaves or serfs), he set out in ships to explore an icy land known to lie to the northwest. After finding a habitable area and settling there, he named it Gr?nland (translated as \\"Greenland\\"), supposedly in the hope that the pleasant name would attract settlers.[18][19][20] The Saga of Erik the Red states: \\"In the summer, Erik left to settle in the country he had found, which he called Greenland, as he said people would be attracted there if it had a favorable name.\\"[21]\\r\\nThe name of the country in the indigenous Greenlandic language is Kalaallit Nunaat (\\"land of the Kalaallit\\").[22] The Kalaallit are the indigenous Greenlandic Inuit people who inhabit the country's western region.\\r\\nIn prehistoric times, Greenland was home to several successive Paleo-Eskimo cultures known today primarily through archaeological finds. The earliest entry of the Paleo-Eskimo into Greenland is thought to have occurred about 2500?BC. From around 2500?BC to 800?BC, southern and western Greenland were inhabited by the Saqqaq culture. Most finds of Saqqaq-period archaeological remains have been around Disko Bay, including the site of Saqqaq, after which the culture is named.[23][24]\\r\\nFrom 2400?BC to 1300?BC, the Independence I culture existed in northern Greenland. It was a part of the Arctic small tool tradition.[25][26][27] Towns, including Deltaterrasserne, started to appear.\\r\\nAround 800?BC, the Saqqaq culture disappeared and the Early Dorset culture emerged in western Greenland and the Independence II culture in northern Greenland.[28] The Dorset culture was the first culture to extend throughout the Greenlandic coastal areas, both on the west and east coasts. It lasted until the total onset of the Thule culture in 1500?AD. The Dorset culture population lived primarily from hunting of whales and caribou.[29][30][31][32]\\r\\nFrom 986, Greenland's west coast was settled by Icelanders and Norwegians, through a contingent of 14 boats led by Erik the Red. They formed three settlementsknown as the Eastern Settlement, the Western Settlement and the Middle Settlementon fjords near the southwestern-most tip of the island.[9][33] They shared the island with the late Dorset culture inhabitants who occupied the northern and western parts, and later with the Thule culture that entered from the north. Norse Greenlanders submitted to Norwegian rule in the 13th century under the Norwegian Empire. Later the Kingdom of Norway entered into a personal union with Denmark in 1380, and from 1397 was a part of the Kalmar Union.[34]\\r\\nErik the Red's recruitment of others to colonize Greenland has been characterized recently as a land scam, the scam (and the name) portraying Greenland as better farm land than in Iceland.[35]\\r\\nThe Norse settlements, such as Brattahle, thrived for centuries but disappeared sometime in the 15th century, perhaps at the onset of the Little Ice Age.[36] Apart from some runic inscriptions, no contemporary records or historiography survives from the Norse settlements. Medieval Norwegian sagas and historical works mention Greenland's economy as well as the bishops of Gardar and the collection of tithes. A chapter in the Konungs skuggsj (The King's Mirror) describes Norse Greenland's exports and imports as well as grain cultivation.\\r\\nIcelandic saga accounts of life in Greenland were composed in the 13th century and later, and do not constitute primary sources for the history of early Norse Greenland.[20] Modern understanding therefore mostly depends on the physical data from archeological sites. Interpretation of ice core and clam shell data suggests that between 800 and 1300, the regions around the fjords of southern Greenland experienced a relatively mild climate several degrees Celsius higher than usual in the North Atlantic,[37] with trees and herbaceous plants growing, and livestock being farmed. Barley was grown as a crop up to the 70th?parallel.[38] What is verifiable is that the ice cores indicate Greenland has had dramatic temperature shifts many times over the past 100,000 years.[39] Similarly the Icelandic Book of Settlements records famines during the winters, in which \\"the old and helpless were killed and thrown over cliffs\\".[37]\\r\\nThese Icelandic settlements vanished during the 14th and early 15th?centuries.[40] The demise of the Western Settlement coincides with a decrease in summer and winter temperatures. A study of North Atlantic seasonal temperature variability during the Little Ice Age showed a significant decrease in maximum summer temperatures beginning in the late 13th century to early 14th centuryas much as 6 to 8?C (11 to 14?F) lower than modern summer temperatures.[41] The study also found that the lowest winter temperatures of the last 2000 years occurred in the late 14th century and early 15th century. The Eastern Settlement was likely abandoned in the early to mid-15th century, during this cold period.\\r\\nTheories drawn from archeological excavations at Herjolfsnes in the 1920s, suggest that the condition of human bones from this period indicates that the Norse population was malnourished, maybe due to soil erosion resulting from the Norsemen's destruction of natural vegetation in the course of farming, turf-cutting, and wood-cutting. Malnutrition may also have resulted from widespread deaths due to pandemic plague;[42] the decline in temperatures during the Little Ice Age; and armed conflicts with the Skr?lings (Norse word for Inuit, meaning \\"wretches\\"[36]). In 1379, the Inuit attacked the Eastern Settlement, killed 18 men and captured two boys and a woman.[36] Recent archeological studies somewhat challenge the general assumption that the Norse colonisation had a dramatic negative environmental effect on the vegetation. Data support traces of a possible Norse soil amendment strategy.[43] More recent evidence suggests that the Norse, who never numbered more than about 2,500, gradually abandoned the Greenland settlements over the 1400s as walrus ivory,[44] the most valuable export from Greenland, decreased in price due to competition with other sources of higher-quality ivory, and that there was actually little evidence of starvation or difficulties.[45]\\r\\nOther theories about the disappearance of the Norse settlement have been proposed;\\r\\nThe Thule people are the ancestors of the current Greenlandic population. No genes from the Paleo-Eskimos have been found in the present population of Greenland.[47] The Thule Culture migrated eastward from what is now known as Alaska around 1000, reaching Greenland around 1300. The Thule culture was the first to introduce to Greenland such technological innovations as dog sleds and toggling harpoons.\\r\\nIn 1500, King Manuel?I of Portugal sent Gaspar Corte-Real to Greenland in search of a Northwest Passage to Asia which, according to the Treaty of Tordesillas, was part of Portugal's sphere of influence. In 1501, Corte-Real returned with his brother, Miguel Corte-Real. Finding the sea frozen, they headed south and arrived in Labrador and Newfoundland. Upon the brothers' return to Portugal, the cartographic information supplied by Corte-Real was incorporated into a new map of the world which was presented to Ercole I d'Este, Duke of Ferrara, by Alberto Cantino in 1502. The Cantino planisphere, made in Lisbon, accurately depicts the southern coastline of Greenland.[48]\\r\\nIn 1605ÿ1607, King Christian IV of Denmark sent a series of expeditions to Greenland and Arctic waterways to locate the lost eastern Norse settlement and assert Danish sovereignty over Greenland. The expeditions were mostly unsuccessful, partly due to leaders who lacked experience with the difficult arctic ice and weather conditions, and partly because the expedition leaders were given instructions to search for the Eastern Settlement on the east coast of Greenland just north of Cape Farewell, which is almost inaccessible due to southward drifting ice. The pilot on all three trips was English explorer James Hall.\\r\\nAfter the Norse settlements died off, Greenland came under the de?facto control of various Inuit groups, but the Danish government never forgot or relinquished the claims to Greenland that it had inherited from the Norse. When it re-established contact with Greenland in the early 18th?century, Denmark asserted its sovereignty over the island. In 1721, a joint mercantile and clerical expedition led by Danish-Norwegian missionary Hans Egede was sent to Greenland, not knowing whether a Norse civilization remained there. This expedition is part of the Dano-Norwegian colonization of the Americas. After 15?years in Greenland, Hans Egede left his son Paul Egede in charge of the mission there and returned to Denmark, where he established a Greenland Seminary. This new colony was centred at Godth?b (\\"Good Hope\\") on the southwest coast. Gradually, Greenland was opened up to Danish merchants, and closed to those from other countries.\\r\\nWhen the union between the crowns of Denmark and Norway was dissolved in 1814, the Treaty of Kiel severed Norway's former colonies and left them under the control of the Danish monarch. Norway occupied then-uninhabited eastern Greenland as Erik the Red's Land in July 1931, claiming that it constituted terra nullius. Norway and Denmark agreed to submit the matter in 1933 to the Permanent Court of International Justice, which decided against Norway.[49]\\r\\nGreenland's connection to Denmark was severed on 9 April 1940, early in World War?II, after Denmark was occupied by Nazi Germany. On 8 April 1941, the United States occupied Greenland to defend it against a possible invasion by Germany.[50] The United States occupation of Greenland continued until 1945. Greenland was able to buy goods from the United States and Canada by selling cryolite from the mine at Ivittuut. The major air bases were Bluie West-1 at Narsarsuaq and Bluie West-8 at S?ndre Str?mfjord (Kangerlussuaq), both of which are still used as Greenland's major international airports. Bluie was the military code name for Greenland.\\r\\nDuring this war, the system of government changed: Governor Eske Brun ruled the island under a law of 1925 that allowed governors to take control under extreme circumstances; Governor Aksel Svane was transferred to the United States to lead the commission to supply Greenland. The Danish Sirius Patrol guarded the northeastern shores of Greenland in 1942 using dogsleds. They detected several German weather stations and alerted American troops, who destroyed the facilities. After the collapse of the Third Reich, Albert Speer briefly considered escaping in a small aeroplane to hide out in Greenland, but changed his mind and decided to surrender to the United States Armed Forces.[51]\\r\\nGreenland had been a protected and very isolated society until 1940. The Danish government had maintained a strict monopoly of Greenlandic trade, allowing only small scale troaking with Scottish whalers. In wartime Greenland developed a sense of self-reliance through self-government and independent communication with the outside world. Despite this change, in 1946 a commission including the highest Greenlandic council, the Landsr?dene, recommended patience and no radical reform of the system. Two years later, the first step towards a change of government was initiated when a grand commission was established. A final report (G-50) was presented in 1950: Greenland was to be a modern welfare state with Denmark as sponsor and example. In 1953 Greenland was made an equal part of the Danish Kingdom. Home rule was granted in 1979.\\r\\nFollowing World War II, the United States developed a geopolitical interest in Greenland, and in 1946 the United States offered to buy the island from Denmark for $100,000,000. Denmark refused to sell it.[52][53] In the 21st century, the United States, according to Wikileaks, remains highly interested in investing in the resource base of Greenland and in tapping hydrocarbons off the Greenlandic coast.[54][55]\\r\\nIn 1950 Denmark agreed to allow the US to reestablish Thule Air Base in Greenland; it was greatly expanded between 1951 and 1953 as part of a unified NATO Cold War defense strategy. The local population of three nearby villages was moved more than 100?kilometres (62?mi) away in the winter. The United States tried to construct a subterranean network of secret nuclear missile launch sites in the Greenlandic ice cap, named Project Iceworm. It managed this project from Camp Century from 1960 to 1966 before abandoning it as unworkable. The Danish government did not become aware of the program's mission until 1997, when they discovered it while looking for records related to the crash of a nuclear-equipped B-52?bomber at Thule in 1968.\\r\\nWith the 1953 Danish constitution, Greenland's colonial status ended as the island was incorporated into the Danish realm as an amt (county). Danish citizenship was extended to Greenlanders. Danish policies toward Greenland consisted of a strategy of cultural assimilationor de-Greenlandification. During this period, the Danish government promoted the exclusive use of the Danish language in official matters, and required Greenlanders to go to Denmark for their post-secondary education. Many Greenlandic children grew up in boarding schools in southern Denmark, and a number lost their cultural ties to Greenland. While the policies \\"succeeded\\" in the sense of shifting Greenlanders from being primarily subsistence hunters into being urbanized wage earners, the Greenlandic elite began to reassert a Greenlandic cultural identity. A movement developed in favour of independence, reaching its peak in the 1970s.[56] As a consequence of political complications in relation to Denmark's entry into the European Common Market in 1972, Denmark began to seek a different status for Greenland, resulting in the Home Rule Act of 1979.\\r\\nThis gave Greenland limited autonomy with its own legislature taking control of some internal policies, while the Parliament of Denmark maintained full control of external policies, security, and natural resources. The law came into effect on 1 May 1979. The Queen of Denmark, Margrethe?II, remains Greenland's Head of state. In 1985, Greenland left the European Economic Community (EEC) upon achieving self-rule, as it did not agree with the EEC's commercial fishing regulations and an EEC ban on seal skin products.[57] Greenland voters approved a referendum on greater autonomy on 25 November 2008.[58][59] According to one study, the 2008 vote created what \\"can be seen as a system between home rule and full independence.\\"[60]\\r\\nOn 21 June 2009, Greenland gained self-rule with provisions for assuming responsibility for self-government of judicial affairs, policing, and natural resources. Also, Greenlanders were recognized as a separate people under international law. (One country, two systems)[61] Denmark maintains control of foreign affairs and defence matters. Denmark upholds the annual block grant of 3.2?billion Danish kroner, but as Greenland begins to collect revenues of its natural resources, the grant will gradually be diminished. This is generally considered to be a step toward eventual full independence from Denmark.[62] Greenlandic was declared the sole official language of Greenland at the historic ceremony.[3][8][63][64][65]\\r\\nGreenland is the world's largest non-continental island[66] and the third largest country in North America.[67] It is between latitudes 59 and 83N, and longitudes 11 and 74W. The Atlantic Ocean borders Greenland's southeast; the Greenland Sea is to the east; the Arctic Ocean is to the north; and Baffin Bay is to the west. The nearest countries are Canada, to the west and southwest across Baffin Bay, and Iceland, east of Greenland in the Atlantic Ocean. Greenland also contains the world's largest national park, and it is the largest dependent territory by area in the world, as well as the fourth largest country subdivision in the world, after Sakha Republic in Russia, Australia's state of Western Australia, and Russia's Krasnoyarsk Krai, and the largest in North America.\\r\\nThe average daily temperature of Nuuk, Greenland varies over the seasons from ?8 to 7?C (18 to 45?F). The total area of Greenland is 2,166,086?km2 (836,330?sq?mi) (including other offshore minor islands), of which the Greenland ice sheet covers 1,755,637?km2 (677,855?sq?mi) (81%) and has a volume of approximately 2,850,000?km3 (680,000?cu?mi).[68] The highest point on Greenland is Gunnbj?rn Fjeld at 3,700?m (12,139?ft) of the Watkins Range (East Greenland mountain range). The majority of Greenland, however, is less than 1,500?m (4,921?ft) in elevation.\\r\\nThe weight of the ice sheet has depressed the central land area to form a basin lying more than 300?m (984?ft) below sea level,[69][70] while elevations rise suddenly and steeply near the coast.[71] The ice flows generally to the coast from the centre of the island. A survey led by French scientist Paul-Emile Victor in 1951 concluded that, under the ice sheet, Greenland is composed of three large islands.[72] This is disputed, but if it is so, they would be separated by narrow straits, reaching the sea at Ilulissat Icefjord, at Greenland's Grand Canyon and south of Nordostrundingen.\\r\\nAll towns and settlements of Greenland are situated along the ice-free coast, with the population being concentrated along the west coast. The northeastern part of Greenland is not part of any municipality, but it is the site of the world's largest national park, Northeast Greenland National Park.[73]\\r\\nAt least four scientific expedition stations and camps had been established on the ice sheet in the ice-covered central part of Greenland (indicated as pale blue in the map to the right): Eismitte, North Ice, North GRIP Camp and The Raven Skiway. There is a year-round station Summit Camp on the ice sheet, established in 1989. The radio station J?rgen Br?nlund Fjord was, until 1950, the northernmost permanent outpost in the world.\\r\\nThe extreme north of Greenland, Peary Land, is not covered by an ice sheet, because the air there is too dry to produce snow, which is essential in the production and maintenance of an ice sheet. If the Greenland ice sheet were to melt away completely, the world's sea level would rise by more than 7?m (23?ft).[74]\\r\\nBetween 1989 and 1993, US and European climate researchers drilled into the summit of Greenland's ice sheet, obtaining a pair of 3?km (1.9?mi) long ice cores. Analysis of the layering and chemical composition of the cores has provided a revolutionary new record of climate change in the Northern Hemisphere going back about 100,000?years and illustrated that the world's weather and temperature have often shifted rapidly from one seemingly stable state to another, with worldwide consequences.[75] The glaciers of Greenland are also contributing to a rise in the global sea level faster than was previously believed.[76] Between 1991 and 2004, monitoring of the weather at one location (Swiss Camp) showed that the average winter temperature had risen almost 6?C (11?F).[77] Other research has shown that higher snowfalls from the North Atlantic oscillation caused the interior of the ice cap to thicken by an average of 6?cm or 2.36?in/y between 1994 and 2005.[78] However, a recent study suggests a much warmer planet in relatively recent geological times:[79]\\r\\nScientists who probed 2?km (1.2?mi) through a Greenland glacier to recover the oldest plant DNA on record said that the planet was far warmer hundreds of thousands of years ago than is generally believed. DNA of trees, plants, spiders and insects including butterflies from beneath the southern Greenland glacier was estimated to date to 450,000 to 900,000?years ago, according to the remnants retrieved from this long-vanished boreal forest. That view contrasts sharply with the prevailing one that a lush forest of this kind could not have existed in Greenland any later than 2.4?million years ago. These DNA samples suggest that the temperature probably reached 10?C (50?F) in the summer and ?17?C (1.4?F) in the winter. They also indicate that during the last interglacial period, 130,000ÿ116,000?years ago, when local temperatures were on average 5?C (9?F) higher than now, the glaciers on Greenland did not completely melt away.\\r\\nIn 2003, a small island, 35 by 15 metres (115 by 49 feet) in length and width, was discovered by arctic explorer Dennis Schmitt and his team at the coordinates of 83-42. Whether this island is permanent is not confirmed as of yet. If it is, it is the northernmost permanent known land on Earth.\\r\\nIn 2007 the existence of a new island was announced. Named \\"Uunartoq Qeqertaq\\" (English: Warming Island), this island has always been present off the coast of Greenland, but was covered by a glacier. This glacier was discovered in 2002 to be shrinking rapidly, and by 2007 had completely melted away, leaving the exposed island.[80] The island was named Place of the Year by the Oxford Atlas of the World in 2007.[81] Ben Keene, the atlas's editor, commented: \\"In the last two or three decades, global warming has reduced the size of glaciers throughout the Arctic and earlier this year, news sources confirmed what climate scientists already knew: water, not rock, lay beneath this ice bridge on the east coast of Greenland. More islets are likely to appear as the sheet of frozen water covering the world's largest island continues to melt\\".[82]\\r\\nSome controversy surrounds the history of the island, specifically over whether the island might have been revealed during a brief warm period in Greenland during the mid-20th?century.[83]\\r\\nThe 1310 m-high Qaqugdluit-mountain-land on the south-side of the peninsula Nugssuaq, situated 50 kilometres (31 miles) west of the Greenland inland ice at 700750.92\\"N 514430.52\\"W, is exemplary of the numerous mountain areas of West-Greenland. Up to the year 1979 (Stage 0) it shows Historical to Holocene, i.e. Postglacial glacier stages dating back at least 7000 and at most about 10 000 years.[84][85] In 1979 the glacier tongues came to an end ÿ according to the extent and height of the glacier nourishing area ÿ between 660 and 140 metres (2,170 and 460 feet) above sea level. The pertinent climatic glacier snowline (ELA) ran at about 800 metres (2,600 feet) in height. The snowline of the oldest (VII) of the three Holocene glacier stages (VÿVII) ran about 230 metres (750 feet) deeper, i.e. at about 570 metres (1,870 feet) in height.[86] The four youngest glacier stages (IV-I) are of a Historical age. They have to be classified as belonging to the global glacier advances in the years 1811 to 1850 and 1880 to 1900 (\\"Little Ice Age\\"), 1910 to 1930, 1948 and 1953.[85] Their snowlines rose step by step up to the level of 1979. The current snowline (Stage 0) runs nearly unchanged. During the oldest Postglacial Stage VII an ice-stream-network from valley glaciers joining each other, has completely covered the landscape. Its nourishing areas consisted of high-lying plateau-glaciers and local ice caps. Due to the uplift of the snowline about that about 230 metres (750 feet) ÿ what corresponds to a warming about 1.5?C (2.7?F), since 1979 there exists a plateau-glaciation with small glacier tongues hanging down on the margins that nearly did not reach the main valley bottoms any more.[86]\\r\\nThere are approximately 700 known species of insects in Greenland, which is low compared with other countries (over one million species have been described worldwide). The sea is rich in fish and invertebrates, especially in the milder West Greenland Current, and a large part of the Greenland fauna associated with marine production, including large colonies of seabirds. The few native land mammals in Greenland include the polar bear, reindeer, arctic fox, arctic hare, musk ox, collared lemming, ermine, and arctic wolf. The last four are found naturally only in East Greenland, having immigrated from Ellesmere Island. There are dozens of species of seals and whales along the coast. Land fauna consists predominantly of animals that have spread from North America or for a lot of birds and insects coming from Europe. There are no native or free-living reptiles or amphibians on the island.[87]\\r\\nPhytogeographically, Greenland belongs to the Arctic province of the Circumboreal Region within the Boreal Kingdom. The island is sparsely populated in vegetation; plant life consists mainly of grassland and small bushes, which is regularly grazed by livestock. The most common tree native to Greenland is the European white birch (Betula pubescens) along with gray-leaf willow (Salix glauca), rowans (Sorbus aucuparia), common junipers (Juniperus communis) and other smaller trees, mainly willows.\\r\\nGreenland's flora comprises about 500 species of higher plants, i.e. flowering plants, ferns, horsetails and lycopodiophyta. Of the other groups, the lichens are the largest with about 950 species; of major fungal species are known 600ÿ700; mosses and algae anything less. Most of Greenland's higher plants are widespread, particularly in arctic and alpine regions, and only a dozen species of particular saxifrage and hawkweed is endemic. A few species were introduced by the Norsemen, such as cow vetch.\\r\\nThe animals of Greenland include the Greenland dog, which was introduced by the Inuit, as well as European-introduced species such as Greenlandic sheep, goats, cattle, reindeer, horse, chicken and sheepdog, all descendants of animals imported by Europeans. Marine mammals include the hooded seal (Cystophora cristata) as well as the grey seal (Halichoerus grypus).[88] Whales frequently pass very close to Greenlandic shores in the late summer and early autumn. Species represented include the beluga whale, blue whale, Greenland whale, fin whale, humpback whale, minke whale, narwhal, pilot whale, sperm whale.[89]\\r\\nApproximately 225 species of fish are known from the waters surrounding Greenland, and the fishing industry is a major part of Greenland's economy, accounting for the majority of the country's total exports.\\r\\nBirds, especially seabirds, are an important part of Greenland's animal life. On steep mountainsides breed large colonies of auks, puffins, skuas, and kittiwakes. By common ducks include eiders, long-tailed ducks and the king eider and in West Greenland white-fronted goose and in East Greenland pink-footed goose and barnacle goose. Breeding migratory birds are also including snow bunting, lapland bunting, ringed plover, red-throated loon and red-necked phalarope. Of land birds that are usually sedentary, can be highlighted arctic redpoll, ptarmigan, short-eared owl, snowy owl, gyrfalcon and in West Greenland the white-tailed eagle.[87]\\r\\nThe Kingdom of Denmark is a constitutional monarchy, in which Queen Margrethe II is the head of state. The monarch officially retains executive power and presides over the Council of State (privy council).[90][91] However, following the introduction of a parliamentary system of government, the duties of the monarch have since become strictly representative and ceremonial,[92] such as the formal appointment and dismissal of the Prime Minister and other ministers in the executive government. The monarch is not answerable for his or her actions, and the monarch's person is sacrosanct.[93]\\r\\nThe party system is dominated by the social democratic Forward Party (14?MPs), and the democratic socialist Inuit Community Party (11?MPs), both of which broadly argue for greater independence from Denmark. While the 2009 election saw the unionistand largely DanishDemocrat Party (2?MPs) decline greatly, the 2013 election consolidated the power of the two main parties at the expense of the smaller groups, and saw the far-left Inuit Party (2?MPs) elected to the Parliament for the first time.\\r\\nThe non-binding 2008 referendum on self-governance favoured increased self-governance 21,355 votes to 6,663.\\r\\nIn 1985, Greenland left the European Economic Community (EEC), unlike Denmark, which remains a member. The EEC later became the European Union (EU, renamed and expanded in scope in 1992). Greenland retains some ties with the EU via Denmark. However, EU law largely does not apply to Greenland except in the area of trade. Greenland is a member state of the Council of Europe.[94]\\r\\nGreenland's head of state is Margrethe?II, Queen regnant of Denmark. The Queen's government in Denmark appoints a High Commissioner (Rigsombudsmand) to represent it on the island. The commissioner is Mikaela Engell.\\r\\nGreenlanders elect two representatives to the Folketing, Denmark's parliament, out of a total of 179. The representatives are Aleqa Hammond of the Siumut Party and Aaja Chemnitz Larsen of the Inuit Community Party.[95]\\r\\nGreenland also has its own Parliament, which has 31?members. The government is the Naalakkersuisut whose members are appointed by the Premier. The head of government is the Premier, usually the leader of the majority party in Parliament. The Premier is Kim Kielsen of the Siumut Party.\\r\\nFormerly consisting of three counties comprising a total of 18 municipalities, Greenland abolished these in 2009 and has since been divided into large territories known as \\"municipalities\\" (Greenlandic: kommuneqarfiit, Danish: kommuner): Sermersooq (\\"Much Ice\\") around the capital Nuuk and also including all East Coast communities; Kujalleq (\\"South\\") around Cape Farewell; Qeqqata (\\"Centre\\") north of the capital along the Davis Strait; Qeqertalik (\\"The one with islands\\") surrounding Disko Bay; and Avannaata (\\"Northern\\") in the northwest; the latter two having come into being as a result of the Qaasuitsup municipality, one of the original four, being partitioned in 2018. The northeast of the island composes the unincorporated Northeast Greenland National Park. Thule Air Base is also unincorporated, an enclave within Avannaata municipality administered by the United States Air Force. During its construction, there were as many as 12,000 American residents but in recent years the number has been below 1,000.\\r\\nThe Greenlandic economy is highly dependent on fishing. Fishing accounts for more than 90% of Greenland's exports.[96] The shrimp and fish industry is by far the largest income earner.[2]\\r\\nGreenland is abundant in minerals.[96] Mining of ruby deposits began in 2007. Other mineral prospects are improving as prices are increasing. These include iron, uranium, aluminium, nickel, platinum, tungsten, titanium, and copper. Despite resumption[when?] of several hydrocarbon and mineral exploration activities, it will take several years before hydrocarbon production can materialize. The state oil company Nunaoil was created to help develop the hydrocarbon industry in Greenland. The state company Nunamineral has been launched on the Copenhagen Stock Exchange to raise more capital to increase the production of gold, started in 2007.\\r\\nElectricity has traditionally been generated by oil or diesel power plants, even if there is a large surplus of potential hydropower. There is a programme to build hydro power plants. The first, and still the largest, is Buksefjord hydroelectric power plant.\\r\\nThere are also plans to build a large aluminium smelter, using hydropower to create an exportable product. It is expected that much of the labour needed will be imported.[97]\\r\\nThe European Union has urged Greenland to restrict People's Republic of China development of rare-earth projects, as China accounts for 95% of the world's current supply. In early 2013, the Greenland government said that it had no plans to impose such restrictions.[98]\\r\\nThe public sector, including publicly owned enterprises and the municipalities, plays a dominant role in Greenland's economy. About half the government revenues come from grants from the Danish government, an important supplement to the gross domestic product (GDP). Gross domestic product per capita is equivalent to that of the average economies of Europe.\\r\\nGreenland suffered an economic contraction in the early 1990s. But, since 1993, the economy has improved. The Greenland Home Rule Government (GHRG) has pursued a tight fiscal policy since the late 1980s, which has helped create surpluses in the public budget and low inflation. Since 1990, Greenland has registered a foreign-trade deficit following the closure of the last remaining lead and zinc mine that year. More recently,[when?] new sources of ruby in Greenland have been discovered, promising to bring new industry and a new export to the country. (See Gemstone industry in Greenland).\\r\\nAbout half of public spending on Greenland is funded by block grants from Denmark which in 2007 totalled over 3.2?billion kr. Additional proceeds from the sale of fishing licences and the annual compensation from the EU represents 280?million DKK per year. Greenland's economy is based on a narrow professional basis with the fishing industry as the dominant sector with some 90% of its exports. In a few years, quarrying and tourism could complement the fisheries that depend on the changing prices of fish and fishing opportunities. The long distances and lack of roads divides the domestic market into many small units that have high operating costs. Most of the fish factories are owned by Royal Greenland.\\r\\nAir transportation exists both within Greenland and between the island and other nations. There is also scheduled boat traffic, but the long distances lead to long travel times and low frequency. There are no roads between cities because the coast has many fjords that would require ferry service to connect a road network.[citation needed] In addition, the lack of agriculture, forestry and similar countryside activities has meant that very few countryside roads have been built.\\r\\nAll civil aviation matters are handled by the Danish Transport Authority. Most airports including Nuuk Airport have short runways and can only be served by special fairly small aircraft on fairly short flights. Kangerlussuaq Airport around 100 kilometres (62 miles) inland from the west coast is the major airport of Greenland and the hub for domestic flights. Intercontinental flights connect mainly to Copenhagen. Travel between international destinations (except Iceland) and any city in Greenland requires a plane change.\\r\\nAir Iceland operates flights from Reykjavk to a number of airports in Greenland, and the company promotes the service as a day-trip option from Iceland for tourists.[99]\\r\\nThere are no direct flights to USA or Canada, although there have been flights Kangerlussuaq ÿ Baltimore,[100] and Nuuk ÿ Iqaluit.,[101] which were cancelled because of too few passengers and financial losses.[102] An alternative between Greenland and USA/Canada is Air Iceland/Icelandair with a plane change in Iceland.[103]\\r\\nSea passenger and freight transport is served by the coastal ferries operated by Arctic Umiaq Line. It makes a single round trip per week, taking 80 hours each direction.\\r\\nGreenland has a population of 56,370 (January 2013 estimate),[6] of whom 88% are Greenlandic Inuit (including mixed persons). The remaining 12% are of European descent, mainly Greenland Danes. Several thousand Greenlandic Inuit reside in the Danish Penisula. The majority of the population is Lutheran. Nearly all Greenlanders live along the fjords in the south-west of the main island, which has a relatively mild climate.[104] More than 17,000 people reside in Nuuk, the capital city.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nBoth Greenlandic (an EskimoÿAleut language) and Danish have been used in public affairs since the establishment of home rule in 1979; the majority of the population can speak both languages. Greenlandic became the sole official language in June 2009,[105] In practice, Danish is still widely used in the administration and in higher education, as well as remaining the first or only language for some Danish immigrants in Nuuk and other larger towns. Debate about the roles of Greenlandic and Danish in the country's future is ongoing. The orthography of Greenlandic was established in 1851[106] and revised in 1973. The country has a 100% literacy rate.[2]\\r\\nA majority of the population speaks Greenlandic, most of them bilingually. It is spoken by about 50,000 people, making it the most populous of the EskimoÿAleut language family, spoken by more people than all the other languages of the family combined.\\r\\nKalaallisut is the Greenlandic dialect of West Greenland, which has long been the most populous area of the island. This has led to its de?facto status as the official \\"Greenlandic\\" language, although the northern dialect Inuktun remains spoken by 1,000 or so people around Qaanaaq, and the eastern dialect Tunumiisut by around 3,000.[107] Each of these dialects is almost unintelligible to the speakers of the other and are considered by some linguists to be separate languages.[citation needed] A UNESCO report has labelled the other dialects as endangered, and measures are now being considered to protect the East Greenlandic dialects.[108]\\r\\nAbout 12% of the population speak Danish as a first or sole language, particularly Danish immigrants in Greenland, many of whom fill positions such as administrators, professionals, academics, or skilled tradesmen. While Greenlandic is dominant in all smaller settlements, a part of the population of Inuit or mixed ancestry, especially in towns, speaks Danish. Most of the Inuit population speaks Danish as a second language. In larger towns, especially Nuuk and in the higher social strata, this is still a large group. While one strategy aims at promoting Greenlandic in public life and education, developing its vocabulary and suitability for all complex contexts, there are opponents of this.[citation needed]\\r\\nEnglish is another important language for Greenland, taught in schools from the first school year.[109]\\r\\nReligion in Greenland (2010)[110][111]\\r\\nThe nomadic Inuit people were traditionally shamanistic, with a well-developed mythology primarily concerned with appeasing a vengeful and fingerless sea goddess who controlled the success of the seal and whale hunts.\\r\\nThe first Norse colonists worshipped the Norse gods, but Erik the Red's son Leif was converted to Christianity by King Olaf Trygvesson on a trip to Norway in 999 and sent missionaries back to Greenland. These swiftly established sixteen parishes, some monasteries, and a bishopric at Garear.\\r\\nRediscovering these colonists and spreading ideas of the Protestant Reformation among them was one of the primary reasons for the Danish recolonization in the 18th century. Under the patronage of the Royal Mission College in Copenhagen, Norwegian and Danish Lutherans and German Moravian missionaries searched for the missing Norse settlements, but no Norse were found, and instead they began preaching to the Inuit. The principal figures in the Christianization of Greenland were Hans and Poul Egede and Matthias Stach. The New Testament was translated piecemeal from the time of the very first settlement on Kangeq Island, but the first translation of the whole Bible was not completed until 1900. An improved translation using the modern orthography was completed in 2000.[112]\\r\\nToday, the major religion is Protestant Christianity, represented mainly by the Church of Denmark, which is Lutheran in orientation. While there are no official census data on religion in Greenland, the Bishop of Greenland Sofie Petersen[113] estimates that 85% of the Greenlandic population are members of her congregation.[114] The Church of Denmark is the established church through the Constitution of Denmark:\\r\\nThe Evangelical Lutheran Church shall be the Established Church of Denmark, and, as such, it shall be supported by the State.\\r\\nThis applies to all of the Kingdom of Denmark, except for the Faroe Islands, as the Church of the Faroe Islands became independent in 2007.\\r\\nThe Roman Catholic minority is pastorally served by the Roman Catholic Diocese of Copenhagen. There are still Christian missionaries on the island, but mainly from charismatic movements proselytizing fellow Christians.[116][117][118][119]\\r\\nThe rate of suicide in Greenland is very high. According to a 2010 census, Greenland holds the highest suicide rate in the world.[120][121] Other significant social issues faced by Greenland are high rates of unemployment, alcoholism, and HIV/AIDS.[122] Alcohol consumption rates in Greenland reached their height in the 1980s, when it was twice as high as in Denmark, and had by 2010 fallen slightly below the average level of consumption in Denmark (which is the 12th highest in the world). But at the same time alcohol prices are much higher, meaning that consumption has a high social impact.[123][124]\\r\\nThere is a 10-year compulsory schooling for children. Secondary education is available in several places in the country. There are many higher schools in Greenland, including the University of Greenland in Nuuk. Traditionally many Greenlanders have received higher education in Denmark.\\r\\nToday Greenlandic culture is a blending of traditional Inuit (Kalaallit) and Scandinavian culture. Inuit, or Kalaallit, culture has a strong artistic tradition, dating back thousands of years. The Kalaallit are known for an art form of figures called tupilak or a \\"spirit object.\\" Traditional art-making practices thrive in the Ammassalik.[125] Sperm whale ivory remains a valued medium for carving.[126]\\r\\nGreenland also has a successful, albeit small, music culture. Some popular Greenlandic bands and artists include Sume (classic rock), Chilly Friday (rock), Nanook (rock), Siissisoq (rock), Nuuk Posse (hip hop) and Rasmus Lyberth (folk), who performed in the Danish Eurovision Song Contest 1979, performing in Greenlandic. The singer-songwriter Simon Lynge is the first musical artist from Greenland to have an album released across the United Kingdom, and to perform at the UK's Glastonbury Festival. The music culture of Greenland also includes traditional Inuit music, largely revolving around singing and drums.\\r\\nSport is an important part of Greenlandic culture, as the population is generally quite active.[127]\\r\\nPopular sports include association football, track and field, handball and skiing. Handball is often referred to as the national sport,[128] and Greenland's men's national team was ranked among the top 20 in the world in 2001.\\r\\nGreenland has excellent conditions for skiing, fishing, snowboarding, ice climbing and rock climbing, although mountain climbing and hiking are preferred by the general public. Although the country's environment is generally ill-suited for golf, there are nevertheless golf courses on the island.\\r\\nCoordinates: 7200N 4000W? / ?72.000N 40.000W? / 72.000; -40.000","input":"What is the small country east of greenland?"},{"output":"is a nation or a sovereign state with a less developed industrial base and a low Human Development Index (HDI) relative to other countries","context":"A developing country, also called a less developed country or an underdeveloped country, is a nation or a sovereign state with a less developed industrial base and a low Human Development Index (HDI) relative to other countries.[1] There are no universally agreed-upon criteria for what makes a country developing versus developed and which countries fit these two categories,[2] although there are general reference points such as a nation's GDP per capita compared with other nations. Also the general term less-developed country should not be confused with the specific least developed country. The term \\"developing\\" describes a currently observed situation and not a dynamic or expected direction of progress. Since the late 1990s developing countries tended to demonstrate higher growth rates than the developed ones.[3]\\r\\nThere is criticism for using the term developing country. The term implies inferiority of a developing country or undeveloped country compared with a developed country, which many countries dislike. It assumes a desire to develop along the traditional Western model of economic development which a few countries, such as Cuba and Bhutan, choose not to follow.[4] An alternative measurement that has been suggested is that of gross national happiness. Countries on the boundary between developed and developing are often categorized under the term newly industrialized countries.[5][6][7][8]\\r\\nAccording to authors such as Walt Whitman Rostow developing countries are in transition from traditional lifestyles towards the modern lifestyle which began in the Industrial Revolution in the 18th and 19th centuries.\\r\\nIn the 2016 edition of its World Development Indicators, the World Bank made a decision to no longer distinguish between developed and developing countries in the presentation of its data.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nVarious terms are used for whatever is not a developed country. Terms used include less developed country or less economically developed country, and for the more extreme, least developed country or least economically developed country.\\r\\nCriteria for what is not a developed country can be obtained by inverting the factors that define a developed country:\\r\\nKofi Annan, former Secretary General of the United Nations, defined a developed country as \\"one that allows all its citizens to enjoy a free and healthy life in a safe environment.\\"[9] But according to the United Nations Statistics Division,\\r\\nThe UN also notes,\\r\\nOn the other hand according to the classification from International Monetary Fund (IMF) before April 2004, all countries of Central and Eastern Europe (including Central European countries that still belongs to the \\"Eastern Europe Group\\" in the UN institutions) as well as the former Soviet Union (USSR) countries in Central Asia (Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan and Turkmenistan) and Mongolia, were not included under either developed or developing regions, but rather were referred to as \\"countries in transition\\". They are however widely regarded (in the international reports) as \\"developing countries\\".\\r\\nThe IMF uses a flexible classification system that considers \\"(1) per capita income level, (2) export diversificationso oil exporters that have high per capita GDP would not make the advanced classification because around 70% of its exports are oil, and (3) degree of integration into the global financial system.\\"[11]\\r\\nThe World Bank classifies countries into four income groups. These are set each year on July 1. Economies were divided according to 2016 GNI per capita using the following ranges of income:[12]\\r\\nSince 2016 the World Bank no longer divide countries into two groups according to the out-dated concept of developed and developing [12]\\r\\nAlong with the current level of development, countries may be classified by how much this has changed over some amount of time.[13] This may be by absolute numbers or country ranking.\\r\\nThe development of a country is measured with statistical indexes such as income per capita (per person), (gross domestic product) per capita, life expectancy, the rate of literacy, freedom index and others. The UN has developed the Human Development Index (HDI), a compound indicator of some above statistics, to gauge the level of human development for countries where data is available. The UN sets Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) from a blueprint developed by all of the world's countries and leading development institutions, in order to evaluate growth.[14]\\r\\nDeveloping countries are, in general, countries that have not achieved a significant degree of industrialization relative to their populations, and have, in most cases, a medium to low standard of living. There is a strong association between low income and high population growth.\\r\\nThe terms utilized when discussing developing countries refer to the intent and to the constructs of those who utilize these terms. Other terms sometimes used are less developed countries (LDCs), least economically developed countries (LEDCs), \\"underdeveloped nations\\" or Third World nations, and \\"non-industrialized nations\\". Conversely, developed countries, most economically developed countries (MEDCs), First World nations and \\"industrialized nations\\" are the opposite end of the spectrum.\\r\\nTo moderate the euphemistic aspect of the word developing, international organizations have started to use the term less economically developed country (LEDCs) for the poorest nationswhich can, in no sense, be regarded as developing. That is, LEDCs are the poorest subset of LDCs. This may moderate against a belief that the standard of living across the entire developing world is the same.\\r\\nThe concept of the developing nation is found, under one term or another, in numerous theoretical systems having diverse orientations  for example, theories of decolonization, liberation theology, Marxism, anti-imperialism, and political economy.\\r\\nAnother important indicator is the sectoral changes that have occurred since the stage of development of the country. On an average, countries with a 50% contribution from the Secondary sector of Manufacturing have grown substantially. Similarly countries with a tertiary Sector stronghold also see greater rate of Economic Development.\\r\\nSome researchers in development economics, such as Theodore Schultz who won a Nobel Prize in 1979, have found that literate farmers in developing countries are more productive than illiterate farmers. They therefore recommend investing in human capital (education, health, etc.) as an effective tool for economic development. Others, such as Mohammed Tamim, believe that economic development is measurable in educational level from primary school to the university. They noticed that wherever the educational level is raised, the level of development is also raised. They conclude that the percentage of the schooled population is proportional to the economic growth rate and inversely proportional in the demographic growth rate. The Take-Off of Walt Whitman Rostow can start in a country if its population is completely schooled. It is therefore necessary for the organization of a worldwide education program, itself conditioned by another worldwide program of birth control and the establishment of a worldwide organization for the implementation of this development strategy.[15]\\r\\n\\r\\nThere are several terms used to classify countries into rough levels of development. Classification of any given country differs across sources, and sometimes these classifications or the specific terminology used is considered disparaging. Use of the term \\"market\\" instead of \\"country\\" usually indicates specific focus on the characteristics of the countries' capital markets as opposed to the overall economy.\\r\\nDeveloping countries can also be categorized by geography:\\r\\nOther classifications include:\\r\\nThere is some criticism of the use of the term \\"developing country\\". The term implies inferiority of a \\"developing country\\" or \\"undeveloped country\\" compared with a \\"developed country\\", which many countries dislike. It is criticized for being too positive and too negative.\\r\\nIt assumes a desire to \\"develop\\" along the traditional Western model of economic development, which a few countries, such as Cuba and Bhutan, choose not to follow.[4]\\r\\nThe concept of \\"development\\" rests on the assumption that Modernization theory holds. Modernization theory, as the dominant development theory of the late 19th and 20th centuries, has largely contributed to the definition of \\"development\\". In short, it argues that there is only one way to achieve \\"modernity\\" and \\"development\\" - that of \\"Western\\" nation-states. Largely challenged today, modernization theory still holds an important role in defining \\"development\\".\\r\\nThe term \\"developing\\" implies mobility and does not acknowledge that development may be in decline or static in some countries, particularly in southern African states worst affected by HIV/AIDS. In such cases, the term \\"developing country\\" may be considered a euphemism. The term implies homogeneity between such countries, which vary widely. The term also implies homogeneity within such countries when wealth (and health) of the most and least affluent groups varies widely. Similarly, the term \\"developed country\\" incorrectly implies a lack of continuing economic development/growth in more-developed countries.\\r\\nIn general, development entails a modern infrastructure (both physical and institutional), and a move away from low value added sectors such as agriculture and natural resource extraction. Developed countries, in comparison, usually have economic systems based on continuous, self-sustaining economic growth in the tertiary sector of the economy and quaternary sector of the economy and high material standards of living. However, there are notable exceptions, as some countries considered developed have a significant component of primary industries in their national economies, e.g., Norway, Canada, Australia. The USA and Western Europe have a very important agricultural sector, and are major players in international agricultural markets. Also, natural resource extraction can be a very profitable industry (high value added), e.g., oil extraction.\\r\\nAn alternative measurement that has been suggested is that of gross national happiness, measuring the actual satisfaction of people as opposed to how fiscally wealthy a country is.\\r\\nDuring the late 20th century, and with the advance of World-systems theory, the notions of \\"developed country\\" and \\"developing country\\" have started to slowly be replaced by the less-controversial, trade-based, notions of \\"core country\\", \\"semi-periphery country\\" and \\"periphery country\\".\\r\\nThe following are considered developing economies according to the International Monetary Fund's World Economic Outlook Report, April 2015.[30][31]\\r\\nCountries not listed by IMF\\r\\nThe following, including the Four Asian Tigers and new Eurozone European countries, were considered developing countries until the '90s, and are now listed as advanced economies (developed countries) by the IMF.

Because of the lack of data, it is difficult to judge whether they are advanced economies or developing economies before being listed as advanced economies.","input":"What does it mean to be a developing country?"},{"output":"the United Kingdom","context":"","input":"Where did the hamburger make its international debut?"},{"output":"April 30, 1916","context":"Daylight saving time (abbreviated DST), sometimes referred to as daylight savings time in U.S., Canadian, and Australian speech,[1][2] and known as British Summer Time (BST) in the UK and just summer time in some countries, is the practice of advancing clocks during summer months so that evening daylight lasts longer, while sacrificing normal sunrise times. Typically, regions that use daylight saving time adjust clocks forward one hour close to the start of spring and adjust them backward in the autumn to standard time.[3]\\r\\nGeorge Hudson proposed the idea of daylight saving in 1895.[4] The German Empire and Austria-Hungary organized the first nationwide implementation, starting on April 30, 1916. Many countries have used it at various times since then, particularly since the energy crisis of the 1970s.\\r\\nDST is generally not observed near the equator, where sunrise times do not vary enough to justify it. Some countries observe it only in some regions; for example, southern Brazil observes it while equatorial Brazil does not.[5] Only a minority of the world's population uses DST, because Asia and Africa generally do not observe it.\\r\\nDST clock shifts sometimes complicate timekeeping and can disrupt travel, billing, record keeping, medical devices, heavy equipment,[6] and sleep patterns.[7] Computer software often adjusts clocks automatically, but policy changes by various jurisdictions of DST dates and timings may be confusing.[8]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nIndustrialized societies generally follow a clock-based schedule for daily activities that do not change throughout the course of the year. The time of day that individuals begin and end work or school, and the coordination of mass transit, for example, usually remain constant year-round. In contrast, an agrarian society's daily routines for work and personal conduct are more likely governed by the length of daylight hours[9][10] and by solar time, which change seasonally because of the Earth's axial tilt. North and south of the tropics daylight lasts longer in summer and shorter in winter, with the effect becoming greater the further one moves away from the tropics.\\r\\nBy synchronously resetting all clocks in a region to one hour ahead of standard time, individuals who follow such a year-round schedule will wake an hour earlier than they would have otherwise; they will begin and complete daily work routines an hour earlier, and they will have available to them an extra hour of daylight after their workday activities.[11][12] However, they will have one less hour of daylight at the start of each day, making the policy less practical during winter.[13][14]\\r\\nWhile the times of sunrise and sunset change at roughly equal rates as the seasons change, proponents of Daylight Saving Time argue that most people prefer a greater increase in daylight hours after the typical \\"nine to five\\" workday.[15][16] Supporters have also argued that DST decreases energy consumption by reducing the need for lighting and heating, but the actual effect on overall energy use is heavily disputed.\\r\\nThe manipulation of time at higher latitudes (for example Iceland, Nunavut or Alaska) has little impact on daily life, because the length of day and night changes more extremely throughout the seasons (in comparison to other latitudes), and thus sunrise and sunset times are significantly out of phase with standard working hours regardless of manipulations of the clock.[17] DST is also of little use for locations near the equator, because these regions see only a small variation in daylight in the course of the year.[18] The effect also varies according to how far east or west the location is within its time zone, with locations farther east inside the time zone benefiting more from DST than locations farther west in the same time zone.[19]\\r\\nAlthough they did not fix their schedules to the clock in the modern sense, ancient civilizations adjusted daily schedules to the sun more flexibly than DST does, often dividing daylight into twelve hours regardless of daytime, so that (for example) each daylight hour became progressively longer during spring and shorter during autumn.[20] For example, the Romans kept time with water clocks that had different scales for different months of the year: at Rome's latitude the third hour from sunrise, hora tertia, started by modern standards at 09:02 solar time and lasted 44 minutes at the winter solstice, but at the summer solstice it started at 06:58 and lasted 75 minutes.[21] After ancient times, equal-length civil hours eventually[when?] supplanted unequal ones, so civil time no longer varies by season. Unequal hours are still used in a few traditional settings, such as some monasteries of Mount Athos[22] and all Jewish ceremonies.[23]\\r\\nDuring his time as an American envoy to France (1776-1785), Benjamin Franklin, publisher of the old English proverb \\"Early to bed, and early to rise, makes a man healthy, wealthy and wise\\",[24][25] anonymously published a letter suggesting that Parisians economize on candles by rising earlier to use morning sunlight.[26] This 1784 satire proposed taxing window shutters, rationing candles, and waking the public by ringing church bells and firing cannons at sunrise.[27] Despite common misconception, Franklin did not actually propose DST; 18th-century Europe did not even keep precise schedules. However, this soon changed as rail transport and communication networks came to require a standardization of time unknown in Franklin's day.[28]\\r\\nThe New Zealand entomologist George Hudson first proposed modern DST. Hudson's shift-work job gave him leisure time to collect insects and led him to value after-hours daylight.[4] In 1895 he presented a paper to the Wellington Philosophical Society proposing a two-hour daylight-saving shift,[11] and after considerable interest was expressed in Christchurch, he followed up with an 1898 paper.[29] Many publications credit DST proposal to the prominent English builder and outdoorsman William Willett,[30] who independently conceived DST in 1905 during a pre-breakfast ride, when he observed with dismay how many Londoners slept through a large part of a summer day.[16] An avid golfer, Willett also disliked cutting short his round at dusk.[31] His solution was to advance the clock during the summer months, a proposal he published two years later.[32] The Liberal Party member of parliament (MP) Robert Pearce took up Willett's proposal, introducing the first Daylight Saving Bill to the House of Commons on February 12, 1908.[33] A select committee was set up to examine the issue, but Pearce's bill did not become law, and several other bills failed in the following years. Willett lobbied for the proposal in the UK until his death in 1915.\\r\\nWilliam Sword Frost, mayor of Orillia, Ontario, introduced daylight saving time in the municipality during his tenure from 1911 to 1912.[34]\\r\\nStarting on April 30, 1916, the German Empire and its World War I ally Austria-Hungary introduced DST (German: Sommerzeit) as a way to conserve coal during wartime. Britain, most of its allies, and many European neutrals soon followed suit. Russia and a few other countries waited until the next year, and the United States adopted daylight saving in 1918.\\r\\nBroadly speaking, most jurisdictions abandoned daylight saving time in the years after the war ended in 1918 (with some notable exceptions including Canada, the UK, France, and Ireland). However, many different places adopted it for periods of time during the following decades and it became common during World War II. It became widely adopted, particularly in North America and Europe, starting in the 1970s as a result of the 1970s energy crisis.\\r\\nSince then, the world has seen many enactments, adjustments, and repeals.[35] For specific details, see Daylight saving time by country.\\r\\nIn the United States, a one-hour time shift occurs at 02:00 local time. In spring the clock jumps forward from the last instant of 01:59 standard time to 03:00 DST and that day has 23?hours. In autumn the clock jumps backward from the last instant of 01:59 DST to 01:00 standard time, repeating that hour, and that day has 25?hours.[36] A digital display of local time does not read 02:00 exactly at the shift to summer time, but instead jumps from 01:59:59.9 forward to 03:00:00.0.\\r\\nClock shifts are usually scheduled near a weekend midnight to lessen disruption to weekday schedules. A one-hour shift is customary.[37] Twenty-minute and two-hour shifts have been used in the past.\\r\\nCoordination strategies differ when adjacent time zones shift clocks. The European Union shifts all zones at the same instant, at 01:00 Greenwich Mean Time[38] or 02:00 CET or 03:00 EET. The result of this procedure is that Eastern European Time is always one hour ahead of Central European Time, at the cost of the shift happening at different local times.[39] In contrast most of North America shifts at 02:00 local time, so its zones do not shift at the same instant; for example, Mountain Time is temporarily (for one hour) zero hours ahead of Pacific Time, instead of one hour ahead, in the autumn and two hours, instead of one, ahead of Pacific Time in the spring. In the past, Australian districts went even further and did not always agree on start and end dates; for example, in 2008 most DST-observing areas shifted clocks forward on October 5 but Western Australia shifted on October 26.[40] In some cases only part of a country shifts; for example, in the U.S., Hawaii and most of Arizona do not observe DST.[41][42]\\r\\nStart and end dates vary with location and year. Since 1996, European Summer Time has been observed from the last Sunday in March to the last Sunday in October; previously the rules were not uniform across the European Union.[39] Starting in 2007, most of the United States and Canada observe DST from the second Sunday in March to the first Sunday in November, almost two-thirds of the year.[43] The 2007 U.S. change was part of the Energy Policy Act of 2005; previously, from 1987 through 2006, the start and end dates were the first Sunday in April and the last Sunday in October, and Congress retains the right to go back to the previous dates now that an energy-consumption study has been done.[44] Proponents for permanently retaining November as the month for ending DST point to Halloween as a reason to delay the changeto provide extra daylight on October 31.\\r\\nBeginning and ending dates are roughly the reverse in the southern hemisphere. For example, mainland Chile observed DST from the second Saturday in October to the second Saturday in March, with transitions at 24:00 local time.[45]\\r\\nAs a result, time difference between two regions varies along the year because of DST. Central European Time is usually six hours later than North American Eastern Time, except a few weeks in March and October/November. Likewise, the United Kingdom and mainland Chile could be five hours apart during the northern summer, three hours during the southern summer, and four hours a few weeks per year because of mismatch of changing dates.\\r\\nDaylight saving has caused controversy since it began.[3] Winston Churchill argued that it enlarges \\"the opportunities for the pursuit of health and happiness among the millions of people who live in this country\\"[46] and pundits have dubbed it \\"Daylight Slaving Time\\".[47] Historically, retailing, sports, and tourism interests have favored daylight saving, while agricultural and evening entertainment interests have opposed it, and its initial adoption had been prompted by energy crises and war.[48]\\r\\nThe fate of Willett's 1907 proposal illustrates several political issues involved. The proposal attracted many supporters, including Arthur Balfour, Churchill, David Lloyd George, Ramsay MacDonald, Edward VII (who used half-hour DST at Sandringham or \\"Sandringham time\\"), the managing director of Harrods, and the manager of the National Bank. However, the opposition was stronger: it included Prime Minister H. H. Asquith, Christie (the Astronomer Royal), George Darwin, Napier Shaw (director of the Meteorological Office), many agricultural organizations, and theatre owners. After many hearings the proposal was narrowly defeated in a parliamentary committee vote in 1909. Willett's allies introduced similar bills every year from 1911 through 1914, to no avail.[49] The U.S. was even more skeptical: Andrew Peters introduced a DST bill to the United States House of Representatives in May 1909, but it soon died in committee.[50]\\r\\nAfter Germany led the way with starting DST (German: Sommerzeit) during World War I on April 30, 1916 together with its allies to alleviate hardships from wartime coal shortages and air raid blackouts, the political equation changed in other countries; the United Kingdom used DST first on May 21, 1916.[51] U.S. retailing and manufacturing interests led by Pittsburgh industrialist Robert Garland soon began lobbying for DST, but were opposed by railroads. The U.S.'s 1917 entry to the war overcame objections, and DST was established in 1918.[52]\\r\\nThe war's end swung the pendulum back. Farmers continued to dislike DST, and many countries repealed it after the war. Britain was an exception: it retained DST nationwide but over the years adjusted transition dates for several reasons, including special rules during the 1920s and 1930s to avoid clock shifts on Easter mornings. Now under a European Community directive summer time begins annually on the last Sunday in March, which may be Easter Sunday (as in 2016).[39] The U.S. was more typical: Congress repealed DST after 1919. President Woodrow Wilson, like Willett an avid golfer, vetoed the repeal twice but his second veto was overridden.[53] Only a few U.S. cities retained DST locally thereafter,[54] including New York so that its financial exchanges could maintain an hour of arbitrage trading with London, and Chicago and Cleveland to keep pace with New York.[55] Wilson's successor Warren G. Harding opposed DST as a \\"deception\\". Reasoning that people should instead get up and go to work earlier in the summer, he ordered District of Columbia federal employees to start work at 08:00 rather than 09:00 during summer 1922. Some businesses followed suit though many others did not; the experiment was not repeated.[12]\\r\\nSince Germany's adoption in 1916, the world has seen many enactments, adjustments, and repeals of DST, with similar politics involved.[56]\\r\\nThe history of time in the United States includes DST during both world wars, but no standardization of peacetime DST until 1966.[57][58] In May 1965, for two weeks, St. Paul, Minnesota and Minneapolis, Minnesota were on different times, when the capital city decided to join most of the nation by starting Daylight Saving Time while Minneapolis opted to follow the later date set by state law.[59] In the mid-1980s, Clorox (parent of Kingsford Charcoal) and 7-Eleven provided the primary funding for the Daylight Saving Time Coalition behind the 1987 extension to U.S. DST, and both Idaho senators voted for it based on the premise that during DST fast-food restaurants sell more French fries, which are made from Idaho potatoes.[60]\\r\\nIn 1992, after a three-year trial of daylight saving in Queensland, Australia, a referendum on daylight saving was held and defeated with a 54.5% 'no' vote?ÿ with regional and rural areas strongly opposed, while those in the metropolitan south-east were in favor.[61] In 2005, the Sporting Goods Manufacturers Association and the National Association of Convenience Stores successfully lobbied for the 2007 extension to U.S. DST.[62] In December 2008, the Daylight Saving for South East Queensland (DS4SEQ) political party was officially registered in Queensland, advocating the implementation of a dual-time zone arrangement for daylight saving in South East Queensland while the rest of the state maintains standard time.[63] DS4SEQ contested the March 2009 Queensland state election with 32 candidates and received one percent of the statewide primary vote, equating to around 2.5% across the 32 electorates contested.[64] After a three-year trial, more than 55% of Western Australians voted against DST in 2009, with rural areas strongly opposed.[65] On April 14, 2010, after being approached by the DS4SEQ political party, Queensland Independent member Peter Wellington, introduced the Daylight Saving for South East Queensland Referendum Bill 2010 into the Queensland parliament, calling for a referendum at the next state election on the introduction of daylight saving into South East Queensland under a dual-time zone arrangement.[66] The Bill was defeated in the Queensland parliament on June 15, 2011.[67]\\r\\nIn the UK the Royal Society for the Prevention of Accidents supports a proposal to observe SDST's additional hour year-round, but is opposed in some industries, such as postal workers and farmers, and particularly by those living in the northern regions of the UK.[10]\\r\\nIn some Muslim countries, DST is temporarily abandoned during Ramadan (the month when no food should be eaten between sunrise and sunset), since the DST would delay the evening dinner. Ramadan took place in July and August in 2012. This concerns at least Morocco,[68][69] although Iran keeps DST during Ramadan.[70] Most Muslim countries do not use DST, partially for this reason.\\r\\nThe 2011 declaration by Russia that it would stay in DST all year long was subsequently followed by a similar declaration from Belarus.[71] Russia's plan generated widespread complaints due to the dark of wintertime morning, and thus was abandoned in 2014.[72] The country changed its clocks to Standard Time on October 26, 2014 and intends to stay there permanently.[73]\\r\\nProponents of DST generally argue that it saves energy, promotes outdoor leisure activity in the evening (in summer), and is therefore good for physical and psychological health, reduces traffic accidents, reduces crime or is good for business. Groups that tend to support DST are urban workers, retail businesses, outdoor sports enthusiasts and businesses, tourism operators, and others who benefit from having more hours of light after the end of a typical workday in the warmer months.\\r\\nOpponents argue that actual energy savings are inconclusive,[75] that DST increases health risks such as heart attack,[75] that DST can disrupt morning activities, and that the act of changing clocks twice a year is economically and socially disruptive and cancels out any benefit. Farmers have tended to oppose DST.[76][77]\\r\\nHaving a common agreement about the day's layout or schedule confers so many advantages that a standard schedule over whole countries or large areas has generally been chosen over ad hoc efforts in which some people get up earlier and others do not.[78] The advantages of coordination are so great that many people ignore whether DST is in effect by altering their nominal work schedules to coordinate with television broadcasts or daylight.[79] DST is commonly not observed during most of winter, because the days are shorter then; workers may have no sunlit leisure time, and students may need to leave for school in the dark.[13] Since DST is applied to many varying communities, its effects may be very different depending on their culture, light levels, geography, and climate. Because of this variation, it is hard to make generalized conclusions about the absolute effects of the practice. The costs and benefits may differ from place to place. Some areas may adopt DST simply as a matter of coordination with others rather than for any direct benefits.\\r\\nA 2017 meta-analysis of 44 studies found that DST leads to electricity savings of only 0.34% during the days when DST applies.[80][81] The meta-analysis furthermore found that \\"electricity savings are larger for countries farther away from the equator, while subtropical regions consume more electricity because of DST.\\"[80][81] This means that DST may conserve electricity in some countries, such as Canada and the United Kingdom, but be wasteful in other places, such as Mexico, the southern United States, and northern Africa. The savings in electricity may also be offset by extra use of other types of energy, such as heating fuel.\\r\\nThe period of Daylight Saving Time before the longest day is shorter than the period after, in several countries including the United States and Europe. This unequal split is an energy-saving measure.[citation needed] For example, in the U.S. the period of Daylight Saving Time is defined by the Energy Policy Act of 2005. The period for Daylight Saving Time was extended by changing the start date from the first Sunday of April to the second Sunday of March, and the end date from the last Sunday in October to the first Sunday in November.\\r\\nDST's potential to save energy comes primarily from its effects on residential lighting, which consumes about 3.5% of electricity in the United States and Canada.[82] Delaying the nominal time of sunset and sunrise reduces the use of artificial light in the evening and increases it in the morning. As Franklin's 1784 satire pointed out, lighting costs are reduced if the evening reduction outweighs the morning increase, as in high-latitude summer when most people wake up well after sunrise. An early goal of DST was to reduce evening usage of incandescent lighting, once a primary use of electricity.[83] Although energy conservation remains an important goal,[84] energy usage patterns have greatly changed since then. Electricity use is greatly affected by geography, climate, and economics, so the results of a study conducted in one place may not be relevant to another country or climate.[82]\\r\\nSeveral studies have suggested that DST increases motor fuel consumption.[82] The 2008 DOE report found no significant increase in motor gasoline consumption due to the 2007 United States extension of DST.[94]\\r\\nThe undisputed winners of DST are the retailers, sporting goods makers, and other businesses that benefit from extra afternoon sunlight.[85] Having more hours of sunlight in between the end of the typical workday and bedtime induces customers to shop and to participate in outdoor afternoon sports.[95] People are more likely to stop by a store on their way home from work if the sun is still up.[85] In 1984, Fortune magazine estimated that a seven-week extension of DST would yield an additional $30?million for 7-Eleven stores, and the National Golf Foundation estimated the extension would increase golf industry revenues $200?million to $300?million.[96] A 1999 study estimated that DST increases the revenue of the European Union's leisure sector by about 3%.[82]\\r\\nConversely, DST can harm some farmers,[75][97] young children, who have difficulty getting enough sleep at night when the evenings are bright,[75] and others whose hours are set by the sun.[98] One reason why farmers oppose DST is that grain is best harvested after dew evaporates, so when field hands arrive and leave earlier in summer, their labor is less valuable.[9] Dairy farmers are another group who complain of the change. Their cows are sensitive to the timing of milking, so delivering milk earlier disrupts their systems.[77][99] Today some farmers' groups are in favor of DST.[100]\\r\\nDST also hurts prime-time television broadcast ratings,[101][75] drive-ins and other theaters.[102]\\r\\nChanging clocks and DST rules has a direct economic cost, entailing extra work to support remote meetings, computer applications and the like. For example, a 2007 North American rule change cost an estimated $500?million to $1?billion,[103] and Utah State University economist William F. Shughart II has estimated the lost opportunity cost at around US$1.7?billion.[75] Although it has been argued that clock shifts correlate with decreased economic efficiency, and that in 2000 the daylight-saving effect implied an estimated one-day loss of $31?billion on U.S. stock exchanges,[104] the estimated numbers depend on the methodology.[105] The results have been disputed,[106] and the original authors have refuted the points raised by disputers.[107]\\r\\nIn 1975 the U.S. DOT conservatively identified a 0.7% reduction in traffic fatalities during DST, and estimated the real reduction at 1.5% to 2%,[108] but the 1976 NBS review of the DOT study found no differences in traffic fatalities.[13] In 1995 the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety estimated a reduction of 1.2%, including a 5% reduction in crashes fatal to pedestrians.[109] Others have found similar reductions.[110] Single/Double Summer Time (SDST), a variant where clocks are one hour ahead of the sun in winter and two in summer, has been projected to reduce traffic fatalities by 3% to 4% in the UK, compared to ordinary DST.[111] However, accidents do increase by as much as 11% during the two weeks that follow the end of British Summer Time.[112] It is not clear whether sleep disruption contributes to fatal accidents immediately after the spring clock shifts.[113] A correlation between clock shifts and traffic accidents has been observed in North America and the UK but not in Finland or Sweden. If this effect exists, it is far smaller than the overall reduction in traffic fatalities.[114] A 2009 U.S. study found that on Mondays after the switch to DST, workers sleep an average of 40 minutes less, and are injured at work more often and more severely.[115]\\r\\nDST likely reduces some kinds of crime, such as robbery and sexual assault, as fewer potential victims are outdoors after dusk.[116][86] Artificial outdoor lighting has a marginal and sometimes even contradictory influence on crime and fear of crime.[117]\\r\\nIn several countries, fire safety officials encourage citizens to use the two annual clock shifts as reminders to replace batteries in smoke and carbon monoxide detectors, particularly in autumn, just before the heating and candle season causes an increase in home fires. Similar twice-yearly tasks include reviewing and practicing fire escape and family disaster plans, inspecting vehicle lights, checking storage areas for hazardous materials, reprogramming thermostats, and seasonal vaccinations.[118] Locations without DST can instead use the first days of spring and autumn as reminders.[119]\\r\\nA 2017 study in the American Economic Journal: Applied Economics estimated that \\"the transition into DST caused over 30 deaths at a social cost of $275 million annually,\\" primarily by increasing sleep deprivation.[120]\\r\\nDST has mixed effects on health. In societies with fixed work schedules it provides more afternoon sunlight for outdoor exercise.[122] It alters sunlight exposure; whether this is beneficial depends on one's location and daily schedule, as sunlight triggers vitamin D synthesis in the skin, but overexposure can lead to skin cancer.[123] DST may help in depression by causing individuals to rise earlier,[124] but some argue the reverse.[125] The Retinitis Pigmentosa Foundation Fighting Blindness, chaired by blind sports magnate Gordon Gund, successfully lobbied in 1985 and 2005 for U.S. DST extensions.[60][62] DST shifts are associated with higher rates of ischemic stroke in the first two days after the shift, though not in the week thereafter.[126]\\r\\nClock shifts were found to increase the risk of heart attack by 10 percent,[75] and to disrupt sleep and reduce its efficiency.[7] Effects on seasonal adaptation of the circadian rhythm can be severe and last for weeks.[127] A 2008 study found that although male suicide rates rise in the weeks after the spring transition, the relationship weakened greatly after adjusting for season.[128] A 2008 Swedish study found that heart attacks were significantly more common the first three weekdays after the spring transition, and significantly less common the first weekday after the autumn transition.[129] A 2013 review found little evidence that people slept more on the night after the fall DST shift, even though it is often described as allowing people to sleep for an hour longer than normal. The same review stated that the lost hour of sleep resulting from the spring shift appears to result in sleep loss for at least a week afterward.[130] In 2015, two psychologists recommended that DST be abolished, citing its disruptive effects on sleep as one reason for this recommendation.[131]\\r\\nThe government of Kazakhstan cited health complications due to clock shifts as a reason for abolishing DST in 2005.[132] In March 2011, Dmitri Medvedev, president of Russia, claimed that \\"stress of changing clocks\\" was the motivation for Russia to stay in DST all year long. Officials at the time talked about an annual increase in suicides.[133]\\r\\nAn unexpected adverse effect of daylight saving time may lie in the fact that an extra part of morning rush hour traffic occurs before dawn and traffic emissions then cause higher air pollution than during daylight hours.[134]\\r\\nIn 2017, researchers at the University of Washington and the University of Virginia reported that judges who experienced sleep deprivation as a result of DST tended to issue longer sentences.[135]\\r\\nDST's clock shifts have the obvious disadvantage of complexity. People must remember to change their clocks; this can be time-consuming, particularly for mechanical clocks that cannot be moved backward safely.[136] People who work across time zone boundaries need to keep track of multiple DST rules, as not all locations observe DST or observe it the same way. The length of the calendar day becomes variable; it is no longer always 24 hours. Disruption to meetings, travel, broadcasts, billing systems, and records management is common, and can be expensive.[137] During an autumn transition from 02:00 to 01:00, a clock reads times from 01:00:00 through 01:59:59 twice, possibly leading to confusion.[138]\\r\\nDamage to a German steel facility occurred during a DST transition in 1993, when a computer timing system linked to a radio time synchronization signal allowed molten steel to cool for one hour less than the required duration, resulting in spattering of molten steel when it was poured.[6] Medical devices may generate adverse events that could harm patients, without being obvious to clinicians responsible for care.[139] These problems are compounded when the DST rules themselves change; software developers must test and perhaps modify many programs, and users must install updates and restart applications. Consumers must update devices such as programmable thermostats with the correct DST rules or manually adjust the devices' clocks.[8] A common strategy to resolve these problems in computer systems is to express time using the Coordinated Universal Time (UTC) rather than the local time zone. For example, Unix-based computer systems use the UTC-based Unix time internally.\\r\\nSome clock-shift problems could be avoided by adjusting clocks continuously[140] or at least more gradually[141]for example, Willett at first suggested weekly 20-minute transitionsbut this would add complexity and has never been implemented.\\r\\nDST inherits and can magnify the disadvantages of standard time. For example, when reading a sundial, one must compensate for it along with time zone and natural discrepancies.[142] Also, sun-exposure guidelines such as avoiding the sun within two hours of noon become less accurate when DST is in effect.[143]\\r\\nAs explained by Richard Meade in the English Journal of the (American) National Council of Teachers of English, the form daylight savings time (with an \\"s\\") was already in 1978 much more common than the older form daylight saving time in American English (\\"the change has been virtually accomplished\\"). Nevertheless, even dictionaries such as Merriam-Webster's, American Heritage, and Oxford, which describe actual usage instead of prescribing outdated usage (and therefore also list the newer form), still list the older form first. This is because the older form is still very common in print and preferred by many editors. (\\"Although daylight saving time is considered correct, daylight savings time (with an \\"s\\") is commonly used.\\")[144] The first two words are sometimes hyphenated (daylight-saving(s) time). Merriam-Webster's also lists the forms daylight saving (without \\"time\\"), daylight savings (without \\"time\\"), and daylight time.[2]\\r\\nIn Britain, Willett's 1907 proposal[32] used the term daylight saving, but by 1911 the term summer time replaced daylight saving time in draft legislation.[74] The same or similar expressions are used in many other languages: Sommerzeit in German, zomertijd in Dutch, kes?aika in Finnish, horario de verano or hora de verano in Spanish, and heure d't in French.[51]\\r\\nThe name of local time typically changes when DST is observed. American English replaces standard with daylight: for example, Pacific Standard Time (PST) becomes Pacific Daylight Time (PDT). In the United Kingdom, the standard term for UK time when advanced by one hour is British Summer Time (BST), and British English typically inserts summer into other time zone names, e.g. Central European Time (CET) becomes Central European Summer Time (CEST).\\r\\nThe North American English mnemonic \\"spring forward, fall back\\" (also \\"spring ahead?...\\", \\"spring up?...\\", and \\"...?fall behind\\") helps people remember which direction to shift clocks.[3]\\r\\nChanges to DST rules cause problems in existing computer installations. For example, the 2007 change to DST rules in North America required that many computer systems be upgraded, with the greatest impact on e-mail and calendar programs. The upgrades required a significant effort by corporate information technologists.[145]\\r\\nSome applications standardize on UTC to avoid problems with clock shifts and time zone differences.[146] Likewise, most modern operating systems internally handle and store all times as UTC and only convert to local time for display.[147][148]\\r\\nHowever, even if UTC is used internally, the systems still require external leap second updates and time zone information to correctly calculate local time as needed. Many systems in use today base their date/time calculations from data derived from the tz?database also known as zoneinfo.\\r\\nThe tz?database maps a name to the named location's historical and predicted clock shifts. This database is used by many computer software systems, including most Unix-like operating systems, Java, and the Oracle RDBMS;[149] HP's \\"tztab\\" database is similar but incompatible.[150] When temporal authorities change DST rules, zoneinfo updates are installed as part of ordinary system maintenance. In Unix-like systems the TZ environment variable specifies the location name, as in TZ=':America/New_York'. In many of those systems there is also a system-wide setting that is applied if the TZ environment variable is not set: this setting is controlled by the contents of the /etc/localtime file, which is usually a symbolic link or hard link to one of the zoneinfo files. Internal time is stored in timezone-independent epoch time; the TZ is used by each of potentially many simultaneous users and processes to independently localize time display.\\r\\nOlder or stripped-down systems may support only the TZ values required by POSIX, which specify at most one start and end rule explicitly in the value. For example, TZ='EST5EDT,M3.2.0/02:00,M11.1.0/02:00' specifies time for the eastern United States starting in 2007. Such a TZ value must be changed whenever DST rules change, and the new value applies to all years, mishandling some older timestamps.[151]\\r\\nAs with zoneinfo, a user of Microsoft Windows configures DST by specifying the name of a location, and the operating system then consults a table of rule sets that must be updated when DST rules change. Procedures for specifying the name and updating the table vary with release. Updates are not issued for older versions of Microsoft Windows.[152] Windows Vista supports at most two start and end rules per time zone setting. In a Canadian location observing DST, a single Vista setting supports both 1987ÿ2006 and post-2006 time stamps, but mishandles some older time stamps. Older Microsoft Windows systems usually store only a single start and end rule for each zone, so that the same Canadian setting reliably supports only post-2006 time stamps.[153]\\r\\nThese limitations have caused problems. For example, before 2005, DST in Israel varied each year and was skipped some years. Windows 95 used rules correct for 1995 only, causing problems in later years. In Windows 98, Microsoft marked Israel as not having DST, forcing Israeli users to shift their computer clocks manually twice a year. The 2005 Israeli Daylight Saving Law established predictable rules using the Jewish calendar but Windows zone files could not represent the rules' dates in a year-independent way. Partial workarounds, which mishandled older time stamps, included manually switching zone files every year[154] and a Microsoft tool that switches zones automatically.[155] In 2013, Israel standardized its daylight saving time according to the Gregorian calendar.[156]\\r\\nMicrosoft Windows keeps the system real-time clock in local time. This causes several problems, including compatibility when multi booting with operating systems that set the clock to UTC, and double-adjusting the clock when multi booting different Windows versions, such as with a rescue boot disk. This approach is a problem even in Windows-only systems: there is no support for per-user timezone settings, only a single system-wide setting. In 2008 Microsoft hinted that future versions of Windows will partially support a Windows registry entry RealTimeIsUniversal that had been introduced many years earlier, when Windows NT supported RISC machines with UTC clocks, but had not been maintained.[157] Since then at least two fixes related to this feature have been published by Microsoft.[158][159]\\r\\nThe NTFS file system used by recent versions of Windows stores the file with a UTC time stamp, but displays it corrected to localor seasonaltime. However, the FAT filesystem commonly used on removable devices stores only the local time. Consequently, when a file is copied from the hard disk onto separate media, its time will be set to the current local time. If the time adjustment is changed, the timestamps of the original file and the copy will be different. The same effect can be observed when compressing and uncompressing files with some file archivers. It is the NTFS file that changes seen time. This effect should be kept in mind when trying to determine if a file is a duplicate of another, although there are other methods of comparing files for equality (such as using a checksum algorithm). A ready clue is if the time stamps differ by precisely 1 hour.\\r\\nA move to \\"permanent daylight saving time\\" (staying on summer hours all year with no time shifts) is sometimes advocated, and in fact is currently implemented in some jurisdictions such as Belarus,[77] some parts of Russia (e.g. Novosibirsk), Turkey, Namibia, and S?o Tom and Prncipe. It could be a result of following the timezone of a neighbouring region, political will or other causes. Advocates cite the same advantages as normal DST without the problems associated with the twice yearly time shifts. However, many remain unconvinced of the benefits, citing the same problems and the relatively late sunrises, particularly in winter, that year-round DST entails.[14]\\r\\nRussia switched to permanent DST from 2011 to 2014, but the move proved unpopular because of the late sunrises in winter, so the country switched permanently back to \\"standard\\" or \\"winter\\" time in 2014 for the whole Russian Federation.[160] The United Kingdom and Ireland also experimented with year-round summer time between 1968 and 1971, and put clocks forward by an extra hour during World War II.[161]\\r\\nIn the IANA time zone database, permanent daylight saving time is considered standard time that has been added by an hour.\\r\\nOn March 23, 2018 Florida Governor Rick Scott signed legislation asking Congress to approve year-round daylight saving time in Florida.[162][163]","input":"When did daylight savings time first come into effect?"},{"output":"spring","context":"Higher education in Japan is provided at universities ( daigaku), junior colleges (ɵ tanki daigaku), colleges of technology (ԃÛ??ƀ kt senmon gakk) and special training schools and community colleges (??ƀ sensh gakk). Of these four types of institutions, only universities and junior colleges are strictly considered postsecondary education providers.[1] The modern Japanese higher education system has undergone numerous changes since the Meiji period and was largely modeled after Western countries such as Germany, France, Britain, and the United States to create a unique Japanese model to serve its national needs.[2][3] The Japanese higher education system differs from higher education in most other countries in many significant ways. Key differences include the method of acceptance, which relies almost entirely on one or two tests, as opposed to GPAs (Grade Point Average) or other methods of assessment used in Western countries. Because students only have one chance to take this test each year, there is an enormous amount of pressure to do well on this test, and the majority of senior high school education is dedicated to doing well on this single test.\\r\\nAnother major difference is graduate school, as very few non-science undergraduate students go to graduate school in Japan. This is because graduate schools for non-science students are generally considered useful only those who want to work in academia. This has changed a little since the turn of the 21st century. The law has changed to require those who want to become lawyers to attend a graduate school the Japanese government has designated a law school. Previously, lawyers only had to pass the bar exam, which undergraduate students could take. Major universities have also opened business schools, though few Japanese students attend these because most Japanese corporations still don't regard graduate students as much more qualified than undergraduate students. For this reason, they are mostly attended by foreign students from neighboring Asian countries, particularly South Korea, Taiwan, and China. Unlike higher education in some other countries, public universities are generally regarded as more prestigious than private universities, especially the National Seven Universities (University of Tokyo, Kyoto University, Tohoku University, Kyushu University, Hokkaido University, Osaka University, and Nagoya University).\\r\\nAs the Japanese economy is largely scientific and technological based, the labor market demands people who have achieved some form of higher education, particularly related to science and engineering in order to gain a competitive edge when searching for employment. According to the MEXT, approximately 75.9% of students who graduate from high school attended a university, junior college, trade school, or other higher education institution.[4]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe modern Japanese higher education system was adapted from a number of methods and ideas inspired from Western education systems that were integrated with their traditional Shinto, Buddhist, and Confucianist pedagogical philosophies. Throughout the 19th and 20th century, many major reforms were introduced in the field of higher education across Japan, which contributed to individual work of students as well as the nation's overall originality, creativity, individuality, identity, and internationalization of higher education. Plunging itself through an active process of Westernization during the Meiji Restoration in 1868, Japan sought to revitalize its entire education system, especially at the higher education level to transmit Western knowledge for modern industrialization. Many Japanese students were sent abroad to Europe to study as were a number of foreign scholars from Western countries were introduced to Japan as well.[5] During the 1880s, Japan sought to search for a higher education system prototype to model in order to suit its national needs. In 1881, the government decided to convert its institutional model, influenced from a variety of Western countries such as Great Britain, the United States and France, to a strictly German model as the Prussian-oriented model of higher education greatly interested the Meiji government at the time.[6]\\r\\nGermany served as the largest inspiration for the modern Japanese higher education system, as German universities were regarded as one of the most innovative in all of Europe in addition to 19th-century Germany being close to Japan in its goals for industrialization. Furthermore, the Meiji government greatly admired the German government bureaucracy, largely dominated by law school graduates, and it sought to absorb the German prototype into the unique Japanese model. Inspired by the American, British, and French models on top of a predominantly-German prototype, its modern higher education system became an catalyzing impetus that propelled Japan's development as a major world power during the late 19th and the early 20th centuries.[7]\\r\\nAt the higher education level, Japan sought to incorporate a number of higher education ideas to suit its national needs. Many books, manuscripts, and documents from the West were translated and foreign professors were common during the Meiji era to disseminate Western knowledge in the arts and sciences as well as Western pedagogical teaching methods. For a modern university model, Japan incorporated many Prussian elements found in that of Germany as the German Empire at the time was similar to Japan in terms of goals for colonial expansion and national development. The German model continued to inspire the Japanese higher education system until the end of World War I. During the American occupation of World War II, Japan incorporated higher education ideas developed in the United States to modernize its higher education for the contemporary era. The contemporary Japanese higher education system now boasts elements incorporated from the United States on top of its German origins.[8]\\r\\nUniversity entrance is the traditional route taken by Japanese students to enter the gateway of higher education as it is by far the most prestigious form of higher education in Japan. Unlike the usage of grade point averages and test scores used in Western countries as a yardstick for eligibility, entrance to universities based largely on the scores that students achieved in entrance examinations (nygaku shiken (?y?f)). Private institutions accounted for nearly 80% of all university enrollments in 1991, but with a few exceptions such as Waseda University and Keio University, the public national universities are more highly regarded. Especially, National Seven Universities are the most prestigious. This distinction had its origins in historical factorsthe long years of dominance of the select imperial universities, such as Tokyo and Kyoto universities, which trained Japan's leaders before the warand also in differences in quality, particularly in facilities and faculty ratios.\\r\\nIn addition, certain prestigious employers, notably the government and selected large corporations (e.g. those listed in Nikkei 225), continue to restrict their hiring of new employees to graduates of the most esteemed universities. There is a close link between university background and employment opportunity. Because Japanese society places such store in academic credentials, the competition to enter the prestigious universities is keen. A common custom practiced by Japanese employers is simultaneous recruiting of new graduates.\\r\\nStudents applying to national or other public universities take two entrance examinations, first a nationally administered uniform achievement test (senta shiken (?f)) and then an examination administered by the university that the student hopes to enter (niji shiken (?f)). Applicants to private universities need to take only the university's examination.\\r\\nSuch intense competition means that many students can not compete successfully for admission to the college of their choice. An unsuccessful student can either accept an admission elsewhere, forgo a college education, or wait until the following spring to take the national examinations again. A large number of students choose the last option. These students, called ronin, meaning masterless samurai, spend an entire year, and sometimes longer, studying for another attempt at the entrance examinations. In 2011, the number of ronin who took the uniform test is 110,211, while the number of high school students who took the test is 442,421.[9]\\r\\nYobikou are private schools that, like many juku, help students prepare for entrance examinations. While yobikou have many programs for upper-secondary school students, they are best known for their specially designed full-time, year-long classes for ronin. The number of applicants to four-year universities totaled almost 560,000 in 1988. Ronin accounted for about 40% of new entrants to four-year colleges in 1988. Most ronin were men, but about 14% were women. The ronin experience is so common in Japan that the Japanese education structure is often said to have an extra ronin year built into it.\\r\\nYobikou sponsor a variety of programs, both full-time and part-time, and employ an extremely sophisticated battery of tests, student counseling sessions, and examination analysis to supplement their classroom instruction. The cost of yobikou education is high, comparable to first-year university expenses, and some specialized courses at yobikou are even more expensive. Some yobikou publish modified commercial versions of the proprietary texts they use in their classrooms through publishing affiliates or by other means, and these are popular among the general population preparing for college entrance exams. Yobikou also administer practice examinations throughout the year, which they open to all students for a fee.\\r\\nIn the late 1980s, the examination and entrance process were the subjects of renewed debate. In 1987 the schedule of the Joint First Stage Achievement Test was changed, and the content of the examination itself was revised for 1990. The schedule changes for the first time provided some flexibility for students wishing to apply to more than one national university. The new Joint First Stage Achievement Test was prepared and administered by the National Center for University Entrance Examinations and was designed to accomplish better assessment of academic achievement.\\r\\nThe Ministry of Education hoped many private schools would adopt or adapt the new national test to their own admissions requirements and thereby reduce or eliminate the university tests. But, by the time the new test was administered in 1990, few schools had displayed any inclination to do so. The ministry urged universities to increase the number of students admitted through alternate selection methods, including admission of students returning to Japan from long overseas stays, admission by recommendation, and admission of students who had graduated from upper-secondary schools more than a few years before. Although a number of schools had programs in place or reserved spaces for returning students, only 5% of university students were admitted under these alternate arrangements in the late 1980s.\\r\\nOther college entrance issues include proper guidance for college placement at the upper-secondary level and better dissemination of information about university programs. The ministry provides information through the National Center for University Entrance Examination's on-line information access system and encourages universities, faculties, and departments to prepare brochures and video presentations about their programs.\\r\\nIn 2010 more than 2.8 million students were enrolled in Japan's 778 universities. At the top of the higher education structure, these institutions provide four-year training leading to a bachelor's degree, and some offer six-year programs leading to a professional degree. There are two types of public four-year colleges: the 86 national universities (including The Open University) and the 95 local public universities, founded by prefectures and municipalities. The 597 remaining four-year colleges in 2010 were private.[10]\\r\\nThe overwhelming majority of college students attend full-time day programs. In 2005 the most popular courses, enrolling almost 38% of all undergraduate students, were in the social sciences, including business, law, and accounting. Other popular subjects were engineering (17.3%), the humanities (16%), and education (5.7%).[citation needed]\\r\\nTruancy among Japanese university students, even at expensive private institutions, is extremely high. Roll calls are perfunctory or easily avoided.[11]\\r\\nThe average costs (tuition, fees, and living expenses) for a year of higher education in 1986 were 1.4 million Yen(US$10,000), of which parents paid a little less than 80%, or about 20% of the average family's income in 1986. To help defray expenses, students frequently work part-time or borrow money through the government-supported Japan Scholarship Association. Assistance also is offered by local governments, nonprofit corporations, and other institutions.[citation needed]\\r\\nIn 2005 there were approximately 89 females for every 100 males enrolled in post-secondary education in Japan, and their numbers are still slowly increasing.[12] Women's choices of majors and programs of study still tend to follow traditional patterns, with more than two-thirds of all women enroll in education, social sciences, or humanities courses. Only 15% studied scientific and technical subjects, and women represented less than 3% of students in engineering, the most popular subject for men in 1991.[citation needed]\\r\\nThe quality of universities and higher education in Japan is internationally recognized. There are 11 Japanese universities in the 2006 THES - QS World University Rankings, with the University of Tokyo 19th and Kyoto University 25th.[13] In 2010 the QS Asia University Rankings Top 20 included eight Japanese universities, with the highest ranking, the University of Tokyo, in 5th position.[14] Out of the top 100 Asian universities in 2011's Times Higher Education - QS World University Rankings, 33 were Japanese.[15]\\r\\nGraduate schools became a part of the formal higher education system only after World War II and were still not stressed in the 1990s. Even though 60% of all universities have graduate schools, only 7% of university graduates advance to master's programs, and total graduate school enrollment is about 4% of the entire university student population.[citation needed]\\r\\nThe pattern of graduate enrollment is almost the opposite of that of undergraduates: the majority (63%) of all graduate students are enrolled in the national universities, and it appears that the disparity between public and private graduate enrollments is widening. Graduate education is largely a male preserve, and women, particularly at the master's level, are most heavily represented in the humanities, social sciences, and education. Men are frequently found in engineering programs where, at the master's level, women comprise only 2% of the students. At the doctoral level, the two highest levels of female enrollment are found in medical programs and the humanities, where in both fields 30% of doctoral students are women. Women account for about 13% of all doctoral enrollments.[citation needed]\\r\\nThe generally small numbers of graduate students and the graduate enrollment profile results from a number of factors, especially the traditional employment pattern of industry. In the private sector, the demand for students with advanced degrees (especially in the non-hard sciences) is low compared to other developed countries. This is because private sector companies frequently prefer to hire new university graduates and train them to operate according to company guidelines. Stated negatively, this is because the skills generally associated with postgraduate education in the West (especially independent thinking) make the employee resistant to homogenization. Thus, students avoid taking graduate work unless in the hard sciences.[citation needed]\\r\\nJunior colleges (ɵ, tanki daigaku)  mainly private institutions  are a legacy of the occupation period; many had been prewar institutions upgraded to college status at that time. More than two thirds of the students in junior colleges are women as many attend them as a form of preparation for a short-term career before marriage. Students who complete the course of study at a junior college are awarded an associate degree or a diploma. Though the enrollment number of women going to junior colleges is decreasing as more desire to gain access to more professional careers and have been choosing to attend universities in greater numbers.[16] Junior colleges provide many women with vocational credentials to help them navigate through Japan's job market. These colleges frequently emphasize home economics, nursing, teaching, liberal arts, humanities, and social sciences in their curricula.[17]\\r\\nSpecial training schools and community colleges (senmon gakk (??ƀ) in Japanese) offer advanced courses for vocational careers that require upper-secondary school completion. These schools offer training in specific skills such as computer science, engineering, social welfare, education, business administration, hygiene, foreign languages, therapy and medicine.[18][19] These institutions enroll a large number of men. Some students attend these schools in addition to attending a university to broaden their employment opportunities while others go to qualify for technical licenses or professional certifications. The prestige of special training schools is lower than that of universities, but graduates, particularly in technical areas, are readily absorbed by the job market.[20]\\r\\nColleges of technology (ԃÛ??ƀ, kosen) in Japan are trade and technical schools offering apprenticeships and diplomas for skilled trades and technical careers. Colleges of technology also offer certifications for workers in support roles in professions such as engineering, accountancy, business administration, nursing, medicine, architecture, and law. The five-year programs are offered within a number of fields such as broadcasting, business administration, computer science, arboriculture, medical care, web design, graphic design, industrial design, robotics, biotechnology, environmental technology and engineering. For the industrial trades, students can also take courses in subjects such as applied chemistry industrial chemistry, public works, merchant marine shipping, drafting, CNC machinery operation, construction management, landscape horiculture, livestock management, land surveying, city planning, interior design, and food inspection.[21][22] Other trade specialties offered by colleges of technology include home inspection, landscape and park maintenance, power engineering, power plant operation, power line and security systems installation and servicing, culinary arts, appliance and HVAC servicing, heat and frost insulation, pipeline maintenance, gasfitting, steamfitting, steel fabrication, plumbing, electrical works, masonry, warehousing, carpentry, machine operation, welding, aviation maintenance and servicing, auto and vehicle mechanics, and power equipment servicing.[23]\\r\\nAs the Japanese economy began to experience major growth in the 1950s, major Japanese corporations lobbied the national government to place a stronger emphasis on vocational education to fill in the skills gap. Private colleges of technology were established in 1961 in response to Japan's growing need for vocational education as well as changing industry needs across the Japanese economy, especially the automotive industry. There, high school age students acquire trade and technical skills through work-based learning, apprenticeships, and work placement programs.[24] While university is by far the most prestigious form of education in Japan, many Japanese students choose to attend colleges of technology as an alternative route. These schools allow them to gain job skills without the intense pressure of the university admissions process. Many students attend specifically to get professional certifications and then proceed to enter the workforce afterwards. However, its also common for university graduates to attend colleges of technology if their efforts to secure a job with a university degree comes to no avail.[25]\\r\\n70 trade and technical schools have been operating since the early 1960s.[26] A small percentage of college technology graduates transfer to universities as third-year students, and some universities such as the University of Tokyo and the Tokyo Institute of Technology, earmarked entrance places for transfer students of colleges of technology in the 1980s. Students are eligible to enter colleges of technology halfway through their senior secondary years. College of technology programs usually last for 5 years. This system of institutions were founded in 1961 and they have enjoyed increased popularity as an alternative route besides the traditional path of going to university. Graduates of technical schools have successful in navigating Japan's high-tech labor market as they been swamped with job offers despite Japan's sluggish economy during the 1990s.[27] Graduates of trade and technical schools are awarded associate degrees or diplomas, which are respected by employers but are below bachelor's degrees in terms of prestige. Many graduates of colleges of technology starting out move from company to company to gain experience and to move up. After spending years gaining experience and honing their skills, some go on to become managers where they are able to supervise entire projects as well as younger apprentices.[28] Nevertheless, technical graduates usually find employment immediately upon graduation. Technical education in the skilled trades continues to be a solid option for students who enjoy working with their hands and have no plans of attending university.[29]\\r\\nOne of the leading trade schools in Japan is Nihon Kogakuin College, which is part of the Katayanagi Institute group. The school has offered industrial education for skilled trades and technical careers since its establishment in 1947. The school today proactively accepts foreign students due to the country's labor shortage of skilled technicians in Japan's information technology industry.[30] With about 10,000 graduates a year, Kosen colleges have not produced nearly enough graduates to meet the demands of Japanese industry as major corporations would give preference in job offers to foreign-trained students, who are perceived as more competent in the workplace than graduates of Japans four-year universities.[31]\\r\\nA 2004 white paper from the Japanese Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology indicated that the colleges of technology are leaders in the use of apprenticeships and internships, with more than 90% of institutions offering this opportunity compared to 46% of universities and 24% of junior colleges.[32] As of 2008, 23.1% of high school graduates study at colleges of technology with 99.6% being employed after graduation.[33]","input":"When do japanese students take college entrance exams?"},{"output":"an epic poem from ancient Mesopotamia","context":"The Epic of Gilgamesh is an epic poem from ancient Mesopotamia that is often regarded as the earliest surviving great work of literature.

The later \\"standard\\" version dates from the 13th to the 10th centuries BC and bears the incipit Sha naqba ؐmuru (\\"He who Saw the Deep\\", in modern terms: \\"He who Sees the Unknown\\"). Approximately two thirds of this longer, twelve-tablet version have been recovered. Some of the best copies were discovered in the library ruins of the 7th-century BC Assyrian king Ashurbanipal.\\r\\nThe first half of the story discusses Gilgamesh, king of Uruk, and Enkidu, a wild man created by the gods to stop Gilgamesh from oppressing the people of Uruk. After Enkidu becomes civilized through sexual initiation with a harlot, he travels to Uruk, where he challenges Gilgamesh to a test of strength. Gilgamesh wins and the two become friends. Together, they make a six-day journey to the legendary Cedar Forest, where they plan to slay the Guardian, Humbaba the Terrible, and cut down the sacred Cedar.[1] Later they kill the Bull of Heaven, which the goddess Ishtar sends to punish Gilgamesh for spurning her advances. As a punishment for these actions, the gods sentence Enkidu to death.\\r\\nIn the second half of the epic, distress about Enkidu's death causes Gilgamesh to undertake a long and perilous journey to discover the secret of eternal life. He eventually learns that \\"Life, which you look for, you will never find. For when the gods created man, they let death be his share, and life withheld in their own hands\\".[2][3] However, because of his great building projects, his account of Siduri's advice, and what the immortal man Utnapishtim told him about the Great Flood, Gilgamesh's fame survived his death. His story has been translated into many languages, and in recent years has featured in works of popular fiction.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nDistinct sources exist from over a 2000-year timeframe. The earliest Sumerian poems are now generally considered to be distinct stories, rather than parts of a single epic.[4]:45 They date from as early as the Third Dynasty of Ur (c.?2100 BC).[4]:41ÿ42 The Old Babylonian tablets (c.?1800 BC),[4]:45 are the earliest surviving tablets for a single Epic of Gilgamesh narrative.[5] The older Old Babylonian tablets and later Akkadian version are important sources for modern translations, with the earlier texts mainly used to fill in gaps (lacunae) in the later texts. Although several revised versions based on new discoveries have been published, the epic remains incomplete.[6] Analysis of the Old Babylonian text has been used to reconstruct possible earlier forms of the Epic of Gilgamesh.[7] The most recent Akkadian version (c.?1200 BC), also referred to as the standard version, consisting of twelve tablets, was edited by Sin-liqe-unninni and was found in the Library of Ashurbanipal in Nineveh.\\r\\nThe New York Times, front page, 1872[8]\\r\\nThe Epic of Gilgamesh was discovered by Hormuzd Rassam in 1853. The central character of Gilgamesh was initially reintroduced to the world as \\"Izdubar\\", before the cuneiform logographs in his name could be pronounced accurately. The first modern translation was published in the early 1870s by George Smith.[9] Smith then made further discoveries of texts on his later expeditions, which culminated in his final translation which is given in his book The Chaldaean Account of Genesis (1880).\\r\\nThe most definitive modern translation is a two-volume critical work by Andrew George, published by Oxford University Press in 2003. A book review by the Cambridge scholar, Eleanor Robson, claims that George's is the most significant critical work on Gilgamesh in the last 70 years.[10] George discusses the state of the surviving material, and provides a tablet-by-tablet exegesis, with a dual language side-by-side translation. In 2004, Stephen Mitchell supplied a controversial version that takes many liberties with the text and includes modernized allusions and commentary relating to the Iraq War of 2003.[11][12]\\r\\nThe first direct Arabic translation from the original tablets was made in the 1960s by the Iraqi archaeologist Taha Baqir.[citation needed]\\r\\nThe discovery of artifacts (c.?2600 BC) associated with Enmebaragesi of Kish, mentioned in the legends as the father of one of Gilgamesh's adversaries, has lent credibility to the historical existence of Gilgamesh.[4]:40ÿ41\\r\\nFrom the diverse sources found, two main versions of the epic have been partially reconstructed: the standard Akkadian version, or He who saw the deep, and the Old Babylonian version, or Surpassing all other kings. Five earlier Sumerian poems about Gilgamesh have been partially recovered, some with primitive versions of specific episodes in the Akkadian version, others with unrelated stories.\\r\\nThe standard version was discovered by Hormuzd Rassam in the library of Ashurbanipal in Nineveh in 1853. It was written in a dialect of Akkadian that was used for literary purposes. This version was compiled by Sin-liqe-unninni sometime between 1300 and 1000 BC from earlier texts.\\r\\nThe standard Akkadian version has different opening words, or incipit, from the older version. The older version begins with the words \\"Surpassing all other kings\\", while the standard version has \\"He who saw the deep\\" (?a nagba ؐmuru), \\"deep\\" referring to the mysteries of the information brought back by Gilgamesh from his meeting with Uta-Napishti (Utnapishtim) about Ea, the fountain of wisdom.[6] Gilgamesh was given knowledge of how to worship the gods, why death was ordained for human beings, what makes a good king, and how to live a good life. The story of Utnapishtim, the hero of the flood myth, can also be found in the Babylonian Epic of Atrahasis.\\r\\nThe 12th tablet is a sequel to the original 11, and was probably added at a later date. It bears little relation to the well-crafted 11-tablet epic; the lines at the beginning of the first tablet are quoted at the end of the 11th tablet, giving it circularity and finality. Tablet 12 is a near copy of an earlier Sumerian tale, a prequel, in which Gilgamesh sends Enkidu to retrieve some objects of his from the Underworld, and he returns in the form of a spirit to relate the nature of the Underworld to Gilgamesh.\\r\\nThis summary is based on Andrew George's translation.[6]\\r\\nThe story introduces Gilgamesh, king of Uruk. Gilgamesh, two-thirds god and one-third man, is oppressing his people, who cry out to the gods for help. For the young women of Uruk this oppression takes the form of a droit du seigneur, or \\"lord's right\\", to sleep with brides on their wedding night. For the young men (the tablet is damaged at this point) it is conjectured that Gilgamesh exhausts them through games, tests of strength, or perhaps forced labour on building projects. The gods respond to the people's pleas by creating an equal to Gilgamesh who will be able to stop his oppression. This is the primitive man, Enkidu, who is covered in hair and lives in the wild with the animals. He is spotted by a trapper, whose livelihood is being ruined because Enkidu is uprooting his traps. The trapper tells the sun-god Shamash about the man, and it is arranged for Enkidu to be seduced by Shamhat, a temple prostitute, his first step towards being tamed. After six days and seven nights of continuous lovemaking she takes Enkidu to a shepherd's camp to learn how to be civilized. Gilgamesh, meanwhile, has been having dreams about the imminent arrival of a beloved new companion.\\r\\nShamhat brings Enkidu to the shepherds' camp, where he is introduced to a human diet and becomes the night watchman. Learning from a passing stranger about Gilgamesh's treatment of new brides, Enkidu is incensed and travels to Uruk to intervene at a wedding. When Gilgamesh attempts to visit the wedding chamber, Enkidu blocks his way, and they fight. After a fierce battle, Enkidu acknowledges Gilgamesh's superior strength and they become friends. Gilgamesh proposes a journey to the Cedar Forest to slay the monstrous demi-god Humbaba in order to gain fame and renown. Despite warnings from Enkidu and the council of elders, Gilgamesh is not deterred.\\r\\nThe elders give Gilgamesh advice for his journey. Gilgamesh visits his mother, the goddess Ninsun, who seeks the support and protection of the sun-god Shamash for their adventure. Ninsun adopts Enkidu as her son, and Gilgamesh leaves instructions for the governance of Uruk in his absence.\\r\\nGilgamesh and Enkidu journey to the Cedar Forest. Every few days they camp on a mountain, and perform a dream ritual. Gilgamesh has five terrifying dreams about falling mountains, thunderstorms, wild bulls, and a thunderbird that breathes fire. Despite similarities between his dream figures and earlier descriptions of Humbaba, Enkidu interprets these dreams as good omens, and denies that the frightening images represent the forest guardian. As they approach the cedar mountain, they hear Humbaba bellowing, and have to encourage each other not to be afraid.\\r\\nThe heroes enter the cedar forest. Humbaba, the guardian of the Cedar Forest, insults and threatens them. He accuses Enkidu of betrayal, and vows to disembowel Gilgamesh and feed his flesh to the birds. Gilgamesh is afraid, but with some encouraging words from Enkidu the battle commences. The mountains quake with the tumult and the sky turns black. The god Shamash sends 13 winds to bind Humbaba, and he is captured. The monster pleads for his life, and Gilgamesh pities him. He offers Gilgamesh to be king of the forest, he will cut the trees for him, and be his slave. Enkidu, however, is enraged and asks Gilgamesh to kill the beast, because he knows that Humbaba is lying. Humbaba curses them both and Gilgamesh dispatches him with a blow to the neck. The two heroes cut down many cedars, including a gigantic tree that Enkidu plans to fashion into a gate for the temple of Enlil. They build a raft and return home along the Euphrates with the giant tree and the head of Humbaba.\\r\\nGilgamesh rejects the advances of the goddess Ishtar because of her mistreatment of previous lovers like Dumuzi. Ishtar asks her father Anu to send Gugalanna, the Bull of Heaven, to avenge her. When Anu rejects her complaints, Ishtar threatens to raise the dead who will \\"outnumber the living\\" and \\"devour them\\". Anu becomes frightened, and gives in to her. Ishtar leads Gugalanna to Uruk, and it causes widespread devastation. It lowers the level of the Euphrates river, and dries up the marshes. It opens up huge pits that swallow 300 men. Without any divine assistance, Enkidu and Gilgamesh attack and slay it, and offer up its heart to Shamash. When Ishtar cries out, Enkidu hurls one of the hindquarters of the bull at her. The city of Uruk celebrates, but Enkidu has an ominous dream about his future failure.\\r\\nIn Enkidu's dream, the gods decide that one of the heroes must die because they killed Humbaba and Gugalanna. Despite the protestations of Shamash, Enkidu is marked for death. Enkidu curses the great door he has fashioned for Enlil's temple. He also curses the trapper and Shamhat for removing him from the wild. Shamash reminds Enkidu of how Shamhat fed and clothed him, and introduced him to Gilgamesh. Shamash tells him that Gilgamesh will bestow great honors upon him at his funeral, and will wander into the wild consumed with grief. Enkidu regrets his curses and blesses Shamhat. In a second dream, however, he sees himself being taken captive to the Netherworld by a terrifying Angel of Death. The underworld is a \\"house of dust\\" and darkness whose inhabitants eat clay, and are clothed in bird feathers, supervised by terrifying beings. For 12 days, Enkidu's condition worsens. Finally, after a lament that he could not meet a heroic death in battle, he dies.\\r\\nGilgamesh delivers a lamentation for Enkidu, in which he calls upon mountains, forests, fields, rivers, wild animals, and all of Uruk to mourn for his friend. Recalling their adventures together, Gilgamesh tears at his hair and clothes in grief. He commissions a funerary statue, and provides grave gifts from his treasury to ensure that Enkidu has a favourable reception in the realm of the dead. A great banquet is held where the treasures are offered to the gods of the Netherworld. Just before a break in the text there is a suggestion that a river is being dammed, indicating a burial in a river bed, as in the corresponding Sumerian poem, The Death of Gilgamesh.\\r\\nTablet nine opens with Gilgamesh roaming the wild wearing animal skins, grieving for Enkidu. Fearful of his own death, he decides to seek Utnapishtim (\\"the Faraway\\"), and learn the secret of eternal life. Among the few survivors of the Great Flood, Utnapishtim and his wife are the only humans to have been granted immortality by the gods. Gilgamesh crosses a mountain pass at night and encounters a pride of lions. Before sleeping he prays for protection to the moon god Sin. Then, waking from an encouraging dream, he kills the lions and uses their skins for clothing. After a long and perilous journey, Gilgamesh arrives at the twin peaks of Mount Mashu at the end of the earth. He comes across a tunnel, which no man has ever entered, guarded by two terrible scorpion-men. After questioning him and recognizing his semi-divine nature, they allow him to enter it, and he passes under the mountains along the Road of the Sun. In complete darkness he follows the road for 12 \\"double hours\\", managing to complete the trip before the Sun catches up with him. He arrives at the Garden of the gods, a paradise full of jewel-laden trees.\\r\\nGilgamesh meets alewife Siduri, who assumes that he is a murderer or thief because of his disheveled appearance. Gilgamesh tells her about the purpose of his journey. She attempts to dissuade him from his quest, but sends him to Urshanabi the ferryman, who will help him cross the sea to Utnapishtim. Gilgamesh, out of spontaneous rage, destroys the stone-giants that live with Urshanabi. He tells him his story, but when he asks for his help, Urshanabi informs him that he has just destroyed the only creatures who can cross the Waters of Death, which are deadly to the touch. Urshanabi instructs Gilgamesh to cut down 120 trees and fashion them into punting poles. When they reach the island where Utnapishtim lives, Gilgamesh recounts his story, asking him for his help. Utnapishtim reprimands him, declaring that fighting the common fate of humans is futile and diminishes life's joys.\\r\\nGilgamesh observes that Utnapishtim seems no different from himself, and asks him how he obtained his immortality. Utnapishtim explains that the gods decided to send a great flood. To save Utnapishtim the god Ea told him to build a boat. He gave him precise dimensions, and it was sealed with pitch and bitumen. His entire family went aboard together with his craftsmen and \\"all the animals of the field\\". A violent storm then arose which caused the terrified gods to retreat to the heavens. Ishtar lamented the wholesale destruction of humanity, and the other gods wept beside her. The storm lasted six days and nights, after which \\"all the human beings turned to clay\\". Utnapishtim weeps when he sees the destruction. His boat lodges on a mountain, and he releases a dove, a swallow, and a raven. When the raven fails to return, he opens the ark and frees its inhabitants. Utnapishtim offers a sacrifice to the gods, who smell the sweet savor and gather around. Ishtar vows that just as she will never forget the brilliant necklace that hangs around her neck, she will always remember this time. When Enlil arrives, angry that there are survivors, she condemns him for instigating the flood. Ea also castigates him for sending a disproportionate punishment. Enlil blesses Utnapishtim and his wife, and rewards them with eternal life. This account matches the flood story that concludes the Epic of Atra-Hasis (see also Gilgamesh flood myth).\\r\\nThe main point seems to be that when Enlil granted eternal life it was a unique gift. As if to demonstrate this point, Utnapishtim challenges Gilgamesh to stay awake for six days and seven nights. Gilgamesh falls asleep, and Utnapishtim instructs his wife to bake a loaf of bread on each of the days he is asleep, so that he cannot deny his failure to keep awake. Gilgamesh, who is seeking to overcome death, cannot even conquer sleep. After instructing Urshanabi the ferryman to wash Gilgamesh, and clothe him in royal robes, they depart for Uruk.\\r\\nAs they are leaving, Utnapishtim's wife asks her husband to offer a parting gift. Utnapishtim tells Gilgamesh that at the bottom of the sea there lives a boxthorn-like plant that will make him young again. Gilgamesh, by binding stones to his feet so he can walk on the bottom, manages to obtain the plant. Gilgamesh proposes to investigate if the plant has the hypothesized rejuvenation ability by testing it on an old man once he returns to Uruk.\\r\\nThere is a plant that looks like a box-thorn, it has prickles like a dogrose, and will prick one who plucks it. But if you can possess this plant, you'll be again as you were in your youth\\r\\nThis plant, Ur-shanabi, is the \\"Plant of Heartbeat\\", with it a man can regain his vigour. To Uruk-the-sheepfold I will take it, to an ancient I will feed some and put the plant to the test![6]:98\\r\\nUnfortunately, when Gilgamesh stops to bathe, it is stolen by a serpent, who sheds its skin as it departs. Gilgamesh weeps at the futility of his efforts, because he has now lost all chance of immortality. He returns to Uruk, where the sight of its massive walls prompts him to praise this enduring work to Urshanabi.\\r\\nThis tablet is mainly an Akkadian translation of an earlier Sumerian poem, Gilgamesh and the Netherworld (also known as \\"Gilgamesh, Enkidu, and the Netherworld\\" and variants), although it has been suggested that it is derived from an unknown version of that story.[4]:42 The contents of this last tablet are inconsistent with previous ones: Enkidu is still alive, despite having died earlier in the epic. Because of this, its lack of integration with the other tablets, and the fact that it is almost a copy of an earlier version, it has been referred to as an 'inorganic appendage' to the epic.[13] Alternatively, it has been suggested that \\"its purpose, though crudely handled, is to explain to Gilgamesh (and the reader) the various fates of the dead in the Afterlife\\" and in \\"an awkward attempt to bring closure\\",[14] it both connects the Gilgamesh of the epic with the Gilgamesh who is the King of the Netherworld,[15] and is \\"a dramatic capstone whereby the twelve-tablet epic ends on one and the same theme, that of \\"seeing\\" (= understanding, discovery, etc.), with which it began.\\"[16]\\r\\nGilgamesh complains to Enkidu that various of his possessions (the tablet is unclear exactly what? different translations include a drum and a ball) have fallen into the underworld. Enkidu offers to bring them back. Delighted, Gilgamesh tells Enkidu what he must and must not do in the underworld if he is to return. Enkidu does everything which he was told not to do. The underworld keeps him. Gilgamesh prays to the gods to give him back his friend. Enlil and Suen don't reply, but Ea and Shamash decide to help. Shamash makes a crack in the earth, and Enkidu's ghost jumps out of it. The tablet ends with Gilgamesh questioning Enkidu about what he has seen in the underworld.\\r\\nThis version of the epic, called in some fragments Surpassing all other kings, is composed of tablets and fragments from diverse origins and states of conservation.[6]:101ÿ26 It remains incomplete in its majority, with several tablets missing and big lacunae in those found. They are named after their current location or the place where they were found.\\r\\nSurpassing all other kings Tablet II, greatly correlates with tablets I-II of the standard version. Gilgamesh tells his mother Ninsun about two dreams he had. His mother explains that they mean that a new companion will soon arrive at Uruk. In the meanwhile the wild Enkidu and the priestess (here called Shamkatum) are making love. She tames him in company of the shepherds by offering him bread and beer. Enkidu helps the shepherds by guarding the sheep. They travel to Uruk to confront Gilgamesh and stop his abuses. Enkidu and Gilgamesh battle but Gilgamesh breaks off the fight. Enkidu praises Gilgamesh.\\r\\nSurpassing all other kings Tablet III, partially matches tablets II-III of the standard version. For reasons unknown (the tablet is partially broken) Enkidu is in a sad mood. In order to cheer him up Gilgamesh suggests going to the Pine Forest to cut down trees and kill Humbaba (known here as Huwawa). Enkidu protests, as he knows Huwawa and is aware of his power. Gilgamesh talks Enkidu into it with some words of encouragement, but Enkidu remains reluctant. They prepare, and call for the elders. The elders also protest, but after Gilgamesh talks to them, they agree to let him go. After Gilgamesh asks his god (Shamash) for protection and both equip, they leave with the elder's blessing and counsel.\\r\\nPossibly another version of the contents of the Yale Tablet, practically irrecoverable.\\r\\nIn the journey to the cedar forest and Huwawa, Enkidu interprets one of Gilgamesh's dreams.\\r\\nFragments from two different versions/tablets tell how Enkidu interprets one of Gilgamesh's dreams on the way to the Forest of Cedar, and their conversation when entering the forest.\\r\\nAfter defeating Huwawa, Gilgamesh refrains from slaying him, and urges Enkidu to hunt Huwawa's \\"seven auras\\". Enkidu convinces him to smite their enemy. After killing Huwawa and the auras, they chop down part of the forest and discover the gods' secret abode. The rest of the tablet is broken.\\r\\nThe auras are not referred to in the standard version, but are in one of the Sumerian poems.\\r\\nPartially overlapping the felling of the trees from the Ishchali tablet.\\r\\nPartially overlapping the standard version tablets IXÿX. Gilgamesh mourns the death of Enkidu wandering in his quest for immortality. Gilgamesh argues with Shamash about the futility of his quest. After a lacuna, Gilgamesh talks to Siduri about his quest and his journey to meet Utnapishtim (here called Uta-na'ishtim). Siduri attempts to dissuade Gilgamesh in his quest for immortality, urging him to be content with the simple pleasures of life.[2] After one more lacuna, Gilgamesh smashes the \\"stone ones\\" and talks to the ferryman Urshanabi (here called Sur-sunabu). After a short discussion, Sur-sunabu asks him to carve 300 oars so that they may cross the waters of death without needing the \\"stone ones\\". The rest of the tablet is missing.\\r\\nThe text on the Old Babylonian Meissner fragment (the larger surviving fragment of the Sippar tablet) has been used to reconstruct possible earlier forms of the Epic of Gilgamesh, and it has been suggested that a \\"prior form of the story ÿ earlier even than that preserved on the Old Babylonian fragment ÿ may well have ended with Siduri sending Gilgamesh back to Uruk...\\" and \\"Utnapistim was not originally part of the tale.\\"[17]\\r\\nThere are five extant Gilgamesh stories in the form of older poems in Sumerian.[6]:141ÿ208 These probably circulated independently, rather than being in the form of a unified epic. Some of the names of the main characters in these poems differ slightly from later Akkadian names; for example, \\"Bilgamesh\\" is written instead of \\"Gilgamesh\\", and there are some differences in the underlying stories such as the fact that Enkidu is Gilgamesh's servant in the Sumerian version:\\r\\nVarious themes, plot elements, and characters in the Epic of Gilgamesh have counterparts in the Hebrew Biblenotably, the accounts of the Garden of Eden, the advice from Ecclesiastes, and the Genesis flood narrative.\\r\\nThe parallels between the stories of Enkidu/Shamhat and Adam/Eve have been long recognized by scholars.[19][20] In both, a man is created from the soil by a god, and lives in a natural setting amongst the animals. He is introduced to a woman who tempts him. In both stories the man accepts food from the woman, covers his nakedness, and must leave his former realm, unable to return. The presence of a snake that steals a plant of immortality from the hero later in the epic is another point of similarity.\\r\\nSeveral scholars suggest direct borrowing of Siduri's advice by the author of Ecclesiastes.[21]\\r\\nA rare proverb about the strength of a triple-stranded rope, \\"a triple-stranded rope is not easily broken\\", is common to both books.\\r\\nAndrew George submits that the Genesis flood narrative matches that in Gilgamesh so closely that \\"few doubt\\" that it derives from a Mesopotamian account.[22] What is particularly noticeable is the way the Genesis flood story follows the Gilgamesh flood tale \\"point by point and in the same order\\", even when the story permits other alternatives.[23] In a 2001 Torah commentary released on behalf of the Conservative Movement of Judaism, rabbinic scholar Robert Wexler stated: \\"The most likely assumption we can make is that both Genesis and Gilgamesh drew their material from a common tradition about the flood that existed in Mesopotamia. These stories then diverged in the retelling.\\"[24] Ziusudra, Utnapishtim and Noah are the respective heroes of the Sumerian, Akkadian and biblical flood legends of the ancient Near East.\\r\\nMatthias Henze suggests that Nebuchadnezzar's madness in the biblical Book of Daniel draws on the Epic of Gilgamesh. He claims that the author uses elements from the description of Enkidu to paint a sarcastic and mocking portrait of the king of Babylon.[25]\\r\\nWhile not directly discussed in the Epic itself, many of the characters in the Epic also have myths associated with them with close biblical parallels, notably Ninti, the Sumerian goddess of life, was created from Enki's rib to heal him after he had eaten forbidden flowers. Some scholars suggest that this served as the basis for the story of Eve created from Adam's rib in the Book of Genesis.[26] Esther J. Hamori, in Echoes of Gilgamesh in Jacob Story, also claims that the myth of Jacob and Esau is paralleled with the wrestling match between Gilgamesh and Enkidu.\\r\\nNumerous scholars have drawn attention to various themes, episodes, and verses, indicating that the Epic of Gilgamesh had a substantial influence on both of the epic poems ascribed to Homer. These influences are detailed by Martin Litchfield West in The East Face of Helicon: West Asiatic Elements in Greek Poetry and Myth.[27] According to Tzvi Abusch of Brandeis University, the poem \\"combines the power and tragedy of the Iliad with the wanderings and marvels of the Odyssey. It is a work of adventure, but is no less a meditation on some fundamental issues of human existence.\\"[28]\\r\\nThe Epic of Gilgamesh has inspired many works of literature, art, and music, as Theodore Ziolkowski points out in his book Gilgamesh Among Us: Modern Encounters With the Ancient Epic (2011).[29][30] It was only after the First World War that the Gilgamesh epic reached a wide audience, and only after the Second World War that it began to feature in a variety of genres.[30]","input":"What type of epic is the epic of gilgamesh?"},{"output":"ϫ-tocopherol","context":"Vitamin E refers to a group of compounds that include both tocopherols and tocotrienols.[1][2] Of the many different forms of vitamin E, -tocopherol is the most common form found in the North American diet.[3] -Tocopherol can be found in corn oil, soybean oil, margarine, and dressings.[3][4] ϫ-tocopherol, the most biologically active form of vitamin E, is the second-most common form of vitamin E in the diet. This variant can be found most abundantly in wheat germ oil, sunflower, and safflower oils.[3][5] As a fat-soluble antioxidant, it interrupts the propagation of reactive oxygen species that spread through biological membranes or through a fat when its lipid content undergoes oxidation by reacting with more-reactive lipid radicals to form more stable products.[3][6][1] U.S. and European Union recommendations are to consume, respectively, 15 mg/day or 11 mg/day (female) and 13 mg/day (male).[7][8]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nVitamin E has many biological functions, including its role as a fat-soluble antioxidant.[1][9]\\r\\nAlthough most vitamin E supplementation studies used ϫ-tocopherol individually, this design of studying only one isoform of vitamin E may introduce errors in interpreting overall vitamin E effects; for example, using only ϫ-tocopherol in studies of inflammation can reduce serum - and Ѵ-tocopherol concentrations.[23] Moreover, a 2013 review involving single long-term supplementation with ϫ-tocopherol showed that many clinical studies revealed an inverse relationship between supplementation and cardiovascular disease risk or mortality, but other studies showed no effect.[24]\\r\\nVitamin E deficiency is rare in humans, occurring as a consequence of abnormalities in dietary fat absorption or metabolism rather than from a diet low in vitamin E.[7] It can cause nerve problems due to poor conduction of electrical impulses along nerves due to changes in nerve membrane structure and function. Vitamin E deficiency can cause: peripheral neuropathy, myopathies, ataxia, retinopathy, impairment of immune responses and red blood cell destruction.[1][7][22][25][26]\\r\\nVitamin E supplementation has not been shown to have significant benefit for people who are healthy, and appears to be harmful.[27][28] It does not improve blood sugar control in an unselected group of people with diabetes mellitus[29] or decrease the risk of stroke.[30] Daily supplementation of vitamin E does not decrease the risk of prostate cancer, and may increase it.[1][31] Studies on its role in age-related macular degeneration are ongoing, though if it is of a combination of dietary antioxidants used to treat the condition it may increase the risk.[32] Routine supplementation with vitamin E during pregnancy has been shown to offer no benefit to the mother or the child. Vitamin E has been reported to cause more side effects, such as abdominal pain in pregnant women, and also the increased risk of having early rupture of membranes at term.[33] Supplementary Vitamin E, along with -carotene and vitamin C, has shown no protective effect on reducing the risk of cataract, cataract extraction, progression of cataract, and slowing the loss of visual acuity.[34] A meta-analysis showed no association between vitamin E supplementation and cardiovascular mortality.[35] A 2015 systematic review found that it may improve endothelial function as determined by measurements of forearm blood flow, but when combined with vitamin C supplementation, it did not.[36]\\r\\nAlthough there is widespread use of vitamin E as a topical medication, with claims for improved wound healing and reduced scar tissue, reviews have repeatedly concluded that there is insufficient evidence to support these claims.[37][38]\\r\\nThe US Food and Nutrition Board has set a Tolerable upper intake level (UL) at 1,000?mg (1,500 IU) per day.[7] The European Food Safety Authority reviewed the same safety question and set a UL at 300?mg/day.[39] Vitamin E can act as an anticoagulant, increasing the risk of bleeding, specifically acting synergistically with the blood-thinner, warfarin, which acts as a vitamin K antagonist.[1] From a 1982 review, vitamin E was reported as not having an anti-coagulation effect in humans who were vitamin K status sufficient.[40]\\r\\nAlthough functioning as an antioxidant when consumed in amounts available from foods, in high doses possible with dietary supplement products, vitamin E can have prooxidant properties, possibly causing oxidation which may damage cells and increase the risk of cancer. Supplementation with vitamin E is not indicated during treatment with chemotherapy or radiotherapy.[1] Long-term use of high doses may cause nausea, diarrhea and blurred vision.[citation needed] The US National Institutes of Health, Office of Dietary Supplements, summarizes the research on health risks from excessive vitamin E.[1]\\r\\nThe U.S. Institute of Medicine (IOM) updated Estimated Average Requirements (EARs) and Recommended Dietary Allowances (RDAs) for vitamin E in 2000. The current EAR for vitamin E for women and men ages 14 and up is 12?mg/day. The RDA is 15?mg/day. RDAs are higher than EARs so as to identify amounts that will cover people with higher than average requirements. RDA for pregnancy is 15?mg/day. RDA for lactation is 19?mg/day. For infants up to 12 months the Adequate Intake (AI) is 4ÿ5?mg/day. For children ages 1ÿ13 years the RDA increases with age from 6 to 11?mg/day. As for safety, the IOM sets Tolerable upper intake levels (ULs) for vitamins and minerals when evidence is sufficient. Hemorrhagic effects in rats were selected as the critical endpoint to calculate the UL via starting with the lowest-observed-adverse-effect-level (LOAEL) and processing that through an uncertainty factor calculation. The end result was the UL set at 1000?mg/day.[7] Collectively the EARs, RDAs, AIs and ULs are referred to as Dietary Reference Intakes (DRIs).[7]\\r\\nThe European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) refers to the collective set of information as Dietary Reference Values, with Population Reference Intake (PRI) instead of RDA, and Average Requirement instead of EAR. AI and UL defined the same as in United States. For women and men ages 10 and older the PRIs are set at 11 and 13?mg/day, respectively. PRI for pregnancy is 11?mg/day, for lactation 11?mg/day. For children ages 1ÿ9 years the PRIs increase with age from 6 to 9?mg/day. These PRIs are lower than the U.S. RDAs.[8] The European Food Safety Authority reviewed the same safety question and set a UL at 300?mg/day. The EU used an effect on blood clotting as a critical effect, identified that no adverse effects were observed in a human trial as 540 mg/day, used an uncertainty factor of 2 to get to a suggest UL of 270 mg/day, then rounded up to 300 mg/day.[39]\\r\\nThe Japan National Institute of Health and Nutrition set lower AIs than the US RDAs or EU PRIs, and intermediate ULs: 6.5 mg/day (females) and 7.0 mg/day (males) for adult AIs, and 650-700 mg/day (females) and 750-900 mg/day (males) for adult ULs, amount depending on age.[41] India recommends an intake of 8-10 mg/day and does not set a UL.[42]\\r\\nA worldwide summary of more than one hundred studies reported a median dietary intake of 6.2 mg/d for alpha-tocopherol.[43] Government survey results in the US reported average consumption for adult females at 8.4 mg/d and adult males 10.4 mg/d.[44] Average consumption is below recommendations.\\r\\nFor U.S. food and dietary supplement labeling purposes the amount in a serving is expressed as a percent of Daily Value (%DV). For vitamin E labeling purposes 100% of the Daily Value was 30 IU, but as of May 27, 2016 it was revised to 15 mg to bring it into agreement with the RDA.[45] A table of the old and new adult Daily Values is provided at Reference Daily Intake. The original deadline to be in compliance was July 28, 2018, but on September 29, 2017 the FDA released a proposed rule that extended the deadline to January 1, 2020 for large companies and January 1, 2021 for small companies.[46] European Union regulations require that labels declare energy, protein, fat, saturated fat, carbohydrates, sugars, and salt. Voluntary nutrients may be shown if present in significant amounts. Instead of Daily Values, amounts are shown as percent of Reference Intakes (RIs). For vitamin E, 100% RI was set at 12 mg in 2011.[47]\\r\\nVitamin E is fat soluble, so dietary supplement products are usually in the form of the vitamin dissolved in vegetable oil in a softgel capsule. For alpha-tocopherol, amounts range from 100 to 1000 IU per serving. Smaller amounts are incorporated into multi-vitamin/mineral tablets. Gamma-tocopherol and tocotrienol supplements are available from a few dietary supplement companies.\\r\\nThe World Health Organization does not have any recommendations for food fortification with vitamin E.[49] The Food Fortification Initiative does not list any countries that have mandatory or voluntary programs for vitamin E.[50] There are breakfast cereals fortified with minerals and vitamins, including vitamin E.\\r\\nThe nutritional content of vitamin E is defined by ϫ-tocopherol activity. The molecules that contribute ϫ-tocopherol activity are four tocopherols and four tocotrienols, identified by the prefixes alpha- (ϫ-), beta- (-), gamma- (-), and delta- (Ѵ-).[51] Natural tocopherols occur in the RRR-configuration only. The synthetic form contains eight different stereoisomers and is called 'all-rac'-ϫ-tocopherol.[52]\\r\\nalpha-Tocopherol is a lipid-soluble antioxidant functioning within the glutathione peroxidase pathway,[53] and protecting cell membranes from oxidation by reacting with lipid radicals produced in the lipid peroxidation chain reaction.[3][54] This removes the free radical intermediates and prevents the oxidation reaction from continuing. The oxidized ϫ-tocopheroxyl radicals produced in this process may be recycled back to the active reduced form through reduction by other antioxidants, such as ascorbate, retinol or ubiquinol.[55] Other forms of vitamin E have their own unique properties; for example, -tocopherol is a nucleophile that can react with electrophilic mutagens.[56]\\r\\nThe four tocotrienols (alpha, beta, gamma, delta) are similar in structure to the four tocopherols, with the main difference being that the former have hydrophobic side chains with three carbon-carbon double bonds, whereas the tocopherols have saturated side chains. For alpha(ϫ)-tocotrienol each of the three \\"R\\" sites has a methyl group (CH3) attached. For beta()-tocotrienol: R1 = Methyl, R2 = H, R3= Methyl. For gamma()-tocotrienol: R1 = H, R2 = Methyl, R3= Methyl. For delta(Ѵ)-tocotrienol: R1 = H, R2 = H, R3= Methyl. Palm oil is a source. Preliminary clinical trials on dietary supplement tocotrienols indicate potential for anti-disease activity.[57]\\r\\nCystic fibrosis and other fat malabsorption conditions can result in low serum vitamin E and dietary supplements will raise serum vitamin E.[7] A normal range for serum alpha-tocopherol has been described as 5ÿ20 mg/L and low as < 2.0 mg/L.[7] A worldwide summary of more than one hundred studies reported a median of 9.5 mg/L for alpha-tocopherol and a desired range of more than 12.9 mg/L (30 mol/L).[43]\\r\\nVitamin E was discovered in 1922 by Herbert McLean Evans and Katharine Scott Bishop[58] and first isolated in a pure form by Evans and Gladys Anderson Emerson in 1935 at the University of California, Berkeley.[59] Because the vitamin activity was first identified as a dietary fertility factor (in rats) it was given the name \\"tocopherol\\" from the Greek words \\"??\\" [t܇kos, birth], and \\"?Ϛ\\", [phrein, to bear or carry] meaning in sum \\"to carry a pregnancy,\\" with the ending \\"-ol\\" signifying its status as a chemical alcohol. George M. Calhoun, Professor of Greek as the University of California, was credited with helping with the naming process.[60] Erhard Fernholz elucidated its structure in 1938 and shortly afterwards the same year, Paul Karrer and his team first synthesized it.[61]\\r\\nNearly 50 years after the discovery of vitamin E an editorial in the Journal of the American Medical Association titled \\"Vitamin in search of a disease\\" read in part \\"...research revealed many of the vitamin's secrets, but no certain therapeutic use and no definite deficiency diease in man.\\" The animal discovery experiments had been a requirement for successful pregnancy, but no benefits were observed for women prone to miscarriage. Evidence for vascular health was characterized as unconvincing. The editorial closed with mention of some preliminary human evidence for protection against hemolytic anemia in young children.[62]\\r\\nA role for vitamin E in coronary heart disease had first been proposed in 1946.[63][64] More cardiovascular work from the same research group followed,[65] including a proposal that megadoses of vitamin E could slow down and even reverse the development of atherosclerosis.[66] However, a 2004 meta-analysis showed no association between vitamin E supplementation and cardiovascular events (nonfatal stroke or myocardial infarction) or cardiovascular mortality.[35] There is a long history of belief that topical application of vitamin E containing oil benefits burn and wound healing. This belief persists even though scientific reviews repeatedly refuted this claim.[37][38][67]\\r\\nThe role of vitamin E in infant nutrition has a long research history. From 1949 onward there were trials with premature infants suggesting that oral alpha-tocopherol was protective against edema, intracranial hemorrhage, hemolytic anemia and retrolental fibroplasia.[68] A 2003 Cochrane review concluded that vitamin E supplementation in preterm infants reduced the risk of intercranial hemorrhage and retinopathy, but noted an increased risk of sepsis.[69]","input":"The most active form of vitamin e is?"},{"output":"Scottish writer Thomas Carlyle","context":"The great man theory is a 19th-century idea according to which history can be largely explained by the impact of great men, or heroes; highly influential individuals who, due to either their personal charisma, intelligence, wisdom, or political skill used their power in a way that had a decisive historical impact. The theory was popularized in the 1840s by Scottish writer Thomas Carlyle, but in 1860 Herbert Spencer formulated a counter-argument that has remained influential throughout the 20th century to the present: Spencer said that such great men are the products of their societies, and that their actions would be impossible without the social conditions built before their lifetimes.[1][2][3]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCarlyle stated that \\"The history of the world is but the biography of great men\\", reflecting his belief that heroes shape history through both their personal attributes and divine inspiration.[4][5] In his book On Heroes, Hero-Worship and the Heroic in History, Carlyle saw history as having turned on the decisions of \\"heroes\\", giving detailed analysis of the influence of several such men (including Muhammad, Shakespeare, Luther, Rousseau, Pericles, Napoleon, and Wagner). Carlyle also felt that the study of great men was \\"profitable\\" to one's own heroic side; that by examining the lives led by such heroes, one could not help but uncover something about one's true nature.[6]\\r\\nAmerican scholar Frederick Adams Woods supported the great man theory in his work The Influence of Monarchs: Steps in a New Science of History.[7] Woods investigated 386 rulers in Western Europe from the 12th century until the French revolution in the late 18th century and their influence on the course of historical events.\\r\\nThis theory is usually contrasted with \\"history from below\\", which emphasises the life of the legion over the leader. An overwhelming wave of smaller events causes certain developments to occur. The Great Man approach to history was most fashionable with professional historians in the 19th century; a popular work of this school is the Encyclop?dia Britannica Eleventh Edition (1911) which contains lengthy and detailed biographies about the great men of history, but very few general or social histories. For example, all information on the post-Roman \\"Migrations Period\\" of European History is compiled under the biography of Attila the Hun. This heroic view of history was also strongly endorsed by some philosophers, such as Leon Bloy, Hegel, Kierkegaard, Nietzsche, Spengler and Max Weber,[8][9][10] but it fell out of favor after World War II.[citation needed]\\r\\nIn Untimely Meditations, Nietzsche writes that: \\"... the goal of humanity lies in its highest specimens\\".[11]\\r\\nIn Fear and Trembling, Kierkegaard writes that: \\"...to be able to fall down in such a way that the same second it looks as if one were standing and walking, to transform the leap of life into a walk, absolutely to express the sublime and the pedestrianthat only these knights of faith can dothis is the one and only prodigy.\\"[12]\\r\\nHegel, proceeding from providentialist theory, argued that \\"what is real is reasonable\\" and World-Historical individuals are World-Spirit's agents. Hegel wrote: \\"Such are great historical menwhose own particular aims involve those large issues which are the will of the World-Spirit.\\"[13] Thus, according to Hegel, a great man does not create historical reality himself but only uncovers the inevitable future.\\r\\nOne of the most forceful critics of Carlyle's formulation of the great man theory was Herbert Spencer, who believed that attributing historical events to the decisions of individuals was a hopelessly primitive, childish, and unscientific position.[14] He believed that the men Carlyle called \\"great men\\" were merely products of their social environment:\\r\\nYou must admit that the genesis of a great man depends on the long series of complex influences which has produced the race in which he appears, and the social state into which that race has slowly grown.... Before he can remake his society, his society must make him.\\r\\nTolstoy's War and Peace features criticism of Great Man Theories as a recurring theme in the philosophical digressions. According to Tolstoy, the significance of great individuals is imaginary; as a matter of fact they are only history's slaves realizing the decree of Providence.[16]\\r\\nWilliam James in his lecture \\"Great Men and Their Environment\\"[17] underlined the importance of the Great Man's congruence with the surroundings (in the broad sense), though his ultimate point was that environments and individuals shape each other reciprocally, just as environments and individual members of animal species do according to Darwinian theory.\\r\\nAmong modern critics of the theory of great man, one, Sidney Hook, is supportive of the idea; he gives credit to those who shape events through their actions, and his book The Hero in History is devoted to the role of the hero and in history and influence of the outstanding persons.[18]\\r\\nLeonid Grinin defines a historical figure (a great man) thus:\\r\\nOwing to his personal features, or to a chance, or to his social standing, or to the peculiarity of the epoch, an individual by the very fact of his existence, by his ideas or actions (or inaction) directly or indirectly, during his lifetime or after his death may have such an influence upon his own or another society which can be recognized significant as he left a noticeable mark (positive, negative or unambiguous) in history and in the further development of society.[19]\\r\\nSo, he concludes that the role of great man depends on a number of factors, not none at all.","input":"Who developed the great man theory of leadership?"},{"output":"eight","context":"Taboo is a British television drama programme produced by Scott Free London and Hardy Son & Baker for BBC One and FX.

Their critical consensus reads, \\"After a sluggish start, Taboo takes a hold as a mysterious, dark, and often brutal period drama with plenty of promise as a series?ÿ most notably Tom Hardy's exceptionally watchable performance\\".[16] On review aggregator Metacritic, the series has a score of 67 out of 100 based on 32 critics, indicating \\"generally favorable reviews\\".[17]\\r\\nBen Lawrence of The Telegraph gave Taboo 3 out of 5 stars, stating that Taboo's strength is that, despite borrowing from westerns, gangster flicks and even Dickens, it still manages to feel utterly original.[18] Sam Wollaston of The Guardian noted that while some of the dialogue does make you wince, Hardy's acting and onscreen presence more than makes up for it.[19]\\r\\nWriting for The Hollywood Reporter, Tim Goodman noted that Taboo is a solid if slow, in the early going, entry in FX's stable of series, with a compelling turn by Tom Hardy.[15] Kevin Yeoman of Screenrant wrote in his review that it all added up to a dark, slow-moving but nonetheless intriguing drama with secrets to dispense in due time. He also said that it was likely that those drawn to Hardys onscreen intensity and seemingly unlimited capacity to become the physical embodiment of gloomy menace would be the ones most likely to stick around until the very end, and in doing so would reap the potential rewards.[14]\\r\\nSome historians have expressed concern that the East India Company may be portrayed inaccurately.[20] Before the broadcast of Taboo, Steven Knight said, \\"This man, James Delaney, is a deeply flawed and deeply troubled human being. His greatest struggle will be against the East India Company which, throughout the 19th century, was the equivalent of the CIA, the NSA, and the biggest, baddest multinational corporation on earth, all rolled into one self-righteous, religiously-motivated monolith.\\" Tirthankar Roy, an economic historian at the London School of Economics, argued that it gave an excessively negative view of the East India Company. Nick Robins, author of The Corporation That Changed the World, added that the organisation had made a positive contribution, but that by the time it was dissolved it had long \\"outlived its usefulness\\".[20] A lecturer at Manchester Business School, Matthew McCaffrey, considers Taboo to portray monopolies realistically.[21]","input":"How many series of taboo will there be?"},{"output":"A Dance with Dragons","context":"The Winds of Winter is the planned sixth novel in the epic fantasy series A Song of Ice and Fire by George R.

And then take it from there.\\"[2] A Victarion Greyjoy chapter will begin five minutes after the end of A Dance with Dragons, taking place on the eve of the Iron Islanders' arrival in Slaver's Bay.[6] Arianne Martell sample chapters that Martin released on his website showed her heading for Griffin's Roost to see the young man who is calling himself Aegon.[7][8]\\r\\nGeorge R. R. Martin has confirmed that the following characters have point-of-view chapters in The Winds of Winter:\\r\\nGeorge R. R. Martin confirmed that there are no new viewpoint characters intended for The Winds of Winter.[25] Martin confirmed that Areo Hotah[26] and Melisandre[27] will return as viewpoints but did not state which novel their chapters will appear in, and that Bran Stark[28] will appear in the novel, but did not elaborate if as a viewpoint. In addition, he teased at the 2014 San Diego Comic-Con that Jeyne Westerling, Robb Stark's widow, will appear in the prologue chapter, but did not reveal who will be the POV character.[29]\\r\\nThe Winds of Winter[9] was originally intended, in the very early stages of the series, to be the final installment of A Song of Ice and Fire (then conceived as a trilogy).[30] Following his expansion of the series, Martin eventually concluded it would be succeeded by one final novel, A Dream of Spring.[31] By June 2010, Martin had finished four chapters for The Winds of Winter from the viewpoints of Sansa Stark, Arya Stark, and Arianne Martell.[9] In July 2010, he added an Aeron Greyjoy chapter that had been moved from A Dance with Dragons to The Winds of Winter, accumulating around 100 completed manuscript pages.[16] Following the publication of A Dance with Dragons in the summer of 2011, Martin announced his return to writing the series in January 2012,[3] having spent the intervening time on his U.S. and overseas book publicity tours and attending various conventions. He continued to work, with his two co-authors Elio Garcia and Linda Antonsson, on the planned illustrated series companion guide The World of Ice & Fire concordance and Westeros history, which at one time he wanted to have completed by the end of 2011. He also worked on a Westeros story, the fourth Tales of Dunk and Egg novella, that will eventually find anthology publication elsewhere. A year after that eventual publication, the story and the three previously published Dunk and Egg tales will be collected and published in the U.S. by Bantam Spectra as a stand-alone fix-up novel.[32]\\r\\nIn December 2011, Martin posted a Theon Greyjoy viewpoint chapter from The Winds of Winter; he also announced that another sample chapter would be included at the end of the North American paperback version of A Dance with Dragons,[2][33] which was originally expected to be released in summer 2012,[2] but was released on October 29, 2013.[34] (International paperback editions of A Dance with Dragons published a year earlier did not include a new, as yet unpublished sample chapter.)[35] In the first quarter of 2012, Martin read new chapters of other characters at public events, including the chapters of Victarion Greyjoy and Tyrion Lannister.[20] Martin continued work editing anthologies and completing a large, highly detailed series atlas The Lands of Ice and Fire, which was published in October 2012.[36][37] Martin published another sample chapter from Arianne Martell's POV on his website in January 2013.[7] On March 27, ten days before the Game of Thrones season four premiere, Martin posted a chapter on his website, titled Mercy. Martin said the new chapter is actually an old one, though never published nor publicly read.[11] In April 2015, Martin posted a Sansa Stark viewpoint chapter from The Winds of Winter titled Alayne.[10] In May 2016, Martin replaced this chapter with an Arianne Martell chapter he had read from at Mysticon,[15] and an Aeron Greyjoy chapter that was removed from A Dance with Dragons was read at Balticon.\\r\\nAs of June 2016, a total of 11 chapters from The Winds of Winter have been either read publicly or published as a sample chapter. The point of view characters with released material are Victarion, Aeron, Tyrion, Barristan, Arianne, Theon, Mercy (Arya), and Alayne (Sansa).[38] Several websites, including Goodreads, have dedicated entire discussion panels to any material that has been released from The Winds of Winter, including plot twists, theories, and speculations.\\r\\nAt Guadalajara International Book Fair 2016, George R.R. Martin gave some clues about the dark nature of The Winds of Winter: ... \\"Ive been telling you for 20 years that winter was coming. Winter is the time when things die, and cold and ice and darkness fill the world, so this is not going to be the happy feel-good that people may be hoping for.

But, as Martin stated in a 2011 interview, \\"Three years from now when I'm sitting on 1,800 pages of manuscript with no end in sight, who the hell knows\\".[40] In April 2011, shortly before the publication of A Dance with Dragons which took him six years to write, Martin hoped that \\"the last two books will go a little quicker than this one has\\" and estimated that it would take \\"three years to finish the next one at a good pace\\".[41][42] By October 2012, 400 pages of the sixth novel had been written, although Martin considered only the first 200 as \\"really finished\\", the rest still needing revisions.[43] In April 2013, Martin estimated that he had a quarter of the book.[44] In the past, Martin has angered some of his fan base for repeatedly estimating his publication dates too optimistically; therefore, he has refrained from making hard estimates for The Winds of Winter's final release date.[3] Ultimately the book \\"will be done when it's done\\".[30] In 2012, Martin had acknowledged his concerns about the final novel, A Dream of Spring, not being completed by the time Game of Thrones catches up in its story line to the novels.[45]\\r\\nIn January 2014, Martin's UK publisher, Jane Johnson, declared on Twitter that the book would \\"certainly\\" not be published before 2015.[46] In September 2014 Johnson stated that the book was \\"not a 2015 release\\",[47] a statement she repeated in January 2015.[48][49] In April 2015, Martin commented on his blog that The Winds of Winter will not be eligible for the 2016 Hugo Award which is awarded for science fiction or fantasy works of the previous year[50] but he also said he would like to have it published before the sixth season of the HBO series Game of Thrones (which would cover material from the book) aired in 2016.[51][52] In Autumn 2015, statements made by the Spanish editor and the Polish translator of the novel indicated that it was expected to be published in 2016.[53][54][55][56]\\r\\nIn early January 2016, Martin confirmed on his Live Journal that he had not met an end-of-year deadline that he had established with his publisher for release of the book before the sixth season of the HBO show. He added that there was \\"a lot still left to write\\" and that completion of the book was \\"months away still... if the writing goes well\\". Martin also revealed there had been a previous deadline of October 2015 that he had considered achievable in May 2015, and that in September 2015 he had still considered the end-of-year deadline achievable. He further confirmed that some of the plot of the book might be revealed in the upcoming season of Game of Thrones[57] but one of the showrunners, David Benioff, claimed that while certain key elements would be the same, the show would diverge from the book in many respects.[58] In February 2016, Martin stated that he had dropped all his editing projects except for Wild Cards, and that he would not be writing any teleplays, screenplays, short stories, introductions or forewords before delivering The Winds of Winter.[59]\\r\\nIn September 2014, Walt Hickey of FiveThirtyEight and Christopher Ingraham of the Washington Post estimated the release date sometime between 2015 and 2018, based on extrapolation of Martin's writing pace.[4][5] In 2017, Goodreads advertised its expected publication in 2020.[60]\\r\\nOn January 10, 2017, Martin announced on his blog in a response to a comment that he believed that The Winds of Winter will be released \\"this year\\", referring to 2017.

It is played on courses consisting of a series of holes (usually a multiple of 9) similar to its parent, but characterized by their short length (usually within 10 yards from tee to cup), the use of artificial putting surfaces such as carpet, astroturf and/or concrete, a geometric layout often requiring non-traditional putting lines such as bank shots, and artificial obstacles such as tunnels/tubes, ramps, concrete/metal/fiberglass forms, and moving obstacles such as windmills. When miniature golf retains many of these characteristics but without the use of any props or obstacles, it is purely a mini version of its parent game.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nWhile the international sports organization World Minigolf Sport Federation (WMF)[1] prefers to use the name \\"minigolf\\", the general public in different countries has also many other names for the game: miniature golf, mini-golf, midget golf, goofy golf, shorties, extreme golf, crazy golf, adventure golf, mini-putt, putter golf and so on. The name Putt-Putt is the trademark of an American company[2] that builds and franchises miniature golf courses in addition to other family-oriented entertainment, and the term \\"putt-putt\\" is sometimes used colloquially to refer to the game itself. The term \\"Minigolf\\" was formerly a registered trademark of a Swedish company that built its own patented type of minigolf courses. Resort towns such as Myrtle Beach, South Carolina; Branson, Missouri; Pigeon Forge, Tennessee; and Wisconsin Dells, Wisconsin are known for their numerous minigolf courses.[3]\\r\\nGeometrically-shaped minigolf courses made of artificial materials (carpet) began to emerge during the early 20th century. The earliest documented mention of such a course is in the 8 June 1912 edition of The Illustrated London News, which introduces a minigolf course called Gofstacle.[4]\\r\\nThe first standardized minigolf courses to enter commercial mass-production were the Thistle Dhu (\\"This'll Do\\") course 1916 in Pinehurst, North Carolina, and the 1927 Tom Thumb patent of Garnet Carter from Lookout Mountain, Tennessee. Thomas McCulloch Fairbairn (inventor), a golf fanatic, revolutionized the game in 1922 with his formulation of a suitable artificial greena mixture of cottonseed hulls, sand, oil, and dye. With this discovery, miniature golf became accessible everywhere; by the late 1920s there were over 150 rooftop courses in New York City alone, and tens of thousands across the United States.[5] This American minigolf boom of early 20th century came to an end during the economic depression in the late 1930s. Nearly all minigolf courses in the United States were closed and demolished before the end of the 1930s.[6] A rare surviving example from this period is the Parkside Whispering Pines Miniature Golf Course located near Rochester, New York, and listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2002.[7]\\r\\nThe first miniature golf course in Canada was at the Maples Inn in Pointe-Claire, Quebec. The \\"Mapes\\" was constructed as a summer home in the 1890s but was renovated into a club in 1902, opened to the public in 1914, and had a miniature golf course in 1930. The popular nightspot burned in 1985. (See: West Island Chronicle, June 29, 2008.)\\r\\nOne of the first documented minigolf courses in mainland Europe was built in 1926 by Fr. Schr?der in Hamburg, Germany. Mr. Schr?der had been inspired by his visit to the United States, where he had seen minigolf courses spreading across the country.[8]\\r\\nIn 1930 Edwin O. Norrman and Eskil Norman returned to Sweden from the United States, where they had stayed for several years and witnessed the golden days of the American minigolf boom. In 1931 they founded a company \\"Norman och Norrmans Miniatyrgolf\\", and began manufacturing standardized minigolf courses for the Swedish market. During the following years they spread this new leisure activity across Sweden, by installing minigolf courses in public parks and other suitable locations.[8]\\r\\nSwedish minigolf courses typically had a rectangular wooden frame surrounding the playing area made of tennis field sand[9] (while the American manufacturers used newly developed and patented felt as the surface of their minigolf courses). Felt did not become popular as a surface material in Sweden until in the mid-1960sbut since then it has become practically the only surface material used in Scandinavia and Britain, due to its favorable playing qualities in wet weather. (Minigolf courses with a felt surface can be played in rainy weather, because water soaks through the felt into the ground. The other commonly used surface materials, beton and eternite, cannot be used in rainy weather, because the rainwater pools on them, stopping the ball from rolling.)\\r\\nThe Swedish Minigolf Federation (Svenska Bangolff?rbundet)[10] was founded in 1937, being the oldest minigolf sport organization in the world. National Swedish championships in minigolf have been played yearly since 1939.[11] In other countries minigolf sport federations were not founded until the late 1950s, due to the post-war economical depression.\\r\\nIn 1954, the minigolf course in Ascona (Switzerland) opened, the oldest course worldwide following the norms of Paul Bongni.\\r\\nThe earliest documented minigolf competitions were played in the United States. The first National Tom Thumb Open minigolf tournament was arranged in 1930, with a total cash purse $10,000 (the top prize being $2,000). Qualification play-offs were played in all of the 48 states, and the final competition on Lookout Mountain, Chattanooga, Tennessee attracted over 200 players representing thirty states.[12] After the Depression ten years later, minigolf died out as a competition sport in America, and has begun to recover only during the most recent decades. The American minigolf sport boom of the 1930s inspired many European countries, and the sport of minigolf lived on in Europe even after the American game fell into Depression.\\r\\nIn 1938 Joseph and Robert Taylor from Binghamton, New York started building and operating their own miniature golf courses. These courses differed from the ones in the late 20s and early 30s; they were no longer just rolls, banks, and curves, with an occasional pipe thrown in. Their courses not only had landscaping, but also obstacles, including windmills, castles, and wishing wells.\\r\\nImpressed by the quality of the courses, many customers asked if the Taylors would build a course for them. By the early 1940s, Joe and Bob formed Taylor Brothers, and were in the business of building miniature golf courses and supplying obstacles to the industry. During both the Korean and Vietnam Wars, many a G.I. played on a Taylor Brothers prefabricated course that the U.S. Military had contracted to be built and shipped overseas.\\r\\nBy the late 50s almost all supply catalogs carried Taylor Brothers' obstacles. In 1961 Bob Taylor, Don Clayton of Putt-Putt, and Frank Abramoff of Arnold Palmer Miniature Golf organized the first miniature golf association known as NAPCOMS (or the \\"National Association of Putting Course Operators, Manufacturers, and Suppliers\\"). Their first meeting was held in New York City. Though this organization only lasted a few years it was the first attempt to bring miniature golf operators together to promote miniature golf.\\r\\nIn 1955, Lomma Golf, Inc., founded by Al Lomma and his brother Ralph Lomma, led the revival of wacky, animated trick hazards. These hazards required both accurately aimed shots and split-second timing to avoid spinning windmill blades, revolving statuary, and other careening obstacles.\\r\\nThe book Tilting At Windmills (How I Learned To Stop Worrying And Love Sport) by Andy Miller tells the story of the formerly sports-hating author attempting to change by competing in miniature golf, including events in Denmark and Latvia.\\r\\nIn the United States, National Miniature Golf Day is held yearly on the second Saturday of May. The event had its inaugural celebration on May 12, 2007, and was officially recognized and published in 2008's edition of Chase's Calendar of Events.\\r\\nMinigolf has so far not reached wide popularity outside Europe and North America.[citation needed] The reason is probably economic, at least to some extent: the less wealthy countries invest their limited sports funds into such sports that enjoy widest public attention and media coverage, leaving the less popular sports with little or no funding at all. (Minigolf is one of the most popular outdoor games in Europe and America, though, but only as an occasional leisure activity, not as a competitive sport.)\\r\\nBy the 1950s the American Putt-Putt company was exporting their minigolf courses to South Africa, Australia, Japan, Korea, India, Iran, Italy, Pakistan, Argentina, Brazil, and the Eastern Bloc.[13] Minigolf courses are found in all parts of the world, but their popularity is by far highest in the USA, the UK, New Zealand, Scandinavia, and central Europe.[citation needed]\\r\\nThe sport of miniature golf is governed internationally by the World Minigolf Sport Federation (WMF), headquartered in G?teborg, Sweden. The WMF is a member of SportAccord. It organises World Championships for youth and elite players, and Continental Championships in Europe, Asia and the USA, held in alternate years.\\r\\nAll competitions approved by World Minigolfsport Federation are played on standardized courses, whose design has been checked to be suitable for competitive play. The WMF currently approves four different course types:\\r\\nThe world record on one round of minigolf is 18 strokes on 18 holes. More than a thousand players have officially achieved this score on eternite. On other playing systems a perfect round of 18 holes-in-one is extremely rare, and has never been scored in an official national or international tournament. Unofficial 18-rounds on concrete and felt courses have been reported in Sweden.[18]\\r\\nIn addition to classical outdoor miniature golf, indoor \\"glow in the dark\\" miniature golf has achieved some popularity, especially in colder climates like Canada[19] and Finland.[20] It can be played throughout the year, and climate control allows building elaborate obstacles that would not withstand inclement weather. There are also a variety of portable miniature golf fairways or 'tracks'[21] that can be set up as temporary courses indoors or outdoors. The fairways are usually constructed of wooden or glass fibre frames. Portable fairways are often used for summer festivals and fairs, corporate events, team-building events, and product launches.\\r\\nThe 18th and final holes of many miniature golf courses are designed to literally capture the ball, effectively preventing the player from playing additional rounds without purchasing another game. This may be accomplished with a \\"drain\\" or trap-door hole setup that channels the ball to a lockbox. One popular method of theming the 18th hole in the United States is to use a gated, ramped target area depicting the face of a clown; if the ball lands \\"in\\" the clown's nose, a bell might sound and the player would win a discount ticket for another game.\\r\\nNearly all European countries have an official national federation for promoting minigolf as a competition sport. The bi-annual European Championships attract competitors from more than twenty European countries. As of 2012, Chris Beattie has been the holder of the European Championship title.[22] Outside Europe only a small number of countries have participated in international minigolf competitions. These countries include USA, Japan, China, India and Taiwan. A national minigolf federation exists also in Moldova, Mexico, Australia and New Zealand, but none of these countries has ever participated in international competitions, and probably are not arranging many domestic competitions either.[23]\\r\\nWorld Minigolfsport Federation represents some 40,000 registered competition players from 37 countries.[24] The national minigolf federation of Germany has 11,000 members with a competing license,[25] and the Swedish federation has 8,000 registered competition players.[18] Other strong minigolf countries include Austria and Switzerland, each having a few thousand licensed competition players. Also Italy, Czech Republic and Netherlands have traditionally been able to send a strong team to international championships, even if they cannot count their licensed players in thousands.\\r\\nThe sceptre of competitive minigolf rests quite firmly in mainland Europe: no player from other countries (such as UK, USA, Japan et cetera) has ever reached even the top 50 in World Championships (in men's category).[22] Nearly all national federations outside Europe were founded only quite recently (within the last 10 years), and it will take time before the players of these countries learn all secrets of the game. USA has a longer history of minigolf competitions, but the standardized European competition courses are practically unknown in USA, and therefore the American players have been unable to learn the secrets of European minigolf. On the traditional American courses the best American players are able to challenge the European top players into a tough and exciting competition.[26]\\r\\nThe British Minigolf Association (BMGA) has an additional ÿ and quite surprising ÿ problem on their way to greater success in competitive minigolf. While the minigolf federations in mainland Europe receive annual funding from the government, in England the national sports organisation Sport England has refused to accept BMGA as its member ÿ which means that BMGA is left without the public funding that other forms of sports enjoy. The rules of Sport England declare that only one variant of each sport can be accepted as member ÿ and minigolf is interpreted as a variant of golf.[24]\\r\\nNo person is known to be earning his living by competing in minigolf. Many course owners and employees naturally earn their living by working at minigolf courses, and some of the best minigolf players earn their living from minigolf-related work, such as giving putting lessons to golf players.[27] Many miniature golf courses also offer other forms of entertainment such as carousels, go-cart tracks, batting cages, redemption arcades, etc.\\r\\nThe highest money prizes are paid in the United States, where the winner of a major competition may earn up to 5,000 US dollars. In mainland Europe the money prizes are generally quite low, and in many cases honor is the only thing at stake in the competition. International championships usually award no money prizes at all.\\r\\nIn the US there are two organizations offering national tournaments: the Professional Putters Association and the US Pro Mini-Golf Association (USPMGA). The USPMGA represents the United States in the World Minigolfsport Federation, having been an active member since 1995. USPMGA President Robert Detwiler is also the WMF representative for North and South America.\\r\\nNew Israeli Minigolf Association was established in February 2010 in Israel. Setting up, for the first time, league playing according to the rules of WMF and USPMGA. Now, a series of lush and inviting minigolf parks in prime locations are building around Israel and will be offering this need of adventure to the public at very attractive surrounding.\\r\\nWorld Minigolfsport Federation (WMF), a member of AGFIS, organises World Championships biennially (on odd-numbered years), while the continental championships in Europe and Asia are organized on even-numbered years. Many of these competitions are arranged for three age groups: juniors (under 20 years), adults (no age limit), and seniors (over 45 years).[28] Men and women compete separately in their own categories, except in some team competitions and pair competitions. The difference in the playing skills of men and women is very small on top level, however: it is not unheard-of that the best player in a major international tournament is female. Typically the winner in women's category would be very close to medals also in men's category.[29]\\r\\nWorld and European Championships have so far never been arranged on MOS courses (which are popular in USA and UK, and were approved by WMF for competition use only a few years ago). International competitions are typically arranged on two courses of 18 holes, of which one course is eternite, and the other course is usually concrete, less commonly felt. In the future, the WMF is expected to use also MOS courses in international championships ÿ which will give American and British players a chance to show their skills on their own traditional course types.\\r\\nThe most prestigious MOS minigolf competitions in the world are the US Masters, US Open, British Open, Kent Open, World Crazy Golf Championships and the World Adventuregolf Masters.","input":"Where is the oldest mini golf course located?"},{"output":"12 years of age or older but under the age of 16 years","context":"The age of consent in Africa for sexual activity varies by jurisdiction across the continent.

Maul offers Vizsla the chance to reclaim Mandalore by recruiting the Black Sun and Pyke crime families and Jabba the Hutt's minions to create the criminal syndicate named The Shadow Collective.\\r\\n\\r\\nFrom there, Maul engineers Vizsla's rise to power: he orders his henchmen to attack Mandalore so the Death Watch can arrest them and appear as heroes to the denizens who have long lived under Duchess Satine Kryze's pacifist rule. Vizsla betrays Maul, imprisoning both Savage and him. Easily breaking free, Maul challenges Vizsla to a duel to take over the Death Watch and Mandalore; he succeeds in killing Vizsla and then claims his former co-conspirator's darksaber.[clarification needed] He wins the loyalty of most Death Watch members, but Bo Katan retreats along with those loyal to their previous leader. Maul then puts the disgraced former prime minister Almec, whom Satine had imprisoned for corruption, in power as a puppet leader, solidifying his control over Mandalore. Maul then anticipates Satine being broken out of prison and her attempt to contact the Jedi Council as part of his plan to get Obi-Wan to Mandalore. Once Obi-Wan arrives and attempts to rescue Satine, Maul captures him and exacts revenge on the Jedi by murdering Satine right in front of him, hoping to make the Jedi suffer as much as he once did. Obi-Wan is later freed by the Night Owl rebels (Bo Katan's Death Watch faction) who request Republic aid.\\r\\n\\r\\nMaul senses Darth Sidious arriving on Mandalore. Although impressed with his former apprentice's survival, Sidious declares Maul a rival and uses the Force to push and choke him and Opress. He then engages them both in lightsaber combat, fatally injuring Opress. After Opress dies from his wounds, Sidious reminds Maul of the Rule of Two, and tells him that he has been replaced. Enraged, Maul pulls out both his lightsaber and darksaber?[clarification needed] and proceeds to fight Sidious on equal ground, but Sidious ultimately defeats him. Maul pleads for mercy, but Sidious ignores him and tortures him with blasts of Force lightning. Sidious reveals that he has no intention of killing Maul, remarking that he has other uses for his former apprentice.\\r\\n\\r\\nAn older Maul appears in the season 2 finale of Star Wars Rebels,[11] which takes place in between Revenge of the Sith and A New Hope. Tracked by an Inquisitor named the Eighth Brother, Maul is stranded on the ancient Sith world of Malachor, where he is discovered by series protagonist Ezra Bridger among the ruins. Introducing himself as \\"Old Master\\" and seeking revenge against Sidious, Maul leads Ezra into an ancient Sith temple, where they discover a holocron that Maul claims can give them the knowledge needed to defeat the Sith. After recovering it, the two find Ezra's master Kanan Jarrus and former Jedi Ahsoka Tano locked in battle with the Eighth Brother. They also find the Fifth Brother and the Seventh Sister, who have been pursuing the Rebels for some time. Maul ÿ having cast aside the title of Darth ÿ then reveals a new lightsaber disguised as a walking stick and joins the Jedi in battling their enemies.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter the Inquisitors retreat, Maul wins the Jedi's trust by denouncing the Sith, and tells them that he cannot defeat Darth Vader on his own. Working together, he and the Jedi ascend towards the top of the Sith temple and successfully kill all three Inquisitors. It is then that Maul reveals his intention to take Ezra as his apprentice, having already tricked him into activating the temple. After blinding Kanan, Maul briefly duels Ahsoka before facing Kanan again, only to be knocked off the temple's edge. However, he survives the fall and escapes Malachor in the Eighth Brother's TIE Fighter.\\r\\n\\r\\nMonths after the events on Malachor, Maul once again reveals himself to the Jedi as he takes the Ghost's crew hostage. He threatens to kill them unless Kanan and Ezra bring both the Sith and Jedi holocrons to him. Despite an attempt by the Rebels to escape, Maul successfully recaptures them and takes them to a remote base in the Outer Rim where he awaits the arrival of the Jedi. After they arrive, the holocrons are hazardously united allowing Ezra and Maul to see visions of their desires: Ezra sees images of a way to destroy the Sith, images including \\"twin suns\\", while Maul sees a vision of his own. Kanan begs Ezra to look away before he sees something he doesn't want to while Maul tells him to ignore Kanan and keep looking. Ezra heeds his master's words and breaks off the connection, which causes a great explosion. Maul escapes in the confusion, uttering, \\"He lives.\\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMaul reappears after finding the Rebellion's secret base. He tells Ezra that because the connection was severed, they got bits and pieces of each other's visions. With the holocrons destroyed from the events of their previous meeting, Maul discovered another way to get the information he needed. With Ezra he travels to Dathomir, former home of the Night Sisters, and recreates one of their spells to temporarily meld his and Ezra's minds. After the spell is completed Ezra, who was still looking for a way to destroy the Sith, and Maul realize they are both looking for Obi-Wan Kenobi.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the episode \\"Twin Suns\\", Maul is shown lost on Tatooine. He decides to use Ezra to lure Obi-Wan out of hiding. During their confrontation, Maul deduces that Obi-Wan is not only hiding, but is protecting someone. In a swift duel, Obi-Wan fatally wounds Maul. As he lies dying in Obi-Wan's arms, Maul asks if the person he is protecting is the Chosen One, and Obi-Wan replies \\"he is\\". Maul declares that this \\"Chosen One\\" will avenge them, and dies.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 2017, Marvel released Star Wars: Darth Maul a 5-issue prequel series centered on Darth Maul before the events of The Phantom Menace.[12]\\r\\n\\r\\nDark Horse Comics produced Darth Maul: Son of Dathomir based on the scripts and storyboards of an unproduced 4-episode story arc intended for The Clone Wars Season 6. After killing Savage Opress, Darth Sidious takes Maul to a Separatist prison, where Count Dooku tortures him for information about the Shadow Collective. Prime Minister Almec arranges Maul's escape and the latter then heads back to Zanbar to command the Death Watch army. However, he is followed there by General Grievous and his droids, who then battle with Maul and the Mandalorians. While they put up a fierce fight, Maul and his minions are ultimately overwhelmed by the droids. During the battle, Maul tears through the droid ranks and attacks Grievous, but is overpowered and forced to retreat. Afterwards, Maul confers with Mother Talzin (revealed to be his biological mother) and plots to draw out Sidious by capturing Dooku and General Grievous. The scheme works, and Talzin is able to restore herself to her physical form, but she sacrifices herself to save Maul. Although Maul escapes with a company of loyal Mandalorians, the Shadow Collective has fallen apart due to the conflict with Sidious, as the Hutts, Pykes, and Black Sun have all abandoned Maul.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn flashbacks during the novel Star Wars: Ahsoka, it is revealed that during the final days of the Clone Wars, Maul and his forces were besieged on Mandalore by an army of clone troopers led by Ahsoka Tano and Captain Rex. During the siege, Maul confronts and duels Ahsoka, and though he proves to be the stronger fighter, the former Jedi outwits him and traps him in a ray shield. However, before Maul can be taken into official custody, Order 66 is enacted and the clone troopers following Ahsoka turn on her, with the exception of Rex. With Rex's life in peril, Ahsoka abandons the chance of killing Maul, allowing the former Sith to escape once again. This battle was  originally intended to be depicted in the series finale of The Clone Wars had the series not been prematurely cancelled ÿ Anakin and Obi-Wan were dispatched to Mandalore with Ahsoka, but were immediately called back to Coruscant to rescue Chancellor Palpatine, thus leading into the opening sequence of Revenge of the Sith.\\r\\n\\r\\nWith the 2012 acquisition of Lucasfilm by The Walt Disney Company, most of the licensed Star Wars novels and comics produced since the originating 1977 film Star Wars were rebranded as Star Wars Legends and declared non-canon to the franchise in April 2014.[13][14][15]\\r\\n\\r\\nAs portrayed in the novel Darth Plagueis, the titular Sith Lord sends his apprentice, Darth Sidious, to the Force-rich world of Dathomir. A Dathomiri witch, or Night-sister, senses Sidious' power in the Force and approaches him. She assumes he is a Jedi and begs him to take her Zabrak infant son. She realizes Sidious is not a Jedi, and explains how she is trying to save her son from a Nightsister named Talzin, who killed Maul's father. It is implied that Maul has a twin brother and that Talzin is only aware of one child. Sidious realizes the infant is strong in the Force, and would become a threat if found by the Jedi. Concealing the existence of his own master, Sidious raises Maul to believe that he is a Sith apprentice, but he actually intends him to be an expendablealbeit usefulminion rather than an heir. Maul himself acknowledges his shortcomings, such as his limited understanding of politics, even as he tries to become a true Sith.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs portrayed in the novel Darth Maul: Shadow Hunter, Maul was raised by Sidious for as long as he can remember. He then trains Maul as a Sith, marking his body with Sith tattoos. Maul initially goes on several missions of terror for his master, killing politicians, crime bosses, merchants and warlords.\\r\\n\\r\\nSeveral sources depict Maul returning from the dead in several different forms. The story \\"Resurrection\\" from Star Wars Tales 9 depicts a cult creating a duplicate of Maul as a replacement for Darth Vader, only for Vader to kill him. The story \\"Phantom Menaces\\" in Star Wars Tales #17 (set after Return of the Jedi) depicts Luke Skywalker visiting Maul's home planet of Iridonia in an ambassadorial capacity, where he faces a \\"solid state hologram\\" of Maul projected from Maul's salvaged brain as part of a scientist's attempt to recreate Maul as Iridonia's \\"champion\\". Luke recognizes the disruption that Maul's existence is causing in the Force, and shuts down the life-support systems keeping the brain alive.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 2005, Dark Horse Comics published Star Wars: Visionaries, a compilation of comic art short stories. One story \\"Old Wounds\\", considered to be non-canonical to Star Wars lore, depicts Maul, now with longer horns on his head, surviving his bisection at Obi-Wan's hands, replacing his missing bottom half with cybernetic legs, similar to those of General Grievous. He then follows Obi-Wan throughout the galaxy, finally tracking him down on Tatooine a few years after the events of Star Wars: Episode III ÿ Revenge of the Sith. Maul taunts Obi-Wan, saying that after he kills him, he will take a toddler-aged Luke Skywalker to his master, Emperor Palpatine. Maul plans to kill Darth Vader, and resume his rightful place at Palpatine's side as his apprentice. He ignites his new double-bladed lightsaber, and engages Obi-Wan in a lightsaber duel, but Obi-Wan again bests him in combat, cutting off his opponent's horns. The Sith Lord is killed, unexpectedly, by a blaster bolt to the head from Owen Lars. Obi-Wan thanks Owen, and says he will take Maul's body into the desert and burn it so he can never come back.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn early 2012, a young adult novel entitled Star Wars: The Wrath of Darth Maul was released by Scholastic. In the 2014 novel, Star Wars: Maul: Lockdown, set before The Phantom Menace, Darth Maul is sent into an infamous galactic prison. Maul is also featured prominently in comic series starting in this period, Star Wars: The Clone Wars: The Sith Hunters & Darth Maul: Death Sentence. Set in the period of the Clone Wars around the various episodes that featured Maul, Sith Hunters and Death Sentence detail his and Savage Opress' journey across the galaxy as they seek vengeance on the Jedi.\\r\\n\\r\\nSince the release of The Phantom Menace, Darth Maul has proven to be a popular character. IGN named Darth Maul the 16th greatest Star Wars character, noting, \\"Of the countless characters to walk in and out of the Star Wars saga, none looks or acts more badass than Darth Maul.\\"[16]\\r\\n\\r\\nDarth Maul-related merchandise was popular among Hasbro Star Wars toy lines, with plastic recreations of his double bladed lightsaber and various action figures in his likeness developed. Darth Maul was the focal point of the toy marketing campaign surrounding the 2012 re-release of The Phantom Menace, being featured on the packaging for the toy line.[17]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn December 2017, an 8-year-old Ontario boy went viral on the Internet with a video of him pretending to be Darth Maul and displaying his martial arts skills.[18]","input":"What star wars movie was darth maul in?"},{"output":"30 to 40 years, and sometimes as much as 100 years","context":"Sea glass and beach glass are similar but come from two different types of water. \\"Sea glass\\" is physically and chemically weathered glass found on beaches along bodies of salt water. These weathering processes produce natural frosted glass.[1] \\"Genuine sea glass\\" can be collected as a hobby and can be used to make jewelry or make for decoration.\\"Beach glass\\" comes from fresh water and in most cases has a different pH balance, and has a less frosted appearance than sea glass. Sea glass takes 30 to 40 years, and sometimes as much as 100 years, to acquire its characteristic texture and shape.[2] Sometimes also colloquially referred to as \\"Drift glass\\" from the longshore drift process that forms the smooth edges. In practice, the two terms are used interchangeably.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nSea glass begins as normal shards of broken glass that are then persistently tumbled and ground until the sharp edges are smoothed and rounded. In this process, the glass loses its slick surface but gains a frosted appearance over many years.[3]\\r\\nNaturally produced sea glass (\\"genuine sea glass\\") originates as pieces of glass from broken bottles, broken tableware, or even shipwrecks, which are rolled and tumbled in the ocean for years until all of their edges are rounded off, and the slickness of the glass has been worn to a frosted appearance.[4]\\r\\nArtificially produced sea glass (sometimes called \\"beach glass\\"), although superficially similar to sea glass, nevertheless has clear differences in appearance. Having not actually originated from the sea, most connoisseurs will not consider artificial \\"sea\\" glass to actually be genuine sea glass, but rather simply tumbled glass, where pieces of modern-day glass are tossed into a rock tumbler or dipped in acid to produce the desired finish. Artificially-produced, the glass is much less expensive and is used for making jewelry, but is often passed off as real sea glass.[5]\\r\\nSea glass can be found all over the world, but the beaches of the northeast United States, Bermuda, Fort Bragg, California, Benicia, California, North Carolina beaches, Scotland, northwest England[citation needed], Mexico, Hawaii, Dominican Republic, Puerto Rico, Nova Scotia, Australia, Italy and southern Spain are famous[6][citation needed] for their bounty of sea glass, bottles, bottle lips and stoppers, art glass, marbles, and pottery shards. The best times to look are during spring tides especially perigean and proxigean tides, and during the first low tide after a storm.[7]\\r\\nGlass from inland waterways such as the Chesapeake Bay and the Great Lakes is known as beach glass.[citation needed] It is similar to sea glass, but in the absence of wave rigor and oceanic saline, content is typically less weathered. Beach glass from inland regions often has prominently embossed designs or letters on it, which can make tracing its origin less challenging.[8] The outer surface of beach glass shards may also be texturally varied, with one side frosty and the other shiny. This is most likely because they are pieces broken off from larger glass objects which are themselves still embedded in mud, silt or clay, slowly being exposed by wave action and erosion.[citation needed]\\r\\nThe color of sea glass is determined by its original source. Most sea glass comes from bottles, but it can also come from jars, plates, windows, windshields, ceramics or sea pottery.[9]\\r\\nThe most common colors of sea glass are kelly green, brown, and white (clear). These colors come from bottles used by companies that sell beer, juices, and soft drinks. The clear or white glass comes from clear plates and glasses, windshields, windows, and assorted other sources.[10]\\r\\nLess common colours include jade, amber (from bottles for whiskey, medicine, spirits, and early bleach bottles), golden amber or amberina (mostly used for spirit bottles), lime green (from soda bottles during the 1960s), forest green, and ice- or soft blue (from soda bottles, medicine bottles, ink bottles, and fruit jars from the late 19th and early 20th centuries, windows, and windshields). These colors are found about once for every 25 to 100 pieces of sea glass found.[10]\\r\\nUncommon colors of sea glass include a type of green, which comes primarily from early to mid-1900s Coca-Cola, Dr Pepper, and RC Cola bottles as well as beer bottles. Soft green colors could come from bottles that were used for ink, fruit, and baking soda. These colors are found once in every 50 to 100 pieces.[10]\\r\\nPurple sea glass is very uncommon, as is citron, opaque white (from milk glass), cobalt and cornflower blue (from early Milk of Magnesia bottles, poison bottles, artwork, and Bromo-Seltzer and Vicks VapoRub containers), and aqua (from Ball Mason jars and 19th century glass bottles). These colors are found once for every 200 to 1,000 pieces found.[10]\\r\\nExtremely rare colors include gray, pink (often from Great Depression-era plates), teal (often from Mateus wine bottles), black (older, very dark olive green glass), yellow (often from 1930s Vaseline containers), turquoise (from tableware and art glass), red (often from old Schlitz bottles,[11] car tail lights, dinnerware or from nautical lights, it is found once in about every 5,000 pieces), and orange (the least common type of sea glass, found once in about 10,000 pieces). These colors are found once for every 1,000 to 10,000 pieces collected. Some shards of black glass are quite old, originating from thick eighteenth-century gin, beer, and wine bottles.[10]\\r\\nOld black that had iron slag added during production to increase strength[12] and opaqueness were at times broken in shipment.[13] These broken bottles were jettisoned at the beachside wharf upon landfall. They originally contained such things as wine, gin, whiskey, medicines, and liquids subject to light damage. The bottles that survived the long and often rough voyage were refilled once emptied of the original contents and recycled, sometimes for many decades. They were refilled with local spirits, herbal tinctures, extracts, and medicinals.\\r\\nAs the glass craft gained knowledge the bottles became thinner. Quality improved in glass formulations and purity, as well as strides in technical improvements in glass-making techniques all aid in placing a piece of sea glass in a loosely defined era. Along with knowledge of historical trading partners that visited the search locations, production sources can be deduced, but a single feature is not a reliable indicator of origin. Many similar features over a broad sample narrow the choices. Particular substances became associated with certain color, and shapes of bottles.[13] These all help define country of origin. Medicines and liquor were often sold in green bottles; olive green was the most common color for gin, but brown was also used as well as cobalt blue. Whiskey was in green and brown bottles also. The liquor bottles for sea shipment were oftentimes square so as to use space more efficiently in shipping crates. Poisons were almost always in blue bottles. Round, mallet, and squat cylinder black glass bottles were all made,[13] and shape correlates to age of the bottles with some overlap. Correlations exist today: brown beer bottles, and of course the globally recognized shape of the Coca-Cola green glass bottle.\\r\\nIn the Caribbean, many nations traded, and pirates plundered them all. So glass from many producer countries can be found with examples going back to the 15th century. Old slave trading ports are good search locations. As are former colonial ports in the slave-molasses-rum triangle. All former colonial locations with sea trade routes, and the motherland shipping ports are prime search areas.\\r\\nFor instance, in Jamaica there are influxes of Spanish, African, English, American, East Indian, Chinese, and Jews (who incidentally arrived about the same time Christopher Columbus' son arrived to settle the island in 1510 and many later shipped with the Caribbean pirate crews) and other Europeans scattered throughout the historical record. The majority of black glass found on the island of Jamaica is English glass produced from the later 1600s until the 1800s in England. Sea glass arrived in Jamaica with the old world supply chain first established in the 15th century. The Spanish considered Santiago (Jamaica) a backwater to Cuba, and this allowed the English to relieve them of it in 1655 without much resistance. The first man-made glass most likely arrived with Christopher Columbus on his 2nd voyage when he claimed the island for Spain in 1494. He is reported to have landed at Dry Harbor, Discovery Bay on the north coast. Whether any of the glass on board became sea glass is part of the romance and wonder of beachcombing.\\r\\nBlack glass is often green or brown when held up to light, although it appears black to the unaided eye. Weathering and oxidation, together with UV light interacting with metallic oxides and chemicals in the glass and seawater are all factors affecting the color of sea glass over long exposure and time frames. In texture and color black sea glass resembles black beach rock, very much resembling the extrusive igneous rock basalt, or weathered black obsidian, a natural black volcanic glass. Gas bubbles are often trapped in old glass, impurities and irregularities in the original bottles were common and one indicator of age. Early examples were hand blown, later ones utilized a mold. Due to the inherent strength, you'll find larger size pieces of old black glass, including pieces that survived for centuries. Potential age of black beach glass found depends on your search location. Small pieces require a trained eye to spot. Texture is a good tool to employ along with color. Black glass is the rarest of all the sea/beach glasses due to age and difficulty in finding it. Although when you find an old, long used location it can produce a considerable amount of material.\\r\\nCollectors should be aware of the historical nature of the location, and the fact that gathering old items is considered cultural theft in some areas of the world. In other areas sea glass is just another piece of trash on the beach. Most sea glass' historical context is lost to the sea, but its mere presence in some areas is the heritage and legacy of the location. National treasures made of former trash exist, such as is Glass Beach at Fort Bragg CA. The glass at Ft. Bragg is mostly from the mid-20th century.\\r\\nLike collecting shells, fossils, or stones, combing shorelines for sea glass is a hobby many beach-goers and beachcombers enjoy. Hobbyists often fill decorative jars with their collections and take great pleasure in tracing a shard's provenance while artisans craft pieces of jewelry, stained glass and other decorative pieces from sea glass. Some collectors use their collections in creating works of art by putting them in cement or other adhesive to create a mosaic.[citation needed]\\r\\nIn North America, the hobby has the North American Sea Glass Association, which organizes a yearly conference and issues a newsletter.[14]\\r\\nAuthentic sea and beach glass is becoming rarer and harder to find for a variety of reasons. More people are actively searching for it, and littering has increasingly staggered[clarification needed] the making of it naturally.[citation needed]\\r\\nThis scarcity has led to some artisans and crafters tumbling poorer pieces of sea glass shards to create what is called \\"twice-tossed\\" glass, while others create artificial sea glass, or \\"craft glass\\", from ordinary glass pieces using a rock tumbler. While such glass is chunkier than most true sea glass, lacks its romantic provenance, and differs in many technical ways (e.g., long-term exposure to water conditions creates an etched surface on the glass that cannot be duplicated artificially), it does meet the demand of crafters at a cheaper price and in a wider range of colors.[citation needed]\\r\\nA number of characteristics highlight the differences between artificial sea glass and natural sea glass, starting with the coloration and surface texture of each piece.[15] An example of natural sea glass will usually have a frosty, almost powdery texture at different points.[15] One of the most reliable indicators for natural sea glass is a \\"C\\" shaped design all over the outside of the sample.[16] If the design is located on the piece, it is authentic sea glass, since artificial beach glass will typically not have that particular design.[16] Sea glass usually comes from broken glass bottles or other household items, so the pieces you find on the beach will not be perfectly shaped, unlike artificial sea glass, often sold as beach glass.[16]\\r\\nCatergory:","input":"How long does it take beach glass to form?"},{"output":"Multilingual User Interface","context":"Multilingual User Interface (MUI) is the name of a Microsoft technology for Microsoft Windows, Microsoft Office and other applications that allows for the installation of multiple interface languages on a single system.

While both localized versions of software and MUI versions display menus and dialogs in the targeted language, only localized versions have translated file and folder names. A localized version of Windows translates the base operating system, as well as all included programs, including file and folder names, objects names, strings in registry, and any other internal strings used by Windows into a particular language. Localized versions of Windows support upgrading from a previous localized version and user interface resources are completely localized, which is not the case for MUI versions of a product. MUI versions of a product do not contain translated administrative functions such as registry entries and items in Microsoft Management Console. The advantage of using MUIs over localized versions is each user on a computer could use a different language MUI without requiring different versions of software installed and dealing with the conflicts that could arise as a result. For example, using MUI technology, any version of Windows can host Windows applications in any other language.[1]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nMUI products for these versions were available only through volume agreements from Microsoft.

Earth and the Moon orbit about their barycentre (common center of mass), which lies about 4,600?km (2,900?mi) from Earth's center (about 3/4 of the radius of Earth). On average, the distance to the Moon is about 385,000?km (239,000?mi) from Earth's center, which corresponds to about 60 Earth radii. With a mean orbital velocity of 1.022?km/s (2,290?mph),[8] the Moon appears to move relative to the stars each hour by an amount roughly equal to its angular diameter, or by about half a degree. The Moon differs from most satellites of other planets in that its orbit is close to the plane of the ecliptic, and not to Earth's equatorial plane. The plane of the lunar orbit is inclined to the ecliptic by about 5, whereas the Moon's equatorial plane is inclined by only 1.5 to the ecliptic.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe properties of the orbit described in this section are approximations. The Moon's orbit around Earth has many irregularities (perturbations), of whose study (lunar theory) has a long history.[9]\\r\\nThe orbit of the Moon is distinctly elliptical, with an average eccentricity of 0.0549. The non-circular form of the lunar orbit causes variations in the Moon's angular speed and apparent size as it moves towards and away from an observer on Earth. The mean angular movement relative to an imaginary observer at the barycentre is 7001131760000000000?13.176 per day to the east (Julian day 2000).\\r\\nThe Moon's elongation is its angular distance east of the Sun at any time. At new moon, it is zero and the Moon is said to be in conjunction. At full moon, the elongation is 180 and it is said to be in opposition. In both cases, the Moon is in syzygy, that is, the Sun, Moon and Earth are nearly aligned. When elongation is either 90 or 270, the Moon is said to be in quadrature.\\r\\nThe orientation of the orbit is not fixed in space, but rotates over time. This orbital precession is also called apsidal precession and is the rotation of the Moon's orbit within the orbital plane, i.e. the axes of the ellipse change direction. The Moon's major axis ÿ the longest diameter of the orbit, joining its nearest and farthest points, the perigee and apogee, respectively ÿ makes one complete revolution every 8.85 Earth years, or 3,232.6054 days, as it rotates slowly in the same direction as the Moon itself (direct motion). The Moon's apsidal precession is distinct from, and should not be confused with its axial precession.\\r\\nFor the moon to make a complete rotation on its axis it takes approximately 27.3 days. It takes the moon about this same time to orbit the earth.[10]\\r\\nThe mean inclination of the lunar orbit to the ecliptic plane is 5.145. The rotational axis of the Moon is also not perpendicular to its orbital plane, so the lunar equator is not in the plane of its orbit, but is inclined to it by a constant value of 6.688 (this is the obliquity). This does not mean that, as a result of the precession of the Moon's orbital plane, the angle between the lunar equator and the ecliptic would vary between the sum (11.833) and difference (1.543) of these two angles, but, as was discovered by Jacques Cassini in 1722, the rotational axis of the Moon precesses with the same rate as its orbital plane, but is 180 out of phase (see Cassini's Laws). Therefore, the angle between the ecliptic and the lunar equator is always 1.543, even though the rotational axis of the Moon is not fixed with respect to the stars.[11]\\r\\nBecause of the inclination of the moon's orbit, the moon is above the horizon at the North and South Pole for almost two weeks every month, even though the sun is below the horizon for six months at a time. The period from moonrise to moonrise at the poles is quite close to the sidereal period, or 27.3 days. When the sun is the furthest below the horizon (winter solstice), the moon will be full when it is at its highest point.\\r\\nThe nodes are points at which the Moon's orbit crosses the ecliptic. The Moon crosses the same node every 27.2122 days, an interval called the draconic or draconitic month. The line of nodes, the intersection between the two respective planes, has a retrograde motion: for an observer on Earth, it rotates westward along the ecliptic with a period of 18.60 years or 19.3549 per year. When viewed from the celestial north, the nodes move clockwise around Earth, opposite to Earth's own spin and its revolution around the Sun. Lunar and solar eclipses can occur when the nodes align with the Sun, roughly every 173.3 days. Lunar orbit inclination also determines eclipses; shadows cross when nodes coincide with full and new moon when the Sun, Earth, and Moon align in three dimensions.\\r\\nIn effect, this means that the \\"tropical year\\" on the moon is only 347 days long. This is called the draconic year or eclipse year. The \\"seasons\\" on the moon fit into this period. For about half of this draconic year, the sun is north of the lunar equator (but at most 1.543), and for the other half, it is south of the lunar equator. Obviously, the effect of these seasons is minor compared to the difference between lunar night and lunar day. At the poles, there are no days and nights of about 15 Earth days, but rather the sun will be \\"up\\" for 173 days at a time. \\"Up\\" here means that the centre of the sun is above the horizon. The sunrise and sunset at the poles each take about 18 days.[12] These polar sunrises and sunsets occur around the time of eclipses (solar or lunar). For example, at the Solar eclipse of March 9, 2016, the moon was near its descending node, and the sun was near the point in the sky where the equator of the moon crosses the ecliptic. When the sun reached that point, the centre of the sunset at the north pole and rose at the south pole.\\r\\nEvery 18.6 years, the angle between the moon's orbit and the Earth's equator reaches a maximum of 2836 (the sum of the Earth's inclination 2327 and the Moon's inclination 509). This is called major lunar standstill. Around this time, the moon's latitude will vary from ?2836 to +2836. 9.3 years later, the angle between the moon's orbit and the Earth's equator reaches its minimum, 1820. This is called a minor lunar standstill.\\r\\nWhen the inclination of the moon's orbit to the Earth's equator is at its minimum of 1820, the centre of the moon's disk will be above the horizon every day as far north and as far south as 90?1820' or 7140' latitude, whereas when the inclination is at its maximum of 2836' the centre of the moon's disk will only be above the horizon every day for latitudes less than 90?2836' or 6124'. At higher latitudes there will be a period of at least a day each month when the moon does not rise, but there will also be a period of at least a day each month during which the moon does not set. This is similar to the behaviour of the sun, but with a period of 27.3 days instead of 365 days. Note that a point on the moon can actually be visible when it is below the horizon by about 34 arc minutes, due to refraction (see Sunrise).\\r\\nScale model of the EarthÿMoon system: Sizes and distances are to scale.\\r\\nAbout 1000 BC, the Babylonians were the first human civilization known to have kept a consistent record of lunar observations. Clay tablets from that period, which have been found over the territory of present-day Iraq, are inscribed with cuneiform writing recording the times and dates of moonrises and moonsets, the stars that the Moon passed close by, and the time differences between rising and setting of both the Sun and the Moon around the time of the full moon. Babylonian astronomy discovered the three main periods of the Moon's motion and used data analysis to build lunar calendars that extended well into the future.[9] This use of detailed, systematic observations to make predictions based on experimental data may be classified as the first scientific study in human history. However, the Babylonians seem to have lacked any geometrical or physical interpretation of their data, and they could not predict future lunar eclipses (although \\"warnings\\" were issued before likely eclipse times).\\r\\nAncient Greek astronomers were the first to introduce and analyze mathematical models of the motion of objects in the sky. Ptolemy described lunar motion by using a well-defined geometric model of epicycles and evection.[9]\\r\\nSir Isaac Newton was the first to develop a complete theory of motion, mechanics. The sheer wealth of humanity's observations of the lunar motion was the main testbed of his theory.[9]\\r\\nThere are several different periods associated with the lunar orbit.[13] The sidereal month is the time it takes to make one complete orbit around Earth with respect to the fixed stars. It is about 27.32 days. The synodic month is the time it takes the Moon to reach the same visual phase. This varies notably throughout the year,[14] but averages around 29.53 days. The synodic period is longer than the sidereal period because the EarthÿMoon system moves in its orbit around the Sun during each sidereal month, hence a longer period is required to achieve a similar alignment of Earth, the Sun, and the Moon. The anomalistic month is the time between perigees and is about 27.55 days. The EarthÿMoon separation determines the strength of the lunar tide raising force.\\r\\nThe draconic month is the time from ascending node to ascending node. The time between two successive passes of the same ecliptic longitude is called the tropical month. The latter three periods are slightly different from the sidereal month.\\r\\nThe average length of a calendar month (a twelfth of a year) is about 30.4 days. This is not a lunar period, though the calendar month is historically related to the visible lunar phase.\\r\\nThe gravitational attraction that the Moon exerts on Earth is the cause of tides in the sea; the Sun has a lesser tidal influence. If Earth had a global ocean of uniform depth, the Moon would act to deform both the solid Earth (by a small amount) and the ocean in the shape of an ellipsoid with the high points roughly beneath the Moon and on the opposite side of Earth. However, because of the presence of the continents, Earth's much faster rotation and varying ocean depths, this simplistic visualisation does not happen. Although the tidal flow period is generally synchronized to the Moon's orbit around Earth, its relative timing varies greatly. In some places on Earth, there is only one high tide per day, whereas others have four, though this is somewhat rare.\\r\\nThe notional tidal bulges are carried ahead of the EarthÿMoon axis by the continents as a result of Earth's rotation. The eccentric mass of each bulge exerts a small amount of gravitational attraction on the Moon, with the bulge on the side of Earth closest to the Moon pulling in a direction slightly forward along the Moon's orbit (because Earth's rotation has carried the bulge forward). The bulge on the side furthest from the Moon has the opposite effect, but because the gravitational attraction varies inversely with the square of distance, the effect is stronger for the near-side bulge. As a result, some of Earth's angular (or rotational) momentum is gradually being transferred to the rotation of the EarthÿMoon pair around their mutual centre of mass, called the barycentre. This slightly faster rotation causes the EarthÿMoon distance to increase at approximately 38 millimetres per year. Conservation of angular momentum means that Earth's axial rotation is gradually slowing, and because of this its day lengthens by approximately 23 microseconds every year (excluding glacial rebound). Both figures are valid only for the current configuration of the continents. Tidal rhythmites from 620 million years ago show that, over hundreds of millions of years, the Moon receded at an average rate of 22?mm (0.87?in) per year and the day lengthened at an average rate of 12 microseconds per year, both about half of their current values. See tidal acceleration for a more detailed description and references.\\r\\nThe Moon is gradually receding from Earth into a higher orbit, and calculations suggest that this would continue for about 50 billion years.[15][16] By that time, Earth and the Moon would be in a mutual spinÿorbit resonance or tidal locking, in which the Moon will orbit Earth in about 47 days (currently 27 days), and both the Moon and Earth would rotate around their axes in the same time, always facing each other with the same side. This has already happened to the Moonthe same side always faces Earthand is also slowly happening to the Earth. However, the slowdown of Earth's rotation is not occurring fast enough for the rotation to lengthen to a month before other effects change the situation: approximately 2.3 billion years from now, the increase of the Sun's radiation will have caused Earth's oceans to evaporate,[17] removing the bulk of the tidal friction and acceleration.\\r\\nThe Moon is in synchronous rotation, meaning that it keeps the same face toward Earth at all times. This synchronous rotation is only true on average, because the Moon's orbit has a definite eccentricity. As a result, the angular velocity of the Moon varies as it orbits Earth and hence is not always equal to the Moon's rotational velocity. When the Moon is at its perigee, its rotation is slower than its orbital motion, and this allows us to see up to eight degrees of longitude of its eastern (right) far side. Conversely, when the Moon reaches its apogee, its rotation is faster than its orbital motion and this reveals eight degrees of longitude of its western (left) far side. This is referred to as longitudinal libration.\\r\\nBecause the lunar orbit is also inclined to Earth's ecliptic plane by 5.1, the rotational axis of the Moon seems to rotate towards and away from Earth during one complete orbit. This is referred to as latitudinal libration, which allows one to see almost 7 of latitude beyond the pole on the far side. Finally, because the Moon is only about 60 Earth radii away from Earth's centre of mass, an observer at the equator who observes the Moon throughout the night moves laterally by one Earth diameter. This gives rise to a diurnal libration, which allows one to view an additional one degree's worth of lunar longitude. For the same reason, observers at both of Earth's geographical poles would be able to see one additional degree's worth of libration in latitude.\\r\\nWhen viewed from the north celestial pole (i.e., from the approximate direction of the star Polaris) the Moon orbits Earth anticlockwise and Earth orbits the Sun anticlockwise, and the Moon and Earth rotate on their own axes anticlockwise.\\r\\nThe right-hand rule can be used to indicate the direction of the angular velocity. If the thumb of the right hand points to the north celestial pole, its fingers curl in the direction that the Moon orbits Earth, Earth orbits the Sun, and the Moon and Earth rotate on their own axes.\\r\\nIn representations of the Solar System, it is common to draw the trajectory of Earth from the point of view of the Sun, and the trajectory of the Moon from the point of view of Earth. This could give the impression that the Moon orbits Earth in such a way that sometimes it goes backwards when viewed from the Sun's perspective. Because the orbital velocity of the Moon around Earth (1?km/s) is small compared to the orbital velocity of Earth about the Sun (30?km/s), this never happens. There are no rearward loops in the Moon's solar orbit.\\r\\nConsidering the EarthÿMoon system as a binary planet, its centre of gravity is within Earth, about 4,624?km (2,873?mi) or 72.6% of the Earth's radius from the centre of the Earth. This centre of gravity remains on the line between the centres of the Earth and Moon as the Earth completes its diurnal rotation. The path of the EarthÿMoon system in its solar orbit is defined as the movement of this mutual centre of gravity around the sun. Consequently, Earth's centre veers inside and outside the solar orbital path during each synodic month as the Moon moves in its orbit around the common centre of gravity.[19]\\r\\nThe Sun's gravitational effect on the Moon is more than twice that of Earth's on the Moon; consequently, the Moon's trajectory is always convex[19][20] (as seen when looking Sunward at the entire SunÿEarthÿMoon system from a great distance outside EarthÿMoon solar orbit), and is nowhere concave (from the same perspective) or looped.[18][19][21] That is, the region enclosed by the Moon's orbit of the Sun is a convex set.","input":"How long does it take for the moon to rotate around the earth?"},{"output":"a flea-infested bundle of cloth arrived from London for the local tailor","context":"Eyam ( /?i?m/)[2] is an English village and civil parish in the Derbyshire Dales district that lies within the Peak District National Park. The population of the civil parish at the 2001 Census was 926 increasing to 969 at the 2011 Census.[3] The village is noted for an outbreak of bubonic plague which occurred there in 1665, in which the villagers chose to isolate themselves rather than let the infection spread. The present village was founded and named by Anglo-Saxons, although lead had been mined in the area by the Romans.[4] Formerly industrial, its economy now relies on the tourist trade and it is promoted as 'the plague village'.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nLead mining seems to have had a continuous history in the Eyam district since at least the Roman era and there is evidence of habitation from earlier. Stone circles and earth barrows on the moors above the present village have largely been destroyed, although some remain and more are recorded. The most notable site is the Wet Withens stone circle on Eyam Moor.[5] Coins bearing the names of many emperors provide evidence of Roman lead-mining locally.[6] However, the village's name derives from Old English and is first recorded in the Domesday Book as Aium. It is a dative form of the noun g (an island) and probably refers to a patch of cultivable land amidst the moors,[7] or else to the settlement's situation between two brooks.[8]\\r\\nIn the churchyard is an Anglo-Saxon cross in Mercian style dated to the 8th century, moved there from its original location beside a moorland cart track. Grade I listed and a Scheduled Ancient Monument,[9] it is covered in complex carvings and is almost complete, but for a missing section of the shaft.[10]\\r\\nThe present parish church of St. Lawrence dates from the 14th century, but evidence of an earlier church there can be found in the Saxon font, a Norman window at the west end of the north aisle, and Norman pillars that are thought to rest on Saxon foundations. There have been alterations since the Middle Ages, including a large sun dial dated 1775 mounted on a wall outside. Some of the Rectors at the church have had contentious histories, none less so than the fanatically Royalist Sherland Adams who, it was accused, \\"gave tythe of lead ore to the King against the Parliament\\", and as a consequence was removed from the living and imprisoned.\\r\\nThe lead mining tithe was due to the rectors by ancient custom. They received one penny for every 'dish' of ore and twopence farthing for every load of hillock-stuff. Owing to the working of a newly discovered rich vein during the 18th century, the Eyam living was a valuable one. Mining continued into the 19th century, after which better sources were discovered and a change-over was made to the working and treatment of fluorspar as a slagging agent in smelting. The last to close was the Ladywash Mine, which was operative between 1948ÿ79. Within a 3 miles radius of the village there are 439 known mines, (some running beneath the village itself), that are drained by 49 drainage levels ('soughs').[11]\\r\\nAccording to the 1841 Census for Eyam, there were 954 inhabitants living in the parish, chiefly employed in agriculture, lead mining, and cotton and silk weaving. By the 1881 Census, most men either worked as lead miners or in the manufacture of boots and shoes, a trade that only ended in the 1960s. The transition from industrial village to tourist based economy is underlined by Roger Ridgeway's statement that, at the beginning of the 20th century, \\"a hundred horses and carts would have been seen taking fluorspar to Grindleford and Hassop stations. Today, up to a dozen coach loads of visiting children arrive each day in the village.\\"[12]\\r\\nThe history of the plague in the village began in 1665 when a flea-infested bundle of cloth arrived from London for the local tailor.[13] Within a week his assistant George Vicars was dead and more began dying in the household soon after.[14] As the disease spread, the villagers turned for leadership to their rector, the Reverend William Mompesson, and the Puritan Minister Thomas Stanley. These introduced a number of precautions to slow the spread of the illness from May 1666. They included the arrangement that families were to bury their own dead and relocation of church services to the natural amphitheatre of Cucklett Delph, allowing villagers to separate themselves and so reducing the risk of infection. Perhaps the best-known decision was to quarantine the entire village to prevent further spread of the disease.\\r\\nThe plague ran its course over 14 months and one account states that it killed at least 260 villagers, with only 83 surviving out of a population of 350.[14] This figure has been challenged on a number of occasions with alternative figures of 430 survivors from a population of around 800 being given.[14] The church in Eyam has a record of 273 individuals who were victims of the plague.[15] Survival among those affected appeared random, as many who remained alive had had close contact with those who died but never caught the disease. For example, Elizabeth Hancock was uninfected despite burying six children and her husband in eight days (the graves are known as the Riley graves after the farm where they lived).[13] The unofficial village gravedigger, Marshall Howe, also survived despite handling many infected bodies.[14]\\r\\nPlague Sunday has been celebrated in the village since the plague's bicentenary in 1866 and now takes place in Cucklett Delph on the last Sunday in August. Originally it was held in mid-August but now coincides with the much older Wakes Week and the well dressing ceremonies.[16]\\r\\nToday Eyam has various plague-related places of interest. One is the Coolstone in which money, usually soaked in vinegar, which was believed to kill the infection, was placed in exchange for food and medicine. It is just one of several 'plague stones' that served to make the boundary that should not be crossed by either inhabitant or outsider. Another site is the isolated enclosure of the Riley graves mentioned above, which is now under the guardianship of the National Trust.\\r\\nA reminder of the village's industrial past remains in the name of its only pub, the Miner's Arms. Built in 1630, before the plague, it was originally called The Kings Arms. Opposite the church is the Mechanics' Institute, originally established in 1824,[17] although the present building with its handsome pillared portico dates from 1859 and was enlarged in 1894. At one time it held a library paid for by subscription, which then contained 766 volumes.[18] The premises now double as the village club. Up the main street is the Jacobean-styled Eyam Hall, built just after the plague. It was leased and managed by the National Trust for five years until December 2017 but is now run by the owners (the Wright Family). The green opposite has an ancient set of village stocks reputedly used to punish the locals for minor crimes.\\r\\nCatherine Mompesson's tabletop grave is in the churchyard and has a wreath laid on it every Plague Sunday. This is in remembrance of her constancy in staying by her husband, rather than moving away with the rest of her family, and dying in the very last days of the plague. The church's burial register also records \\"Anna the traveller, who according to her own account, was 136 years of age\\" and was interred on 30 December 1663. A more recent arrival there is the cricketer Harry Bagshaw, who played for Derbyshire and then acted as a respected umpire after retiring. At the apex of his headstone is a hand with a finger pointing upwards. Underneath the lettering a set of stumps is carved, with the bails flying off and a bat which has just hit the wicket.[19]\\r\\nRespect for its heritage has not always been a priority in Eyam. In his Peak Scenery (1824), Ebenezer Rhodes charges that by the start of the 19th century many former gravestones of plague victims had been pulled up to floor houses and barns and that ploughing was allowed to encroach on the Riley Graves (pp.?34ÿ5); that the lime trees planted on either side of Mrs Mompesson's grave had been cut down for timber (39ÿ40); that the missing piece from the shaft of the Saxon Cross had been broken up for domestic use (p.?44); and that in general the profit of the living was put before respect for the dead (46ÿ7).[20]\\r\\nEyam Museum was opened in 1994 and, besides its focus on the plague, includes exhibits on the village's local history in general. Among the art exhibits there are painted copies from different eras of a print (taken from a drawing by Francis Chantrey) in Ebenezer Rhodes' Peak Scenery (1818). These depict the sweep of the road by the 'plague cottages' where the first victims died, with the church tower beyond.[21] The local amateur John Platt painted in naive style and is represented by depictions of the Riley Graves (1871)[22] and the old windmill (1874).[23]\\r\\nSince the area is scenically beautiful, it has attracted many artists and the village appeared in the work of Sheffield artist George Cunningham (1924ÿ1996),[24] while the specialist in interiors from the same city, Tim Rose, has painted several watercolours inside Eyam Hall.[25] Other watercolourists who have painted landscape views include George Hammond Steel (1900ÿ1960)[26] and Freida Marrion Scott (d.2012).[27] Eyam also has a resident artist in Hazel Money, who specialises in small scale acrylic paintings and lino prints of the village and surrounding area.[28]\\r\\nThe most distinctive of the Sheffield artists to paint Eyam was Harry Epworth Allen, since he subordinated the picturesque so as to interpret his subject as a living community within a worked landscape. His \\"Road above Eyam\\" (1936), now in the Laing Art Gallery, shows a road travelled by working people above the village.[29] His \\"Burning Limestone\\" in Newport Museum and Art Gallery acknowledges the two centuries and more of industrialisation by which the local inhabitants earned their living among harsh conditions.[30] Anna Seward, a pioneer of Romanticism, could not hide from herself the fact that the wild natural rocks she admired were daily being blasted for utilitarian purposes and the \\"perpetual consumption of the ever burning lime kilns\\", while the view was hidden behind the smoke from the smelting works.[31] She takes up the subject again as she explores her memory of the scene in a poem addressed to the future mill-owner William Newton:\\r\\nThe ruthless realism of inhabitant and observer conjoined here is expressed not only by the 18th century poet and the 20th century painter, but by the village of Eyam in its struggle for survival.\\r\\nThe village of Eyam,\\" its historian begins his account, \\"has been long characterized throughout the Peak of Derbyshire, as the birthplace of genius ÿ the seat of the Muses ÿ the Athens of the Peak\\". During the 18th century the place was notable for having no less than four poets associated with it. Reverend Peter Cunningham, curate there between 1775 ÿ 1790, published two sermons during that time as well as several poems of a political nature. In addition, William Woods' account speaks of \\"numberless stones in the burial place that contain the offerings of his muse\\".[33]\\r\\nThe Rector for whom Cunningham deputised much of the time, Thomas Seward, published infrequently, but at least one poem written during his tenure at Eyam deals with personal matters. His \\"Ode on a Lady's Illness after the Death of her Child\\", dated 14 April 1748, concerns the death in infancy of his daughter Jenny.[34] Seward also encouraged one of his surviving daughters, Anna Seward, to write poetry, but only after she moved with her father to Lichfield. Following a visit to her birthplace in 1788, she wrote a poem about it filled with nostalgia for the past.[35] She celebrated this lost domain of happiness once more in \\"Epistle to Mr. Newton, the Derbyshire Minstrel, on receiving his description in verse of an autumnal scene near Eyam, September 1791\\".[36] No copy of the poem by William Newton now exists. The author was a labouring class protg from nearby, originally discovered by Cunningham and introduced to Miss Seward in 1783.\\r\\nThe poet Richard Furness belongs to the early 19th century and was known as 'the Poet of Eyam' after his birthplace, but the bulk of his poetry too was written after he had left the district. Among the several references to the village there are his \\"Lines written in sight of the rectory\\", which praises both Anna Seward and her father.[37] William Wood, the author of The History and Antiquities of Eyam was a village resident. At the head of his first chapter there is an excerpt from a poem that links the place with the story of the plague.[38] Simply initialled W. W., the inference to be drawn is that it had earlier appeared in Wood's collection, The genius of the Peak and other poems (1837).\\r\\nLater the novelist Robert Murray Gilchrist came to live in the area. The village of Milton that figures in some of his fiction is in fact based upon Eyam. His The Peakland Faggot (1897) consists of short stories, each focusing on a particular character in the village.[39] This was followed by two other series, Nicholas and Mary and Other Milton Folk (1899) and Natives of Milton (1902). Eyam was also featured under its own name in Joseph Hatton's novel, The Dagger and the Cross (1897). Set in the former Bradshaw Hall in the year before the plague arrives, it includes local characters who had key roles during the spread of the disease, such as George Vicars and William and Catherine Mompesson.[40]\\r\\nThe village lends its name to the evolutionary \\"Eyam Hypothesis\\" whereby infected individuals exhibit sickness behaviour because of kin selection of reduced infectivity.","input":"How did the plague spread from london to eyam?"},{"output":"25 April 1792","context":"A guillotine (/??l?ti?n/; French:?[ij?tin]) is an apparatus designed for efficiently carrying out executions by beheading. The device consists of a tall, upright frame in which a weighted and angled blade is raised to the top and suspended. The condemned person is secured with stocks at the bottom of the frame, positioning the neck directly below the blade. The blade is then released, to quickly fall and forcefully decapitate the victim with a single, clean pass so that the head falls into a basket below.\\r\\nThe device is best known for its use in France, in particular during the French Revolution, where it was celebrated as the people's avenger by supporters of the revolution and vilified as the pre-eminent symbol of the Reign of Terror by opponents.[1] The name dates from this period, but similar devices had been used elsewhere in Europe over several centuries. The display of severed heads had long been one of the most common ways a European sovereign displayed his power to his subjects.[2]\\r\\nThe guillotine remained Frances standard method of judicial execution until as recently as the abolition of capital punishment in 1981.[3] The last person to be executed in France was Hamida Djandoubi, who was guillotined on 10 September 1977.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe use of beheading machines in Europe long predates such use during the French revolution in 1792. An early example of the principle is found in the High History of the Holy Grail, dated to about 1210. Although the device is imaginary, its function is clear.[4] The text says:\\r\\nWithin these three openings are the hallows set for them. And behold what I would do to them if their three heads were therein ... She setteth her hand toward the openings and draweth forth a pin that was fastened into the wall, and a cutting blade of steel droppeth down, of steel sharper than any razor, and closeth up the three openings. \\"Even thus will I cut off their heads when they shall set them into those three openings thinking to adore the hallows that are beyond.\\"[4]\\r\\nThe Halifax Gibbet was a wooden structure consisting of two wooden uprights, capped by a horizontal beam, of a total height of 4.5 metres (15?ft). The blade was an axe head weighing 3.5?kg (7.7?lb), attached to the bottom of a massive wooden block that slid up and down in grooves in the uprights. This device was mounted on a large square platform 1.25 metres (4?ft) high. It is not known when the Halifax Gibbet was first used; the first recorded execution in Halifax dates from 1280, but that execution may have been by sword, axe, or gibbet. The machine remained in use until Oliver Cromwell forbade capital punishment for petty theft. It was used for the last time, for the execution of two criminals on a single day, on 30 April 1650.\\r\\nHolinshed's Chronicles of 1577 included a picture of \\"The execution of Murcod Ballagh near Merton in Ireland in 1307\\" showing a similar execution machine, suggesting its early use in Ireland.[5]\\r\\nThe Maiden was constructed in 1564 for the Provost and Magistrates of Edinburgh, and it was in use from April 1565 to 1710. One of those executed was James Douglas, 4th Earl of Morton, in 1581, and a 1644 publication began circulating the legend that Morton himself had commissioned the Maiden after he had seen the Halifax Gibbet.[6] The Maiden was readily dismantled for storage and transport, and it is now on display in the National Museum of Scotland.\\r\\nJoseph-Ignace Guillotin, together with German engineer Tobias Schmidt, built a prototype for the guillotine. Schmidt recommended using an angled blade as opposed to a round one.[7]\\r\\nOn 10 October 1789, physician Joseph-Ignace Guillotin proposed to the National Assembly that capital punishment should always take the form of decapitation \\"by means of a simple mechanism.\\"[8]\\r\\nSensing the growing discontent, Louis XVI banned the use of the breaking wheel.[9] In 1791, as the French Revolution progressed, the National Assembly researched a new method to be used on all condemned people regardless of class, consistent with the idea that the purpose of capital punishment was simply to end life rather than to inflict pain.[9]\\r\\nA committee was formed under Antoine Louis, physician to the King and Secretary to the Academy of Surgery.[9] Guillotin was also on the committee. The group was influenced by the Italian Mannaia (or Mannaja: which had been used ever since Roman times), the Scottish Maiden and the Halifax Gibbet, which was fitted with an axe head weighing 7 pounds 12 ounces (3.5?kg).[10] While these prior instruments usually crushed the neck or used blunt force to take off a head, devices also usually used a crescent blade and a lunette (a hinged two part yoke to immobilize the victim's neck).[9]\\r\\nLaquiante, an officer of the Strasbourg criminal court,[11] designed a beheading machine and employed Tobias Schmidt, a German engineer and harpsichord maker, to construct a prototype.[12] Antoine Louis is also credited with the design of the prototype. The memoirs of the official executioner claim that King Louis XVI (an amateur locksmith) recommended that an oblique blade be used instead of a crescent blade, lest the blade not fit all necks (ironically, the king's own was offered up discreetly as an example).[13] The first execution by guillotine was performed on highwayman Nicolas Jacques Pelletier[14] on 25 April 1792.[15][16][17] He was executed in front of what is now the city hall of Paris (Place de l'h?tel de ville). All citizens deemed guilty of a crime punishable by death were from then on executed there, until the scaffold was moved on 21 August to the Place du Carrousel.\\r\\nThe machine was successful because it was considered a humane form of execution, contrasting with the methods used in pre-revolutionary Ancien Rgime. In France, before the invention of the guillotine, members of the nobility were beheaded with a sword or an axe, which often took two or more blows to kill the condemned. (The condemned or their families would sometimes pay the executioner to ensure that the blade was sharp, to achieve a quick and relatively painless death.) Commoners were usually hanged, which could take many minutes. In the early phase of the French Revolution, the slogan  la lanterne (in English: To the Lamp Post!, String Them Up! or Hang Them!) had become a symbol of popular justice in revolutionary France. The revolutionary radicals hanged officials and aristocrats from street lanterns. Other more gruesome methods of execution were also used, such as the wheel or burning at the stake.\\r\\nThe guillotine was thus perceived to deliver an immediate death without risk of suffocation. Furthermore, having only one method of civil execution was seen as an expression of equality among citizens. The guillotine was then the only civil legal execution method in France until the abolition of the death penalty in 1981,[18] apart from certain crimes against the security of the state, or for the death sentences passed by military courts,[19] which entailed execution by firing squad.[20]\\r\\nFor a period of time after its invention, the guillotine was called a louisette. However, it was later named after Guillotin who had proposed that a less painful method of execution should be found in place of the breaking wheel, though he opposed the death penalty and bemoaned the association of the guillotine with his name.\\r\\nFrom June 1793 to July 1794 (the Reign of Terror) thousands were guillotined, beginning with Collenot d'Angremont of the National Guard in 1792. Former King Louis XVI and Queen Marie Antoinette were executed in 1793. At this time, executions in Paris were carried out in the Place de la Revolution (former Place Louis XV and current Place de la Concorde); the guillotine stood in the corner near the H?tel Crillon where the statue of Brest can be found today. For a time, executions by guillotine were a popular form of entertainment that attracted great crowds of spectators, with vendors selling programs listing the names of the condemned. But more than popular entertainment alone, during the Reign of Terror, the guillotine symbolized revolutionary ideals: equality in death equivalent to equality before the law, open and demonstrable revolutionary justice, and the destruction of privilege under the Ancien Rgime which included separate forms of execution for the nobility.[21] As such, the guillotine was considered a positive force for progress by the Parisian sans-culottes, the popular public face of lower-class patriotic radicalism in the French Revolution.[22]\\r\\nAfter the French Revolution, executions began again in the city center. On 4 February 1832, the guillotine was moved behind the church of Saint Jacques, just before being moved again, to the Grande Roquette prison, on 29 November 1851.\\r\\nOn 6 August 1909, the guillotine was used on the junction of the Boulevard Arago and the Rue de la Sant, behind the La Sant Prison.\\r\\nThe last public guillotining in France was of Eugen Weidmann, who was convicted of six murders. He was beheaded on 17 June 1939 outside the prison Saint-Pierre, rue Georges Clemenceau 5 at Versailles, which is now the Palais de Justice. A number of problems with that execution (inappropriate behavior by spectators, incorrect assembly of the apparatus, and the fact that it was secretly filmed) caused the French government to order that future executions be conducted in private in the prison courtyard.[citation needed]\\r\\nThe guillotine remained the official method of execution in France until the death penalty was abolished in 1981.[3] The final three guillotinings in France before its abolition were those of child-murderers Christian Ranucci on 28 July 1976 in Marseille and Jr?me Carrein on 23 June 1977 in Douai, and torturer-murderer Hamida Djandoubi on 10 September 1977 in Marseille.\\r\\nIn the late 1840s the Tussaud brothers Joseph and Francis, gathering relics for Madame Tussauds wax museum, visited the aged Henry-Clment Sanson, grandson of the executioner Charles Henri Sanson, from whom they obtained parts, the knife and lunette, of one of the original guillotines used during the Reign of Terror. The executioner had \\"pawned his guillotine, and got into woeful trouble for alleged trafficking in municipal property\\".[23]\\r\\nA number of countries, primarily in Europe, continued to employ this method of execution into the 19th and 20th centuries.\\r\\nIn Antwerp (Belgium), the last person to be beheaded was Francis Kol. Convicted of robbery and murder, he received his punishment on 8 May 1856. During the period from 19 March 1798, until 30 March 1856, there were 19 beheadings in Antwerp.[24]\\r\\nIn Germany, where the guillotine is known as the Fallbeil (\\"falling axe\\"), it was used in various German states from the 17th century onwards,[citation needed] becoming the preferred method of execution in Napoleonic times in many parts of Germany. The guillotine and the firing squad were the legal methods of execution during the era of the German Empire (1871ÿ1918) and the Weimar Republic (1919ÿ1933).\\r\\nThe original German guillotines resembled the French Berger 1872 model, but they eventually evolved into more specialized machines largely built of metal with a much heavier blade enabling shorter uprights to be used. Accompanied by a more efficient blade recovery system and the eventual removal of the tilting board (or bascule) this allowed a quicker turn-around time between executions, those deemed likely to struggle were backed up from behind a curtain in order to shield their view of the device. Additionally, the blade was covered by a metal screen in order to hide it from sight.\\r\\nThe guillotine was used in Nazi Germany between 1933 and 1945 to execute 16,500 prisoners, including 10,000 executions between 1944ÿ1945 alone.[25] One of these Nazi executions was that of Sophie Scholl, who was convicted of high treason after distributing anti-Nazi pamphlets at the University of Munich with her brother Hans, and other members of the German student resistance group, the White Rose.[26] The guillotine was used for the last time in West Germany in 1949 (in the execution of Richard Schuh)[27] and it was last used in East Germany in 1966 (in the execution of Horst Fischer).[28] The guillotine was used in East Germany by the Stasi between 1950 and 1966 for secret executions.[29] In Switzerland it was used for the last time by the canton of Obwalden in the execution of murderer Hans Vollenweider in 1940.\\r\\nThe guillotine was also introduced into Greece in 1834, along with the firing squad, as a method of execution. It was last used in Greece in 1913.\\r\\nIn Sweden, where beheading became the mandatory method of execution in 1866, the guillotine replaced manual beheading in 1903 and it was used only once, in the execution of murderer Alfred Ander in 1910 at L?ngholmen Prison, Stockholm. He was also the last person to be executed in Sweden before capital punishment was abolished in that country in 1921. Swedish child killer Hilda Nilsson was scheduled to be executed by guillotine in 1917. She evaded that fate when her death sentence was commuted to life in prison. She hanged herself in prison before the pardon was communicated to her.[30][31]\\r\\nIn South Vietnam, after the Di?m regime enacted the 10/59 Decree in 1959, mobile special military courts were dispatched to the countryside in order to intimidate the rural population and they used guillotines which had belonged to the former French colonial power in order to carry out death sentences on the spot.[32] One such guillotine is still on show at the War Remnants Museum in Ho Chi Minh City.[33]\\r\\nThe only recorded use of the guillotine in North America took place on the French island of St. Pierre in 1889, of Basque-born assassin Carlos Zuzuarregui, with a guillotine brought in from Guadeloupe.[34] In the Caribbean, it was used more routinely in Guadeloupe and Martinique, the last time in Fort-de-France in 1965.[35]\\r\\nIn 1996 in the US, Georgia State Representative Doug Teper[36] unsuccessfully sponsored a bill to replace that state's electric chair with the guillotine.[37]\\r\\nIn recent years, a number of individuals have committed suicide by means of a guillotine which they had constructed themselves.[38][39][40][41]\\r\\nFrom its first use, there has been debate as to whether the guillotine always provided a swift death as Guillotin had hoped. With previous methods of execution intended to be painful, there was little concern about the level of suffering that they inflicted. Because the guillotine was invented specifically to be humane, the issue of pain and suffering was seriously considered.\\r\\nThe question of consciousness following decapitation remained a topic of discussion during the guillotine's use.\\r\\nThe following report was written by Dr. Beaurieux, who experimented with the head of a condemned prisoner by the name of Henri Languille, on 28 June 1905:\\r\\nHere, then, is what I was able to note immediately after the decapitation: the eyelids and lips of the guillotined man worked in irregularly rhythmic contractions for about five or six seconds. This phenomenon has been remarked by all those finding themselves in the same conditions as myself for observing what happens after the severing of the neck ...\\r\\nI waited for several seconds. The spasmodic movements ceased. [...] It was then that I called in a strong, sharp voice: \\"Languille!\\" I saw the eyelids slowly lift up, without any spasmodic contractions ÿ I insist advisedly on this peculiarity ÿ but with an even movement, quite distinct and normal, such as happens in everyday life, with people awakened or torn from their thoughts.\\r\\nNext Languille's eyes very definitely fixed themselves on mine and the pupils focused themselves. I was not, then, dealing with the sort of vague dull look without any expression, that can be observed any day in dying people to whom one speaks: I was dealing with undeniably living eyes which were looking at me. After several seconds, the eyelids closed again [...].\\r\\nIt was at that point that I called out again and, once more, without any spasm, slowly, the eyelids lifted and undeniably living eyes fixed themselves on mine with perhaps even more penetration than the first time. Then there was a further closing of the eyelids, but now less complete. I attempted the effect of a third call; there was no further movement ÿ and the eyes took on the glazed look which they have in the dead.[42][43]\\r\\nDuring the span of its usage, the French guillotine has gone by many names, some of which include these:","input":"When was the guillotine first used in france?"},{"output":"938 AD","context":"The Chinese domination of Vietnam (Vietnamese: B?c thu?c, Hn t?: ??, \\"Belonging to the North (China)\\"[1][2][3]) began in 111 BC, and is usually considered to have ended in 938 AD. A fourth, relatively brief, 20-year punitive invasion by the Ming dynasty, 400 years later, is usually excluded by historians in discussion of the main, almost continuous, period of Chinese colonization from 111 BC to 938 AD, as is the brief occupation of northern Vietnam by Chinese forces at the end of the Second World War.\\r\\nThe four periods of Chinese colonization or occupation do not correspond to the modern borders of Vietnam but to Vietnam as a cultural entity. During the first three Chinese periods of domination, Vietnamese society was primarily in the northern part of modern Vietnam.[4][5] Ten centuries of Chinese colonization left a substantial demographic footprint, with settlement by large numbers of ethnic Chinese,[6][7] while opening up Vietnam for trade.[8] Against this the second period of Chinese colonization saw almost 500 years of revolt and war,[9] though the third period (603-939) was more harmonious.\\r\\nIn addition to administration, and making Chinese the language of administration, the long period of Chinese domination introduced Chinese techniques of dike construction, rice cultivation, and animal husbandry.[10][11] Chinese culture, having been established among the elite mandarin class, remained the dominant current among that elite for most of the next 1,000 years (939-1870s) until the loss of independence under French Indochina. This cultural affiliation to China remained true even when militarily defending Vietnam against attempted invasion, such as against the Mongol Kublai Khan. The only significant exceptions to this were the 7 years of the strongly anti-Chinese H? dynasty which banned the use of Chinese (among other actions triggering the fourth Chinese invasion), but then after the expulsion of the Ming the rise in vernacular ch? n?m literature.[12] Although 1,000 years of Chinese rule left many traces, the collective memory of the period reinforced Vietnam's cultural and later political independence.[13]","input":"When did vietnam free itself from chinese control?"},{"output":"Burgundy region","context":"Pinot noir (French:?[pino nwa?]) is a red wine grape variety of the species Vitis vinifera. The name may also refer to wines created predominantly from Pinot Noir grapes. The name is derived from the French words for pine and black. The pine alluding to the grape variety having tightly clustered, pine cone-shaped bunches of fruit.[1]\\r\\nPinot noir grapes are grown around the world, mostly in the cooler climates, and the grape is chiefly associated with the Burgundy region of France. Pinot noir is used to make the Italian wine Franciacorta. Other regions that have gained a reputation for pinot noir include: the Willamette Valley of Oregon, the Carneros, Central Coast and Russian River AVAs (American Viticultural Area) of California, the Elgin and Walker Bay wine regions of South Africa, South Australia, Adelaide Hills, Tasmania and Yarra Valley in Australia and the Central Otago, Martinborough and Marlborough wine regions of New Zealand. Pinot Noir is the primary varietal used in sparkling wine production in Champagne and other wine regions.[2]\\r\\nPinot noir is a difficult variety to cultivate and transform into wine.[3] The grape's tendency to produce tightly packed clusters makes it susceptible to several viticultural hazards involving rot that require diligent canopy management. The thin-skins and low levels of phenolic compounds lends pinot to producing mostly lightly colored, medium bodied and low tannin wines that can often go through phases of uneven and unpredictable aging. When young, wines made from Pinot Noir tend to have red fruit aromas of cherries, raspberries and strawberries. As the wine ages, Pinot has the potential to develop more vegetal and \\"barnyard\\" aromas that can contribute to the complexity of the wine.[2]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nPinot noir's home is France's Burgundy region, particularly in C?te-d'Or. It is also planted in Argentina, Australia, Austria, Bulgaria, Canada, Chile, northern parts of Croatia, Czech Republic, the Republic of Georgia, Germany, Greece, Israel, Italy, Hungary, Kosovo, the Republic of Macedonia, Moldova, New Zealand, Romania, Serbia, Slovakia, Slovenia, South Africa, Switzerland, Ukraine, United States and Uruguay. The United States has increasingly become a major Pinot Noir producer, with some of the best regarded coming from the Willamette Valley in Oregon and California's Sonoma County with its Russian River Valley and Sonoma Coast appellations. Lesser known appellations can be found in Mendocino County's Anderson Valley, as well as the Central Coast's Santa Lucia Highlands appellation, the Santa Maria Valley and Sta. Rita Hills American Viticulture Area in Santa Barbara County. In New Zealand, it is principally grown in Martinborough, Marlborough, Waipara and Central Otago.\\r\\nThe leaves of pinot noir are generally smaller than those of Cabernet Sauvignon or Syrah. The Pinot vine is typically less vigorous than either of these varieties. The grape cluster is small and conico-cylindrical; shaped like a pine cone. Some viticultural historians believe this shape similarity may have given rise to the name.[4] In the vineyard pinot noir is sensitive to wind and frost, cropping levels (it must be low yielding for production of quality wines), soil types and pruning techniques. In the winery it is sensitive to fermentation methods, yeast strains and is highly reflective of its terroir with different regions producing very different wines. Its thin skin makes it susceptible to bunch rot and similar fungal diseases. The vines themselves are susceptible to powdery mildew, especially in Burgundy infection by leaf roll and fanleaf viruses causes significant vine health problems. These complications have given the grape a reputation for being difficult to grow: Jancis Robinson calls Pinot a \\"minx of a vine\\"[5] and Andr Tchelistcheff declared that \\"God made Cabernet Sauvignon whereas the devil made Pinot Noir.\\"[5] It is much less tolerant of harsh vineyard conditions than the likes of Cabernet Sauvignon, Syrah, Merlot or Grenache.\\r\\nHowever, pinot noir wines are among the most popular in the world. Joel Fleischman of Vanity Fair describes pinot noir as \\"the most romantic of wines, with so voluptuous a perfume, so sweet an edge, and so powerful a punch that, like falling in love, they make the blood run hot and the soul wax embarrassingly poetic.\\"[6] Master Sommelier Madeline Triffon calls Pinot \\"sex in a glass\\".[6]\\r\\nThe tremendously broad range of bouquets, flavors, textures and impressions that Pinot noir can produce sometimes confuses tasters.[4] In the broadest terms, the wine tends to be of light to medium body with an aroma reminiscent of black and/or red cherry, raspberry and to a lesser extent currant and many other fine small red and black berry fruits. Traditional red Burgundy is famous for its savory fleshiness and 'farmyard' aromas (these latter sometimes associated with thiol and other reductive characters), but changing fashions, modern winemaking techniques, and new easier-to-grow clones have favored a lighter, more fruit-prominent, cleaner style.\\r\\nThe wine's color when young is often compared to that of garnet, frequently being much lighter than that of other red wines. This is entirely natural and not a winemaking fault as Pinot noir has a lower skin anthocyanin (coloring matter) content than most other classical red / black varieties. Callistephin, the 3-O-glucoside of pelargonidin, an orange colored anthocyanidin, is also found in the berry skins of Pinot Noir grapes.[7]\\r\\nHowever, an emerging, increasingly evident, style from California and New Zealand highlights a more powerful, fruit forward and darker wine that can tend toward Syrah (or even new world Malbec) in depth, extract, and alcoholic content.\\r\\nPinot noir is also used in the production of Champagne (usually along with Chardonnay and Pinot Meunier) and is planted in most of the world's wine growing regions for use in both still and sparkling wines. Pinot noir grown for dry table wines is generally low-yielding and of lesser vigour than many other varieties, whereas when grown for use in sparkling wines (e.g. Champagne) it is generally cropped at significantly higher yields.\\r\\nIn addition to being used for the production of sparkling and still red wine, Pinot noir is also sometimes used for ros still wines, Beaujolais Nouveau-styled wines, and even vin gris white wines. Its juice is uncolored.\\r\\nPinot noir is almost certainly a very ancient variety that may be only one or two generations removed from wild, Vitis sylvestris, vines.[8] Its origins are nevertheless unclear: In De re rustica, Columella describes a grape variety similar to pinot noir in Burgundy during the 1st century CE,[4][9] however, vines have grown wild as far north as Belgium in the days before phylloxera, and it is possible that Pinot represents a direct domestication of (hermaphrodite-flowered) Vitis sylvestris.\\r\\nFerdinand Regner argued[10] that pinot noir is a cross between Pinot Meunier (Schwarzriesling) and Traminer, but this claim has since been refuted.[4] In fact Pinot Meunier has been shown to be a chimerical mutation (in the epidermal cells) which makes the shoot tips and leaves prominently hairy-white and the vine a little smaller and early ripening.[11] Thus Pinot Meunier is a chimera with two tissue layers of different genetic makeup, both of which contain a mutation making them non-identical to, and mutations of, Pinot noir (as well as of any of the other color forms of Pinot). As such, Pinot Meunier cannot be a parent of Pinot noir, and, indeed, it seems likely that chimerical mutations which can generate Pinot gris from other Pinots (principally blanc or noir) may in turn be the genetic pathway for the emergence of Pinot Meunier.\\r\\nPinot gris is a Pinot color sport (and can arise by mutation of Pinot noir or Pinot blanc), presumably representing a somatic mutation in either the VvMYBA1 or VvMYBA2 genes that control grape berry color. Pinot blanc is a further mutation and can either naturally arise from or give rise to Pinot gris or Pinot noir; the mutationÿreversion path is multi-directional therefore. The general DNA profiles of both Pinot gris and blanc are identical to Pinot noir;[12] and other Pinots, Pinot moure and Pinot teinturier, are also genetically similarly close. It should be noted therefore that almost any given Pinot (of whatever berry color) can occur as a complete mutation or as a chimera of almost any other Pinot[13] As such, suggestions that Pinot noir is the fundamental and original form of the Pinots are both misleading and highly tendentious. Indeed, if anything, Pinot blanc may be the original human-selected form of Pinot, although given the genetic variability of this longstanding genetic line, thinking of Pinot as a familial cluster of grapes sharing a fundamental and common genetic core is almost certainly nearest the truth. It is this 'core' around which the sub-varietally identifying color variations (blanc, rouge, noir, gris, rose, violet, tenteurier, moure, etc.) occur, along with the more striking chimeric morphological mutation that is Pinot Meunier, and the interesting further mutations of this variety as Pinot Meunier gris and as the non-hairy mutation which the Germans classify as 'Samtrot' (effectively 'Pinot red velvet').\\r\\nA white berried sport of Pinot noir was propagated in 1936 by Henri Gouges of Burgundy, and there is now 2.5ha planted of this grape which Clive Coates[14] calls Pinot Gouges, and others call Pinot Musigny. There is however no published evidence, nor any obvious reason, to believe that this is other than a (possibly quite fine) form of Pinot blanc, having simply arisen as a selected natural mutation of the original Pinot noir in the Gouges' vineyard.\\r\\nIn the UK, the name 'Wrotham Pinot' is a permitted synonym for Pinot Meunier and stems from a vine that one of the pioneers of UK viticulture, Edward Hyams, discovered in Wrotham (pronounced 'root-am' or 'root-em') in Kent in the late 1940s. It was in all probability the variety known as 'Miller's Burgundy' which had been widely grown on walls and in gardens in Great Britain for many years. Archibald Barron writing in his book, Vines and Vine Culture, the standard Victorian work on grape growing in the UK, states that the 'Millers Burgundy' also was: found by [the famous horticulturalist] Sir Joseph Banks in the remains of an ancient vineyard at Tortworth, Gloucestershire ÿ a county well known for its medieval vineyards. Hyams took the vine to Raymond Barrington Brock, who ran what was to become the Oxted Viticultural Research Station, and he trialed it alongside the many other varieties he grew. Brock said that when compared to supplies of Meunier from France, Wrotham Pinot: had a higher natural sugar content and ripened two weeks earlier. Hyams, ever the journalist in search of a good story, claimed that this vine had been left behind by the Romans although he provided absolutely no evidence for this. Brock sold cuttings of 'Wrotham Pinot' and the variety became quite popular in early English 'revival' vineyards in the late twentieth century, although it is unlikely that many vines from the cuttings supplied by Brock survive in any present UK vineyards. Indeed, despite the fact that today virtually all plantings of Meunier in the UK stem from French and German nurseries, the name Wrotham Pinot is still a legally acceptable synonym for this variety, although little, if ever, used by UK growers.\\r\\nPinot noir can be particularly prone to mutation (suggesting it has active transposable elements), and thanks to its long history in cultivation there are hundreds of different clones in vineyards and vine collections worldwide. More than 50 are officially recognized in France compared to only 25 of the much more widely planted Cabernet Sauvignon.[15] The French Etablissement National Technique pour l'Amelioration de la Viticulture (ENTAV) has set up a program to select the best clones of Pinot. This program has succeeded in increasing the number of quality clones available to growers. In the new world, particularly in Oregon, wines of extraordinary quality continue to be made from the (ex-University of California at Davis) Pommard (principally UCD4) and Wadensvil (UCD 1A and / or 2A) clones.[4]\\r\\nGamay Beaujolais is a Californian misnomer for a UCD clone series of upright-growing ('Pinot droit') Pinot noir. Planted mostly in California it also became established in New Zealand.[16] In New Zealand, its disposition to poor fruit set in cool flowering conditions can be problematic. It has been claimed that the 'Gamay Beaujolais' Pinot noir was brought to California by Paul Masson.[17] But it was collected in France by Harold Olmo for UCD in the 1950s and was one of the first Pinot noir vines this institution offered as a high health clonal line from about 1962 onward. However, it was misleadingly identified at UCD as a 'Gamay Beaujolais' type (of Pinot noir). In general, these upright growing 'Pinot droit' clones are highly productive (in suitable, hot-to-warm, flowering conditions) and in California and New Zealand they give robust, burly, wines favored by those who like muscle rather than charm and velvety finesse in their Pinot noir wines.[citation needed] In Burgundy, the use of (highly productive) Pinot droit clones is reportedly still widespread in inferior, Village appellation, or even non-appellation, vineyards and Pinot droit is consequently regarded, arguably with very good reason, as a (genetic) sub-form significantly inferior to classical, decumbent, 'Pinot fine' or 'Pinot tordu', clonal lines of Pinot.\\r\\nFrhburgunder (Pinot Noir Prcoce) is an early-ripening form of Pinot noir.[18] Across the Pinot family, ripening in typical climates can be dispersed by as much as four, and even six, weeks between the very earliest (including Prcoce) clones and the very latest ripening. Virus infection and excessive cropping significantly add to the delaying of Pinot noir ripening.\\r\\nGouget noir is sometimes confused as being a clone of Pinot noir but DNA analysis has confirmed that it is a distinct variety.[19]\\r\\nIn August 2007, French researchers announced the sequencing of the genome of Pinot noir.[20] It is the first fruit crop to be sequenced, and only the fourth flowering plant.\\r\\nIn the Middle Ages, the nobility and church of northeast France grew some form of Pinot in favored plots, while peasants grew a large amount of the much more productive, but otherwise distinctly inferior, Gouais blanc. Cross-pollination may have resulted from such close proximity, with the genetic distance between the two parents imparting hybrid vigor leading to the viticultural selection of a diverse range of offspring from this cross (which may, nevertheless, have also resulted from deliberate human intervention). In any case, however it occurred, offspring of the Pinot - Gouais cross include: Chardonnay, Aligot, Auxerrois, Gamay, Melon and eleven others.[12] Pinot noir was not necessarily the Pinot involved here; any member of the Pinot family appears genetically capable of being the Pinot parent to these ex-Gouais crosses.\\r\\nIn 1925, Pinot noir was crossed in South Africa with the Cinsaut grape (known locally by the misnomer 'Hermitage') to create a unique variety called Pinotage.\\r\\nPinot noir is produced in several wine growing areas of Australia, notably in the Southern Highlands in New South Wales, Yarra Valley, Geelong, the Bellarine Peninsula, Beechworth, South Gippsland, Sunbury, Macedon Ranges and Mornington Peninsula in Victoria, Adelaide Hills in South Australia, Great Southern Wine Region in Western Australia, all Tasmania, and the Canberra District in the Australian Capital Territory.\\r\\nIn Austria, Pinot noir is usually called Blauburgunder (literally Blue Burgundy) and produced in Burgenland and Lower Austria. Austrian Pinot noir wines are dry red wines similar in character to the red wines of Burgundy, mostly aged in French barriques. Some of the best Austrian Pinots come from Neusiedlersee and Blaufraenkischland (Burgenland), and Thermenregion (Lower Austria).\\r\\nPinot noir has been grown in Ontario for some time in the Niagara Peninsula and especially the Niagara-on-the-Lake and Short Hills Bench wine regions, as well as in Prince Edward County and on the north shore of Lake Ontario. It has also been grown recently in the Okanagan, here it is grown predominantly on the Naramata bench and in the northern Okanagan, Lower Mainland, and Vancouver Island wine regions of British Columbia, the Annapolis Valley region of Nova Scotia and the Lanaudire and Brome-Missisquoi regions of Quebec.\\r\\nPinot noir is increasingly being planted in the U.K. and is now the second most widely planted variety, (305-ha in 2012) almost all of it for sparkling wine[citation needed].\\r\\nPinot noir has made France's Burgundy appellation famous, and vice versa. Wine historians, including John Winthrop Haeger and Roger Dion, believe that the association between Pinot and Burgundy was the explicit strategy of Burgundy's Valois dukes. Roger Dion, in his thesis regarding Philip the Bold's role in promoting the spread of Pinot noir, holds that the reputation of Beaune wines as \\"the finest in the world\\" was a propaganda triumph of Burgundy's Valois dukes.[21] In any event, the worldwide archetype for pinot noir is that grown in Burgundy, where it has been cultivated since AD 100.\\r\\nBurgundy's Pinot noir produces wines which can age well in good years, developing complex fruit and forest floor flavours as they age, often reaching peak 15 or 20 years after the vintage. Many of the wines are produced in small quantities. Today, the C?te d'Or escarpment of Burgundy has about 4,500 hectares (11,000 acres) of Pinot noir. Most of the region's finest wines are produced from this area. The C?te Chalonnaise and Maconnais regions in southern Burgundy have another 4,000 hectares (9,900 acres).\\r\\nIn Jura dpartement, across the river valley from Burgundy, the wines made from pinot noir are lighter.\\r\\nIn Champagne it is used in blending with Chardonnay and Pinot Meunier. It can also appear unblended, in which case it may be labeled blanc de noirs. The Champagne appellation has more Pinot planted than any other area of France.\\r\\nIn Sancerre it is used to make red and ros wines, much lighter in style that those of Burgundy, refreshing served chilled, especially in warmer years when they are less thin.\\r\\nIn Alsace it is generally used to make Pinot-noir d'Alsace?(fr), a varietal ros wine. However, it is also used to make genuine red wines usually called Pinot noir rouge, which are similar in character to red Burgundy and Beaujolais wines but are consumed chilled. Prominent examples are Rouge de Barr and Rouge d'Ottrott?(fr). Pinot noir rouge is the only red wine produced in Alsace.\\r\\nIn Germany it is called Sp?tburgunder (lit. \\"Late Burgundian\\"), and is now the most widely planted red grape.[22] Historically much German wine produced from Pinot noir was pale, often ros like the red wines of Alsace; over-cropping and bunch-rot were major contributing factors to this. However, recently, despite the northerly climate, darker, richer reds have been produced, often barrel (barrique) aged, in regions such as Baden, Palatinate (Pfalz) and Ahr. These are rarely exported and are often expensive in Germany for the better examples. As \\"Rhenish\\", German Pinot noir is mentioned several times in Shakespearean plays as a highly prized wine.[23]\\r\\nThere is also a smaller-berried, early ripening, lower yield variety called Frhburgunder (Pinot Noir Prcoce, lit. \\"Early Burgundian\\") which is grown in Rheinhessen and Ahr area and can produce good wines. In the last 20 years, efforts have been made to develop and husband good quality high health clones of Frhburgunder selected from Wrttemberg vineyards.[citation needed]\\r\\nIn Italy, where Pinot noir is known as Pinot nero, it has traditionally been cultivated in South Tyrol, the Collio Goriziano, Franciacorta, Oltrep Pavese, Veneto, Friuli and Trentino. It is also planted in Tuscany.\\r\\nIn South Tyrol the variety is first noted 1838 as \\"Bourgoigne noir\\" in a grape wine buy list of the \\"k.u.k. Landwirtschafts-Gesellschaft von Tirol und Vorarlberg, Niederlassung Bozen\\" and later called \\"Blauburgunder\\" like in Austria. The first analytical descriptions are from Edmund Mach (founder of Ist. Agr. San Michele a.A.) in the year 1894: Friedrich Boscarolli - Rametz/Meran - Rametzer Burgunder 1890, Chorherrenstift Neustift - Blauburgunder 1890, R.v.Bressendorf - Vernaun/Meran - Burgunder 1890, C. Frank - Rebhof Gries Bozen - Burgunder 1889, Fr. Tschurtschenthaler - Bozen - Burgunder 1890 & 1891, Fr. Tschurtschenthaler - Bozen - Kreuzbichler 1889 & 1891 & 1887.[24]\\r\\nLarge amounts of Pinot were planted in central Moldova during the 19th century, but much was lost to the ravages of phylloxera; Soviet control of Moldova from 1940 to 1991 also reduced the productivity of vineyards.\\r\\nPinot noir is New Zealand's largest red wine variety, and second largest variety overall behind sauvingnon blanc. In 2014, pinot noir vines covered 5,569 hectares (13,760 acres) and produced 36,500?tonnes of grapes.[25]\\r\\nPinot noir is a grape variety whose \\"importance\\" in New Zealand is extremely high. However, initial results were not promising for several reasons, including high levels of leaf roll virus in older plantings, and, during the 1960s and 1970s, the limited number and indifferent quality of Pinot noir clones available for planting. However, since this time importation of high quality clones and much-improved viticulture and winemaking has seen pinot noir, from Martinborough in the north to Central Otago in the south, win international awards and accolades. As the industry has matured, many of the country's top producers have made the decision no longer to submit their wines to reviews or shows.[26]\\r\\nIn Slovenia, the pinot noir is produced especially in the Slovenian Littoral, particularly in the Gori?ka Brda sub-region. In smaller amounts, the Pinot noir is also produced in Slovenian Styria. The wine is usually called Modri Pinot (Blue Pinot) or also Modri Burgundec (Blue Burgundy).\\r\\nWith the growth of the South African wine industry into newer areas, Pinot noir is now also to be found in cool climate Walker Bay and Elgin, the two oldest Pinot regions in the country.\\r\\nNot often found, Pinot noir has been produced in small amounts in Lleida province, Catalonia, under the appellation \\"Costers del Segre\\" DO.[27] There is also a small vineyard of Pinot noir within DO Montsant which has the wine produced in Celler de Cap?anes although as Pinot noir is not a permitted grape varietal within the DO, it is released under the broader DO Catalunya.[28]\\r\\nPinot noir is a popular grape variety all over Switzerland. In German-speaking regions of Switzerland it is often called Blauburgunder. Pinot noir wines are produced in Neuchatel, Schaffhausen, St. Gallen and Bndner Herrschaft. In Valais, Pinot noir is also blended with Gamay to produce the well known D?le.\\r\\nBy volume most Pinot noir in America is grown in California, with Oregon second in production.[29] Other growing regions are the states of Washington, Michigan, and New York.\\r\\nCalifornia wine regions known for producing Pinot noir are:\\r\\nOregon wine regions known for producing Pinot noir:\\r\\nRichard Sommers of HillCrest Vineyard in the Umpqua Valley of Oregon is the father of Oregon Pinot noir. An early graduate of UC Davis, Sommers moved north after graduation with the idea of planting Pinot noir in the Coastal valleys of Oregon. He brought cuttings to the state in 1959 and made his first commercial planting at HillCrest Vineayard in Roseburg Oregon in 1961. For this he was honored by the Oregon State House of Representatives (HR 4A). In 2011 the State of Oregon honored him for this achievement and also for producing the first commercial bottling in the state in 1967. It was announced by the state of Oregon in the summer of 2012 that an historical marker would be placed at the winery in the summer of 2013.[30]\\r\\nSommers, who graduated from UC Davis in the early 1950s, brought Pinot Noir cuttings to Oregon's Umpqua Valley in 1959 and planted them at HillCrest Vineyard in 1961. These first Pinot noir cuttings came from Louis Martinis Sr.'s Stanley Ranch located in the Carneros region of Napa Valley. The first commercial vintage from these grapes was the noted 1967 Pinot noir although test bottlings were made as early as 1963. In the 1970s several other growers followed suit. In 1979, David Lett took his wines to a competition in Paris, known in English as the Wine Olympics, and they placed third among Pinots. In a 1980 rematch arranged by French wine magnate Robert Drouhin, the Eyrie vintage improved to second place. The competition established Oregon as a world-class Pinot noir producing region.[31][32]\\r\\nThe Willamette Valley of Oregon is at the same latitude as the Burgundy region of France, and has a similar climate in which the finicky Pinot noir grapes thrive. In 1987, Drouhin purchased land in the Willamette Valley, and in 1989 built Domaine Drouhin Oregon, a state-of-the-art, gravity-fed winery. Throughout the 1980s, the Oregon wine industry blossomed.\\r\\nBeing lighter in style, Pinot noir has benefited from a trend toward more restrained, less alcoholic wines around 12% alcohol by volume.\\r\\nDuring 2004 and the beginning of 2005, Pinot noir became considerably more popular among consumers in the US, Australia, New Zealand and Asia as a result of the film Sideways,[33] and its deleterious effect on Merlot sales. Throughout the film, the main character speaks fondly of Pinot Noir while denigrating Merlot.[34][35] Following the film's U.S. release in October 2004, Merlot sales dropped 2% while Pinot Noir sales increased 16% in the Western United States. A similar trend occurred in British wine outlets.[35][36][37][38][39][40] A 2009 study by Sonoma State University found that Sideways slowed the growth in Merlot sales volume and caused its price to fall, but the film's main effect on the wine industry was a rise in the sales volume and price of Pinot Noir and in overall wine consumption.[41] A 2014 study by Vineyard Financial Associates estimated that Sideways cost Merlot farmers over $400m in lost revenue in the decade after its release.[42]","input":"Where is the pinot noir grape variety grown in france?"},{"output":"Jackie","context":"The Jackson family is an American family of singers who originated in Gary, Indiana. Performing as members of The Jackson 5 and as solo artists, the children of Joseph Walter and Katherine Esther Jackson were very successful in the field of popular music from the late 1960s onwards. As a group, the eldest sons Jackie, Tito, Jermaine, Marlon, Michael, and later with the inclusion of Randy made the family's reputation, facilitating the subsequent success of siblings Rebbie, La Toya, and Janet. The Jackson 5 became known as the \\"First Family of Soul\\"[1][2] (a title first held by the Five Stairsteps).[2] The continued success of Michael and Janet's careers as solo artists led the Jacksons to become known as the \\"Royal Family of Pop\\".[3] All nine of the Jackson siblings have gold records to their credits with La Toya holding the distinction of being the first Jackson sister to attain one (awarded by France's SNEP for \\"Reggae Night\\", a song she co-wrote for Jimmy Cliff).[4]\\r\\nIn recent years, certain members of the family have been honored for their work; in 1997 The Jackson 5 was inducted to the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.[5] Michael would follow the group to the hall in 2001. The Jacksons, Michael and Janet all received stars on the Hollywood Walk of Fame in 1980, 1984 and 1990 respectively. In 2009 a new series from A&E entitled The Jacksons: A Family Dynasty premiered documenting the Jackson brothers dealing with the sudden loss of Michael and preparing for a Jackson 5 Reunion tour.[6]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nJoseph Walter Jackson was born on July 26, 1928 in Arkansas but he grew up in Oakland, California with his father Samuel Jackson, a school teacher. At age 18 he moved to East Chicago, Indiana to be with his mother Crystal Lee King and to pursue his dreams of becoming a professional boxer. At age 21, Joseph married Katherine Scruse, 19, immediately starting a family. Even though he wanted to be a success in boxing it wasnt a job for a family man, so he obtained a job as an overhead crane operator with East Chicago's Inland Steel Company. His family continued to grow steadily and over the course of sixteen years he and Katherine had a house full of nine children. Joe Jackson always wanted to make it big and although he couldnt in boxing or in his own short musical stint in the 1950s with the band The Falcons, he saw the talent in his children, starting with Tito and Tito's ability to play the guitar.[7]\\r\\nSoon enough Joe Jackson formed a band of his sons Tito, Jermaine, and Jackie called The Jackson Brothers in 1964 and became their manager. After several years of doing local talent shows, Joseph enlarged the band to include Marlon and Michael, two of his younger sons, and then changed the name of the band to The Jackson Five by 1966, remaining the group's manager. As their father he was a very strict disciplinarian and had an abusive nature[citation needed] and as their manager he enforced long practice sessions of singing and dancing in hopes of preparing them to make it big one day. In August 1967, the group made a debut at the Apollo Theater in Harlem, New York where they won the Amateur Night contest. Gordon Keith the owner and producer at Steeltown Records in Gary, Indiana, discovered the Jackson Five and signed them to their first contract in November 1967. Big Boy, the boys' first record which was produced by Keith, was released on January 30, 1968. It became a local hit. In March 1969, they signed a Motown record contract and became known as the Jackson 5. The group enjoyed the fame Joseph Jackson had been longing for in his life. He continued to manage The Jackson 5 into stardom and after the band they had many No. 1 hits on the Billboard hot singles charts; Joseph moved them to a mansion in Encino, California with his own hefty salary he had obtained as their full-time manager. After many years as a band and with Michael as lead singer, the group continued to churn out even more hits and wealth, but tensions grew and in 1979, Michael severed ties with his father/manager and went on to pursue a solo musical entertainment career. Four years later, in 1983, Michael's siblings fired Joseph Jackson as their manager. In 1993, Michael Jackson accused his father of physical and mental abuse; a few of the other siblings confirmed this claim, but others denied it.[7]\\r\\nKatherine Jackson (ne Kattie B. Scruse) was born on May 4, 1930 in Barbour County, Alabama, the child of Prince Albert Scruse (1907ÿ1997) and Martha Mattie Upshaw (1907ÿ1990). She was left with a permanent limp after acquiring polio syndrome in her childhood. She later recovered from her illness after moving with her family to East Chicago, Indiana, where she would remain until meeting her husband Joseph Jackson. The couple moved and bought a small home in Gary, Indiana, where they birthed and raised nine children and she was a stay-at-home mother.[8] Throughout her life, Katherine remained a devoted Jehovah's Witness and raised her children strictly under the same spiritual teachings she received. Also, as a talented pianist and vocalist who shared her talents with her children, she was later credited for being the foundation of her children's success. After her sons' rise to fame as The Jackson 5, she strongly supported her children and became the costume designer for their shows and performances. Some of the memorable moments of her unconditional support were seen when her son Michael was tried for molestation charges in 1993 and 2005. Katherine now lives in Calabasas, California where she cares for the children of her late son, Michael.[8] After allegations that she may have been held against her will by Randy and Janet Jackson, Katherine lost custody of Michael's children, ultimately regaining it in 2012.[9][10]\\r\\nTogether, Joseph and Katherine Jackson had ten children. Their son Brandon (Marlon's twin) died at birth. The other nine grew up to become professional musicians.[11]\\r\\nThere are 26 children that make up the third generation of the Jackson family along with several great-grandchildren. Among them, some have followed in the family's footsteps into the entertainment industry.\\r\\nThe three children of Michael Jackson are probably the most well-known of the third generation. Michael Joseph Jackson Jr. (b. February 13, 1997), also known as \\"Prince\\", Paris Jackson (b. April 3, 1998), and Prince Michael Jackson II also known as \\"Blanket\\" now called \\"Bigi\\" (b. February 21, 2002), have been discussed in the press numerous times throughout their lives, particularly since their father's death in 2009.\\r\\nRebbie, Tito, Jackie, Jermaine and Janet Jackson have also had children, who have come under varying degrees of media focus. Austin Brown (b. 1985), the only son of Rebbie Jackson, is a singer and songwriter who has released several successful singles in the pop/R&B genre. Tito Jackson's three sons, Toriano Adaryll \\"Taj\\" Jackson, Jr. (b. 1973), Taryll Adren Jackson (b. 1975), and Tito Joe \\"TJ\\" Jackson (b.1978) make up the R&B/pop music group 3T. 3T has released three studio albums and has gone on to have moderate success in the industry, primarily outside of the United States. Sigmund \\"Siggy\\" Jackson Jr. (b. 1977), the eldest son to Jackie Jackson, is a hip-hop artist who goes under the name \\"Dealz\\". Siggy has been a ghostwriter for a number of independent artists and has obtained mild success as a solo artist. Jermaine La Jaune \\"Jay\\" Jackson Jr. (b. 1977), the eldest son to Jermaine Jackson, portrayed his father in the 1992 miniseries, The Jacksons: An American Dream, a biopic about the Jackson family. On January 3, 2017, at the age of 50, Janet gave birth to Eissa Al Mana, the newest member to the Jackson Family.","input":"Who was born first in the jackson family?"},{"output":"Afghanistan","context":"Adherents of Islam constitute the world's second largest religious group.

Of the total Muslim population, 87-90% are Sunni and 10-13% are Shi'a. Most Shi'as (between 68% and 80%) live in mainly four countries: Iran, Azerbaijan, Bahrain and Iraq.[17] Today, many of the Shia sects are extinct. The major surviving Imamah-Muslim Sects are Usulism (with nearly more than 10%), Nizari Ismailism (with nearly more than 1%) and Alevism (with slightly more than 0.5%[18] but less than 1%[19]). The other existing groups include Zaydi Shi'a of Yemen whose population is nearly more than 0.5% of the world's Muslim population, Mustali Ismaili (with nearly 0.1%[20] whose Taiyabi adherents reside in Sindh and Gujarat in South Asia. There are also significant diaspora populations in Europe, North America, the Far East and East Africa[21]), and Ibadis from the Kharijites whose population has diminished to a level below 0.15%.

Pizza was mainly eaten in the country of Italy and by emigrants from there. This changed after World War II, when Allied troops stationed in Italy came to enjoy pizza along with other Italian foods.\\r\\n\\r\\nFoods similar to pizza have been made since the neolithic age. Records of people adding other ingredients to bread to make it more flavorful can be found throughout ancient history.\\r\\n\\r\\nSome commentators have suggested that the origins of modern pizza can be traced to pizzarelle, which were kosher for Passover cookies eaten by Roman Jews after returning from the synagogue on that holiday, though some also trace its origins to other Italian paschal breads.[10] Abba Eban has suggested that modern pizza \\"was first made more than 2000 years ago when Roman soldiers added cheese and olive oil to matzah\\".[11]\\r\\n\\r\\nOther examples of flatbreads that survive to this day from the ancient Mediterranean world are focaccia (which may date back as far as the ancient Etruscans); Mankoucheh in Lebanon, coca (which has sweet and savory varieties) from Catalonia; Valencia and the Balearic Islands; the Greek Pita; Lepinja in the Balkans; or Piadina in the Romagna part of Emilia-Romagna in Italy.[12]\\r\\n\\r\\nFoods similar to flatbreads in other parts of the world include Chinese bing (a wheat flour-based Chinese food with a flattened or disk-like shape); the Indian paratha (in which fat is incorporated); the Central and South Asian naan (leavened) and roti (unleavened); the Sardinian carasau, spianata, guttiau, pistoccu; and Finnish rieska. Also worth noting is that throughout Europe there are many similar pies based on the idea of covering flat pastry with cheese, meat, vegetables and seasoning such as the Alsatian flammkuchen, German zwiebelkuchen, and French quiche.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 16th-century Naples, a galette flatbread was referred to as a pizza. Known as the dish for poor people, it was sold in the street and was not considered a kitchen recipe for a long time.[13] This was later replaced by oil, tomatoes (after Europeans came into contact with the Americas) or fish. In 1843, Alexandre Dumas, pre, described the diversity of pizza toppings.[14] An often recounted story holds that on 11 June 1889, to honour the Queen consort of Italy, Margherita of Savoy, the Neapolitan pizzamaker Raffaele Esposito created the \\"Pizza Margherita\\", a pizza garnished with tomatoes, mozzarella, and basil, to represent the national colours of Italy as on the Italian flag.[15][16][17]\\r\\n\\r\\nPizza is now a type of bread and tomato dish, often served with cheese. However, until the late nineteenth or early twentieth century, the dish was sweet, not savory, and earlier versions which were savory more resembled the flat breads now known as schiacciata.[18] Pellegrino Artusi's classic early-twentieth-century cookbook, La Scienza in cucina e l'Arte di mangiar bene gives three recipes for pizza, all of which are sweet.[19] After the dispute of some readers, Artusi will add in a copy of 1911 edition (founded by food historian Alberto Capatti) a typed sheet, bound with the volume, with the recipe of \\"pizza alla napoletana\\": mozzarella, tomatoes, anchovies and mushrooms. [20]\\r\\n\\r\\nHowever, by 1927, Ada Boni's collection of regional cooking includes a recipe using tomatoes and mozzarella.[21]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe innovation that led to flat bread pizza was the use of tomato as a topping. For some time after the tomato was brought to Europe from the Americas in the 16th century, it was believed by many Europeans to be poisonous (as some other fruits of the nightshade family are). However, by the late 18th century, it was common for the poor of the area around Naples to add tomato to their yeast-based flat bread, and so the pizza began.[citation needed] The dish gained popularity, and soon pizza became a tourist attraction as visitors to Naples ventured into the poorer areas of the city to try the local specialty.\\r\\n\\r\\nAccording to documents founded by historian Antonio Mattozzi in State Archive of Naples, in 1807 already 54 pizzerias existed, with their owners and addresses. [22]  In the half of Nintheen Century, when the success of Neapolitan pizza exploded, they increase to 120.[23]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn Naples two others figures existed, connected to the trade: the pizza hawker (pizzaiuolo ambulante\\r\\n), who sold pizza but he did not make it, and the seller of pizza \\" a oggi a otto\\", who made pizzas but sold them in return for a payment for seven days. [24]\\r\\n\\r\\nPurists, like the famous pizzeria \\"Da Michele\\" in Via C. Sersale, consider there to be only two true pizzasthe marinara and the margheritaand that is all they serve. These two \\"pure\\" pizzas are the ones preferred by many Italians today.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe marinara is the older of the two and has a topping of tomato, oregano, garlic, and extra virgin olive oil. It is named marinara because it was traditionally the food prepared by \\"la marinara\\", the seaman's wife, for her seafaring husband when he returned from fishing trips in the Bay of Naples.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe margherita is topped with modest amounts of tomato sauce, mozzarella cheese and fresh basil. It is widely attributed to baker Raffaele Esposito, who worked at \\"Pizzeria di Pietro\\", established in 1880. Though recent research casts doubt on this legend,[25] the tale holds that, in 1889, he baked three different pizzas for the visit of King Umberto I and Queen Margherita of Savoy. The Queen's favorite was a pizza evoking the colors of the Italian flaggreen (basil leaves), white (mozzarella), and red (tomatoes).[26] According to the tale, this combination was named Pizza Margherita in her honor. Although those were the most preferred, today there are many variations of pizzas.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\"Associazione Verace Pizza Napoletana\\"[27] (\\"True Neapolitan Pizza Association\\"), which was founded in 1984, has set the very specific rules that must be followed for an authentic Neapolitan pizza. These include that the pizza must be baked in a wood-fired, domed oven; that the base must be hand-kneaded and must not be rolled with a pin or prepared by any mechanical means (i pizzaiolithe pizza makersmake the pizza by rolling it with their fingers) and that the pizza must not exceed 35 centimetres in diameter or be more than one-third of a centimetre thick at the centre. The association also selects pizzerias all around the world to produce and spread the verace pizza napoletana philosophy and method.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere are many famous pizzerias in Naples where these traditional pizzas can be found such as Da Michele, Port'Alba, Brandi, Di Matteo, Sorbillo, Trianon, and Umberto (founded: 1916).[28] Most of them are in the ancient historical centre of Naples. These pizzerias will go even further than the specified rules by, for example, using only San Marzano tomatoes grown on the slopes of Mount Vesuvius and drizzling the olive oil and adding tomato topping in only a clockwise direction.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe pizza bases in Naples are soft and pliable. In Rome they prefer a thin and crispy base. Another popular form of pizza in Italy is \\"pizza al taglio\\", which is pizza baked in rectangular trays with a wide variety of toppings and sold by weight.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1962, the \\"Hawaiian\\" pizza, a pizza topped with pineapple and ham, was invented in Canada by restaurateur Sam Panopoulis at the Satellite Restaurant in Chatham, Ontario.[29]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn December 2009, the pizza napoletana was granted Traditional Speciality Guaranteed status by the European Union.[30]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 2012, the world's largest pizza was made in Rome, and was measured to be 1261.65 square metres.[31]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 2016, robotics company BeeHex, widely covered in the media, was building robots that 3D-printed pizza.[32]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn December 2017, the pizza napoletana was inscribed on the UNESCO Intangible Cultural Heritage Lists.[33]\\r\\n\\r\\nCanada was first introduced to pizza in the late 1950s, with the first pizza ovens entering the country.[34] It gained popularity throughout the 1960s, with many pizzerias and restaurants opening across the country. Pizza was mostly served in restaurants and small pizzerias. Most pizza restaurants across Canada also serve popular Italian cuisine in addition to pizza, such as pasta, salad, soups and sandwiches. Fast-food pizza chains also provide other side options for customers to choose from, in addition to ordering pizza, including chicken wings, fries and poutine, salad, and calzones. Pizza Pops are a Canadian calzone-type snack introduced in the 1960s. Pizza chains across Canada can be found in shopping centres, schools, and neighbourhood plazas, with the majority of these chains offering a sit-and-dine facility for customers.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe most distinct pizza in Canada is the \\"Canadian\\" pizza. A \\"Canadian\\" pizza is usually prepared with tomato sauce, mozzarella cheese, mushrooms and bacon. Many variations of this pizza exist, but the two standout ingredients that make this pizza distinctly Canadian are bacon and mushrooms. Pizzas in Canada are almost never served with \\"Canadian bacon\\", or back bacon as it's referred to in Canada. Rather, side bacon is the standard pork topping on pizza.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn Canada, pizza is served on a variety of crust types, including a traditional-style pan crust, a thin crust, multi-grain crust, whole-grain crust, and a gluten-free crust. Stuffed-crust pizza is also a popular pizza alternative for Canadian customers. It contains pizza toppings of the customers choice on a mozzarella-filled crust.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the province of Quebec Pizza-ghetti is a combination meal commonly found in fast food or family restaurants. It consists of a pizza, sliced in half, accompanied by a small portion of spaghetti with a tomato based sauce. Although both pizza and spaghetti are considered staples of Italian cuisine, combining them in one dish is completely unknown in Italy. A popular variant involves using spaghetti as a pizza topping, under the pizza's mozzarella cheese\\r\\n\\r\\nSome of Canada's successful pizza brands include: Boston Pizza, Pizza Pizza, and Vanellis. Boston Pizza, also known as BPs in Canada, and \\"Boston'sthe Gourmet Pizza\\" in the United States and Mexico, is one of Canadas largest franchising restaurants.[35] The brand has opened over 325 locations across Canada and 50 locations in Mexico and the US.[35] The first Boston Pizza location was opened in Edmonton, Alberta, in 1964, and operated under the name \\"Boston Pizza & Spaghetti House\\", with locations still opening across the nation. It is the first Canadian restaurant to introduce the heart-shaped pizza on Valentines Day, a 22-year tradition, where a dollar from each pizza ordered supports Boston Pizza Foundation Future Prospects.[36] Pizza Pizza, and its subsidiary chain Pizza 73 in Western Canada, are among Canadas largest domestic brands based in Ontario.[citation needed] To date, they have over 500 locations nationwide, and fill more than 29 million orders annually.[37]\\r\\nVanellis is an international pizza chain that is based in Mississauga, Ontario.[38] The chain first opened in 1981, serving both pizza and other fresh Italian cuisine, such as pasta and Italian sandwiches.[38]  In 1995, the brand opened its first international location in Bahrain and became an international success. The brand continued to open additional locations across the Middle East, with chains now opened in the United Arab Emirates, Lebanon, and Morocco.[39] There are over 110 locations worldwide; making Vanellis the first pizza brand in Canada to open locations internationally.\\r\\n\\r\\nWith pizza gaining popularity across the nation, major American pizza chains such as Pizza Hut, Dominos Pizza and Little Caesars have expanded their locations in Canada, competing against the domestic Canadian brands. The major American pizza chains have brought their signature classic pizza recipes and toppings into their Canadian chains, offering their traditional classic pizzas to Canadian customers. However, the American chains have also created Canadian specialty pizzas that are available only in Canada. Pizzas that have been made exclusively for Canada by the American chain Pizza Hut for a limited time, included the following:\\r\\n\\r\\nPizza first made its appearance in the United States with the arrival of Italian immigrants in the late 19th century and was very popular among large Italian populations in New York City, Chicago, Philadelphia, and Saint Louis. In the late 19th century, pizza was introduced by peddlers who walked up and down the streets with a metal washtub of pizzas on their heads, selling their pizzas at two cents a slice. It was not long until small cafes and groceries began offering pizzas to their Italian American communities.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe first printed reference to \\"pizza\\" served in the US is a 1904 article in The Boston Journal.[41] Giovanni and Gennaro Bruno came to America from Naples, Italy in 1903 to introduce the Neapolitan Pizza.[clarification needed] Vincent (Jimmy) Bruno (Giovanni's son) went on to open the first pizzeria in The Loop in Chicago at 421 S. Wabash Avenue, the Yacht Club. Gennaro Lombardi opened a grocery store in 1897 which was later established as the \\"said\\" first pizzeria in America in 1905 with New York's issuance of the mercantile license. An employee of his, Antonio Totonno Pero, began making pizza for the store to sell that same year. The price for a pizza was five cents, but since many people could not afford the cost of a whole pie, they would instead say how much they could pay and they were given a slice corresponding to the amount offered. In 1924, Totonno left Lombardi's to open his own pizzeria on Coney Island called Totonno's. While the original Lombardi's closed its doors in 1984, it was reopened in 1994 just down the street and is run by Lombardi's grandson.\\r\\n\\r\\nPizza was brought to the Trenton area of New Jersey with Joe's Tomato Pies opening in 1910, followed soon by Papa's Tomato Pies in 1912. In 1936, De Lorenzo's Tomato Pies was opened. While Joe's Tomato Pies has closed, both Papa's and Delorenzo's have been run by the same families since their openings and remain among the most popular pizzas in the area. Frank Pepe Pizzeria Napoletana in New Haven, Connecticut, was another early pizzeria which opened in 1925 (after the owner served pies from local carts and bakeries for 20ÿ25 years) and is famous for its New Havenÿstyle Clam Pie. Frank Pepe's nephew Sal Consiglio opened a competing store, Sally's Apizza, on the other end of the block, in 1938. Both establishments are still run by descendants of the original family. When Sal died, over 2,000 people attended his wake, and The New York Times ran a half-page memoriam. The D'Amore family introduced pizza to Los Angeles in 1939.\\r\\n\\r\\nBefore the 1940s, pizza consumption was limited mostly to Italian immigrants and their descendants. The international breakthrough came after World War II. Allied troops occupying Italy, weary of their rations, were constantly on the lookout for good food. They discovered the pizzeria and local bakers were hard-pressed to satisfy the demand from the soldiers. The American troops involved in the Italian campaign took their appreciation for the dish back home, touted by \\"veterans ranging from the lowliest private to Dwight D. Eisenhower\\".[This quote needs a citation] By the 1960s, it was popular enough to be featured in an episode of Popeye the Sailor.[42]\\r\\n\\r\\nTwo entrepreneurs, Ike Sewell and Ric Riccardo, invented Chicago-style deep-dish pizza, in 1943. They opened their own restaurant on the corner of Wabash and Ohio, Pizzeria Uno.\\r\\n\\r\\nChain restaurants sprang up with pizza's popularity rising. Leading early pizza chains were Shakey's Pizza, founded in 1954 in Sacramento, California; Pizza Hut, founded in 1958 in Wichita, Kansas; and Josey's Pizza founded in Newnan, Georgia, in 1943. Later entrant restaurant chains to the dine-in pizza market were Bertucci's, Happy Joe's, Monical's Pizza, California Pizza Kitchen, Godfather's Pizza, and Round Table Pizza.[43]","input":"Where was pizza invented new york or italy?"},{"output":"Indonesia","context":"Association football is the most popular sport in nearly every Asian country, and 12 members of the Asian Football Confederation (AFC) have competed at the sport's biggest event, the men's FIFA World Cup.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe team ranking in each tournament is according to FIFA.[4] The rankings, apart from the top four positions (top two in 1930), are not a result of direct competition between the teams; instead, teams eliminated in the same round are ranked by their full results in the tournament. In recent tournaments, FIFA has used the rankings for seedings for the final tournament draw.[5]\\r\\nFor each tournament, the number of teams in each finals tournament (in brackets) are shown.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs per statistical convention in football, matches decided in extra time are counted as wins and losses, while matches decided by penalty shoot-outs are counted as draws. 3 points per win, 1 point per draw and 0 points per loss.\\r\\nAfter 19 June 2018\\r\\nEach successive World Cup has had at least one team appearing for the first time. This table shows the national associations in alphabetical order per year.\\r\\nThis table shows the number of countries represented at the World Cup, the number of entries (#E) from around the world including any rejections and withdrawals, the number of Asian entries (#A), how many of those Asian entries withdrawn (#A-) before/during qualification or were rejected by FIFA, the Asian representatives at the World Cup finals, the number of World Cup Qualifiers each Asian representative had to play to get to the World Cup (#WCQ), the furthest stage reached, results, and coaches.\\r\\nThe Indonesian team, prior to independence in 1945. Indonesia was the first Asian team to participate in the FIFA World Cup when the team qualified for the 1938 tournament after its opponent, Japan, withdrew from the qualification heats. The 6ÿ0 loss to eventual finalists Hungary in the first round of the tournament in Reims, France, remains the nation's only appearance in the World Cup. The straight knock-out format used at the time made it the only game ever played by the Indonesians. Thus, Indonesia holds the World Cup record as the team with the fewest matches played (1) and one of the teams with the fewest goals scored (0). They were 15th place in the rankings.\\r\\nBurma, Philippines and Indonesia withdrew before the draw, so India qualified automatically. India later also withdrew because of the expense of travelling (or, according to some reports, after a FIFA ruling that players were not allowed to play barefoot). Other teams economised by sailing, rather than flying, to the tournament. FIFA decided not to invite another team, leaving the World Cup three teams short.\\r\\nIn the 1954 FIFA World Cup qualification, the Asian zone was allocated one place (out of 16) in the final tournament. In the 1954 World Cup qualification, three countries from the AFC participated. China PR withdrew, South Korea won against Japan and for the first time qualified for the World Cup. South Korea lost twice 0ÿ9 to Hungary and 0ÿ7 to Turkey. They were 16th place in the rankings.\\r\\nAt the 1958 World Cup qualification, FIFA rejected South Korea's entry. Qualifications were held with Africa, Turkey, Cyprus and China PR withdrew in the first qualification round, Indonesia and Egypt in second. Sudan withdrew in the final qualification round as they refused to play against Israel for political reasons. Israel technically would have qualified automatically, but before the qualification rounds began, FIFA ruled that no team would qualify without playing at least one match (except for the defending champions and the hosts), and Israel had yet to play any. A special play-off was created between Israel and the runner-up of one of the UEFA Groups, where the teams played against each other on a home-and-away basis, with the winner qualifying. After Belgium refused, Wales, the runner-up of UEFA Group 4, was the team drawn from the UEFA group runners-up. Israel lost both times 0ÿ2 and did not reach the World Cup.\\r\\nThere was only one round of play at the 1962 FIFA World Cup qualification. The three teams played against each other on a home-and-away basis. The group winner would advance to the UEFA/AFC Intercontinental play-off. Indonesia withdrew. South Korea won twice against Japan and advanced to the UEFA/AFC Intercontinental play-off. South Korea lost both times against Yugoslavia and did not reach the World Cup.\\r\\nAFC, CAF, OFC confederations competed together in the qualification rounds. After having no teams from Africa or Asia qualifying for the previous two World Cups, FIFA decided to allocate a single spot to the winner of a four-way play-off between the winners of three African groups and the winner of the Asian zone. South Africa was suspended by FIFA due to apartheid. All 15 remaining African teams withdrew in protest against there being no automatic qualification for an African team, leaving the AFCÿOFC winner to qualify by default. Japan then withdrew because the three-team tournament was moved from Japan to Cambodia, leaving only Australia and North Korea to contest the final place. Because North Korea lacked diplomatic relations with most countries, finding a suitable venue for the match proved difficult, until Head of State Norodom Sihanouk, an ally of Kim Il-sung, agreed to hosting the matches in Phnom Penh. North Korea easily won both legs to qualify. North Korea qualified for the eighth FIFA World Cup held in England.\\r\\nNorth Korea got to Group 4. North Korea lost the first game against the USSR by 0ÿ3, the second was 1ÿ1 against Chile. However, in an upset North Korea beat Italy 1-0 at Ayresome Park, Middlesbrough, and finished above them, thus earning qualification to the next round along with the USSR. This was the first time that a nation from outside Europe or the Americas had progressed from the first stage of a World Cup. In their match against Portugal, they lead 3ÿ0 after only 22 minutes. Portugal's Eusbio changed the pace, scoring four goals in the game and Jos Augusto added a fifth in the 78th minute to earn Portugal a 5ÿ3 win. In a 1999 documentary featuring interviews with surviving members of the team, they describe themselves as having been welcomed home as national heroes.\\r\\nThe 1970 AFC and OFC FIFA World Cup qualification were held together. Israel, New Zealand and Rhodesia received byes and advanced to the second round directly. The remaining three teams, Australia, Japan and South Korea, played against each other twice in South Korea. Australia advanced to the second round Group 1 and won over Rhodesia and advanced to the final round. In Group 2, Israel advanced to the final round when they defeated New Zealand twice. North Korea, despite their good performance in the previous tournament staged in England in 1966, refused to play in Israel and withdrew. In the final round, Israel defeated Australia 2ÿ1 on aggregate and reached the World Cup. Israel qualified for their only World Cup to date as an Asian team. Soon after this, however, they left the Asian Football Confederation, and now compete in the European zone as they are now a member of UEFA. As of 2018, this is Israel's only World Cup finals appearance.\\r\\nIsrael lost their first game 0ÿ2 against Uruguay, the other ended in a 1ÿ1 draw against Sweden and 0ÿ0 with Italy. Israel ranked last in the group and did not advance in the tournament. The team finished 13th out of 16 teams.\\r\\nThe Asian and Oceania zone competed for one place in the World Cup. India, Sri Lanka and the Philippines withdrew before the matches were played. The remaining 15 teams were divided into two zones, based on geographical and political considerations. Zone A had 7 teams (teams from East Asia, plus Israel). All matches were played in the Republic of Korea. Zone B had 8 teams (teams from West Asia and Oceania, plus Indonesia and North Korea). South Korea won Zone A and Australia Zone B. In the final round, South Korea and Australia were tied 2ÿ2 on aggregate, and a play-off on neutral ground in Hong Kong was played to decide the qualifier. Australia won this match through a Jimmy Mackay goal, scored off a free kick.\\r\\nA total of 21 AFC and OFC teams and Israel entered the competition. However, South Vietnam could not compete after being annexed by Vietnam. The Asian zone was allocated one place (out of 16) in the final tournament. The 21 teams would be divided into 5 groups. Sri Lanka, North Korea, Iraq and the United Arab Emirates withdrew. Hong Kong, South Korea, Iran, Kuwait and Australia won in their group. Iran won the final group and qualified for the FIFA World Cup for the first time.\\r\\nThe group consisted of Iran, Netherlands, Peru and Scotland. Iran, the reigning Asian champion, went out of the tournament winless. Iran lost two of their three group stage games: 0ÿ3 against the Netherlands and 1ÿ4 against Peru. However, they managed to draw 1ÿ1 against Scotland with a late Iraj Danaeifard goal. The team finished 14th out of the 16 teams.\\r\\nA total of 21 AFC and OFC teams entered the qualification. Iran withdrew before the draw was made. The Asian and Oceania zone was allocated two places (out of 24) in the final tournament. The remaining 20 teams would be divided into four groups. New Zealand, Saudi Arabia, Kuwait and China PR advanced to the Final Round. In the Final Round, Kuwait ranked first place and immediately qualified to the World Cup. China PR and New Zealand finished level on points and goal difference, and a play-off on neutral ground (Singapore) was played to decide the qualifier. Kuwait won 2ÿ1 and qualified to the World Cup for the first time.\\r\\nKuwait's group consisted of Czechoslovakia, England and France. In the opening match, Kuwait held Czechoslovakia to a 1ÿ1 draw. In the game between Kuwait and France, with France leading 3ÿ1, France midfielder Alain Giresse scored a goal vehemently contested by the Kuwait team, who had stopped play after hearing a piercing whistle from the stands, which they thought had come from Soviet referee Miroslav Stupar. Play had not yet resumed when Sheikh Fahid Al-Ahmad Al-Sabah, brother of the Kuwaiti Emir and president of the Kuwaiti Football Association, rushed onto the pitch to remonstrate with the referee. Stupar countermanded his initial decision and disallowed the goal to the fury of the French. Maxime Bossis scored another valid goal a few minutes later and France won 4ÿ1. Kuwait lost the third game 0ÿ1 against England. Kuwait finished fourth in their group and 21st out of the 24 teams.\\r\\nA total of 27 AFC teams entered the competition. The Asian zone was allocated two places (out of 24) in the final tournament. Teams were divided into two zones, based on geographical considerations. Zone A had 13 teams (teams from West Asia) and Zone B had 14 teams (teams from East Asia). Lebanon, Oman withdrew. Iran were disqualified. Iraq won Zone A Final Round, South Korea won Zone B. Iraq and South Korea qualified for the 1986 World Cup.\\r\\nAs of 2018, this was the last time Iraq qualified for the finals. Iraq lost all three games: 0ÿ1 against Paraguay, 1ÿ2 against Belgium and 0ÿ1 against Mexico, and finished 23 out of the 24 teams. However the defeat to Paraguay was controversial, as Iraq's Ahmed Radhi had scored a header from a corner right at the end of the first half which the referee disallowed as he incorrectly blew the whistle for half-time just before the header went into the back of the net.[28] The defeat to Belgium was also controversial as the referee gave a yellow card to Iraq's Basil Gorgis in a case of mistaken identity (the yellow was supposed to be given to Ghanim Oraibi) while the score was 0ÿ2. Gorgis sarcastically applauded the referee's incorrect decision which led to him getting sent off and Iraq lost 1ÿ2.[29] South Korea qualified for the first time since 1954. In its first game, South Korea lost 1ÿ3 against Argentina, in the second game drew Bulgaria 1ÿ1 in a downpour and in the third lost 2ÿ3 against Italy. South Korea finished 20 out of the 24 teams.\\r\\nTwenty-six teams were in the running for these spots; Bahrain, India, Maldives and South Yemen withdrew without playing a qualifying match. The Maldives withdrew before the final draw, leaving 25 teams to be divided into six groups of four or five teams each. South Korea, United Arab Emirates, Qatar, China PR, Saudi Arabia and North Korea advanced to the Final Round. South Korea and the United Arab Emirates qualified for the 1990 World Cup, taking the first two places.\\r\\nThe United Arab Emirates qualified for the FIFA World Cup for the first time, its only appearance to date, but lost all three of its games: 2ÿ0 to Colombia, 5ÿ1 to West Germany and 4ÿ1 to Yugoslavia. All three of the UAE's first round opponents reached the last 16. They were 24th (and last) place in the rankings. South Korea also lost all its three games: 0ÿ2 to Belgium, 1ÿ3 to Spain and 0ÿ1 to Uruguay, and finished 22 out of 24 teams.\\r\\nA total of 30 teams entered the qualification. The Asian zone was allocated two places (out of 24) in the final tournament. The 30 teams were divided into six groups of five teams each, although Myanmar and Nepal withdrew after playing no match. The teams would play against each other twice. The group winners would advance to the Final Round. Iraq, Iran, North Korea, South Korea, Saudi Arabia and Japan advanced to the Final Round, with Saudi Arabia and South Korea taking the first two places in the World Cup.\\r\\nSaudi Arabia qualified for the World Cup finals for the first time. Their group consisted of Belgium, Netherlands, Saudi Arabia and Morocco. Saudi Arabia lost its first game 1ÿ2 against Netherlands, although they scored the first goal. Later, they beat Morocco 2ÿ1. Against Belgium, Saudi player Saaed Al-Owairian ran from his own half through a maze of Belgian players to score the game's only goal. Both teams went through. For the much-fancied Dutch, however, progression to the second round was a somewhat nervier experience. Netherlands won the group, Saudi Arabia finished second and Belgium qualified as one of the best third-placed teams. In the first knockout stage match, Saudi Arabia faced Sweden and lost 1ÿ3 after two goals from Kennet Andersson and one from Martin Dahlin. They were 12th place in the rankings.\\r\\nSouth Korea's World Cup began with two draws against Spain (2ÿ2) and Bolivia (0ÿ0). However they lost the decisive match 2ÿ3 against title holders Germany. They were 20th place in the rankings.\\r\\nA total of 36 teams entered the competition. The Asian zone was allocated 3.5 places (out of 32) in the final tournament. Iran, Japan, Saudi Arabia and South Korea qualified for the 1998 World Cup. Japan qualified for the first time.\\r\\nSaudi Arabia were placed in Group C alongside South Africa, Denmark and hosts France. Saudi Arabia started with a 1ÿ0 defeat by Denmark. Next, France scored four to eliminate Saudi Arabia. Saudi Arabia (0ÿ2ÿ0), which again failed to show any resemblance to the 1994 team that reached the second round, played most of the game with ten men after defender Mohammed Al-Khilaiwi was given a direct red card in the 19th minute for a poor tackle on Bixente Lizarazu. Forward Thierry Henry scored two goals, while David Trezeguet and Lizarazu scored one each for France. With two goals against Saudi Arabia, South Africa led but watched in horror as the Saudis scored on two penalty kicks to gain a 2ÿ2 draw. The Saudis entered the match under new coach Mohammed al-Kharashi, a longtime assistant, after Brazilian Carlos Alberto Parreira was fired following the 4ÿ0 loss to France.\\r\\nJapan lost all three of its matches in its debut. In the first, it fell 1ÿ0 to Argentina, with Gabriel Batistuta scoring for the opponents, knocking the ball over the Japanese goalkeeper on the edge of the penalty area. In the second match, against Croatia, a late Davor ?uker goal ensured a 1ÿ0 Croatia victory and his nation's progression to the next round, simultaneously eliminating Japan from the tournament. Japan's World Cup campaign officially ended with an unexpected 2ÿ1 defeat to rank outsiders Jamaica. Two goals from Theodore Whitmore gave Jamaica their first ever win in the World Cup finals, although Masashi Nakayama had the honour of scoring Japan's first-ever goal at the World Cup finals, which came in the 74th minute.\\r\\nIran's first game of Group F was played against Yugoslavia, a 1ÿ0 loss instigated by a Sini?a Mihajlovi? free-kick. Iran recorded their first World Cup victory in the second game, beating the United States 2ÿ1, with Hamid Estili and Mehdi Mahdavikia scoring goals for Iran. The IranÿU.S. World Cup match was preheated with much excitement owing to each country's political stance after the Iranian Revolution. In an act of defiance against all forms of hatred or politics in sports, however, both sides presented one another with gifts and flowers and took ceremonial pictures before the match kickoff. Following the defeat by Iran, the U.S. were eliminated from the World Cup. Iran played Germany in the third game, where they lost 2ÿ0. German goals were scored from Oliver Bierhoff and Jrgen Klinsmann. The one win and two defeats left Iran third in the final group standings, not enough for progression to the next round.\\r\\nSouth Korea entered the 1998 World Cup without a single win to their name despite 14 World Cup games' experience. South Korea played Mexico, the Netherlands and Belgium. In the first game, South Korea lead in the 27th minute thanks to a Ha Seok-ju free-kick that was deflected into the Mexican goal. A couple of minutes after the goal was scored, however, Ha Seok-ju was sent off for a bad challenge from behind, and Mexico leveled the score through half-time substitute Ricardo Pelez. With approximately 15 minutes remaining, Luis Hernndez put Mexico in the lead with a simple tap-in. Hernndez then went on to complete the victory after scoring Mexico's third goal. South Korea had to wait four more years to record their first ever victory in a World Cup: its next game against the Netherlands was a heavy 0ÿ5 defeat, the third-worst loss in the nation's World Cup history. Its third game was against Belgium. A big win would have given Belgium a chance of progressing and an early goal by Luc Nilis might have set them on the way. The Koreans, however, mounted stiff resistance and in the second half, and Yoo Sang-chul scored the equaliser in an eventual 1ÿ1 draw.\\r\\nSouth Korea and Japan were selected as hosts by FIFA on 31 May 1996. Initially, South Korea, Japan and Mexico presented three rival bids. However, the two Asian countries agreed to unite their bids shortly before the decision was made, and they were chosen unanimously in preference to Mexico. This was the first (and so far the only) World Cup to be hosted by two countries. The 2002 World Cup was the tournament's 17th staging. It was also the first World Cup held in Asia, and the last in which the golden goal rule was utilized. South Korea and Japan, the co-hosts, qualified automatically, leaving 2.5 spots open for competition between 40 teams. Myanmar withdrew from the tournament after being placed in Group 2 but before any matches had been played, therefore reducing the group to three teams. Afghanistan, Bhutan, North Korea and Timor-Leste did not participate in the qualification process. Asia's two remaining automatic qualifying berths were taken by Saudi Arabia and China PR. Iran failed to become a third Asian representative in the World Cup after losing their AFC/UEFA playoff against the Republic of Ireland.\\r\\nChina PR qualified for the finals for the first time. Coached by Bora Milutinovi? (the fifth national team he coached in five consecutive World Cups), the nation failed to earn a point or even score a goal. As football is widely followed in China, national team success is considered to be a source of national pride. Around 300 million people tuned into broadcasts of China's 2002 World Cup matches, with a staggering 170 million new television sets being bought by citizens in order to watch their nation's first World Cup appearance. Its first game was against Costa Rica. Costa Rica dealt China PR a harsh blow by taking the lead against the run of play on 61 minutes. R܇nald G܇mez's slick backheel played Paulo Wanchope in, and Wu Chengying's challenge only popped the ball up for G܇mez to fire in a left-foot shot. China PR had no time to gather their thoughts before they were 2ÿ0 down. China's PR best moment of the first-half came on 39 minutes when they broke quickly after fending off a Costa Rica free-kick. Its second game against Brazil was a 0ÿ4 defeat. China PR looked lively and appeared to be enjoying themselves, even when they overhit the ball, but China PR could not do anything about Roberto Carlos's left-footed free-kick goal in the 15th minute. Ronaldo then scored two and Ronaldinho one to effectively end the match. China PR searched for their first goal of the tournament in their third match, against Turkey. After just ten minutes, however, they were already down 0ÿ2. Just before the half-hour mark, China PR almost scored their first goal of the tournament when Yang Chen hit the post. Hasan ?a? again set up Turkey with a cross to the far post, this time for mit Davala to score off the post. China PR failed to score a goal and was eliminated from the tournament.\\r\\nSouth Korea beat Poland 2ÿ0 after Hwang Sun-hong and Yoo Sang-chul scored. The first real chance for the home side came in the 20th minute, when Yoo Sang-chul shot across the face of an outstretched Jerzy Dudek. South Korea started to apply more pressure and took the lead in the 25th minute: Lee Eul-yong played the ball into Hwang Sun-hong, who hit the ball first-time into the net. In the 53rd minute, South Korea scored their second goal: Yoo Sang-chul ran towards Tomasz Wa?doch and Rados?aw Ka?u?ny, then confidently shot between them and past goalkeeper Dudek. Even the President of Korea waved his hat at the goal, which secured South Korea's first-ever win at the World Cup finals. In its second match, against the United States, the game's first real scoring chance fell to the U.S.' Clint Mathis, who scored with a left-footed drive from the middle of the penalty area. Later on, in the 78th minute, an Ahn Jung-hwan glancing header completely stunned American goalkeeper Brad Friedel, who seemed rooted to the spot as the ball sailed into the net. South Korea missed the chance to take all three points right at the end when Choi Yong-soo stabbed another shot over the bar, with only Friedel to beat. South Korea played its third match against Portugal, needing a win to be guaranteed a place in the second round, though earning one point would suffice (for the U.S. as well, however).\\r\\nThe South Koreans tore apart a Portuguese side who had Jo?o Pinto and Beto sent off. In the 70th minute, Park Ji-sung smashed in a brilliant goal for Korea to secure a 1ÿ0 victory and Korea's progression to the next round. Here, South Korea beat Italy 2ÿ1 in sudden-death extra time. In the 18th minute, Christian Vieri headed Italy into the lead from a Francesco Totti corner. Ahn Jung-hwan had the best chance for Korea in the 36th minute when he shot over the bar from close range. Two minutes from time, the stadium erupted as Italy defender Christian Panucci failed to clear the ball, with Seol Ki-hyun pouncing on his mistake. Totti received his second yellow card for diving in the penalty area. Ten-men Italy finally fell to a 117th-minute, golden goal header scored by Ahn Jung-hwan, who at the time was ironically playing for Italian club Perugia.\\r\\nIn the quarter-finals, Spain were unable to win a second consecutive penalty shootout, losing to South Korea after having two goals controversially disallowed in normal time, with South Korea becoming the first (and, as of 2014, the only) team from outside Europe and the Americas to reach the last four of a World Cup. Four minutes after the restart, a Spanish goal was disallowed, while a second Spanish goal was disallowed after the linesman judged that the ball had gone out of play before Fernando Morientes headed the ball into the net. In the 100th minute, Morientes turned on a long throw-in and crashed his shot against the left post. Korea won 5ÿ3 on penalties and became the first ever Asian nation to reach the semi-finals of the World Cup, where they would face Germany.\\r\\nThe match started slowly: South Korea kept possession well and Germany appeared content to keep the volume of the crowd down, with both sides entering half-time level at 0ÿ0. In the 75th minute, however, Michael Ballack ran on to Oliver Neuville's low cross; his shot was blocked by goalkeeper Lee Woon-jae, but Ballack followed up to convert the rebound and secure Germany's place in the final with a 1ÿ0 victory. With the semi-final defeat, Korea contested the third-place match in Daegu against the other defeated semi-finalist, Turkey. Turkey, however, won third place after an entertaining 3ÿ2 victory in a match that included the fastest ever World Cup goal, scored by Parma striker Hakan ?kr after just 11 seconds. Lee Eul-yong replied in the ninth minute with a curling free-kick into the top right-hand corner, but shortly after, ?lhan Mans?z put Turkey back in front in the 13th minute after splitting the South Korean defence by playing a swift one-two with ?kr. Song Chong-gug then managed to stun Turkey goalkeeper R?t Re?ber when his long-range shot deflected off of Cha Du-ri's bottom, in injury time, for a last consolation goal that ended the game on a slight high note for the home fans.\\r\\nSaudi Arabia were eliminated as the worst team in tournament, after three defeats and no goals scored, including an 0ÿ8 loss to Germany, 0ÿ1 to Cameroon and 0ÿ3 to the Republic of Ireland.\\r\\nHosts Japan topped their group with two wins and one draw. In the first match, they drew 2ÿ2 with Belgium. Marc Wilmots broke the deadlock with a beautiful overhead kick in the 57th minute. Two minutes later, Japan's Takayuki Suzuki, in the penalty area, got a foot on to Shinji Ono's pass from the half-way line. In the 67th minute, Arsenal's Junichi Inamoto ran through three defenders to give Japan a 2ÿ1 lead. Five minutes later, the stadium was momentarily silenced when Peter Van Der Heyden, beating the offside trap on the edge of the area, neatly lobbed Japan goalkeeper Seigo Narazaki as he came off his line. Japan advanced to the second round with a 1ÿ0 win over Russia and a 2ÿ0 victory against Tunisia. Japan register their first ever World Cup finals victory. However, they subsequently exited the tournament during the Round of 16 after a 1ÿ0 defeat to Turkey. mit Davala headed Turkey into the lead from an Ergn Penbe's corner in the 12th minute. An Alessandro Santos free-kick crashed against the woodwork later on to give the Japanese some hope for the second-half. Japan made a couple of substitutions at half-time as they looked for fresh initiative. Hidetoshi Nakata deflected shot almost troubled Turkish goalkeeper R?t Re?ber. Japan continued to look for the equaliser, with Akinori Nishizawa's header on target and Tomokazu Myojin shooting just narrowly wide. With ten minutes left in the game, Nishizawa's shot flew over the bar and with it Japan's hopes of a place in the quarter-finals.\\r\\nForty-four Asian teams are affiliated with FIFA, but Cambodia, Philippines, Bhutan and Brunei decided not to take part, while Myanmar was banned from the competition, so a total of 39 teams took part to compete for 4.5 places in the World Cup. Saudi Arabia, South Korea, Japan and Iran qualified for the 2006 World Cup finals.\\r\\nIran started their campaign with high expectations from fans and media. Their first match was against Mexico in Group D. The game was level 1ÿ1 at the half-time, but Iran lost at the end because of a defensive mistake, and the match finished 3ÿ1, with goals scored by Omar Bravo and Zinha for Mexico and Yahya Golmohammadi for Iran. Iran then played Portugal in the second game, losing 2ÿ0; goals were scored by Deco and Cristiano Ronaldo, the latter from a penalty. The two losses meant Iran was eliminated from the competition even before contesting their third and final game against Angola. Iran drew 1ÿ1, with Sohrab Bakhtiarizadeh scoring the Iran goal.\\r\\nJapan also failed to advance to the Round of 16 after finishing the group without a win, losing to Australia 1ÿ3 in the first match. In the 26th minute, Shunsuke Nakamura scored the first goal, only for Australia to respond with three late goals in the 84th, 89th and 92nd minutes. In game two, Japan drew with Croatia 0ÿ0. After defeats in the opening game, both Japan and Croatia seemed reluctant to take any early risks and for 20 minutes, little appeared to transpire. In the 21st minute, however, Niko Kranj?ar missed penalty, while five minutes into the second-half, the ball arrived at the far post only for Atsushi Yanagisawa to horrendously miss an open goal, skewing the ball back across the goalmouth. In Japan's third match, it lost to Brazil 1ÿ4, despite scoring the game's first goal, in the 34th minute, from Keiji Tamada.\\r\\nSouth Korea won its first match 2ÿ1, against Togo; goals were scored by Lee Chun-soo and Ahn Jung-hwan. The victory marked Korea's their first World Cup finals win outside of home soil. In the second game, a 1ÿ1 draw with France, Thierry Henry scored in the ninth minute, but Park Ji-sung leveled the score in 80th minute. Before the last match, against Switzerland, Korea had a strong chance to reach the round of 16. Switzerland scored first from a Philippe Senderos headed a goal off a Hakan Yakin free-kick in the 23rd minute. France went ahead against Togo in the 55th minute, which would mean that if Switzerland were to win, South Korea would be eliminated. Switzerland's star striker, Alexander Frei, doubled Switzerland's lead with 13 minutes to play while France won their match, resulting in South Korea's elimination from the competition.\\r\\nSaudi Arabia drew the first match 2ÿ2 with Tunisia; Saudi Arabia had the lead as late as the 93rd minute, but Radhi Jaidi leveled the score. The Saudis' next game was against Ukraine, a 0ÿ4 defeat. Saudi Arabia knew before kick-off that they had to score at least four goals to stand a chance of qualifying, but survival was clearly priority number one as they allowed Spain, who had changed their entire first 11, to feel their way into the match. Juanito scored at the 39th minute and buried their chances of progression beyond the group stage.\\r\\nForty-three teams competed for spots at the 2010 World Cup; Laos, Brunei and the Philippines did not enter qualification. This was the first time Timor-Leste competed in World Cup qualification and the first time Australia attempted to qualify as a member of the AFC, having moved from the Oceania Football Confederation at the start of 2006. Asia's four automatic qualifying berths were taken by Australia, Japan]], North Korea and South Korea.\\r\\nNorth Korea qualified for the first time since 1966; they were drawn into Group G, and played their first match against five-time winners Brazil on 15 June. Brazil won 2ÿ1 in a game where North Korea were well organised defensively and showed resilience, frustrating the Brazilians. Despite their best efforts, however, they were nevertheless outmatched and eventually broken down. Maicon's relief was visible after his goal to finally put Brazil ahead. Their next game was against Portugal on 21 June, where they suffered a heavy 0ÿ7 defeat. Despite starting well (much like against the Brazilians), with a defensive, well organised approach, once Portugal scored the first, the North Korean defense unfolded and the following six goals were scored with relative ease. In North Korea's last match, against the Ivory Coast on 25 June, the team fell 3ÿ0. After losing all three matches in the group stages, North Korea were eliminated, finishing last in Group G.\\r\\nSouth Korea were drawn into Group B alongside Argentina, Nigeria and Greece. South Korea registered the first win at the 2010 World Cup with a 2ÿ0 victory over Greece, with goals scored by Lee Jung-soo and captain Park Ji-sung. In the second match, South Korea fell to Argentina 1ÿ4, with striker Gonzalo Higuan scoring a hat-trick and Park Chu-young scoring an own goal for the Argentines; Lee Chung-yong scored Korea's consolation goal. South Korea coach Huh Jung-moo, who played against Argentina's Diego Maradona at the 1986 World Cup, saw his team struggle to live with Argentina's quick tempo and the quality of their pass-and-move football. The decisive match was with Nigeria, which ended 2ÿ2 and with subsequent triumph for South Korea, because paired with Argentina's defeat of Greece, the draw sealed their first-ever progression beyond the group stage on foreign soil.\\r\\nAs Group B runners-up, South Korea faced Uruguay in the last 16. The South Koreans were effervescent in their attacking third but shaky in their defence, which was exposed as early as the eighth minute: Diego Forln was fed on the left and played a low ball across the six-yard area, which was misjudged by goalkeeper Jung Sung-ryong and his statuesque defence but not by Luis Surez at the far post, who calmly slotted in for his second goal of the competition. In the 68th minute, the South Koreans' luck change when, off of a free-kick, Bolton's Lee Chung-yong pounced on Mauricio Victorino's attempted headed clearance to score a nod-in from eight yards out; it was the first goal Uruguay had conceded in the tournament. With ten minutes remaining, Surez lurked on the fringes of the 18-yard area as a corner was swung in from the right. He cut in from the left before curling in a well-struck shot that left goalkeeper Jung Sung-ryong rooted as the ball clipped the post on its way in. The South Koreans pressed and should have taken the game into extra-time, but substitute Lee Dong-gook's weak shot squirmed under the shirt of Fernando Muslera before it was comfortably cleared.\\r\\nAustralia were drawn into Group D, which also featured three-time world champion Germany, Ghana and Serbia. On 14 June, Australia faced Germany in Durban; Pim Verbeek surprisingly chose to play without a recognised striker. Australia were comprehensively defeated 4ÿ0, and Verbeek was heavily criticised for his tactics,[30] with chief SBS Football Analyst Craig Foster calling for his immediate sacking.[31]\\r\\nAustralia's second group match, against Ghana, resulted in a 1ÿ1 draw. Australia shot its only goal early in the first half by Brett Holman after Ghana's goalkeeper Richard Kingson fumbled the ball following a Mark Bresciano free-kick. Shortly after, a goal-bound strike from Ghana's Jonathan Mensah was blocked on the goal line by Harry Kewell's upper arm, resulting in a penalty kick and a straight red card for Kewell. Ghanaian striker Asamoah Gyan scored the equalizing goal. Despite the man advantage, however, Ghana were mostly limited to long-range shots on Australia's goal, and some desperate defending from Australia saw the game finish a draw.\\r\\nIn their final group match, against Serbia, Tim Cahill was back from suspension and scored via a header in the second half to give Australia a 1ÿ0 lead. Only four minutes later, Brett Holman doubled the scoreline with an impressive long-range effort. Late in the second half, Serbia managed to score a late goal through Marko Panteli? after Australian goalkeeper Mark Schwarzer fumbled the ball, with the game ultimately ending at 2ÿ1. Germany had defeated Ghana 1ÿ0, which meant that both Australia and Ghana finished on four points. Ghana, however, progressed to the knockout stage due to their superior goal difference. Verbeek completed his term as Australian coach at the end of the 2010 World Cup.\\r\\nJapan hung on to win their first-ever World Cup match on foreign soil, defeating Cameroon 1ÿ0. The game's only goal came in the 39th minute when Keisuke Honda controlled a cross at the far post and stabbed the ball past goalkeeper Souleymanou Hamidou. In the second game, Japan lost 0ÿ1 to the Netherlands. Wesley Sneijder's powerful 52nd-minute winner from just outside the box settled a fascinating Group E contest between two contrasting sides who opened up in the second half and were creating good chances right up to the final whistle. Loitering just outside the penalty area, Sneijder lashed a powerful right-foot shot towards goal that goalkeeper Eiji Kawashima could only deflect into the net despite being well-placed to make the save. Japan had the best chance to level the score one minute from time, but unmarked substitute Shinji Okazaki fired over the net from ten yards out.\\r\\nJapan's third, decisive match was against Denmark. Midfielder Keisuke Honda opened the scoreline, bending a 30-yard free-kick past Danish goalkeeper Thomas S?rensen in the 17th minute. Just 13 minutes later, teammate Yasuhito End fired past S?rensen's outstretched hand to make it 2ÿ0 for Japan. Takeshi Okada's side had to survive a late scare as Jon Dahl Tomasson tapped in a rebound after goalkeeper Kawashima saved the Dane's penalty kick. However, subtite Shinji Okazaki's 88th-minute strike clinched second place in the group for Japan with a 3ÿ1 victory.\\r\\nJapan faced Paraguay in the last 16. The match was decided by a penalty shootout after the score was locked at 0ÿ0 for 120 minutes. Paraguay won the shootout and progressed to its first ever World Cup quarter-final. The match was a generally unexciting affair, as Japan adopted a defensive posture while Paraguay itself maintained a solid defence. The first-half produced the occasional chance on goal, with Lucas Barrios having a shot saved shortly before a long-distance shot from Daisuke Matsui hit the crossbar of Paraguay's goal. The second half was similar, with both sides producing occasional chances to score rather than periods of outright dominance. The result of the deadlock was extra time, which continued goalless. A penalty shootout ensued, during which Yuichi Komano missed a spot kick for Japan. Paraguay scored all five of its penalties, clinching the win and subsequent progression to the quarter-finals.\\r\\nThe 2014 FIFA World Cup, held in Brazil, marked the first time since 1990 where no Asian team managed to win a game, and where the AFC was the only FIFA confederation without both wins and teams represented in the knockout stages.[32][33] Three of Asia's four qualifiers in 2010Australia, Japan and South Koreaqualified for the 2014 tournament. Iran, meanwhile, qualified for the first time since 2006.\\r\\nAustralia was eliminated early despite good performances against Chile and the Netherlands that both ended in close losses (1ÿ3 and 2ÿ3 respectively). In their third match, however, they were blown-out 3ÿ0 to defending World Cup champions Spain, who were themselves also mathematically eliminated from the tournament.\\r\\nJapan opened the scoring in its first match against the Ivory Coast, but lost the lead en route to an eventual 1ÿ2 defeat. In the following games, the Japanese failed to break Greece's tight defence and finished in a goalless draw, and afterwards, despite equalizing Colombia at half-time, eventually lost 4ÿ1 to ensure an early tournament exit.\\r\\nSouth Korea opened the score against Russia after a blunder by goalkeeper Igor Akinfeev, but wound up conceding the equalizing goal shortly after. A high-scoring match with Algeria had the Koreans defeated 4ÿ2, and a 1ÿ0 loss to Belgium ended Korea's campaign.\\r\\nAfter an opening 0ÿ0 draw with Nigeria, the Iranian defense held Argentina goalless for most of the match before a Lionel Messi goal in injury time. Needing to beat the already-eliminated Bosnia and Herzegovina to clinch the group's second spot in the knockout stages, Iran wound up defeated 3ÿ1.\\r\\nThe 2018 FIFA World Cup, held in Russia, marked the first time five Asian teams qualified for the FIFA World Cup.","input":"What was the first asian country to qualify for the world cup?"},{"output":"September 20","context":"","input":"When did hurricane maria path through puerto rico?"},{"output":"WrangellÿSt. Elias","context":"The United States has 59 protected areas known as national parks that are operated by the National Park Service, an agency of the Department of the Interior. National parks must be established by an act of the United States Congress. A bill creating the first national park, Yellowstone, was signed into law by President Ulysses S. Grant in 1872, followed by Mackinac National Park in 1875 (decommissioned in 1895), and then Rock Creek Park (later merged into National Capital Parks), Sequoia and Yosemite in 1890. The Organic Act of 1916 created the National Park Service \\"to conserve the scenery and the natural and historic objects and wildlife therein, and to provide for the enjoyment of the same in such manner and by such means as will leave them unimpaired for the enjoyment of future generations.\\"[1] Many current national parks had been previously protected as national monuments by the president under the Antiquities Act before being upgraded by Congress. Seven national parks (including six in Alaska) are paired with a national preserve, areas with different levels of protection that are administered together but considered separate units and whose areas are not included in the figures below.\\r\\nCriteria for the selection of national parks include natural beauty, unique geological features, unusual ecosystems, and recreational opportunities (though these criteria are not always considered together). National monuments, on the other hand, are frequently chosen for their historical or archaeological significance. Fourteen national parks are designated UNESCO World Heritage Sites (WHS),[2] while twenty one national parks are designated UNESCO Biosphere Reserves (BR).[3] Eight national parks are designated in both UNESCO programs.\\r\\nTwenty-seven states have national parks, as do the territories of American Samoa and the United States Virgin Islands. California has the most (nine), followed by Alaska (eight), Utah (five), and Colorado (four). The largest national park is WrangellÿSt. Elias in Alaska: at over 8?million acres (32,375?km2), it is larger than each of the nine smallest states. The next three largest parks are also in Alaska. The smallest park is Hot Springs, Arkansas, at less than 6?thousand acres (24?km2). The total area protected by national parks is approximately 52.2?million acres (211,000?km2), for an average of 885?thousand acres (3,580?km2) but a median of only 236?thousand acres (960?km2) at Mount Rainier, the 30th largest park.[4] The most-visited national park is Great Smoky Mountains in North Carolina and Tennessee, with over 11.3 million visitors in 2016, followed by Arizona's Grand Canyon, with nearly 6 million. In contrast, only 10,047 people visited the remote Gates of the Arctic in Alaska in the same year.[5]\\r\\nA few former national parks are no longer designated as such, or have been disbanded.

K. Rowling's Harry Potter series. His first appearance was in the first book of the series, Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone as the best friend of Harry Potter and Hermione Granger. He is a member of the Weasley family, a pure blood family, who reside in \\"The Burrow\\" outside Ottery St. Catchpole. Along with Harry and Hermione, he is a member of the Gryffindor house. Ron is present in most of the action throughout the series.\\r\\n\\r\\nAccording to Rowling, Ron was among the characters she created \\"the very first day\\".[1] Ron is inspired by Rowling's best friend Sean Harris (to whom Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets is dedicated), but she has clearly stated that she \\"never set out to describe Sean in Ron, but Ron has a Sean-ish turn of phrase.\\"[2] Like Harris is to Rowling, Ron is \\"always there\\" when Harry needs him. The character of Ron fits many of the stereotypes expected of the sidekick; he is often used as comic relief, is loyal to the hero, and lacks much of the talent Harry possesses, at least in terms of magical power; however, he proves his bravery several times, such as playing 'real wizard's chess' in the first book, and entering into the Forbidden Forest with Harry during the second book despite his arachnophobia.\\r\\n\\r\\nSome of Ron's qualities serve as foils to Harry. While Harry is an orphan with more gold than he needs, Ron comes from a loving but poor family; many of his possessions are hand-me-downs. Harry is famous but would prefer to avoid the spotlight; Ron, in comparison, is often perceived as a mere lackey and sometimes becomes jealous of the recognition Harry receives. Finally, Ron is the most mediocre of his siblings, being (as of the first book) neither an excellent Quidditch player, a noteworthy student, nor the daughter his mother always wanted. All of these factors combined cause Ron to feel insecure; Ron's inferiority complex and his need to prove himself, is the main thrust of his character arc.\\r\\n\\r\\nRowling first introduces Ron with his family in Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone. Harry is lost at King's Cross railway station and the Weasleys guide him through the barrier of Platform 9? into the wizarding world. Ron and Harry share a compartment on the Hogwarts Express, and they begin their friendship: Ron is fascinated with the famous Harry, and Harry is fascinated with the ordinary Ron. It is here that they both meet Hermione Granger as well, whom they initially dislike but who later becomes their close friend after they save each other during a dangerous encounter with a mountain troll.[PS?Ch.6] Ron and Harry share the same classes throughout the series, and generally have similar academic successes and disappointments. Ron plays a vital part in the quest to save the Philosopher's Stone. His strategy at Wizard's Chess allows Hermione and Harry to proceed safely through a dangerous life-size, animated chess game. During the game, Ron allows his piece to be sacrificed and is subsequently knocked unconscious.[PS?Ch.16] At the Leaving Feast, the last dinner of the school year, Albus Dumbledore, Hogwarts' Headmaster, awards Ron fifty House points to Gryffindor for \\"the best-played game of chess Hogwarts has seen in many years.\\" These last-minute points help support Gryffindor's win of the House Cup.[PS?Ch.17]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe second installment, Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets, takes place the year following the events of the Philosopher's Stone.\\r\\nDuring the summer, Ron attempts to write to Harry several times. He receives no reply because Dobby the house elf is stopping Harry's wizard mail. Ron becomes so concerned that he and his brothers Fred and George fly their father's enchanted Ford Anglia car to Harry's home at his aunt and uncle's house. Harry spends the next month at the Weasleys' home, The Burrow. While attempting to depart from King's Cross station, Harry and Ron find themselves unable to enter the barrier to access Platform 9?. With Harry, Ron conceives the idea of taking the flying Ford Anglia to Hogwarts. The plan is successful, but the Anglia loses power at the end of the journey and crashes into the Whomping Willow. Ron and Harry survive the impact, but Ron's wand is broken in the process, and the car drives itself off into the Forbidden Forest, a forest at the edge of the Hogwarts grounds in which student access is prohibited. Ron receives a Howler from his mother, berating him for taking the car.\\r\\n\\r\\nLater in the novel, Ron and Harry transform themselves using Polyjuice Potion to resemble Draco Malfoy's close associates Crabbe and Goyle, so that they can spy on him, and find out what he knows about the Chamber of Secrets. During the hunt to find the Heir of Slytherin, Ron is responsible for providing the first clue to the identity of Tom Marvolo Riddle, recalling that he saw the name \\"T.?M. Riddle\\" on a trophy inscribed \\"For Special Services to the School\\". Later Ron is forced to come face-to-face with his worst nightmare, spiders, in the Forbidden Forest, where the two have ventured at Hagrid's suggestion. Giant spiders nearly devour the two of them, but the Weasley Ford Anglia returns from the Forbidden Forest and rescues the pair. Ron and Harry then discover the entrance into the Chamber, and enter it in the hopes of saving Ginny Weasley, Ron's sister, who had been kidnapped and kept in the Chamber. Due to an accident with Ron's wand, the Chamber Entrance's ceiling collapses, trapping Ron on one side and Harry on the other. Harry goes on to rescue Ginny and save the day. Ron and Harry are given Special Awards for Services to the School for this, and he receives two hundred points, along with Harry for their success in the Chamber of Secrets.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban, Ron's rat, Scabbers, already seen in Philosopher's Stone, goes missing, which he blames Hermione's new cat Crookshanks, and the two have a falling-out.[PoA?Ch.11][PoA?Ch.12] They eventually make up when Hermione has a nervous breakdown brought by taking too many classes and distress at the fate of the hippogriff Buckbeak. The animal, owned by Hagrid, has been put on trial for injuring Draco and risks execution. Ron offers to help with the preparation of Buckbeak's defence, but this fails to help. Harry, Ron and Hermione go to see Hagrid on the execution day where they discover Scabbers hiding out in Hagrid's hut.[PoA?Ch.15] As they leave, Scabbers struggles free of Ron and runs away. He chases Scabbers to the Whomping Willow where he is grabbed by a large black dog and dragged into a tunnel hidden below the tree.[PoA?Ch.16][PoA?Ch.17]\\r\\n\\r\\nHarry and Hermione follow the tunnel, which leads to the Shrieking Shack. The dog is actually the animal form of Sirius Black (an Animagus), Harry's godfather and an escaped convict from the wizard prison Azkaban. The school's Defence Against the Dark Arts professor Remus Lupin arrives just after Harry and Hermione. Along with Sirius, Lupin casts a spell on Scabbers, who also turns out to be an Animagus by the name of Peter Pettigrew. Pettigrew was Sirius's, Lupin's, and Harry's father James Potter's school friend, thought to have been murdered by Sirius.[PoA?Ch.16][PoA?Ch.16] Pettigrew, who had lived as a rat ever since faking his death, denies everything, but Sirius and Lupin piece together that he has been a servant of Voldemort, and it was he who divulged the secret whereabouts of Harry's parents, leading to their murder. Initially, Ron does not believe Sirius and refuses to turn over Scabbers to him, but he is disgusted when he learns his rat's identity. Pettigrew escapes when the main characters lead him out of the Whomping Willow.[PoA?Ch.18][PoA?Ch.19][PoA?Ch.20] Ron, knocked out by a spell from Pettigrew, is taken to the hospital wing, and is forced to remain there while Harry and Hermione travel back in time to save Sirius and Buckbeak.[PoA?Ch.21] At the end of the novel, Sirius sends Ron an excitable little owl whom Ginny names Pigwidgeon, but whom Ron refers to as \\"Pig\\".[PoA?Ch.22]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire, the Weasleys invite Harry and Hermione to the Quidditch World Cup. Ron is in awe of his favourite Quidditch champion, Viktor Krum.[GoF?Ch.7][GoF?Ch.8] Ron is even more excited when Krum, still a student at the Durmstrang wizarding school, comes to Hogwarts to take part in the Triwizard Tournament, a magical wizarding tournament opposing the top three magic schools in Europe.[GoF?Ch.12] However, when Harry, underage, mysteriously becomes the fourth Tournament champion, Ron joins the dissenters who think Harry somehow cheated his way into the tournament and feels let down; according to Hermione, this stems from Ron's latent envy caused by being left out of the spotlight shared by Harry or his brothers. The rift is serious enough that the friends fail to make up for nearly a month.[GoF?Ch.17] They only reconcile shortly after Harry successfully gets by a fire-breathing dragon in the first task; Ron realises how dangerous the Tournament is and finally believes that Harry did not enter himself.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt Christmas time, as per Triwizard Tournament tradition, Hogwarts hosts a Yule Ball. Ron and Harry panic at the prospect of having to secure dates for the event, and Ron appalls Hermione with his immature approach, particularly for failing to extend her an invitation, apparently failing until the last minute to even realise she is a girl. At the last minute, Harry saves the day by getting Parvati Patil and her sister Padma to agree to come with the duo, although Padma seems less than pleased at Ron's surly attitude and shabby dress. Ron becomes overcome with jealousy when he sees Hermione with her date: his former idol Krum. When Hermione comes over to Ron and Harry for a friendly chat, Ron loses control and accuses her of \\"fraternising with the enemy\\" and giving away Harry's Triwizard secrets. At the evening's end, the two have a heated row, in which Hermione tells Ron he should have asked her before Krum, rather than simply hoping to secure her by default.[GoF?Ch.23] Ron completely fails to get the hint and remains either in denial or oblivious to the pair's increasingly obvious feelings for each other. Ron's jealousy over Krum is mirrored by Hermione's dislike of Fleur Delacour (of the Beauxbatons Academy and a Triwizard competitor), on whom Ron has an obvious crush.[GoF?Ch.22]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the Second Task of the Tournament, Ron is the person selected for Harry to rescue from the depths of the Hogwarts Lake, as he is the one whom Harry would most miss. Harry successfully saves him and Ron mocks him gently for thinking that the hostages for the task were in actual danger.[GoF?Ch.26]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix, Ron is appointed a Gryffindor prefect, much to the surprise of himself and everyone else, especially Hermione, the other new prefect.[OotP?Ch.9] His brother, Percy, now distant and disconnected from the family, sends Ron an owl congratulating him and advising him to \\"sever ties\\" with Harry and side himself instead with Professor Umbridge, the abominable new Defence Against the Dark Arts teacher at Hogwarts; the letter angers Ron.[OotP?Ch.14] Ron explicitly shows his support and loyalty for Harry when his classmates imply Harry is lying about the return of Voldemort, sometimes using his power as prefect to threaten them into silence.[OotP?Ch.15] Though they spend their usual amount of time bickering, Ron and Hermione present a united front endorsing Harry. Ron supports Hermione's suggestion of Harry teaching students practical Defence Against the Dark Arts, which Umbridge, using the Ministry of Magic to slowly take over the Dumbledore-run school, has all but banned. He co-founds the secret students' group called Dumbledore's Army.[OotP?Ch.15] He also joins the Gryffindor Quidditch team, but his nerves and confidence issues often get the better of him during practices and matches, causing the Slytherins to make up a song about how Ron will make sure Slytherin win the interhouse Quidditch Cup. However, during the last match, Ron plays better and wins the game and the Quidditch Cup for Gryffindor. At the climax of the novel, Ron battles the Death Eaters alongside Harry, Hermione, Ginny, Neville Longbottom and Luna Lovegood at the Department of Mysteries. He is injured in the fight, but makes a full recovery by the end of the novel.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince Ron, who has grown taller over the summer, attracts the attention of Lavender Brown. Harry, the new Quidditch Captain, picks Ron to continue as Keeper for the Gryffindor Quidditch team, over competing candidate Cormac McLaggen who is equally-skilled but has difficulty with teamwork and following orders.[HBP?Ch.11] Upon learning Hermione most likely had kissed Krum, Ron performs increasingly badly at Quidditch, and thrown off by jealousy of his former idol, becomes unkind to Hermione. His low self-esteem is not helped much by his younger sister Ginny who after Ron reacts badly to finding her kissing her boyfriend, throws in the fact that of those in the group, Ron is the only one who has never had his first kiss. To bolster Ron's confidence, Harry pretends to give him Felix Felicis, a potion which makes the drinker lucky; believing he has actually taken it, Ron performs admirably and Gryffindor wins the match. However, this leads to a major row between Ron and Hermione: Hermione accuses Harry of helping Ron cheat, while Ron berates Hermione for having no faith in his abilities.[HBP?Ch.14] At a post-game celebration, Ron kisses Lavender (though Ginny describes it as \\"eating her face\\"). Hermione, jealous and seeking retaliation, takes McLaggen as her date to new Potions professor Horace Slughorn's Christmas party, but he proves to be an egomaniac.[HBP?Ch.15] After Christmas, Hermione continues to ignore Ron, stopping only to give him disdainful looks and occasional snide remarks. By now, Ron is visibly discontent with his relationship with Lavender.[HBP?Ch.17]\\r\\n\\r\\nOn his birthday in March, Ron accidentally eats Amortentia-infused Chocolate Cauldrons (actually meant for Harry). After being cured by Slughorn, he then consumes poisoned mead (which Draco Malfoy actually intended for Dumbledore). Harry saves his life by forcing a bezoar, a poison antidote, into his mouth, and Ron is transferred to the hospital wing. A panic-stricken Hermione arrives, forgetting her past anger. While sitting by his bed, Hermione, Harry, Ginny and the twins hear Ron mutter Hermione's name in his delirium, although they do not hear what he is saying and ignore it. Conversely, Ron feigns sleep when Lavender visits him. Upon recovering, Ron and Hermione reconcile,[HBP?Ch.18][HBP?Ch.19][HBP?Ch.20] and a little while later, Ron and Lavender break up. Rowling in an interview said that she \\"really enjoyed writing the Ron/Lavender business, and the reason that was enjoyable was Ron up to this point has been quite immature compared to the other two, and he kind of needed to make himself worthy of Hermione....he had to grow up emotionally and now he's taken a big step up.\\"[3]\\r\\n\\r\\nInitially, Ron does not support Harry's belief that Draco Malfoy is a Death Eater, a follower of Voldemort, but is later convinced. Before leaving Hogwarts with Dumbledore to recover a Horcrux Harry arranges for Ron, Hermione, and Ginnytogether with any of Dumbledore's Army they can summonto keep a close watch on Malfoy and Snape. Harry also provides them with the remains of his vial of Felix Felicis, to aid them in the effort.[HBP?Ch.25] Despite the D.A.'s watch, Malfoy provides the Death Eaters entrance into Hogwarts, and a battle ensues. Thanks to Felix Felicis, Ron, Hermione and Ginny are unharmed by the Death Eater's hexes during the battle.[HBP?Ch.29] Snape kills Dumbledore during the battle when Malfoy proves that he is unable to.[HBP?Ch.27] During his funeral, Ron comforts a weeping Hermione. Ron and Hermione vow to help Harry find and destroy the Horcruxes and kill Voldemort, even if it means leaving Hogwarts.[HBP?Ch.30]\\r\\n\\r\\nAttention is drawn several times to Ron's deepening relationships to Harry and Hermione, with unresolved romantic tension with Hermione being one of the main subplots of the novel (and indeed, the entire series). Furthermore, Harry and Ron's friendship has strengthened to the point where Harry can tell Ron that his Quidditch performance is endangering his membership on the team without either character taking it personally.\\r\\n\\r\\nRon agrees to go with Harry and Hermione on the quest to destroy all of Voldemort's Horcruxes. Worried that the Ministry, now taken over by Voldemort, will learn he is with Harry on a quest, Ron dresses the family ghoul up in pyjamas and spreads the story he is ill with \\"spattergroit\\", a type of highly contagious magical illness. Ron disguises himself as Reginald Cattermole as the trio attempts to find the locket Horcrux in the possession of Dolores Umbridge.\\r\\n\\r\\nHarry decides he wants someone to wear the Horcrux at all times, fearing it might be lost or stolen. This has a much more profound effect on Ron than it seems to have on Hermione or Harry. Ron ends up lashing out in frustration at the lack of comforts and a concrete plan, eventually leaving his friends behind. Distressed over his absence, Harry and Hermione do not even mention his name during the time that he is gone. However, when they finally mention his name, Ron, who had immediately regretted his decision to leave but was captured by Snatchers and then could not return due to Hermione's anti-Death Eater enchantments, was led to Harry's location by unknown magic within the Deluminator he inherited from Dumbledore. Ron dramatically returns by saving Harry from drowning when Harry is attempting to recover Godric Gryffindor's sword from an icy pool. Harry, a sudden believer in the fate created by his return, immediately forgives Ron and insists it must be Ron who uses the sword to destroy Slytherin's locket. However, the portion of Voldemort's soul inside it plays on Ron's insecurities by revealing that Ron thinks he is \\"least loved by a mother who craved a daughter\\", then showing him a doppelg?nger of Harry who tells him that Harry was happier without him and a doppelg?nger of Hermione who does not return his affections and is involved instead with Harry. Ron summons his courage and overcomes the spell, destroying the locket, but is visibly shaken until Harry tells him that he regards Hermione as a sister and a friend, nothing more.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe trio are eventually captured by Snatchers, and Bellatrix Lestrange tortures Hermione with the Cruciatus Curse for information. This sends Ron into a panic, and he continually screams and fights with all his effort to save her, despite Harry's instruction that he calm down and think of a better plan. The trio and some other prisoners are rescued by Dobby, but the house-elf is killed by Bellatrix during the escape. Eventually, the trio returns to Hogwarts, hoping to find the last unknown Horcrux shown in Harry's vision. Having lost the Sword of Gryffindor to Griphook the goblin, Ron gets an idea to procure more Basilisk fangs and manages to speak enough Parseltongue to open the Chamber of Secrets, where Hermione destroys the Horcrux in Helga Hufflepuff's cup. He begins to worry about the fate of Hogwarts' elves. Upon hearing this, Hermione drops the basilisk fangs she was carrying and kisses him for the first time. He also takes part in the Battle of Hogwarts, witnessing the death of his brother Fred, and teams up with Neville to defeat Fenrir Greyback.\\r\\n\\r\\nNineteen years after Voldemort's downfall, Ron and Hermione have two children: Rose Granger-Weasley, whom they are sending off to her first year at Hogwarts, and a younger son named Hugo.[DH?Ch.37] Though the epilogue does not explicitly say Ron and Hermione are married,[DH?Ch.37] news articles and other sources treat it as a fact.[4][5][6] Ron has also passed his Muggle driving test, despite Hermione's apparent belief that he could not do so without Confunding the examiner. (Ron secretly reveals to Harry he actually did Confund the examiner.) He and Harry work for the Ministry of Magic as Aurors, and along with Hermione they have helped to revamp the Ministry; it is far different from the one that existed previously.[7] Before becoming an Auror, Ron joins George at Weasleys' Wizard Wheezes, which becomes a very lucrative business.[8]\\r\\n\\r\\nRowling introduces Ron as \\"tall, thin and gangling, with freckles, big hands and feet, and a long nose.\\"[PS?Ch.6] Ron has the trademark red hair of the Weasleys and is indeed one of Harry's tallest schoolmates, even outgrowing some of his older brothers. Rowling states in the novels that Ron has freckles, though Rupert Grint, the actor who plays Ron, has none. Rowling has also stated that Ron has blue eyes.\\r\\n\\r\\nRowling in an interview described Ron as very funny but insensitive and immature, saying \\"There's a lot of immaturity about Ron, and that's where a lot of the humor comes from.\\"[9] As his first exercise with the actors who portray the central trio, Alfonso Cuar܇n, who directed the third film in the series, Prisoner of Azkaban, assigned them to write an autobiographical essay about their character, written in the first person, spanning birth to the discovery of the magical world, and including the character's emotional experience. Of Rupert Grint's essay, Cuar܇n recalls, \\"Rupert didn't deliver the essay. When I questioned why he didn't do it, he said, 'I'm Ron; Ron wouldn't do it.' So I said, 'Okay, you do understand your character.'\\"[10] Commenting on Ron's character development in the final book, Rowling explained that \\"Ron is the most immature of the three main characters, but in part seven he grows up. He was never strong footed, people see him mostly as Harry's friend; his mother had actually wanted a girl and in the last book he finally has to acknowledge his weaknesses. But it's exactly that which makes Ron a man.\\"[11]\\r\\n\\r\\nRon is given his brother Charlie's old, chipped wand, which is made out of ash and has a unicorn hair sticking out of the end. He holds the wand together with Spellotape after nearly breaking it in half at the start of Chamber of Secrets, but it malfunctions dreadfully after this, backfiring spells, making strange noises, and emitting objects from the wrong end. Ron's new wand is fourteen inches, willow and unicorn hair, which he procures before the start of his third year at Hogwarts. He also shows signs of exceptional tactical ability, as evidenced by his skill at Wizard's Chess (which is played exactly like normal chess but with living pieces). Ron's talents are rarely shown, but he, like the other DA members, survives a violent encounter with adult Death Eaters in Order of the Phoenix, and it is implied that during the Death Eater assault in Half-Blood Prince he held his own quite well because he was being helped by Felix Felicis, the good luck potion. In Deathly Hallows, Ron loses his original wand, and takes Peter Pettigrew's wand for his own. Following this, Ron begins to demonstrate more aptitude and general knowledge, along with a sudden spurt in maturity after a terrible row with Harry. For a while, he effectively leads the trio in the hunt for the Horcruxes while Harry suffers a major depression.\\r\\n\\r\\nRowling has stated that Ron's Patronus Charm takes the form of a Jack Russell Terrier, \\"a really sentimental choice\\" as Rowling herself owns a Jack Russell.[12]\\r\\n\\r\\nNotes:\\r\\n\\r\\nRon was born into the Weasley family on 1 March 1980,[13][HBP?Ch.18] the sixth of their seven children, and the youngest son. His middle name, Bilius, is the same as that of a deceased uncle. Ron grew up in the family home, The Burrow, near the village of Ottery St Catchpole in Devon. Ron has six siblings; his five older brothers, Bill, Charlie, Percy, twins Fred and George, and a younger sister, Ginny, each with their own distinct personality trait. One recurring factor in Ron's siblings is that they often appear to be more confident, self-assured and, to varying degrees, more outwardly talented than he is.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Weasley family is one of the few remaining pure-blood wizarding families, though they were considered \\"blood traitors\\" for associating with non-pure-bloods. Moreover, they are far from rich, and are looked down upon by snobbish \\"old families\\" such as the Malfoys. All of the Weasleys have been sorted into Gryffindor House at Hogwarts. All of the Weasley children, except Bill and Percy who both were Head Boy, are known to have played on the Gryffindor Quidditch team, with Charlie being the captain of the team for at least one of his school years. Bill, Charlie, and Ron were also chosen as the prefect of their House. The Weasleys also all work for the Order of the Phoenix, and all are members except for Ron, Percy, and Ginny, who (as of the end of Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows) are not known to have officially been inducted into the Order. Arthur is distantly related to Sirius Black and is part of the famed Black family, though he and the rest of his immediate family have been considered \\"blood traitors\\" and are disowned. Other distant relatives include Draco Malfoy, Nymphadora Tonks, and Bellatrix Lestrange.\\r\\n\\r\\nRon was chosen by IGN as their third favourite Harry Potter character, who said that Ron's status as comic relief made him \\"instantly endearing\\" and that his frustration and flirtation with Hermione Granger was a \\"highlight\\".[14]\\r\\n\\r\\nRon has made several appearances in parodies of Harry Potter. Seth Meyers appeared as Ron in Saturday Night Live in the sketch in which Lindsay Lohan portrays Hermione.[15] On his The Big Impression show, Alistair McGowan did a sketch called \\"Louis Potter and the Philosopher's Scone\\". It featured impressions of Anne Robinson as Ron.[16] In 2003, Comic Relief performed a spoof story called Harry Potter and the Secret Chamberpot of Azerbaijan, in which Jennifer Saunders appeared as both Ron and J. K. Rowling.[17][18] In Harry Podder: Dude Where's My Wand?, a play by Desert Star Theater in Utah, written by sisters Laura J., Amy K. and Anna M. Lewis, Ron appears as \\"Ron Sneasley\\".[19][20] In the Harry Bladder sketches in All That, Ron appears as ReRon and is played by Bryan Hearne. Ron also is a regular character in Potter Puppet Pals sketches by Neil Cicierega. In one of the episodes, \\"The Mysterious Ticking Noise\\", Ron, along with Snape, Harry, Hermione and Dumbledore, is killed by a bomb placed by Voldemort; the episode being the seventeenth most viewed video of all time as of 2008 and the winner for \\"Best Comedy\\" of the year 2007 at YouTube.[21] In the 2008 American comedy film Yes Man, Carl (portrayed by Jim Carrey) attends a Harry Potter-themed party hosted by Norman (Rhys Darby), in which Norman disguises as Ron. In A Very Potter Musical (2009) and A Very Potter Sequel (2010), parody musicals by StarKid Productions, Ron was portrayed by Joey Richter.","input":"What is the name of the weasley-family's house?"},{"output":"Caesars Palace","context":"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Hangover is a 2009 American comedy film directed by Todd Phillips, co-produced with Daniel Goldberg, and written by Jon Lucas and Scott Moore. It is the first installment in The Hangover trilogy. The film stars Bradley Cooper, Ed Helms, Zach Galifianakis, Heather Graham, Justin Bartha, and Jeffrey Tambor. It tells the story of Phil Wenneck, Stu Price, Alan Garner, and Doug Billings, who travel to Las Vegas for a bachelor party to celebrate Doug's impending marriage. However, Phil, Stu, and Alan wake up with Doug missing and no memory of the previous night's events, and must find the groom before the wedding can take place.\\r\\n\\r\\nLucas and Moore wrote the script after executive producer Chris Bender's friend disappeared and had a large bill after being sent to a strip club. After Lucas and Moore sold it to the studio for $2 million, Philips and Jeremy Garelick rewrote the script to include a tiger as well as a subplot involving a baby and a police cruiser, and also including boxer Mike Tyson. Filming took place in Nevada for 15 days, and during filming, the three main actors (Cooper, Helms, and Galifianakis) formed a real friendship.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Hangover was released on June 5, 2009, and was a critical and commercial success. The film became the tenth-highest-grossing film of 2009, with a worldwide gross of over $467 million. The film won the Golden Globe Award for Best Motion Picture ÿ Musical or Comedy, and received multiple other accolades. It is the tenth-highest-grossing worldwide film of 2009, as well as the second-highest-grossing R-rated comedy ever in the United States, surpassing a record previously held by Beverly Hills Cop for almost 25 years.[4] It is the sixth-highest-grossing R-rated film in the U.S., behind The Passion of the Christ, The Matrix Reloaded, American Sniper, It, and Deadpool.\\r\\n\\r\\nA sequel, The Hangover Part II, was released on May 26, 2011, and a third and final installment, The Hangover Part III, was released on May 23, 2013, though both films never received the same reception as their predecessor.\\r\\n\\r\\nTo celebrate his upcoming marriage to Tracy Garner, Doug Billings travels to Las Vegas with his best friends Phil Wenneck, Stuart \\"Stu\\" Price, and Tracy's brother Alan, in Doug's future father-in-law Sid's vintage Mercedes-Benz W111. They spend the night at Caesars Palace, where they relax in their hotel suite before celebrating with a few drinks on the hotel rooftop. The next morning, Phil, Stu, and Alan awaken to find they have no memory of the previous night, and Doug is nowhere to be found. Stu's tooth is in Alan's pocket, their suite is in a state of complete disarray, a tiger is in their bathroom, a chicken is in their living room, and a baby is in the closet, whom Alan names \\"Carlos\\". They see Doug's mattress impaled on a statue outside of Caesars Palace and when they ask for their Mercedes, the valet delivers an LVPD police cruiser.\\r\\n\\r\\nUsing clues to retrace their steps, the trio travel to a hospital where they discover they were drugged with Rohypnol (\\"roofies\\"), causing their memory loss, and that they came to the hospital from a chapel. At the chapel, they learn that Stu married a stripper named Jade, despite being in a long-term relationship with his abusive, domineering girlfriend Melissa. Outside the chapel, the trio is attacked by gangsters saying they are looking for someone. They flee and visit Jade, discovering that she is the mother of the baby, whose real name is Tyler. They are then arrested by the police for stealing the police cruiser. After being told that the Mercedes has been impounded, the trio is released when they unknowingly volunteer to be targets for a taser demonstration. While driving the Mercedes, they discover a naked Chinese man named Leslie Chow in the trunk. Chow jumps out of the trunk, beats the trio up with a crowbar and flees. Alan confesses that he drugged their drinks to ensure they had a good night, believing the drug to be ecstasy.\\r\\n\\r\\nReturning to their suite, they find the boxer Mike Tyson, who orders the trio to return the tiger to his mansion immediately. Stu drugs the tiger with the remaining Rohypnol, and they drive towards Tyson's home in the Mercedes-Benz. However, the tiger awakens midway and attacks them, clawing Phil on the neck and damaging the car's interior. After pushing the car the rest of the way to the mansion, Tyson shows the trio footage of them at his house to help them locate Doug. While driving, their car is intentionally t-boned by a 2009 Cadillac Escalade. The passengers are revealed to be the gangsters from the chapel, and their boss Chow. Chow accuses the trio of kidnapping him and stealing $80,000 that was in his purse. As the trio denies this, Chow tells them he has Doug, and threatens to kill him if his money is not returned. Unable to find Chow's $80,000, Alan, with help from Stu and Jade, uses his knowledge of card counting to win $82,400 playing Blackjack.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe next morning, they meet with Chow in the desert and exchange the money, only to find that \\"Doug\\" is the black drug dealer who accidentally sold Alan Rohypnol. With the wedding set to occur in 5 hours, Phil calls Tracy and tells her that they cannot find Doug. When \\"Black Doug\\" mentions that, \\"If you take Roofies, you're more likely to end up on the floor than on the roof,\\" Stu realizes where Doug is. The trio travels back to their hotel where they find a badly sunburned Doug on the roof. Stu, Phil, and Alan had moved him there on his mattress the night before as a practical joke, but forgot where they left him. Doug had thrown his own mattress onto the statue, in an attempt to signal help. Before leaving, Stu makes arrangements to go on a date with Jade the following week. With less than four hours before the wedding and with no flights to L.A. available, the four quickly drive home. Along the way, Doug reveals he has possession of Chow's original $80,000. Despite their late arrival, Doug and Tracy are married, the former learns the damaged Mercedes was a wedding gift, and Stu breaks up with Melissa, having grown tired of her domineering attitude. As the reception ends, Alan finds Stu's digital camera containing photos of the events they cannot remember, and the four agree to look at the pictures together before deleting the evidence of their exploits. All of them, save for Alan, are traumatized by what they see.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe cast also includes: Mike Epps as \\"Black Doug\\", a drug dealer who is mistaken for Doug; Rachael Harris as Melissa, Stu's domineering, philandering girlfriend; Bryan Callen as Eddie, the wedding organizer; Rob Riggle and Cleo King as Officers Franklin and Garden, respectively; Gillian Vigman as Stephanie Wenneck, Phil's wife; Ian Anthony Dale and Michael Lee portray Chow's henchmen. Matt Walsh portrays Dr. Valsh and Dan Finnerty plays a wedding singer at Doug and Tracy's wedding. Todd Phillips, the film's director, appears as Mr. Creepy, who appears briefly in an elevator. Mike Tyson appears as himself; Tyson originally refused to appear in the film, but he changed his mind when he found out that Todd Phillips directed Old School, which Tyson liked.[5] Tyson later said that working on the film convinced him to change his lifestyle.[6] Professional skateboarder Mike Vallely portrays Neeco, the high-speed tuxedo delivery man.[7] Las Vegas personalities Wayne Newton and Carrot Top appear as themselves in the photo slide show.[8]\\r\\n\\r\\nEd Helms[9]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe plot of The Hangover was inspired by a real event that happened to Tripp Vinson, a producer and friend of executive producer Chris Bender. Vinson had gone missing from his own Las Vegas bachelor party, blacking out and waking up \\"in a strip club being threatened with a very, very large bill [he] was supposed to pay\\".[10]\\r\\n\\r\\nJon Lucas and Scott Moore sold the original script of The Hangover to Warner Bros. for over $2?million. The story was about three friends who lose the groom at his Las Vegas bachelor party and then must retrace their steps to figure out what happened.[11]\\r\\nIt was then rewritten by Jeremy Garelick and director Todd Phillips, who added additional elements such as Mike Tyson and his tiger, the baby, and the police cruiser. The Writers Guild of America, West disallowed their work to be credited due to the rules of its screenwriting credit system.[10][12]\\r\\n\\r\\nEd Helms, Zach Galifianakis, and Bradley Cooper were all casual acquaintances before The Hangover was filmed, which Helms said he believed helped in establishing a rapport and chemistry amongst their characters. Helms credited Phillips for \\"bringing together three guys who are really different, but really appreciate each others' humor and sensibilities\\". Helms also said the fact that the story of the three characters growing closer and bonding informed the friendship between the three actors: \\"As you spend 14?hours a day together for three months, you see a lot of sides of somebody. We went through the wringer together, and that shared experience really made us genuine buddies.\\"[9]\\r\\n\\r\\nLindsay Lohan was offered the role of Jade in the film. However, she turned it down, saying that the script \\"had no potential\\". She later regretted making that decision.[13]\\r\\n\\r\\nOn a budget of $35?million,[2] principal photography took place in Nevada for fifteen days.[14]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Hangover was mostly filmed on location at Caesars Palace, including the front desk, lobby, entrance drive, pools, corridors, elevators, and roof, but the suite damaged in the film was built on a soundstage.[15]\\r\\n\\r\\nHelms said filming The Hangover was more physically demanding than any other role he had done, and that he lost eight pounds while making the film. He said the most difficult day of shooting was the scene when Mr. Chow rams his car and attacks the main characters, which Helms said required many takes and was very painful, such as when a few of the punches and kicks accidentally landed and when his knees and shins were hurt while being pulled out of a window.[9] The missing tooth was not created with prosthetics or visual effects, but is naturally occurring: Helms never had an adult incisor grow, and got a dental implant as a teenager, which was removed for filming.[16]\\r\\n\\r\\nJeong stated that his jumping on Cooper's neck naked wasn't a part of the script, but rather improvisation on their part. It was added with Phillips' blessing. Jeong also stated that he had to receive his wife's permission to appear nude in the film.[17]\\r\\n\\r\\nPhillips tried to convince the actors to allow him to use a real Taser until Warner Bros. lawyers intervened.[18]\\r\\n\\r\\nRegarding the explicit shots in the final photo slide show in which his character is seen receiving fellatio in an elevator, Galifianakis confirmed that a prosthesis was used for the scene, and that he had been more embarrassed than anyone else during the creation of the shot. \\"You would think that I wouldn't be the one who was embarrassed; I was extremely embarrassed. I really didn't even want it in there. I offered Todd's assistant a lot of money to convince him to take it out of the movie. I did. But it made it in there.\\"[19]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe scenes involving animals were filmed mostly with trained animals. Trainers and safety equipment were digitally removed from the final version. Some prop animals were used, such as when the tiger was hidden under a sheet and being moved on a baggage cart. Such efforts were given an \\"Outstanding\\" rating by the American Humane Association for the monitoring and treatment of the animals.[20]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe film's score was composed by Christophe Beck. The film featured 20 songs, consisting of music by Kanye West, Dyslexic Speedreaders, Danzig, The Donnas, Usher, Phil Collins, The Belle Stars, T.I., Wolfmother and The Dan Band, who tend to feature in Phillips' films as the inappropriate, bad-mouthed wedding band. The Dan Band also has a version of the 50 Cent hit single \\"Candy Shop\\". Pro-skater and punk musician Mike Vallely was invited with his band, Revolution Mother, to write a song for the film and also makes a cameo appearance as the high speed tuxedo delivery guy.[7]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\"Right Round\\" by Flo Rida is played over the ending credits.[21][22] The film uses the Kanye West song \\"Can't Tell Me Nothing\\" for which Zach Galifianakis made an alternative music video.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Hangover was a financial success. As of  December?17, 2009[update], it had grossed $467,416,722, of which $277,322,503 was in Canada and the United States. It was tenth-highest-grossing film of 2009 in the world, the ninth-highest-grossing film of 2009 in the U.S. and the highest-grossing R-rated comedy ever in the United States, surpassing a record previously held by Beverly Hills Cop for almost 25?years.[3][23]\\r\\nOut of all R-rated films, it is the sixth-highest-grossing ever in the U.S., behind The Passion of the Christ, Deadpool, American Sniper, It and The Matrix Reloaded.[24] However, adjusted for inflation The Hangover earned less than half the total earned by Beverly Hills Cop and is out grossed by several comedies including Porky's.[25][26]\\r\\n\\r\\nOn its first day of release in the U.S., the film drew $16,734,033 on approximately 4,500?screens at 3,269?sites, and exceeded the big-budgeted Land of the Lostthe other major new release of the weekendfor first day's box office takings.[27]\\r\\nAlthough initial studio projections had the Disney{Pixar film Up holding on to the number one slot for a second consecutive weekend, final revised figures, bolstered by a surprisingly strong Sunday showing, ultimately had The Hangover finishing first for the weekend, with $44,979,319 from?3,269 theaters, averaging $13,759 per venue, narrowly edging out Up for the top spot, and more than twice that of Land of the Lost, which finished third with $18.8?million.[28]\\r\\nThe film exceeded Warner Bros.' expectationswhich had anticipated it would finish third behind Up and Land of the Lostbenefiting from positive word-of-mouth and critical praise, and a generally negative buzz for Land of the Lost.[28][29] It stayed at the number one position in its second weekend, grossing another $32,794,387, from 3,355?theaters for an average of $9,775 per venue, and bringing the 10-day amount to $104,768,489.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Hangover was released on DVD, Blu-ray, and UMD on December 15, 2009. There is a single-disc theatrical version featuring both full- and wide-screen option (DVD only), as well as a wide-screen two-disc unrated version of the film, also containing the theatrical version (DVD, Blu-ray, and UMD). The unrated version is approximately seven minutes longer than the theatrical version.[30] The unrated version is on disc one and the theatrical version, digital copy, and the different features are on disc two.[31]\\r\\nThe Hangover beat Inglourious Basterds and G-Force in first week DVD and Blu-ray sales, as well as rentals, selling more than 8.6?million units and making it the best-selling comedy ever on DVD and Blu-ray, beating the previous record held by My Big Fat Greek Wedding.[32]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nOn Rotten Tomatoes the film has an approval rating of 79% based on 234 reviews with an average rating of 6.8/10. The website's critical consensus reads, \\"With a clever script and hilarious interplay among the cast, The Hangover nails just the right tone of raunchy humor and the non-stop laughs overshadow any flaw.\\"[33] On Metacritic, the film has a score of 73 out of 100 based on 31 critics, indicating \\"generally favorable reviews\\".[34] Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \\"A\\" on an A+ to F scale.[35]\\r\\n\\r\\nRoger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times gave it three-and-a-half stars out of four and praised the film for its funniness and comedic approach.[36] A. O. Scott of The New York Times praised Cooper, Helms and Galifianakis for their performances in the film as well as Todd Phillips for its direction. Scott later went on to say that the film is \\"safe as milk\\".[37] Mick LaSalle of the San Francisco Chronicle also praised Phillips' direction. LaSalle also praised the film's comedic scenes and called it \\"the funniest movie so far this year [2009]\\".[38] Betsy Sharkey of the Los Angeles Times praised the film for its perverseness. Sharkey also said that the film is \\"filled with moments as softhearted as they are crude, as forgiving as unforgivable\\".[39] Although Joe Leydon of Variety criticized the film's trailers and TV-spots for its \\"beer-and-boobs, party-hearty farce\\", Leydon praised the film for its cleverness.[40]\\r\\n\\r\\nConversely, Richard Corliss of Time said that \\"virtually every joke [in the film] either is visible long before it arrives or extends way past its expiration date\\" and added, \\"Whatever the other critics say, this is a bromance so primitive it's practically Bro-Magnon.\\"[41]\\r\\nIn his review in The Baltimore Sun, Michael Sragow called the film a \\"foul mesh of cheap cleverness and vulgarity\\"[42] Joe Neumaier of the Daily News gave the film two-and-a-half out of 5 stars and noted, \\"Amusing as it is, it never feels real. That may not seem like a big deala lot of funny movies play by their own rulesexcept that The Hangover keeps doubling-down on the outlandishness.\\"[43]\\r\\nFamily-oriented reviewers have harangued the film, noting that Galifianakis said he tried to forbid his own mother from seeing it and that he yells at parents of kids who tell him they like the film.[44]\\r\\n\\r\\nCritics noted the weak character development, especially in its female characters.[45] Critics also focused on misogyny[46] and stereotyping, in particular the Asian gangster.[41][47]\\r\\nEbert, despite his praise, stated, \\"I won't go so far as to describe it as a character study\\"[36] but that the film is more than the sum of its partsparts that may at first seem a little generic or clichd,[48] since many other films (such as Very Bad Things) have already explored the idea of a weekend in Vegas gone wrong. The film's premise has several similarities to Dude, Where's My Car?[49] Both films are about \\"a couple guys waking up after a night of getting trashed, only to find they are missing something important\\",[50] whose adventures include \\"a trail of clues, a missing car, dubious encounters with strippers and wild animals, a brush with the law and gangs chasing them for something they don't realize they have\\".[51]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nOn January 17, 2010, The Hangover won the Golden Globe Award for Best Motion Picture ÿ Musical or Comedy.[46]\\r\\nIt was also named one of the top ten films of the year by the American Film Institute.[52]\\r\\nThe film won \\"Best Ensemble\\" from the Detroit Film Critics Society.[53]\\r\\nThe screenplay was nominated for a Writers Guild of America and BAFTA awards.\\r\\n\\r\\nBy depicting and celebrating Las Vegas as the \\"ultimate guys' getaway\\", The Hangover had a major impact on Caesars Palace and Las Vegas.[54] It was reported in 2013 that as of that year, guests were still continuing to quote to Caesars staff two lines from the film's check-in scene: \\"Did Caesar live here?\\" and \\"Do you know if the hotel is pager friendly?\\"[54] As a result of the film, Hangover-themed slot machines became popular at casinos throughout the Las Vegas Valley, the Caesars Palace gift shop sold tens of thousands of Hangover-related souvenirs, and the Las Vegas Convention and Visitors Authority received numerous inquiries from persons interested in recreating some of the film's most wild scenes, such as those involving a tiger.[54]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nPrincipal photography of The Hangover Part II began in October 2010, with Bradley Cooper, Ed Helms, Justin Bartha, and Zach Galifianakis returning, in addition to Ken Jeong who appears in a much larger role.

The village is 3?km southeast of the town of Artik.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nHarichavank known as one of the most famous monastic centers in Armenia and it was especially renowned for its school and scriptorium. Archaeological excavations of 1966 indicate that Harich was in existence during the 2nd century BC, and was one of the more well known fortress towns in Armenia.\\r\\nThe oldest part of this Armenian monastery is the Church of St. Gregory the Enlightener (??. ?????? ??????????); it is a domed structure that is usually placed in the category of so-called \\"Mastara-style\\" churches (named after the fifth century church of St. Hovhannes in the village of Mastara, in the southern part of Shirak). The founding date of the monastery is unknown, but probably it was built no later than the 7th century, when St. Gregory was erected.\\r\\nThe Cathedral of the Holy Mother of God (??. ??????????) that dominates the monastic complex was built by the orders of Zakare Zakarian, Amirspasalar (commander-in-chief) and Prince who ruled Eastern Armenia in the 13th century together with his brother Ivane Zakarian. Prince Zakare started the Cathedral after he bought Harich from a family representing the Pahlavuni dynasty.\\r\\nThe Cathedral is a cruciform church with two-story sacristies in each of the four extensions of the building. The tall 20-hedral drum of the cupola is of original style. Initially tent-roofed, it acquired triple columns on its facets and large rosettes in the piers which, together with platbands, form an unusual decorative girder around the middle of the drum height. Later, the cupola drum of the Gandzasar Monastery (1216-1238) was decorated in the same way.\\r\\nThe eastern facade of the Cathedral features a relief carving depicting the Zakarian brothers holding a model of the Cathedral in their hands. This theme can be found in many other Armenian churches of the time e.g. on the Memorial Cathedral of the Dadivank Monastery in Nagorno Karabakh, as well as on main churches of the Sanahin and Haghartsin monasteries in Armenia. This relief was covered in 1895 with a marble plaque featuring Madonna; when the plaque was removed, the original carving showed beneath.\\r\\nHaritchavanks Cathedral belongs to the category of \\"Gandzasar-style\\" ecclesiastical edifices that were built approximately at the same time in different parts of Armenia, and were endowed with similar compositional and decorative characteristics (another exampleCathedral of the Hovhannavank Monastery).[1] Those include umbrella-shaped dome, cruciform floor plan, narthex (often with stalactite-ornamented ceiling), and high-relief of a large cross on one of churchs walls.\\r\\nThe privileges granted by the princes to the monastery contributed towards its becoming a large cultural and enlightenment center of medieval Armenia. At the end of the 12th and the beginning of the 13th century, two monumental gavits (narthexes) were built of big stones, some measuring 3.5 meters. The larger narthex (gavit) is adjacent to the western facade of the Cathedral and is linked to the northern apse of the Church of St. Gregory. It is a rectangular building supported by four pillars, with a stalactite carving in the central part of the ceiling.\\r\\nOver 800 years the monastery was repeatedly reconstructed. Damages inflicted on it were repaired and small annexes and chapels were added to it at various times. The largest of these dates back to the second half of the 19th century, when Harich was made the summer audience of the Katholikos of Echmiadzin in 1850. The monastery grounds expanded northwards and were encircled with walls and towers. New one- and two-storey structures were erected: Katholikos offices, a refectory with a kitchen and a bakery, a school, a hostel for monks and disciples, an inn, stores and cattlesheds. Greenery was planted in the yards.\\r\\nSouth of the monastery, on a steep cliff, stands the Hermitage Chapel.

Jordan played 15 seasons in the NBA for the Chicago Bulls and Washington Wizards. His biography on the NBA website states: \\"By acclamation, Michael Jordan is the greatest basketball player of all time.\\"[4] Jordan was one of the most effectively marketed athletes of his generation and was considered instrumental in popularizing the NBA around the world in the 1980s and 1990s.[5]\\r\\nJordan played three seasons for coach Dean Smith at the University of North Carolina. As a freshman, he was a member of the Tar Heels' national championship team in 1982. Jordan joined the Bulls in 1984 as the third overall draft pick. He quickly emerged as a league star, entertaining crowds with his prolific scoring. His leaping ability, demonstrated by performing slam dunks from the free throw line in slam dunk contests, earned him the nicknames Air Jordan and His Airness. He also gained a reputation for being one of the best defensive players in basketball.[6] In 1991, he won his first NBA championship with the Bulls, and followed that achievement with titles in 1992 and 1993, securing a \\"three-peat\\". Although Jordan abruptly retired from basketball before the beginning of the 1993ÿ94 NBA season and started a new career playing minor league baseball, he returned to the Bulls in March 1995 and led them to three additional championships in 1996, 1997, and 1998, as well as a then-record 72 regular-season wins in the 1995ÿ96 NBA season. Jordan retired for a second time in January 1999, but returned for two more NBA seasons from 2001 to 2003 as a member of the Wizards.\\r\\nJordan's individual accolades and accomplishments include five Most Valuable Player (MVP) Awards, ten All-NBA First Team designations, nine All-Defensive First Team honors, fourteen NBA All-Star Game appearances, three All-Star Game MVP Awards, ten scoring titles, three steals titles, six NBA Finals MVP Awards, and the 1988 NBA Defensive Player of the Year Award. Among his numerous accomplishments, Jordan holds the NBA records for highest career regular season scoring average (30.12 points per game) and highest career playoff scoring average (33.45 points per game). In 1999, he was named the greatest North American athlete of the 20th century by ESPN, and was second to Babe Ruth on the Associated Press's list of athletes of the century. Jordan is a two-time inductee into the Basketball Hall of Fame, having been enshrined in 2009 for his individual career, and again in 2010 as part of the group induction of the 1992 United States men's Olympic basketball team (\\"The Dream Team\\"). He became a member of the FIBA Hall of Fame in 2015.\\r\\nJordan is also known for his product endorsements. He fueled the success of Nike's Air Jordan sneakers, which were introduced in 1985 and remain popular today.[7] Jordan also starred in the 1996 film Space Jam as himself. In 2006, he became part-owner and head of basketball operations for the then-Charlotte Bobcats, buying a controlling interest in 2010. In 2015, Jordan became the first billionaire NBA player in history as a result of the increase in value of NBA franchises. He is the third-richest African-American, behind Oprah Winfrey and Robert F. Smith.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nJordan was born in Brooklyn, New York, to Deloris (ne Peoples), who worked in banking, and James R. Jordan Sr., an equipment supervisor. His family moved to Wilmington, North Carolina, when he was a toddler.[8]\\r\\nJordan is the fourth of five children. He has two older brothers, Larry Jordan and James R. Jordan, Jr., one older sister, Deloris, and one younger sister, Roslyn. Jordan's brother James retired in 2006 as the Command Sergeant Major of the 35th Signal Brigade of the XVIII Airborne Corps in the U.S. Army.[9]\\r\\nJordan attended Emsley A. Laney High School in Wilmington, where he highlighted his athletic career by playing basketball, baseball, and football. He tried out for the varsity basketball team during his sophomore year, but at 5'11\\" (1.80 m), he was deemed too short to play at that level. His taller friend, Harvest Leroy Smith, was the only sophomore to make the team.[10][11]\\r\\nMotivated to prove his worth, Jordan became the star of Laney's junior varsity squad, and tallied several 40-point games.[10] The following summer, he grew four inches (10?cm)[11][4] and trained rigorously. Upon earning a spot on the varsity roster, Jordan averaged about 20 points per game over his final two seasons of high school play.[12][13] As a senior, he was selected to the McDonald's All-American Team[14] after averaging a triple-double: 29.2 points, 11.6 rebounds, and 10.1 assists.[15]\\r\\nJordan was recruited by numerous college basketball programs, including Duke, North Carolina, South Carolina, Syracuse, and Virginia.[16] In 1981, Jordan accepted a basketball scholarship to North Carolina, where he majored in cultural geography.[17]\\r\\nAs a freshman in coach Dean Smith's team-oriented system, he was named ACC Freshman of the Year after he averaged 13.4 points per game (ppg) on 53.4% shooting (field goal percentage).[18] He made the game-winning jump shot in the 1982 NCAA Championship game against Georgetown, which was led by future NBA rival Patrick Ewing.[4] Jordan later described this shot as the major turning point in his basketball career.[19] During his three seasons at North Carolina, he averaged 17.7 ppg on 54.0% shooting, and added 5.0 rebounds per game (rpg).[12] He was selected by consensus to the NCAA All-American First Team in both his sophomore (1983) and junior (1984) seasons. After winning the Naismith and the Wooden College Player of the Year awards in 1984, Jordan left North Carolina one year before his scheduled graduation to enter the 1984 NBA draft. The Chicago Bulls selected Jordan with the third overall pick, after Hakeem Olajuwon (Houston Rockets) and Sam Bowie (Portland Trail Blazers). One of the primary reasons why Jordan was not drafted sooner was because the first two teams were in need of a center.[20] However, Trail Blazers general manager Stu Inman contended that it was not a matter of drafting a center, but more a matter of taking Sam Bowie over Jordan, in part because Portland already had Clyde Drexler, who was a guard with similar skills to Jordan.[21] ESPN, citing Bowie's injury-laden college career, named the Blazers' choice of Bowie as the worst draft pick in North American professional sports history.[22] Jordan returned to North Carolina to complete his degree in 1986.[23]\\r\\nDuring his rookie season in the NBA, Jordan averaged 28.2 ppg on 51.5% shooting.[18] He quickly became a fan favorite even in opposing arenas,[24][25][26] and appeared on the cover of Sports Illustrated with the heading \\"A Star Is Born\\" just over a month into his professional career.[27][28] Jordan was also voted in as an All-Star starter by the fans in his rookie season.[4] Controversy arose before the All-Star game when word surfaced that several veteran playersled by Isiah Thomaswere upset by the amount of attention Jordan was receiving.[4] This led to a so-called \\"freeze-out\\" on Jordan, where players refused to pass the ball to him throughout the game.[4] The controversy left Jordan relatively unaffected when he returned to regular season play, and he would go on to be voted Rookie of the Year.[29] The Bulls finished the season 38ÿ44[30] and lost to the Milwaukee Bucks in four games in the first round of the playoffs.[29]\\r\\nJordan's second season was cut short when he broke his foot in the third game of the year, causing him to miss 64 games.[4] Despite Jordan's injury and a 30ÿ52 record (at the time it was fifth worst record of any team to qualify for the playoffs in NBA history),[30][31] the Bulls made the playoffs. Jordan recovered in time to participate in the playoffs and performed well upon his return. Against a 1985ÿ86 Boston Celtics team that is often considered one of the greatest in NBA history,[32] Jordan set the still-unbroken record for points in a playoff game with 63 in Game 2.[33] The Celtics, however, managed to sweep the series.[29]\\r\\nJordan had completely recovered in time for the 1986ÿ87 season, and he had one of the most prolific scoring seasons in NBA history. He joined Wilt Chamberlain as the only two players to score 3,000 points in a season, averaging a league high 37.1 points on 48.2% shooting.[18] In addition, Jordan demonstrated his defensive prowess, as he became the first player in NBA history to record 200 steals and 100 blocked shots in a season.[34] Despite Jordan's success, Magic Johnson won the league's Most Valuable Player Award. The Bulls reached 40 wins,[30] and advanced to the playoffs for the third consecutive year. However, they were again swept by the Celtics.[29]\\r\\nJordan again led the league in scoring during the 1987ÿ88 season, averaging 35.0 ppg on 53.5% shooting[18] and won his first league MVP Award. He was also named the Defensive Player of the Year, as he had averaged 1.6 blocks and a league high 3.16 steals per game.[35] The Bulls finished 50ÿ32,[30] and made it out of the first round of the playoffs for the first time in Jordan's career, as they defeated the Cleveland Cavaliers in five games.[36] However, the Bulls then lost in five games to the more experienced Detroit Pistons,[29] who were led by Isiah Thomas and a group of physical players known as the \\"Bad Boys\\".[37]\\r\\nIn the 1988ÿ89 season, Jordan again led the league in scoring, averaging 32.5 ppg on 53.8% shooting from the field, along with 8 rpg and 8 assists per game (apg).[18] The Bulls finished with a 47ÿ35 record,[30] and advanced to the Eastern Conference Finals, defeating the Cavaliers and New York Knicks along the way. The Cavaliers series included a career highlight for Jordan when he hit The Shot over Craig Ehlo at the buzzer in the fifth and final game of the series.[38] However, the Pistons again defeated the Bulls, this time in six games,[29] by utilizing their \\"Jordan Rules\\" method of guarding Jordan, which consisted of double and triple teaming him every time he touched the ball.[4]\\r\\nThe Bulls entered the 1989ÿ90 season as a team on the rise, with their core group of Jordan and young improving players like Scottie Pippen and Horace Grant, and under the guidance of new coach Phil Jackson. Jordan averaged a league leading 33.6 ppg on 52.6% shooting, to go with 6.9 rpg and 6.3 apg[18] in leading the Bulls to a 55ÿ27 record.[30] They again advanced to the Eastern Conference Finals after beating the Bucks and Philadelphia 76ers. However, despite pushing the series to seven games, the Bulls lost to the Pistons for the third consecutive season.[29]\\r\\nIn the 1990ÿ91 season, Jordan won his second MVP award after averaging 31.5 ppg on 53.9% shooting, 6.0 rpg, and 5.5 apg for the regular season.[18] The Bulls finished in first place in their division for the first time in 16 years and set a franchise record with 61 wins in the regular season.[30] With Scottie Pippen developing into an All-Star, the Bulls had elevated their play. The Bulls defeated the New York Knicks and the Philadelphia 76ers in the opening two rounds of the playoffs. They advanced to the Eastern Conference Finals where their rival, the Detroit Pistons, awaited them. However, this time the Bulls beat the Pistons in a four-game sweep.[39][40]\\r\\nThe Bulls advanced to the NBA Finals for the first time in franchise history to face the Los Angeles Lakers, who had Magic Johnson and James Worthy, two formidable opponents. The Bulls won the series four games to one, and compiled an outstanding 15ÿ2 playoff record along the way.[39] Perhaps the best known moment of the series came in Game 2 when, attempting a dunk, Jordan avoided a potential Sam Perkins block by switching the ball from his right hand to his left in mid-air to lay the shot into the basket.[41] In his first Finals appearance, Jordan posted per game averages of 31.2 points on 56% shooting from the field, 11.4 assists, 6.6 rebounds, 2.8 steals, and 1.4 blocks.[42] Jordan won his first NBA Finals MVP award,[43] and he cried while holding the NBA Finals trophy.[44]\\r\\nJordan and the Bulls continued their dominance in the 1991ÿ92 season, establishing a 67ÿ15 record, topping their franchise record from 1990ÿ91.[30] Jordan won his second consecutive MVP award with averages of 30.1 points, 6.4 rebounds and 6.1 assists per game on 52% shooting.[35] After winning a physical 7-game series over the New York Knicks in the second round of the playoffs and finishing off the Cleveland Cavaliers in the Conference Finals in 6 games, the Bulls met Clyde Drexler and the Portland Trail Blazers in the Finals. The media, hoping to recreate a MagicÿBird rivalry, highlighted the similarities between \\"Air\\" Jordan and Clyde \\"The Glide\\" during the pre-Finals hype.[45] In the first game, Jordan scored a Finals-record 35 points in the first half, including a record-setting six three-point field goals.[46] After the sixth three-pointer, he jogged down the court shrugging as he looked courtside. Marv Albert, who broadcast the game, later stated that it was as if Jordan was saying, \\"I can't believe I'm doing this.\\"[47] The Bulls went on to win Game 1, and defeat the Blazers in six games. Jordan was named Finals MVP for the second year in a row[43] and finished the series averaging 35.8 ppg, 4.8 rpg, and 6.5 apg, while shooting 53% from the floor.[43]\\r\\nIn the 1992ÿ93 season, despite a 32.6 ppg, 6.7 rpg, and 5.5 apg campaign,[35] Jordan's streak of consecutive MVP seasons ended as he lost the award to his friend Charles Barkley. Coincidentally, Jordan and the Bulls met Barkley and his Phoenix Suns in the 1993 NBA Finals. The Bulls won their third NBA championship on a game-winning shot by John Paxson and a last-second block by Horace Grant, but Jordan was once again Chicago's leader. He averaged a Finals-record 41.0 ppg during the six-game series,[48] and became the first player in NBA history to win three straight Finals MVP awards.[43] He scored more than 30 points in every game of the series, including 40 or more points in 4 consecutive games. With his third Finals triumph, Jordan capped off a seven-year run where he attained seven scoring titles and three championships, but there were signs that Jordan was tiring of his massive celebrity and all of the non-basketball hassles in his life.[49]\\r\\nDuring the Bulls' playoff run in 1993, controversy arose when Jordan was seen gambling in Atlantic City, New Jersey, the night before a game against the New York Knicks.[50] In that same year, he admitted that he had to cover $57,000 in gambling losses,[51] and author Richard Esquinas wrote a book claiming he had won $1.25?million from Jordan on the golf course.[51] In 2005, Jordan talked to Ed Bradley of the CBS evening show 60 Minutes about his gambling and admitted that he made some reckless decisions. Jordan stated, \\"Yeah, I've gotten myself into situations where I would not walk away and I've pushed the envelope. Is that compulsive? Yeah, it depends on how you look at it. If you're willing to jeopardize your livelihood and your family, then yeah.\\"[52] When Bradley asked him if his gambling ever got to the level where it jeopardized his livelihood or family, Jordan replied, \\"No.\\"[52]\\r\\nOn October 6, 1993, Jordan announced his retirement, citing a loss of desire to play the game. Jordan later stated that the death of his father three months earlier also shaped his decision.[53] Jordan's father was murdered on July 23, 1993, at a highway rest area in Lumberton, North Carolina, by two teenagers, Daniel Green and Larry Martin Demery, who carjacked the luxury vehicle. The assailants were traced from calls that they made on James Jordan's cell phone.[54][55] The two criminals were caught, convicted at trial, and sentenced to life in prison. Jordan was close to his father; as a child he had imitated his father's proclivity to stick out his tongue while absorbed in work. He later adopted it as his own signature, displaying it each time he drove to the basket.[4] In 1996, he founded a Chicago area Boys & Girls Club and dedicated it to his father.[56][57]\\r\\nIn his 1998 autobiography For the Love of the Game, Jordan wrote that he had been preparing for retirement as early as the summer of 1992.[58] The added exhaustion due to the Dream Team run in the 1992 Olympics solidified Jordan's feelings about the game and his ever-growing celebrity status. Jordan's announcement sent shock waves throughout the NBA and appeared on the front pages of newspapers around the world.[59]\\r\\nJordan then further surprised the sports world by signing a minor league baseball contract with the Chicago White Sox on February 7, 1994.[60] He reported to spring training in Sarasota, Florida, and was assigned to the team's minor league system on March 31, 1994.[61] Jordan has stated this decision was made to pursue the dream of his late father, who had always envisioned his son as a Major League Baseball player.[62] The White Sox were another team owned by Bulls owner Jerry Reinsdorf, who continued to honor Jordan's basketball contract during the years he played baseball.[63]\\r\\nIn 1994, Jordan played for the Birmingham Barons, a Double-A minor league affiliate of the Chicago White Sox, batting .202 with three home runs, 51 runs batted in, 30 stolen bases, 114 strikeouts, 51 base on balls, and 11 errors.[13] He also appeared for the Scottsdale Scorpions in the 1994 Arizona Fall League, batting .252 against the top prospects in baseball.[61] On November 1, 1994, his number 23 was retired by the Bulls in a ceremony that included the erection of a permanent sculpture known as The Spirit outside the new United Center.[64][65][66]\\r\\nIn the 1993ÿ94 season, the Bulls, without Jordan, achieved a 55ÿ27 record,[30] and lost to the New York Knicks in the second round of the playoffs. But the 1994ÿ95 Bulls were a shell of the championship team of just two years earlier. Struggling at mid-season to ensure a spot in the playoffs, Chicago was 31ÿ31 at one point in mid-March.[67] The team received help, however, when Jordan decided to return to the NBA for the Bulls.[68]\\r\\nIn March 1995, Jordan decided to quit baseball due to the ongoing Major League Baseball strike, as he wanted to avoid becoming a potential replacement player.[69] On March 18, 1995, Jordan announced his return to the NBA through a two-word press release: \\"I'm back.\\"[4] The next day, Jordan took to the court with the Bulls to face the Indiana Pacers in Indianapolis, scoring 19 points.[70] The game had the highest Nielsen rating of a regular season NBA game since 1975.[71] Although he could have opted to wear his normal number in spite of the Bulls having retired it, Jordan instead wore number 45, as he had while playing baseball.[70]\\r\\nAlthough he had not played an NBA game in a year and a half, Jordan played well upon his return, making a game-winning jump shot against Atlanta in his fourth game back. He then scored 55 points in the next game against the Knicks at Madison Square Garden on March 28, 1995.[29] Boosted by Jordan's comeback, the Bulls went 13ÿ4 to make the playoffs and advanced to the Eastern Conference Semifinals against the Orlando Magic. At the end of Game 1, Orlando's Nick Anderson stripped Jordan from behind, leading to the game-winning basket for the Magic; he would later comment that Jordan \\"didn't look like the old Michael Jordan\\"[72] and that \\"No. 45 doesn't explode like No. 23 used to.\\"[73]\\r\\nJordan responded by scoring 38 points in the next game, which Chicago won. Before the game, Jordan decided that he would resume wearing his former number, 23, immediately. The Bulls were fined $25,000 for failing to report the impromptu number change to the NBA.[73] Jordan was fined an additional $5,000 for opting to wear white shoes as the rest of the Bulls wore black.[74] He averaged 31 points per game in the series, but Orlando won the series in 6 games.[12]\\r\\nFreshly motivated by the playoff defeat, Jordan trained aggressively for the 1995ÿ96 season.[75] Strengthened by the addition of rebound specialist Dennis Rodman, the Bulls dominated the league, starting the season 41ÿ3,[76] and eventually finishing with the then-best regular season record in NBA history (later surpassed by the 2015ÿ16 Golden State Warriors): 72ÿ10.[77] Jordan led the league in scoring with 30.4 ppg,[78] and won the league's regular season and All-Star Game MVP awards.[4]\\r\\nIn the playoffs, the Bulls lost only three games in four series (Miami Heat 3ÿ0, New York Knicks 4ÿ1, Orlando Magic 4ÿ0). They defeated the Seattle SuperSonics 4ÿ2 in the NBA Finals to win their fourth championship. Jordan was named Finals MVP for a record fourth time,[43] surpassing Magic Johnson's three Finals MVP awards. He also achieved only the second sweep of the MVP Awards in the All-Star Game, regular season and NBA Finals, Willis Reed having achieved the first, during the 1969ÿ70 season.[29] Because this was Jordan's first championship since his father's murder, and it was won on Father's Day, Jordan reacted very emotionally upon winning the title, including a memorable scene of him crying on the locker room floor with the game ball.[4][44]\\r\\nIn the 1996ÿ97 season, the Bulls started out 69ÿ11, but missed out on a second consecutive 70-win season by losing their final two games to finish 69ÿ13.[79] However, this year Jordan was beaten for the NBA MVP Award by Karl Malone. The Bulls again advanced to the Finals, where they faced Malone and the Utah Jazz. The series against the Jazz featured two of the more memorable clutch moments of Jordan's career. He won Game 1 for the Bulls with a buzzer-beating jump shot. In Game 5, with the series tied at 2, Jordan played despite being feverish and dehydrated from a stomach virus. In what is known as the \\"Flu Game\\", Jordan scored 38 points, including the game-deciding 3-pointer with 25 seconds remaining.[80] The Bulls won 90ÿ88 and went on to win the series in six games.[79] For the fifth time in as many Finals appearances, Jordan received the Finals MVP award.[43] During the 1997 NBA All-Star Game, Jordan posted the first triple double in All-Star Game history in a victorious effort; however, he did not receive the MVP award.[81]\\r\\nJordan and the Bulls compiled a 62ÿ20 record in the 1997ÿ98 season.[30] Jordan led the league with 28.7 points per game,[35] securing his fifth regular-season MVP award, plus honors for All-NBA First Team, First Defensive Team and the All-Star Game MVP.[4] The Bulls won the Eastern Conference Championship for a third straight season, including surviving a seven-game series with the Indiana Pacers in the Eastern Conference Finals; it was the first time Jordan had played in a Game 7 since the 1992 Eastern Conference Semifinals with the Knicks.[82][83] After winning, they moved on for a rematch with the Jazz in the Finals.[84]\\r\\nThe Bulls returned to the Delta Center for Game 6 on June 14, 1998, leading the series 3ÿ2. Jordan executed a series of plays, considered to be one of the greatest clutch performances in NBA Finals history.[85] With the Bulls trailing 86ÿ83 with 41.9 seconds remaining in the fourth quarter, Phil Jackson called a timeout. When play resumed, Jordan received the inbound pass, drove to the basket, and hit a shot over several Jazz defenders, cutting the Utah lead to 86ÿ85.[85] The Jazz brought the ball upcourt and passed the ball to forward Karl Malone, who was set up in the low post and was being guarded by Rodman. Malone jostled with Rodman and caught the pass, but Jordan cut behind him and took the ball out of his hands for a steal.[85] Jordan then dribbled down the court and paused, eyeing his defender, Jazz guard Bryon Russell. With 10 seconds remaining, Jordan started to dribble right, then crossed over to his left, possibly pushing off Russell,[86][87][88] although the officials did not call a foul. With 5.2 seconds left, Jordan gave Chicago an 87ÿ86 lead with a game-winning jumper, the climactic shot of his Bulls career. Afterwards, John Stockton missed a game-winning three-pointer. Jordan and the Bulls won their sixth NBA championship and second three-peat. Once again, Jordan was voted the Finals MVP,[43] having led all scorers averaging 33.5 points per game, including 45 in the deciding Game 6.[89] Jordan's six Finals MVPs is a record; Shaquille O'Neal, Magic Johnson, LeBron James and Tim Duncan are tied for second place with three apiece.[43] The 1998 Finals holds the highest television rating of any Finals series in history. Game 6 also holds the highest television rating of any game in NBA history.[90][91]\\r\\nWith Phil Jackson's contract expiring, the pending departures of Scottie Pippen and Dennis Rodman looming, and being in the latter stages of an owner-induced lockout of NBA players, Jordan retired for the second time on January 13, 1999.[92][93][94] On January 19, 2000, Jordan returned to the NBA not as a player, but as part owner and President of Basketball Operations for the Washington Wizards.[95] Jordan's responsibilities with the Wizards were comprehensive. He controlled all aspects of the Wizards' basketball operations, and had the final say in all personnel matters. Opinions of Jordan as a basketball executive were mixed.[96][97] He managed to purge the team of several highly paid, unpopular players (such as forward Juwan Howard and point guard Rod Strickland),[98][99] but used the first pick in the 2001 NBA draft to select high schooler Kwame Brown, who did not live up to expectations and was traded away after four seasons.[96][100]\\r\\nDespite his January 1999 claim that he was \\"99.9% certain\\" that he would never play another NBA game,[44] in the summer of 2001 Jordan expressed interest in making another comeback,[101][102] this time with his new team. Inspired by the NHL comeback of his friend Mario Lemieux the previous winter,[103] Jordan spent much of the spring and summer of 2001 in training, holding several invitation-only camps for NBA players in Chicago.[104] In addition, Jordan hired his old Chicago Bulls head coach, Doug Collins, as Washington's coach for the upcoming season, a decision that many saw as foreshadowing another Jordan return.[101][102]\\r\\nOn September 25, 2001, Jordan announced his return to the NBA to play for the Washington Wizards, indicating his intention to donate his salary as a player to a relief effort for the victims of the September 11, 2001 attacks.[105][106] In an injury-plagued 2001ÿ02 season, he led the team in scoring (22.9 ppg), assists (5.2 apg), and steals (1.42 spg).[4] However, torn cartilage in his right knee ended Jordan's season after only 60 games, the fewest he had played in a regular season since playing 17 games after returning from his first retirement during the 1994ÿ95 season.[18] Jordan started 53 of his 60 games for the season, averaging 24.3 points, 5.4 assists, and 6.0 rebounds, and shooting 41.9% from the field in his 53 starts. His last seven appearances were in a reserve role, in which he averaged just over 20 minutes per game.[107]\\r\\nPlaying in his 14th and final NBA All-Star Game in 2003, Jordan passed Kareem Abdul-Jabbar as the all-time leading scorer in All-Star Game history (a record since broken by Kobe Bryant).[108] That year, Jordan was the only Washington player to play in all 82 games, starting in 67 of them. He averaged 20.0 points, 6.1 rebounds, 3.8 assists, and 1.5 steals per game.[4] He also shot 45% from the field, and 82% from the free throw line.[4] Even though he turned 40 during the season, he scored 20 or more points 42 times, 30 or more points nine times, and 40 or more points three times.[29] On February 21, 2003, Jordan became the first 40-year-old to tally 43 points in an NBA game.[109] During his stint with the Wizards, all of Jordan's home games at the MCI Center were sold out, and the Wizards were the second most-watched team in the NBA, averaging 20,172 fans a game at home and 19,311 on the road.[110] However, neither of Jordan's final two seasons resulted in a playoff appearance for the Wizards, and Jordan was often unsatisfied with the play of those around him.[111][112] At several points he openly criticized his teammates to the media, citing their lack of focus and intensity, notably that of the number one draft pick in the 2001 NBA draft, Kwame Brown.[111][112]\\r\\nWith the recognition that 2002ÿ03 would be Jordan's final season, tributes were paid to him throughout the NBA. In his final game at his old home court, the United Center in Chicago, Jordan received a four-minute standing ovation.[113] The Miami Heat retired the number 23 jersey on April 11, 2003, even though Jordan never played for the team.[114] At the 2003 All-Star Game, Jordan was offered a starting spot from Tracy McGrady and Allen Iverson,[115] but refused both. In the end, he accepted the spot of Vince Carter, who decided to give it up under great public pressure.[116]\\r\\nJordan played in his final NBA game on April 16, 2003 in Philadelphia. After scoring only 13 points in the game, Jordan went to the bench with 4 minutes and 13 seconds remaining in the third quarter and with his team trailing the Philadelphia 76ers, 75ÿ56. Just after the start of the fourth quarter, the First Union Center crowd began chanting \\"We want Mike!\\" After much encouragement from coach Doug Collins, Jordan finally rose from the bench and re-entered the game, replacing Larry Hughes with 2:35 remaining. At 1:45, Jordan was intentionally fouled by the 76ers' Eric Snow, and stepped to the line to make both free throws. After the second foul shot, the 76ers in-bounded the ball to rookie John Salmons, who in turn was intentionally fouled by Bobby Simmons one second later, stopping time so that Jordan could return to the bench. Jordan received a three-minute standing ovation from his teammates, his opponents, the officials and the crowd of 21,257 fans.[117]\\r\\nJordan played on two Olympic gold medal-winning American basketball teams. He won a gold medal as a college player in the 1984 Summer Olympics. The team was coached by Bob Knight and featured players such as Patrick Ewing, Sam Perkins, Chris Mullin, Steve Alford, and Wayman Tisdale. Jordan led the team in scoring, averaging 17.1 ppg for the tournament.[118]\\r\\nIn the 1992 Summer Olympics, he was a member of the star-studded squad that included Magic Johnson, Larry Bird, and David Robinson and was dubbed the \\"Dream Team\\". Jordan was the only player to start all 8 games in the Olympics. Playing limited minutes due to the frequent blowouts, Jordan averaged 14.9 ppg,[119] finishing second on the team in scoring.[120] Jordan and fellow Dream Team members Patrick Ewing and Chris Mullin are the only American men's basketball players to win Olympic gold medals as amateurs and professionals.[118][119]\\r\\nAfter his third retirement, Jordan assumed that he would be able to return to his front office position as Director of Basketball Operations with the Wizards.[121] However, his previous tenure in the Wizards' front office had produced the aforementioned mixed results and may have also influenced the trade of Richard \\"Rip\\" Hamilton for Jerry Stackhouse (although Jordan was not technically Director of Basketball Operations in 2002).[96] On May 7, 2003, Wizards owner Abe Pollin fired Jordan as Washington's President of Basketball Operations.[96] Jordan later stated that he felt betrayed, and that if he knew he would be fired upon retiring he never would have come back to play for the Wizards.[52]\\r\\nJordan kept busy over the next few years. He stayed in shape, played golf in celebrity charity tournaments, and spent time with his family in Chicago. He also promoted his Jordan Brand clothing line and rode motorcycles.[122] Since 2004, Jordan has owned Michael Jordan Motorsports, a professional closed-course motorcycle road racing team that competed with two Suzukis in the premier Superbike championship sanctioned by the American Motorcyclist Association (AMA) until the end of the 2013 season.[123][124] In 2006, Jordan and his wife Juanita pledged $5?million to Chicago's Hales Franciscan High School.[125] The Jordan Brand has made donations to Habitat for Humanity and a Louisiana branch of the Boys & Girls Clubs of America.[126]\\r\\nOn June 15, 2006, Jordan bought a minority stake in the Charlotte Bobcats, becoming the team's second-largest shareholder behind majority owner Robert L. Johnson. As part of the deal, Jordan took full control over the basketball side of the operation, with the title \\"Managing Member of Basketball Operations.\\"[127] Despite Jordan's previous success as an endorser, he has made an effort not to be included in Charlotte's marketing campaigns.[128] A decade earlier, Jordan had made a bid to become part-owner of Charlotte's original NBA team, the Charlotte Hornets, but talks collapsed when owner George Shinn refused to give Jordan complete control of basketball operations.[129]\\r\\nIn February 2010, it was reported that Jordan was seeking majority ownership of the Bobcats.[130] As February wore on, it became apparent that Jordan and former Houston Rockets president George Postolos were the leading contenders for ownership of the team. On February 27, the Bobcats announced that Johnson had reached an agreement with Jordan and his group, MJ Basketball Holdings, to buy the team pending NBA approval.[131] On March 17, the NBA Board of Governors unanimously approved Jordan's purchase, making him the first former player to become the majority owner of an NBA team.[132] It also made him the league's only African-American majority owner of an NBA team.[133]\\r\\nDuring the 2011 NBA lockout, The New York Times wrote that Jordan led a group of 10 to 14 hardline owners who wanted to cap the players' share of basketball-related income at 50 percent and as low as 47. Journalists observed that, during the labor dispute in 1998, Jordan had told Washington Wizards then-owner Abe Pollin, \\"If you can't make a profit, you should sell your team.\\"[134] Jason Whitlock of FoxSports.com called Jordan a \\"sellout\\" wanting \\"current players to pay for his incompetence.\\"[135] He cited Jordan's executive decisions to draft disappointing players Kwame Brown and Adam Morrison.[135]\\r\\nDuring the 2011ÿ12 NBA season that was shortened to 66 games by the lockout, the Bobcats posted a 7ÿ59 record. Their .106 winning percentage was the worst in NBA history.[136] \\"I'm not real happy about the record book scenario last year. It's very, very frustrating\\", Jordan said later that year.[137]\\r\\nJordan was a shooting guard who was also capable of playing as a small forward (the position he would primarily play during his second return to professional basketball with the Washington Wizards), and as a point guard.[12] Jordan was known throughout his career for being a strong clutch performer. With the Bulls, he decided 25 games with field goals or free throws in the last 30 seconds, including two NBA Finals games and five other playoff contests.[138] His competitiveness was visible in his prolific trash-talk[139] and well-known work ethic.[140][141] As the Bulls organization built the franchise around Jordan, management had to trade away players who were not \\"tough enough\\" to compete with him in practice. To help improve his defense, he spent extra hours studying film of opponents. On offense, he relied more upon instinct and improvisation at game time.[142] Noted as a durable player, Jordan did not miss four or more games while active for a full season from 1986ÿ87 to 2001ÿ02, when he injured his right knee.[12][143] He played all 82 games nine times. Jordan has frequently cited David Thompson, Walter Davis, and Jerry West as influences.[144][145] Confirmed at the start of his career, and possibly later on, Jordan had a special \\"Love of the Game Clause\\" written into his contract (unusual at the time) which allowed him to play basketball against anyone at any time, anywhere.[146]\\r\\nJordan had a versatile offensive game. He was capable of aggressively driving to the basket, as well as drawing fouls from his opponents at a high rate; his 8,772 free throw attempts are the ninth-highest total of all time.[147] As his career progressed, Jordan also developed the ability to post up his opponents and score with his trademark fadeaway jump shot, using his leaping ability to \\"fade away\\" from block attempts. According to Hubie Brown, this move alone made him nearly unstoppable.[148] Despite media criticism as a \\"selfish\\" player early in his career, Jordan's 5.3 assists per game[18] also indicate his willingness to defer to his teammates. After shooting under 30% from three-point range in his first five seasons in the NBA, including a career-low 13% in the 1987ÿ88 season, Jordan improved to a career-high 50% in the 1994ÿ95 season.[18] The three-point shot became more of a focus of his game from 1994ÿ95 to 1996ÿ97, when the NBA shortened its three-point line to 22?ft (6.7?m) (from 23?ft 9?in (7.24?m)).[149] His three-point field-goal percentages ranged from 35% to 43% in seasons in which he attempted at least 230 three-pointers between 1989ÿ90 and 1996ÿ97.[12] For a guard, Jordan was also a good rebounder (6.2 per game).[18]\\r\\nIn 1988, Jordan was honored with the NBA's Defensive Player of the Year Award and became the first NBA player to win both the Defensive Player of the Year and MVP awards in a career (since equaled by Hakeem Olajuwon, David Robinson, and Kevin Garnett; Olajuwon is the only player other than Jordan to win both during the same season). In addition, he set both seasonal and career records for blocked shots by a guard,[150] and combined this with his ball-thieving ability to become a standout defensive player. He ranks third in NBA history in total steals with 2,514, trailing John Stockton and Jason Kidd.[151] Jerry West often stated that he was more impressed with Jordan's defensive contributions than his offensive ones.[152] He was also known to have strong eyesight; broadcaster Al Michaels said that he was able to read baseball box scores on a 27-inch television clearly from about 50 feet away.[153]\\r\\nJordan's marked talent was clear from his rookie season.[24][26] In his first game in Madison Square Garden against the New York Knicks, Jordan received a prolonged standing ovation,[26] a rarity for an opposing player. After Jordan scored a playoff record 63 points against the Boston Celtics on April 20, 1986, Celtics star Larry Bird described him as \\"God disguised as Michael Jordan.\\"[33]\\r\\nJordan led the NBA in scoring in 10 seasons (NBA record) and tied Wilt Chamberlain's record of seven consecutive scoring titles.[4] He was also a fixture on the NBA All-Defensive First Team, making the roster nine times (NBA record shared with Gary Payton, Kevin Garnett and Kobe Bryant).[154] Jordan also holds the top career regular season and playoff scoring averages of 30.1 and 33.4 points per game,[4] respectively. By 1998, the season of his Finals-winning shot against the Jazz, he was well known throughout the league as a clutch performer. In the regular season, Jordan was the Bulls' primary threat in the final seconds of a close game and in the playoffs, Jordan would always demand the ball at crunch time.[155] Jordan's total of 5,987 points in the playoffs is the second-highest in NBA history.[156] He retired with 32,292 points in regular season play,[157] placing him fourth on the NBA's all-time scoring list behind Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, Karl Malone, and Kobe Bryant.[157]\\r\\nWith five regular-season MVPs (tied for second place with Bill Russellonly Kareem Abdul-Jabbar has won more, with six), six Finals MVPs (NBA record), and three All-Star MVPs, Jordan is the most decorated NBA player. Jordan finished among the top three in regular-season MVP voting a record 10 times, and was named one of the 50 Greatest Players in NBA History in 1996. He is one of only seven players in history to win an NCAA championship, an NBA championship, and an Olympic gold medal (doing so twice with the 1984 and 1992 U.S. men's basketball teams).[158] Since 1976, the year of the NBA's merger with the American Basketball Association,[159] Jordan and Pippen are the only two players to win six NBA Finals playing for one team.[160] In the All-Star Game fan ballot, Jordan received the most votes nine times, more than any other player.[161]\\r\\nMany of Jordan's contemporaries say that Jordan is the greatest basketball player of all time.[152] In 1999, an ESPN survey of journalists, athletes and other sports figures ranked Jordan the greatest North American athlete of the 20th century, above such luminaries as Babe Ruth and Muhammad Ali.[162] Jordan placed second to Babe Ruth in the Associated Press's December 1999 list of 20th century athletes.[163] In addition, the Associated Press voted him as the greatest basketball player of the 20th century.[164] Jordan has also appeared on the front cover of Sports Illustrated a record 50 times.[165] In the September 1996 issue of Sport, which was the publication's 50th anniversary issue, Jordan was named the greatest athlete of the past 50 years.[166]\\r\\nJordan's athletic leaping ability, highlighted in his back-to-back slam dunk contest championships in 1987 and 1988, is credited by many with having influenced a generation of young players.[167][168] Several current NBA All-Stars have stated that they considered Jordan their role model while growing up, including LeBron James[169] and Dwyane Wade.[170] In addition, commentators have dubbed a number of next-generation players \\"the next Michael Jordan\\" upon their entry to the NBA, including Anfernee \\"Penny\\" Hardaway, Grant Hill, Allen Iverson, Kobe Bryant, LeBron James, Vince Carter, and Dwyane Wade.[171][172][173] Although Jordan was a well-rounded player, his \\"Air Jordan\\" image is also often credited with inadvertently decreasing the jump shooting skills, defense, and fundamentals of young players,[167] a fact Jordan himself has lamented.\\r\\nI think it was the exposure of Michael Jordan; the marketing of Michael Jordan. Everything was marketed towards the things that people wanted to see, which was scoring and dunking. That Michael Jordan still played defense and an all-around game, but it was never really publicized.[167]\\r\\nAlthough Jordan has done much to increase the status of the game, some of his impact on the game's popularity in America appears to be fleeting.[174] Television ratings in particular increased only during his time in the league,[174] and Finals ratings have not returned to the level reached during his last championship-winning season.[175]\\r\\nIn August 2009, the Basketball Hall of Fame in Springfield, Massachusetts, opened a Michael Jordan exhibit that contained items from his college and NBA careers, as well as from the 1992 \\"Dream Team\\". The exhibit also has a batting glove to signify Jordan's short career in minor league baseball.[176] After Jordan received word of his acceptance into the Hall of Fame, he selected Class of 1996 member David Thompson to present him.[177] As Jordan would later explain during his induction speech in September 2009, growing up in North Carolina, he was not a fan of the Tar Heels, and greatly admired Thompson, who played at rival North Carolina State. He was inducted into the Hall in September, with several former Bulls teammates in attendance, including Scottie Pippen, Dennis Rodman, Charles Oakley, Ron Harper, Steve Kerr, and Toni Kuko?.[178] Two of Jordan's former coaches, Dean Smith and Doug Collins, were also among those present. His emotional reaction during his speechwhen he began to crywas captured by Associated Press photographer Stephan Savoia and would later become widely shared on social media as the Crying Jordan Internet meme.[179][180] In 2016, President Barack Obama honored Jordan with a Presidential Medal of Freedom.[181]\\r\\nJordan married Juanita Vanoy in September 1989, and they had two sons, Jeffrey Michael and Marcus James, and a daughter, Jasmine. Jordan and Vanoy filed for divorce on January 4, 2002, citing irreconcilable differences, but reconciled shortly thereafter. They again filed for divorce and were granted a final decree of dissolution of marriage on December 29, 2006, commenting that the decision was made \\"mutually and amicably\\".[182][183] It is reported that Juanita received a $168?million settlement (equivalent to $200 million in 2016), making it the largest celebrity divorce settlement on public record at the time.[184][185]\\r\\nIn 1991, Jordan purchased a lot in Highland Park, Illinois, to build a 56,000 square foot mansion, which was completed four years later. Jordan listed his Highland Park mansion for sale in 2012.[186] Both of his sons attended Loyola Academy, a private Roman Catholic high school located in Wilmette, Illinois.[187] Jeffrey graduated as a member of the 2007 graduating class and played his first collegiate basketball game on November 11, 2007, for the University of Illinois. After two seasons, Jeffrey left the Illinois basketball team in 2009. He later rejoined the team for a third season,[188][189] then received a release to transfer to the University of Central Florida, where Marcus was attending.[190][191] Marcus transferred to Whitney Young High School after his sophomore year at Loyola Academy and graduated in 2009. He began attending UCF in the fall of 2009,[192] and played three seasons of basketball for the school.[193]\\r\\nOn July 21, 2006, a judge in Cook County, Illinois, determined that Jordan did not owe his alleged former lover Karla Knafel $5?million in a breach of contract claim.[194] Jordan had allegedly paid Knafel $250,000 to keep their relationship a secret.[195][196][197] Knafel claimed Jordan promised her $5?million for remaining silent and agreeing not to file a paternity suit after Knafel learned she was pregnant in 1991. A DNA test showed Jordan was not the father of the child.[194]\\r\\nHe proposed to his longtime girlfriend, Cuban-American model Yvette Prieto, on Christmas 2011,[198] and they were married on April 27, 2013, at Bethesda-by-the-Sea Episcopal Church.[199][200] It was announced on November 30, 2013, that the two were expecting their first child together.[201][202] On February 11, 2014, Prieto gave birth to identical twin daughters named Victoria and Ysabel.[203]\\r\\nJordan is one of the most marketed sports figures in history. He has been a major spokesman for such brands as Nike, Coca-Cola, Chevrolet, Gatorade, McDonald's, Ball Park Franks, Rayovac, Wheaties, Hanes, and MCI.[204] Jordan has had a long relationship with Gatorade, appearing in over 20 commercials for the company since 1991, including the \\"Be Like Mike\\" commercials in which a song was sung by children wishing to be like Jordan.[204][205]\\r\\nNike created a signature shoe for him, called the Air Jordan. One of Jordan's more popular commercials for the shoe involved Spike Lee playing the part of Mars Blackmon. In the commercials Lee, as Blackmon, attempted to find the source of Jordan's abilities and became convinced that \\"it's gotta be the shoes\\".[204] The hype and demand for the shoes even brought on a spate of \\"shoe-jackings\\" where people were robbed of their sneakers at gunpoint. Subsequently, Nike spun off the Jordan line into its own division named the \\"Jordan Brand\\". The company features an impressive list of athletes and celebrities as endorsers.[206][207] The brand has also sponsored college sports programs such as those of North Carolina, Cal, Georgetown, and Marquette.[208]\\r\\nJordan also has been associated with the Looney Tunes cartoon characters. A Nike commercial shown during 1992's Super Bowl XXVI featured Jordan and Bugs Bunny playing basketball.[209] The Super Bowl commercial inspired the 1996 live action/animated film Space Jam, which starred Jordan and Bugs in a fictional story set during the former's first retirement from basketball.[210] They have subsequently appeared together in several commercials for MCI.[210] Jordan also made an appearance in the music video of Michael Jackson's \\"Jam\\" (1992).[211]\\r\\nJordan's yearly income from the endorsements is estimated to be over forty million dollars.[212][213] In addition, when Jordan's power at the ticket gates was at its highest point, the Bulls regularly sold out both their home and road games.[214] Due to this, Jordan set records in player salary by signing annual contracts worth in excess of US $30?million per season.[215] An academic study found that Jordan's first NBA comeback resulted in an increase in the market capitalization of his client firms of more than $1?billion.[216]\\r\\nMost of Jordan's endorsement deals, including his first deal with Nike, were engineered by his agent, David Falk.[217] Jordan has described Falk as \\"the best at what he does\\" and that \\"marketing-wise, he's great. He's the one who came up with the concept of 'Air Jordan.'\\"[218]\\r\\nIn June 2010, Jordan was ranked by Forbes magazine as the 20th-most powerful celebrity in the world with $55?million earned between June 2009 and June 2010. According to the Forbes article, Jordan Brand generates $1?billion in sales for Nike.[219] In June 2014, Jordan was named the first NBA player to become a billionaire, after he increased his stake in the Charlotte Hornets from 80% to 89.5%.[220][221] On January 20, 2015, Jordan was honored with the Charlotte Business Journal's Business Person of the Year for 2014.[222] In 2017, he became a part owner of the Miami Marlins of Major League Baseball.[223] As of April 2017, his current net worth is estimated at $1.31?billion by Forbes.[224] Jordan is the third-richest African-American as of 2017, behind Oprah Winfrey and Robert F. Smith.[225]\\r\\nSources:[4][230][231]","input":"When did michael jordan join the chicago bulls?"}]`),I={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:C},data(){return{visibleCount:20,poemsData:M}},computed:{visiblePoems(){return this.poemsData.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{loadMore(){this.visibleCount+=20}}},B={class:"card-container"};function x(h,t,n,c,u,i){const m=p("PoemCard");return a(),o(l,null,[t[1]||(t[1]=e("section",null,[e("div",{class:"top-Banner"},[e("div",{class:"top-Banner-Title"},[e("div",{class:"top-Banner-Title-Text"},"🎉Q&A Life🥳")])])],-1)),e("section",null,[e("div",B,[(a(!0),o(l,null,g(i.visiblePoems,(r,f)=>(a(),y(m,{key:f,poem:r},null,8,["poem"]))),128))]),i.hasMorePoems?(a(),o("button",{key:0,class:"load-more-button",onClick:t[0]||(t[0]=(...r)=>i.loadMore&&i.loadMore(...r))},"See more")):w("",!0)])],64)}const P=d(I,[["render",x]]),W=JSON.parse('{"title":"","description":"","frontmatter":{"page":true},"headers":[],"relativePath":"qapage/22.md","filePath":"qapage/22.md"}'),D={name:"qapage/22.md"},G=Object.assign(D,{setup(h){return(t,n)=>(a(),o("div",null,[b(P)]))}});export{W as __pageData,G as default};
