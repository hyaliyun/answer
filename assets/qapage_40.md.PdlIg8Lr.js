It is a herbaceous perennial growing from short, thick rhizomes. It produces large poisonous leaves that are somewhat triangular, with long fleshy edible stalks and small flowers grouped in large compound leafy greenish-white to rose-red inflorescences.\\r\\nIn culinary use, fresh raw leaf stalks (petioles) are crisp (similar to celery, although they do not share the same family) with a strong, tart taste. Although rhubarb is not a true fruit, in the kitchen it is usually prepared as if it were.[1] Most commonly, the stalks are cooked with sugar and used in pies, crumbles and other desserts. A number of varieties have been domesticated for human consumption, most of which are recognised as Rheum x hybridum by the Royal Horticultural Society.\\r\\nRhubarb contains anthraquinones including rhein, and emodin and their glycosides (e.g. glucorhein), which impart cathartic and laxative properties. It is hence useful as a cathartic in case of constipation.[2]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nRhubarb is grown widely, and with greenhouse production it is available throughout much of the year. Rhubarb grown in hothouses (heated greenhouses) is called \\"hothouse rhubarb\\", and is typically made available at consumer markets in early spring, before outdoor cultivated rhubarb is available. Hothouse rhubarb is usually brighter red, more tender and sweeter-tasting than outdoor rhubarb.[3] In temperate climates, rhubarb is one of the first food plants harvested, usually in mid- to late spring (April/May in the Northern Hemisphere, October/November in the Southern Hemisphere), and the season for field-grown plants lasts until September. In the northwestern US states of Oregon and Washington, there are typically two harvests, from late April to May and from late June into July.[4][citation needed] Rhubarb is ready to consume as soon as harvested, and freshly cut stalks are firm and glossy.\\r\\nIn the United Kingdom, the first rhubarb of the year is harvested by candlelight in forcing sheds where all other light is excluded, a practice that produces a sweeter, more tender stalk.[5] These sheds are dotted around the \\"Rhubarb Triangle\\" between Wakefield, Leeds, and Morley.[6]\\r\\nThe advocate of organic gardening Lawrence D. Hills listed his favorite rhubarb varieties for flavor as Hawke's Champagne, Victoria, Timperley Early, and Early Albert, also recommending Gaskin's Perpetual for having the lowest level of oxalic acid, allowing it to be harvested over a much longer period of the growing season without developing excessive sourness.[7]\\r\\nBecause rhubarb is a seasonal plant, obtaining fresh rhubarb out of season is difficult in colder climates, such as in the UK, Ireland, and Russia. Rhubarb thrives in areas of direct sunlight and can successfully be planted in containers if they are large enough to accommodate a season's growth.\\r\\nRhubarb damaged by severe cold should not be eaten, as it may be high in oxalic acid, which migrates from the leaves and can cause illness.[8]\\r\\nThe color of rhubarb stalks can vary from the commonly associated crimson red, through speckled light pink, to simply light green. Rhubarb stalks are poetically described as \\"crimson stalks\\". The color results from the presence of anthocyanins, and varies according to both rhubarb variety and production technique. The color is not related to its suitability for cooking:[9] The green-stalked rhubarb is more robust and has a higher yield, but the red-coloured stalks are much more popular with consumers.[citation needed]\\r\\nThe Chinese call rhubarb \\"the great yellow\\" (d hung ?S), and have used rhubarb root for medicinal purposes for thousands of years.[2] It appears in The Divine Farmer's Herb-Root Classic which is thought to have been compiled about 2,700 years ago.[10] Though Dioscurides' description of ϻ or ? indicates that a medicinal root brought to Greece from beyond the Bosphorus may have been rhubarb, commerce in the drug did not become securely established until Islamic times. During Islamic times, it was imported along the Silk Road, reaching Europe in the 14th century through the ports of Aleppo and Smyrna, where it became known as \\"Turkish rhubarb\\".[11] Later, it started arriving also via other via the new maritime routes or overland through Russia. The \\"Russian rhubarb\\" was the most valued, probably because of the rhubarb-specific quality control system maintained by the Russian Empire.[12]\\r\\nThe cost of transportation across Asia made rhubarb expensive in medieval Europe. It was several times the price of other valuable herbs and spices such as cinnamon, opium, and saffron. The merchant explorer Marco Polo therefore searched for the place where the plant was grown and harvested, discovering that it was cultivated in the mountains of Tangut province.[10] The value of rhubarb can be seen in Ruy Gonzles de Clavijo's report of his embassy in 1403ÿ05 to Timur in Samarkand: \\"The best of all merchandise coming to Samarkand was from China: especially silks, satins, musk, rubies, diamonds, pearls, and rhubarb...\\"[13]\\r\\nThe high price as well as the increasing demand from apothecaries stimulated efforts to cultivate the plant on European soil. These were unsuccessful in producing rhubarb root with the necessary medicinal qualities, but the variety then grown in Russia became the ancestor of the common modern rhubarb. The availability of this \\"Siberian rhubarb\\", together with the increasing abundance and decreasing price of sugar in the 18th century, galvanised its culinary adoption.[12]\\r\\nThe term \\"rhubarb\\" is a combination of the Ancient Greek rha and barbarum; rha refers both to the plant and to the River Volga.[14] For centuries, the plant has grown wild along the banks of the River Volga, for which the ancient Scythian hydronym was Rh.[11]\\r\\nThough it is often asserted that rhubarb first came to the United States in the 1820s,[15] John Bartram was growing medicinal and culinary rhubarbs in Philadelphia from the 1730s, planting seeds sent him by Peter Collinson.[16] From the first, the familiar garden rhubarb was not the only Rheum in American gardens: Thomas Jefferson planted R. undulatum at Monticello in 1809 and 1811, observing that it was \\"Esculent rhubarb, the leaves excellent as Spinach.\\"[17]\\r\\nRhubarb is grown primarily for its fleshy stalks, technically known as petioles. The use of rhubarb stalks as food is a relatively recent innovation. This usage was first recorded in 17th-century England after affordable sugar became available to common people, and reached a peak between the 20th century's two world wars.\\r\\nCommonly, it is stewed with sugar or used in pies and desserts, but it can also be put into savory dishes or pickled. Rhubarb can be dehydrated and infused with fruit juice. In most cases, it is infused with strawberry juice to mimic the popular strawberry rhubarb pie.\\r\\nRhubarb root produces a rich brown dye similar to walnut husks. It is used in northern regions where walnut trees do not survive.\\r\\nFor cooking, the stalks are often cut into small pieces and stewed (boiled in water) with added sugar, until soft. Little water is added, as rhubarb stalks already contain a great deal of water. Rhubarb should be processed and stored in containers which are unaffected by residual acid content, such as glass or stainless steel. Spices such as cinnamon, nutmeg, and ginger are sometimes added. Stewed rhubarb or rhubarb sauce, like applesauce, is usually eaten cold. Pectin, or sugar with pectin, can be added to the mixture to make jams.\\r\\nA similar preparation, thickened with cornstarch or flour, is used as filling for rhubarb pie, tarts, and crumbles, leading to the nickname \\"pie plant\\", by which it is referred to in many 19th-century cookbooks,[18] as well as by American author Laura Ingalls Wilder in her short novel The First Four Years. The term \\"pie plant\\" is still used regionally in the U.S.[citation needed]\\r\\nIn recent times rhubarb has often been paired with strawberries to make strawberry-rhubarb pie, though some rhubarb purists jokingly consider this \\"a rather unhappy marriage\\".[18]\\r\\nIn former days, a common and affordable sweet for children in parts of the United Kingdom and Sweden was a tender stick of rhubarb, dipped in sugar. It is still eaten this way in western Finland, Norway, Iceland and Sweden, and also some other parts of the world. In Chile, Chilean rhubarb, which is only very distantly related, is sold on the street with salt or dried chili pepper, not sugar.\\r\\nRhubarb can be used to make a fruit wine or sima. It is also used to make compote.[19] Being a bit sour, it is very refreshing and can be drunk cold, especially during the summer.\\r\\nIn traditional Chinese medicine, rhubarb roots have been thought of as a laxative for several millennia.[20] Rhubarb also appears in medieval Arabic and European prescriptions.[21][22] It was one of the first Chinese medicines to be imported to the West from China.[23]\\r\\nThe roots and stems are rich in anthraquinones, such as emodin and rhein.[2] These substances are cathartic and laxative, explaining the sporadic use of rhubarb as a dieting aid. The anthraquinone compounds have been separated from powdered rhubarb root for medicinal purposes.[20]\\r\\nThe rhizomes contain stilbenoid compounds (including rhaponticin), which seem to lower blood glucose levels in diabetic mice.[24]\\r\\nRhubarb also contains the flavanol glucosides (+)-catechin-5-O-glucoside and (?)-catechin-7-O-glucoside.[25]\\r\\nRhubarb contains carbon-based quinone molecules which are capable of carrying an electrical charge. In 2014 a Harvard-based team of scientists published results[26] describing the use of the quinone AQDS, almost identical to a form found in rhubarb, in flow-batteries.[27]\\r\\nRhubarb leaves contain poisonous substances, including oxalic acid, which is a nephrotoxic and corrosive acid that is present in many plants. Humans have been poisoned after ingesting the leaves, a particular problem during World War I when the leaves were mistakenly recommended as a food source in Britain.[28][29][30] The toxic rhubarb leaves have been used in flavoring extracts, after the oxalic acid is removed by treatment with precipitated chalk. Oxalic acid can also be found in the stalks of rhubarb, but the levels are too low to cause any bodily harm.\\r\\nThe LD50 (median lethal dose) for pure oxalic acid in rats is about 375 mg/kg body weight,[31] or about 25 grams for a 65-kilogram (143?lb) human. Other sources give a much higher oral LDLo (lowest published lethal dose) of 600?mg/kg.[32] While the oxalic acid content of rhubarb leaves can vary, a typical value is about 0.5%,[33] so a rather unlikely 5?kg (for a 70?kg human) of the extremely sour leaves would have to be consumed to reach the LD50 of oxalic acid. Cooking the leaves with baking soda can make them more poisonous by producing soluble oxalates.[34] However, the leaves are believed to also contain an additional, unidentified toxin,[35] which might be an anthraquinone glycoside (also known as senna glycosides).[36]\\r\\nIn the petioles (stalks), the proportion of oxalic acid is much lower, only about 2ÿ2.5% of the total acidity, which consists mostly of malic acid.[37]\\r\\nThe rhubarb curculio, Lixus concavus, is a weevil. Rhubarb is a host, damage being visible mainly on the leaves and stalks, with gummosis, and oval or circular feeding and/or egg-laying sites.[38]\\r\\nHungry wildlife may dig up and eat rhubarb roots in the spring, as stored starches are turned to sugars for new foliage growth.","context":"What family is the rhubarb a part of?"},{"output":"The hypothalamus","context":"The hypothalamus (from Greek ??, \\"under\\" and Ĳ?ϫ?, thalamus) is a portion of the brain that contains a number of small nuclei with a variety of functions. One of the most important functions of the hypothalamus is to link the nervous system to the endocrine system via the pituitary gland (hypophysis).\\r\\nThe hypothalamus is located below the thalamus and is part of the limbic system.[1] In the terminology of neuroanatomy, it forms the ventral part of the diencephalon. All vertebrate brains contain a hypothalamus. In humans, it is the size of an almond.\\r\\nThe hypothalamus is responsible for the regulation of certain metabolic processes and other activities of the autonomic nervous system. It synthesizes and secretes certain neurohormones, called releasing hormones or hypothalamic hormones, and these in turn stimulate or inhibit the secretion of pituitary hormones. The hypothalamus controls body temperature, hunger, important aspects of parenting and attachment behaviours, thirst,[2] fatigue, sleep, and circadian rhythms.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe hypothalamus is a brain structure made up of distinct nuclei as well as less anatomically distinct areas. It is found in all vertebrate nervous systems. In mammals, magnocellular neurosecretory cells in the paraventricular nucleus and the supraoptic nucleus of the hypothalamus produce neurohypophysial hormones, oxytocin and vasopressin. These hormones are released into the blood in the posterior pituitary.[3] Much smaller parvocellular neurosecretory cells, neurons of the paraventricular nucleus, release corticotropin-releasing hormone and other hormones into the hypophyseal portal system, where these hormones diffuse to the anterior pituitary.\\r\\nThe hypothalamic nuclei include the following:[4][5][6]\\r\\nSee also: ventrolateral preoptic nucleus, periventricular nucleus.\\r\\nA cross section of the monkey hypothalamus displays 2 of the major hypothalamic nuclei on either side of the fluid-filled 3rd ventricle.\\r\\nHypothalamic nuclei\\r\\nHypothalamic nuclei on one side of the hypothalamus, shown in a 3-D computer reconstruction[10]\\r\\nThe hypothalamus is highly interconnected with other parts of the central nervous system, in particular the brainstem and its reticular formation. As part of the limbic system, it has connections to other limbic structures including the amygdala and septum, and is also connected with areas of the autonomous nervous system.\\r\\nThe hypothalamus receives many inputs from the brainstem, the most notable from the nucleus of the solitary tract, the locus coeruleus, and the ventrolateral medulla.\\r\\nMost nerve fibres within the hypothalamus run in two ways (bidirectional).\\r\\nSeveral hypothalamic nuclei are sexually dimorphic; i.e., there are clear differences in both structure and function between males and females.[citation needed]\\r\\nSome differences are apparent even in gross neuroanatomy: most notable is the sexually dimorphic nucleus within the preoptic area. However most of the differences are subtle changes in the connectivity and chemical sensitivity of particular sets of neurons.[citation needed]\\r\\nThe importance of these changes can be recognized by functional differences between males and females. For instance, males of most species prefer the odor and appearance of females over males, which is instrumental in stimulating male sexual behavior. If the sexually dimorphic nucleus is lesioned, this preference for females by males diminishes. Also, the pattern of secretion of growth hormone is sexually dimorphic, and this is one reason why in many species, adult males are much larger than females.[citation needed]\\r\\nOther striking functional dimorphisms are in the behavioral responses to ovarian steroids of the adult. Males and females respond to ovarian steroids in different ways, partly because the expression of estrogen-sensitive neurons in the hypothalamus is sexually dimorphic; i.e., estrogen receptors are expressed in different sets of neurons.[citation needed]\\r\\nEstrogen and progesterone can influence gene expression in particular neurons or induce changes in cell membrane potential and kinase activation, leading to diverse non-genomic cellular functions. Estrogen and progesterone bind to their cognate nuclear hormone receptors, which translocate to the cell nucleus and interact with regions of DNA known as hormone response elements (HREs) or get tethered to another transcription factor's binding site. Estrogen receptor (ER) has been shown to transactivate other transcription factors in this manner, despite the absence of an estrogen response element (ERE) in the proximal promoter region of the gene. In general, ERs and progesterone receptors (PRs) are gene activators, with increased mRNA and subsequent protein synthesis following hormone exposure.[citation needed]\\r\\nMale and female brains differ in the distribution of estrogen receptors, and this difference is an irreversible consequence of neonatal steroid exposure. Estrogen receptors (and progesterone receptors) are found mainly in neurons in the anterior and mediobasal hypothalamus, notably:[citation needed]\\r\\nIn neonatal life, gonadal steroids influence the development of the neuroendocrine hypothalamus. For instance, they determine the ability of females to exhibit a normal reproductive cycle, and of males and females to display appropriate reproductive behaviors in adult life.[citation needed]\\r\\nIn primates, the developmental influence of androgens is less clear, and the consequences are less understood. Within the brain, testosterone is aromatized to (estradiol), which is the principal active hormone for developmental influences. The human testis secretes high levels of testosterone from about week 8 of fetal life until 5ÿ6 months after birth (a similar perinatal surge in testosterone is observed in many species), a process that appears to underlie the male phenotype. Estrogen from the maternal circulation is relatively ineffective, partly because of the high circulating levels of steroid-binding proteins in pregnancy.[citation needed]\\r\\nSex steroids are not the only important influences upon hypothalamic development; in particular, pre-pubertal stress in early life (of rats) determines the capacity of the adult hypothalamus to respond to an acute stressor.[11] Unlike gonadal steroid receptors, glucocorticoid receptors are very widespread throughout the brain; in the paraventricular nucleus, they mediate negative feedback control of CRF synthesis and secretion, but elsewhere their role is not well understood.\\r\\nThe hypothalamus has a central neuroendocrine function, most notably by its control of the anterior pituitary, which in turn regulates various endocrine glands and organs. Releasing hormones (also called releasing factors) are produced in hypothalamic nuclei then transported along axons to either the median eminence or the posterior pituitary, where they are stored and released as needed.[12]\\r\\nIn the hypothalamicÿadenohypophyseal axis, releasing hormones, also known as hypophysiotropic or hypothalamic hormones, are released from the median eminence, a prolongation of the hypothalamus, into the hypophyseal portal system, which carries them to the anterior pituitary where they exert their regulatory functions on the secretion of adenohypophyseal hormones.[13] These hypophysiotropic hormones are stimulated by parvocellular neurosecretory cells located in the periventricular area of the hypothalamus. After their release into the capillaries of the third ventricle, the hypophysiotropic hormones travel through what is known as the hypothalamo-pituitary portal circulation. Once they reach their destination in the anterior pituitary, these hormones bind to specific receptors located on the surface of pituitary cells. Depending on which cells are activated through this binding, the pituitary will either begin secreting or stop secreting hormones into the rest of the bloodstream. (Bear, Mark F. \\"Hypothalamic Control of the Anterior Pituitary.\\" Neuroscience: Exploring the Brain. 4th ed. Philadelphia: Wolters Kluwer, 2016. 528. Print.)\\r\\nOther hormones secreted from the median eminence include vasopressin, oxytocin, and neurotensin.[15][16][17][18]\\r\\nIn the hypothalamic-neurohypophyseal axis, neurohypophysial hormones are released from the posterior pituitary, which is actually a prolongation of the hypothalamus, into the circulation.\\r\\nIt is also known that hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis (HPA) hormones are related to certain skin diseases and skin homeostasis. There is evidence linking hyperactivity of HPA hormones to stress-related skin diseases and skin tumors.[19]\\r\\nThe hypothalamus coordinates many hormonal and behavioural circadian rhythms, complex patterns of neuroendocrine outputs, complex homeostatic mechanisms, and important behaviours. The hypothalamus must, therefore, respond to many different signals, some of which generated externally and some internally. Delta wave signalling arising either in the thalamus or in the cortex influences the secretion of releasing hormones; GHRH and prolactin are stimulated whilst TRH is inhibited.\\r\\nThe hypothalamus is responsive to:\\r\\nOlfactory stimuli are important for sexual reproduction and neuroendocrine function in many species. For instance if a pregnant mouse is exposed to the urine of a 'strange' male during a critical period after coitus then the pregnancy fails (the Bruce effect). Thus, during coitus, a female mouse forms a precise 'olfactory memory' of her partner that persists for several days. Pheromonal cues aid synchronization of oestrus in many species; in women, synchronized menstruation may also arise from pheromonal cues, although the role of pheromones in humans is disputed.\\r\\nPeptide hormones have important influences upon the hypothalamus, and to do so they must pass through the bloodÿbrain barrier. The hypothalamus is bounded in part by specialized brain regions that lack an effective bloodÿbrain barrier; the capillary endothelium at these sites is fenestrated to allow free passage of even large proteins and other molecules. Some of these sites are the sites of neurosecretion - the neurohypophysis and the median eminence. However, others are sites at which the brain samples the composition of the blood. Two of these sites, the SFO (subfornical organ) and the OVLT (organum vasculosum of the lamina terminalis) are so-called circumventricular organs, where neurons are in intimate contact with both blood and CSF. These structures are densely vascularized, and contain osmoreceptive and sodium-receptive neurons that control drinking, vasopressin release, sodium excretion, and sodium appetite. They also contain neurons with receptors for angiotensin, atrial natriuretic factor, endothelin and relaxin, each of which important in the regulation of fluid and electrolyte balance. Neurons in the OVLT and SFO project to the supraoptic nucleus and paraventricular nucleus, and also to preoptic hypothalamic areas. The circumventricular organs may also be the site of action of interleukins to elicit both fever and ACTH secretion, via effects on paraventricular neurons.[citation needed]\\r\\nIt is not clear how all peptides that influence hypothalamic activity gain the necessary access. In the case of prolactin and leptin, there is evidence of active uptake at the choroid plexus from the blood into the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). Some pituitary hormones have a negative feedback influence upon hypothalamic secretion; for example, growth hormone feeds back on the hypothalamus, but how it enters the brain is not clear. There is also evidence for central actions of prolactin.[citation needed]\\r\\nFindings have suggested that thyroid hormone (T4) is taken up by the hypothalamic glial cells in the infundibular nucleus/ median eminence, and that it is here converted into T3 by the type 2 deiodinase (D2). Subsequent to this, T3 is transported into the thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH)-producing neurons in the paraventricular nucleus. Thyroid hormone receptors have been found in these neurons, indicating that they are indeed sensitive to T3 stimuli. In addition, these neurons expressed MCT8, a thyroid hormone transporter, supporting the theory that T3 is transported into them. T3 could then bind to the thyroid hormone receptor in these neurons and affect the production of thyrotropin-releasing hormone, thereby regulating thyroid hormone production.[20]\\r\\nThe hypothalamus functions as a type of thermostat for the body.[21] It sets a desired body temperature, and stimulates either heat production and retention to raise the blood temperature to a higher setting or sweating and vasodilation to cool the blood to a lower temperature. All fevers result from a raised setting in the hypothalamus; elevated body temperatures due to any other cause are classified as hyperthermia.[21] Rarely, direct damage to the hypothalamus, such as from a stroke, will cause a fever; this is sometimes called a hypothalamic fever. However, it is more common for such damage to cause abnormally low body temperatures.[21]\\r\\nThe hypothalamus contains neurons that react strongly to steroids and glucocorticoids ÿ (the steroid hormones of the adrenal gland, released in response to ACTH). It also contains specialized glucose-sensitive neurons (in the arcuate nucleus and ventromedial hypothalamus), which are important for appetite. The preoptic area contains thermosensitive neurons; these are important for TRH secretion.\\r\\nOxytocin secretion in response to suckling or vagino-cervical stimulation is mediated by some of these pathways; vasopressin secretion in response to cardiovascular stimuli arising from chemoreceptors in the carotid body and aortic arch, and from low-pressure atrial volume receptors, is mediated by others. In the rat, stimulation of the vagina also causes prolactin secretion, and this results in pseudo-pregnancy following an infertile mating. In the rabbit, coitus elicits reflex ovulation. In the sheep, cervical stimulation in the presence of high levels of estrogen can induce maternal behavior in a virgin ewe. These effects are all mediated by the hypothalamus, and the information is carried mainly by spinal pathways that relay in the brainstem. Stimulation of the nipples stimulates release of oxytocin and prolactin and suppresses the release of LH and FSH.\\r\\nCardiovascular stimuli are carried by the vagus nerve. The vagus also conveys a variety of visceral information, including for instance signals arising from gastric distension or emptying, to suppress or promote feeding, by signalling the release of leptin or gastrin, respectively. Again this information reaches the hypothalamus via relays in the brainstem.\\r\\nIn addition hypothalamic function is responsive toand regulated bylevels of all three classical monoamine neurotransmitters, noradrenaline, dopamine, and serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine), in those tracts from which it receives innervation. For example, noradrenergic inputs arising from the locus coeruleus have important regulatory effects upon corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) levels.\\r\\nThe extreme lateral part of the ventromedial nucleus of the hypothalamus is responsible for the control of food intake. Stimulation of this area causes increased food intake. Bilateral lesion of this area causes complete cessation of food intake. Medial parts of the nucleus have a controlling effect on the lateral part. Bilateral lesion of the medial part of the ventromedial nucleus causes hyperphagia and obesity of the animal. Further lesion of the lateral part of the ventromedial nucleus in the same animal produces complete cessation of food intake.\\r\\nThere are different hypotheses related to this regulation:[23]\\r\\nThe medial zone of hypothalamus is part of a circuitry that controls motivated behaviors, like defensive behaviors.[24] Analyses of Fos-labeling showed that a series of nuclei in the \\"behavioral control column\\" is important in regulating the expression of innate and conditioned defensive behaviors.[25]\\r\\nExposure to a predator (such as a cat) elicits defensive behaviors in laboratory rodents, even when the animal has never been exposed to a cat.[26] In the hypothalamus, this exposure causes an increase in Fos-labeled cells in the anterior hypothalamic nucleus, the dorsomedial part of the ventromedial nucleus, and in the ventrolateral part of the premammillary nucleus (PMDvl).[27] The premammillary nucleus has an important role in expression of defensive behaviors towards a predator, since lesions in this nucleus abolish defensive behaviors, like freezing and flight.[27][28] The PMD does not modulate defensive behavior in other situations, as lesions of this nucleus had minimal effects on post-shock freezing scores.[28] The PMD has important connections to the dorsal periaqueductal gray, an important structure in fear expression.[29][30] In addition, animals display risk assessment behaviors to the environment previously associated with the cat. Fos-labeled cell analysis showed that the PMDvl is the most activated structure in the hypothalamus, and inactivation with muscimol prior to exposure to the context abolishes the defensive behavior.[27] Therefore, the hypothalamus, mainly the PMDvl, has an important role in expression of innate and conditioned defensive behaviors to a predator.\\r\\nLikewise, the hypothalamus has a role in social defeat: Nuclei in medial zone are also mobilized during an encounter with an aggressive conspecific. The defeated animal has an increase in Fos levels in sexually dimorphic structures, such as the medial pre-optic nucleus, the ventrolateral part of ventromedial nucleus, and the ventral premammilary nucleus.[31] Such structures are important in other social behaviors, such as sexual and aggressive behaviors. Moreover, the premammillary nucleus also is mobilized, the dorsomedial part but not the ventrolateral part.[31] Lesions in this nucleus abolish passive defensive behavior, like freezing and the \\"on-the-back\\" posture.[31]\\r\\nAccording to D. F. Swaab, writing in a July 2008 paper, \\"Neurobiological research related to sexual orientation in humans is only just gathering momentum, but the evidence already shows that humans have a vast array of brain differences, not only in relation to gender, but also in relation to sexual orientation.\\"[32]\\r\\nSwaab first reported on the relationship between sexual orientation in males and the hypothalamus's \\"clock\\", the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN). In 1990, Swaab and Hofman[33] reported that the suprachiasmatic nucleus in homosexual men was significantly larger than in heterosexual men. Then in 1995, Swaab et al.[34] linked brain development to sexual orientation by treating male rats both pre- and postnatally with ATD, an aromatase blocker in the brain. This produced an enlarged SCN and bisexual behavior in the adult male rats. In 1991, LeVay showed that part of the sexually dimorphic nucleus (SDN) known as the 3rd interstitial nucleus of the anterior hypothalamus (INAH 3), is nearly twice as large (in terms of volume) in heterosexual men than in homosexual men and heterosexual women. However, a study in 1992 has shown that the sexually dimorph nucleus of the preoptic area, which include the INAH3, are of similar size in homosexual males who died of AIDS to heterosexual males, and therefore larger than female. This clearly contradicts the hypothesis that homosexual males have a female hypothalamus. Furthermore, the SCN of homosexual males is extremely large (both the volume and the number of neurons are twice as many as in heterosexual males). These areas of the hypothalamus have not yet been explored in homosexual females nor bisexual males nor females. Although the functional implications of such findings still haven't been examined in detail, they cast serious doubt over the widely accepted D?rner hypothesis that homosexual males have a \\"female hypothalamus\\" and that the key mechanism of differentiating the \\"male brain from originally female brain\\" is the epigenetic influence of testosterone during prenatal development.[35][36]\\r\\nIn 2004 and 2006, two studies by Berglund, Lindstr?m, and Savic[37][38] used positron emission tomography (PET) to observe how the hypothalamus responds to smelling common odors, the scent of testosterone found in male sweat, and the scent of estrogen found in female urine. These studies showed that the hypothalamus of heterosexual men and homosexual women both respond to estrogen. Also, the hypothalamus of homosexual men and heterosexual women both respond to testosterone. The hypothalamus of all four groups did not respond to the common odors, which produced a normal olfactory response in the brain.\\r\\nHuman brain left dissected midsagittal view\\r\\nLocation of the hypothalamus\\r\\nBear, Mark F. \\"Hypothalamic Control of the Anterior Pituitary.\\" Neuroscience: Exploring the Brain. 4th ed.

Italian is by most measures, together with the Sardinian language, the closest tongue to Vulgar Latin of the Romance languages.[11] Italian is an official language in Italy, Switzerland, San Marino, Vatican City and western Istria (in Slovenia and Croatia). It used to have official status in Albania, Malta and Monaco, where it is still widely spoken, as well as in former Italian East Africa and Italian North Africa regions where it plays a significant role in various sectors. Italian is also spoken by large expatriate communities in the Americas and Australia.[12] It has official minority status in Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia, Slovenia and Romania.[13] Many speakers are native bilinguals of both standardized Italian and other regional languages.[14]\\r\\nItalian is a major European language, being one of the official languages of the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe and one of the working languages of the Council of Europe. It is the third most widely spoken first language in the European Union with 69 million native speakers (13% of the EU population) and it is spoken as a second language by 16 million EU citizens (3%).[1] Including Italian speakers in non-EU European countries (such as Switzerland and Albania) and on other continents, the total number of speakers is around 90 million.[15] Italian is the main working language of the Holy See, serving as the lingua franca (common language) in the Roman Catholic hierarchy as well as the official language of the Sovereign Military Order of Malta. Italian is known as the language of music because of its use in musical terminology and opera. Its influence is also widespread in the arts and in the luxury goods market. Italian has been reported as the fourth or fifth most frequently taught foreign language in the world.[16][17]\\r\\nItalian was adopted by the state after the Unification of Italy, having previously been a literary language based on Tuscan as spoken mostly by the upper class of Florentine society.[18] Its development was also influenced by other Italian languages and to some minor extent, by the Germanic languages of the post-Roman invaders. The incorporation into Italian of learned, or \\"bookish\\" words from its own ancestor language, Latin, is arguably another form of lexical borrowing through the influence of written language and the liturgical language of the Church. Throughout the Middle Ages and into the early modern period, most literate Italian speakers were also literate in Latin; and thus they easily adopted Latin words into their writingand eventually speechin Italian. Its vowels are the second-closest to Latin after Sardinian.[19][20] Unlike most other Romance languages, Italian retains Latin's contrast between short and long consonants.[21] As in most Romance languages, stress is distinctive.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nDuring the Middle Ages, the established written language in Europe was Latin. With the great majority of people being illiterate, however, only a handful were well versed in the language. In the Italian peninsula, as in most of Europe, the majority would instead speak a local vernacular. These dialects (as they are commonly referred to as) were born to Vulgar Latin over the course of centuries, evolving naturally unaffected by formal standards and teachings, and are not truly \\"dialects\\" of Standard Italian, that itself started off being one of these local tongues. Since they often provide poor mutual intelligibility with standard Italian, they are better classified as distinct languages.[22]:13\\r\\nThe standard Italian language has a poetic and literary origin in the writings of Tuscan writers of the 12th century, and, even though the grammar and core lexicon are basically unchanged from those used in Florence in the 13th century,[23] the modern standard of the language was largely shaped by relatively recent events. However, Italian as a language spoken in the Appenine peninsula has a longer history. In fact, the earliest surviving texts that can definitely be called Italian (or more accurately, vernacular, as distinct from its predecessor Vulgar Latin) are legal formulae known as the Placiti Cassinesi from the Province of Benevento that date from 960ÿ963, although the Veronese Riddle, probably from the 8th or early 9th century, contains a late form of Vulgar Latin that can be seen as a very early sample of an Italian dialect.[24]\\r\\nThe language which came to be thought of as Italian was first formalized in the early 14th century through the works of Tuscan writer Dante Alighieri, written in his native Florentine. Dante's epic poems, known collectively as the Commedia, to which another Tuscan poet Giovanni Boccaccio later affixed the title Divina, were read throughout the peninsula and his written dialect became the \\"canonical standard\\" that all educated Italians could understand. Dante is still credited with standardizing the Italian language. In addition to the widespread exposure gained through literature, the Florentine dialect also gained prestige due to the political and cultural significance of Florence at the time and the fact that it was linguistically an intermediate between the northern and the southern Italian dialects.[22]:22 Thus the dialect of Florence became the basis for what would become the official language of Italy.\\r\\nItalian was progressively made an official language of most of the Italian states predating unification, slowly replacing Latin, even when ruled by foreign powers (like Spain in the Kingdom of Naples, or Austria in the Kingdom of Lombardy-Venetia), even though the masses kept speaking primarily vernacular languages and dialects. Italian was also one of the many recognised languages in the Austro-Hungarian Empire.\\r\\nItaly has always had a distinctive dialect for each city because the cities, until recently, were thought of as city-states. Those dialects now have considerable variety. As Tuscan-derived Italian came to be used throughout Italy, features of local speech were naturally adopted, producing various versions of Regional Italian. The most characteristic differences, for instance, between Roman Italian and Milanese Italian are the gemination of initial consonants and the pronunciation of stressed \\"e\\", and of \\"s\\" in some cases: e.g. va bene \\"all right\\": is pronounced [va ?b??ne] by a Roman (and by any standard-speaker), [va ?bene] by a Milanese (and by any speaker whose native dialect lies to the north of the La SpeziaÿRimini Line); a casa \\"at home\\" is [a ?k?asa] for Roman and standard, [a ?kaza] for Milanese and generally northern.\\r\\nIn contrast to the Gallo-Italic linguistic panorama of northern Italy, the Italo-Dalmatian Neapolitan and its related dialects were largely unaffected by the Franco-Occitan influences introduced to Italy mainly by bards from France during the Middle Ages, but after the Norman conquest of southern Italy, Sicily became the first Italian land to adopt Occitan lyric moods (and words) in poetry. Even in the case of Northern Italian languages, however, scholars are careful not to overstate the effects of outsiders on the natural indigenous developments of the languages.\\r\\nThe economic might and relatively advanced development of Tuscany at the time (Late Middle Ages) gave its language weight, though Venetian remained widespread in medieval Italian commercial life, and Ligurian (or Genoese) remained in use in maritime trade alongside the Mediterranean. The increasing political and cultural relevance of Florence during the periods of the rise of the Banco Medici, Humanism, and the Renaissance made its dialect, or rather a refined version of it, a standard in the arts.\\r\\nThe Renaissance era, known as il Rinascimento in Italian, was seen as a time of \\"rebirth\\", which is the literal meaning of both renaissance (from French) and rinascimento (Italian).\\r\\nDuring this time, long-existing beliefs stemming from the teachings of the Roman Catholic Church began to be understood from new a perspectives as humanistsindividuals who placed emphasis on the human body and its full potentialbegan to shift focus from the church to human beings themselves.[25] Humanists began forming new beliefs in various forms: social, political, and intellectual. The ideals of the Renaissance were evident throughout the Protestant Reformation, which took place simultaneously with the Renaissance. The Protestant Reformation began with Martin Luther's rejection of the selling of indulgences by Johann Tetzel and other authorities within the Roman Catholic Church, resulting in Luther's eventual break-off from the Roman Catholic Church in the Diet of Worms. After Luther was excommunicated from the Roman Catholic Church, he founded what was then understood to be a sect of Catholicism, later referred to as Lutheranism.[25] Luther's preaching in favor of faith and scripture rather than tradition led him to translate the Bible into many other languages, which would allow for people from all over Europe to read the Bible. Previously, the Bible was only written in Latin, but after the Bible was translated, it could be understood in many other languages, including Italian. The Italian language was able to spread even more with the help of Luther and the invention of the printing press by Johannes Gutenberg. The printing press facilitated the spread of Italian because it was able to rapidly produce texts, such as the Bible, and cut the costs of books which allowed for more people to have access to the translated Bible and new pieces of literature.[26] The Roman Catholic Church was losing its control over the population, as it was not open to change, and there was an increasing number of reformers with differing beliefs.[27]\\r\\nItalian became the language used in the courts of every state in the Italian peninsula. The rediscovery of Dante's De vulgari eloquentia and a renewed interest in linguistics in the 16th century, sparked a debate that raged throughout Italy concerning the criteria that should govern the establishment of a modern Italian literary and spoken language. This discussion, known as \\"questione della lingua\\" (i. e., the problem of the language), ran through the Italian culture until the end of the 19th century, often linked to the political debate on achieving a united Italian state. Renaissance scholars divided into three main factions:\\r\\nA fourth faction claimed the best Italian was the one that the papal court adopted, which was a mix of Florentine and the dialect of Rome. Eventually, Bembo's ideas prevailed, and the foundation of the Accademia della Crusca in Florence (1582ÿ1583), the official legislative body of the Italian language led to publication of Agnolo Monosini's Latin tome Floris italicae linguae libri novem in 1604 followed by the first Italian dictionary in 1612.\\r\\nThe continual advancements in technology plays a crucial role in the diffusion of languages. After the invention of the printing press in the fifteen century, the number of printing presses in Italy grew rapidly and by the year 1500 reached a total of 56, the biggest number of printing presses in all of Europe. This allowed to produce more pieces of literature at a lower cost and as the dominant language, Italian spread.[28]\\r\\nAn important event that helped the diffusion of Italian was the conquest and occupation of Italy by Napoleon in the early 19th century (who was himself of Italian-Corsican descent). This conquest propelled the unification of Italy some decades after and pushed the Italian language into a lingua franca used not only among clerks, nobility, and functionaries in the Italian courts but also by the bourgeoisie.\\r\\nItalian literature's first modern novel, I Promessi Sposi (The Betrothed), by Alessandro Manzoni, further defined the standard by \\"rinsing\\" his Milanese \\"in the waters of the Arno\\" (Florence's river), as he states in the Preface to his 1840 edition.\\r\\nAfter unification, a huge number of civil servants and soldiers recruited from all over the country introduced many more words and idioms from their home languages (\\"ciao\\" is derived from Venetian word \\"s-cia[v]o\\" (slave), \\"panettone\\" comes from Lombard word \\"panetton\\" etc.). Only 2.5% of Italy's population could speak the Italian standardized language properly when the nation was unified in 1861.[29]\\r\\nItalian is a Romance language, and is therefore a descendant of Vulgar Latin (the spoken form of non-classical Latin).[note 1] Standard Italian is based on Tuscan, especially its Florentine dialect, and is therefore an Italo-Dalmatian language, to which Sicilian and the extinct Dalmatian also belong, among a few others.\\r\\nUnlike most other Romance languages, Italian retains Latin's contrast between short and long consonants. As in most Romance languages, stress is distinctive. In particular, among the Romance languages, Italian is the closest to Latin in terms of vocabulary.[31] Lexical similarity is 89% with French, 87% with Catalan, 85% with Sardinian, 82% with Spanish, 78% with Ladin, and 77% with Romanian.[12][32][33]\\r\\nOne study analyzing the degree of differentiation of Romance languages in comparison to Latin (comparing phonology, inflection, discourse, syntax, vocabulary, and intonation) estimated that among the languages analyzed the distance between Italian and Latin is only higher than that between Sardinian and Latin.[34]\\r\\nItalian is an official language of Italy and San Marino and is spoken fluently by the majority of the countries' populations. Italian is official, together with French, German and Romansch in Switzerland, with most of the 0.5 million speakers concentrated in the south of the country, in the cantons of Ticino and southern Graubnden (predominately in Italian Grigioni). Italian is the third most spoken language in Switzerland (after German and French), and its use has modestly declined since the 1970s.[35] Italian is also used in administration and official documents in Vatican City.[36]\\r\\nItalian is widely spoken in Malta, where nearly two-thirds of the population can speak it fluently.[37] Italian served as Malta's official language until 1934, when it was abolished by the British colonial administration amid strong local opposition.[38] Italian is also recognized as an official language in Istria County, Croatia, and Slovenian Istria, where there are significant and historic Italian populations.[39][40][41]\\r\\nIt is used as the official language of the Sovereign Military Order of Malta, a Roman Catholic chivalric order which, while not a nation per se, is still recognized as a sovereign subject of international law.\\r\\nIn Albania, it is one of the most spoken languages. This is due to the strong historical ties between Italy and Albania but also the Albanian communities in Italy, and the 19,000 Italians living in Albania.[42] It is reported as high as 70% of the Albanian adult population has some form of knowledge of Italian. Furthermore, the Albanian government has pushed to make Italian a compulsory second language in schools.[43] Today, Italian is the third most spoken language in the country after Albanian and Greek.\\r\\nItalian is also spoken by a minority in Monaco and France (especially in the southeast region of the country).[44][45]\\r\\nDue to heavy Italian influence during the Italian colonial period, Italian is still understood by some in former colonies.[12] Although it was the primary language in Libya since colonial rule, Italian greatly declined under the rule of Muammar Gaddafi, who expelled the Italian Libyan population and made Arabic the sole official language of the country.[46] Nevertheless, Italian continues to be used in economic sectors in Libya. In Eritrea, Italian is at times used in commerce and the capital city Asmara still has one Italian-language school.[47] Italian was also introduced to Somalia through colonialism and was the sole official language of administration and education during the colonial period but fell out of use after government, educational and economic infrastructure were destroyed in the Somali Civil War. Italian is still understood by some elderly and other people. The official languages of the Somali Republic are Somali (Maay and Maxaatiri) and Arabic. The working languages during the Transitional Federal Government were Italian and English.[48]\\r\\nAlthough over 17 million Americans are of Italian descent, only a little over one million people in the United States speak Italian at home.[49] Nevertheless, an Italian language media market does exist in the country.[50] On the other hand, although technology allows for the Italian language to spread globally, there has been a decrease in the number of Italian speakers in the United States. According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the number of Italian speakers in 1980 was 1,614,344. In 1990, the number of Italian speakers in the United States dropped to 1,308,648. In 2000, the number of speakers decreased to 1,008,370, and finally, in 2010, the number of Italian speakers plummeted to 725,223. The percent change from 1980ÿ2010 was a negative 55.2.[51]\\r\\nIn Canada, Italian is the second most spoken non-official language when varieties of Chinese are not grouped together, with over 660,000 speakers (or about 2.1% of the population) according to the 2006 Census.[52]\\r\\nIn Australia, Italian is the second most spoken foreign language after Chinese, with 1.4% of the population speaking it as their home language.[53]\\r\\nItalian immigrants to South America have also brought a presence of the language to that continent. Italian is the second most spoken language in Argentina[54] after the official language of Spanish, with over 1 million (mainly of the older generation) speaking it at home, and Italian has also influenced the dialect of Spanish spoken in Argentina and Uruguay, mostly in phonology, as well as the Portuguese prosody of the Brazilian state of S?o Paulo which itself has 15 million Italian descendants. This form of Spanish is known as Rioplatense Spanish.[55] Italian bilingual speakers can be found in the Southeast of Brazil as well as in the South. In Venezuela, Italian is the second most spoken language after Spanish, with around 200,000 speakers.[56] Smaller Italian-speaking minorities on the continent are also found in Paraguay and Ecuador.\\r\\nIn Costa Rica, Central America, Italian is one of the most important immigration community languages, after English. It is spoken in the southern area of the country in cities like San Vito and other communities of Coto Brus, near the south borderline with Panama.[57]\\r\\n[58]\\r\\nItalian is widely taught in many schools around the world, but rarely as the first foreign language. Italian is the fourth[16][59] most frequently taught foreign language in the world.[60] In the 21st century, technology also allows for the continual spread of the Italian language, as people have new ways for one to learn how to speak, read, and write languages at their own pace and at any given time. For example, the free website and application Duolingo has 28.1 million English speakers learning the Italian language.[61]\\r\\nAccording to the Italian Ministry of Foreign Affairs, every year there are more than 200,000 foreign students who study the Italian language; they are distributed among the 90 Institutes of Italian Culture that are located around the world, in the 179 Italian schools located abroad, or in the 111 Italian lecturer sections belonging to foreign schools where Italian is taught as a language of culture.[62]\\r\\nIn the United States, Italian is the fourth most taught foreign language after Spanish, French, and German, in that order (or the fifth if American Sign Language is considered).[63] In central-east Europe Italian is first in Montenegro, second in Austria, Croatia, Slovenia, and Ukraine after English, and third in Hungary, Romania and Russia after English and German.[62] But throughout the world, Italian is the fifth most taught foreign language, after English, French, German, and Spanish.[64]\\r\\nIn the European Union statistics, Italian is spoken as a native language by 13% of the EU population, or 65 million people,[1] mainly in Italy. In the EU, it is spoken as a second language by 3% of the EU population, or 14 million people. Among EU states, the percentage of people able to speak Italian well enough to have a conversation is 66% in Malta, 15% in Slovenia, 14% in Croatia, 8% in Austria, 5% in France and Luxembourg, and 4% in the former West Germany, Greece, Cyprus, and Romania.[65] Italian is also one of the national languages of Switzerland, which is not a part of the European Union.[66] The Italian language is well-known and studied in Albania,[67] another non-EU member, due to its historical ties and geographical proximity to Italy and to the diffusion of Italian television in the country.[68]\\r\\nFrom the late nineteenth to the mid-twentieth century, thousands of Italians settled in Argentina, Uruguay, southern Brazil, and Venezuela, where they formed a physical and cultural presence.\\r\\nIn some cases, colonies were established where variants of regional languages of Italy were used, and some continue to use this regional language. Examples are Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil, where Talian is used, and the town of Chipilo near Puebla, Mexico; each continues to use a derived form of Venetian dating back to the nineteenth century. Another example is Cocoliche, an ItalianÿSpanish pidgin once spoken in Argentina and especially in Buenos Aires, and Lunfardo.\\r\\nRioplatense Spanish, and particularly the speech of the city of Buenos Aires, has intonation patterns that resemble those of Italian languages because Argentina has had a continuous large influx of Italian settlers since the second half of the nineteenth century: initially primarily from northern Italy; then, since the beginning of the twentieth century, mostly from southern Italy.\\r\\nStarting in late medieval times in much of Europe and the Mediterranean, Latin was replaced as the primary commercial language by Italian language variants (especially Tuscan and Venetian). These variants were consolidated during the Renaissance with the strength of Italy and the rise of humanism and the arts.\\r\\nDuring that period, Italy held artistic sway over the rest of Europe. It was the norm for all educated gentlemen to make the Grand Tour, visiting Italy to see its great historical monuments and works of art. It thus became expected to learn at least some Italian. In England, while the classical languages Latin and Greek were the first to be learned, Italian became the second most common modern language after French, a position it held until the late eighteenth century when it tended to be replaced by German. John Milton, for instance, wrote some of his early poetry in Italian.\\r\\nWithin the Catholic church, Italian is known by a large part of the ecclesiastical hierarchy and is used in substitution for Latin in some official documents.\\r\\nItalian loanwords continue to be used in most languages in matters of art and music (especially opera), in the design and fashion industries, in some sports like football[69] and especially, in culinary terms.\\r\\nThroughout Italy, regional variations of Standard Italian, called Regional Italian, are spoken. In Italy, almost all Romance languages are spoken as the vernacularother than standard Italian and distantly-related, non-Romance languages spoken in border regions or among immigrant communitiesare often imprecisely called \\"Italian dialects\\",[70] even though they are quite different, with some belonging to different branches of the Romance language family. The only exceptions to this are Sardinian, Ladin and Friulian, which are officially recognized as distinct minority languages by the law. On the other hand, Corsican (a language spoken on the French island of Corsica) is closely related to Tuscan, from which Standard Italian derives and evolved.\\r\\nThe differences in the evolution of Latin in the different regions of Italy can be attributed to the presence of three other types of languages: substrata, superstrata, and adstrata. The most prevalent were substrata (the language of the original inhabitants), as the Italian dialects were most likely simply Latin as spoken by native cultural groups. Superstrata and adstrata were both less important. Foreign conquerors of Italy that dominated different regions at different times left behind little to no influence on the dialects. Foreign cultures with which Italy engaged in peaceful relations with, such as trade, had no significant influence either.[22]:19-20\\r\\nRegional differences can be recognized by various factors: the openness of vowels, the length of the consonants, and influence of the local language (for example, in informal situations the contraction ann replaces andare in the area of Rome for the infinitive \\"to go\\"; and nare is what Venetians say for the infinitive \\"to go\\").\\r\\nThere is no definitive date when the various Italian variants of Latinincluding varieties that contributed to modern Standard Italianbegan to be distinct enough from Latin to be considered separate languages. From a linguistic perspective, two language variants are considered separate languages (rather than variant dialects of a single language) when they are no longer mutually intelligible. For the Italian Romance languages, the first extant written evidence of varieties that can be considered no longer to be Latin comes from the ninth and tenth centuries C.E. These written sources demonstrate certain vernacular characteristics and sometimes explicitly mention the use of the vernacular in Italy. Full literary manifestations of the vernacular began to surface around the 13th century in the form of various religious texts and poetry.[22]:21Although these are the first written records of Italian varieties separate from Latin, the spoken language had likely diverged long before the first written records appear, since those who were literate generally wrote in Latin even if they spoke other Romance varieties in person.\\r\\nThroughout the 19th and 20th centuries, the use of Standard Italian became increasingly widespread and was mirrored by a decline in the use of the dialects. An increase in literacy was one of the main driving factors (one can assume that only literates were capable of learning Standard Italian, whereas those who were illiterate had access only to their native dialect). The percentage of literates rose from 25% in 1861 to 60% in 1911, and then on to 78.1% in 1951. Tullio De Mauro, an Italian linguist, has asserted that in 1861 only 2.5% of the population of Italy could speak Standard Italian. He reports that in 1951 that percentage had risen to 87%. The ability to speak Italian did not necessarily mean it was in everyday use, and most people (63.5%) still usually spoke their native dialects. In addition, other factors such as mass emigration, industrialization, and urbanization, and internal migrations after World War II contributed to the proliferation of Standard Italian. The Italians who emigrated during the Italian diaspora beginning in 1861 were often of the uneducated lower class, and thus the emigration had the effect of increasing the percentage of literates, who often knew and understood the importance of Standard Italian, back home in Italy. A large percentage of those who had emigrated also eventually returned to Italy, often more educated than when they had left.[22]:35\\r\\nThe Italian dialects have declined in the modern era, as Italy unified under Standard Italian and continues to do so aided by mass media, from newspapers to radio to television.[22]:37\\r\\nNotes:\\r\\nItalian has a seven-vowel system, consisting of /a, ?, e, i, ?, o, u/, as well as 23 consonants. Compared with most other Romance languages, Italian phonology is conservative, preserving many words nearly unchanged from Vulgar Latin. Some examples:\\r\\nThe conservativeness of Italian phonology is partly explained by its origin. Italian stems from a literary language that is derived from the 13th-century speech of the city of Florence in the region of Tuscany, and has changed little in the last 700 years or so. Furthermore, the Tuscan dialect is the most conservative of all Italian dialects, radically different from the Gallo-Italian languages less than 100 miles to the north (across the La SpeziaÿRimini Line).\\r\\nThe following are some of the conservative phonological features of Italian, as compared with the common Western Romance languages (French, Spanish, Portuguese, Galician, Catalan). Some of these features are also present in Romanian.\\r\\nCompared with most other Romance languages, Italian has a large number of inconsistent outcomes, where the same underlying sound produces different results in different words, e.g. laxre > lasciare and lassare, captire > cacciare and cazzare, (ex)droteolre > sdrucciolare, druzzolare and ruzzolare, rgؐna > regina and reina, -c- > /k/ and //, -t- > /t/ and /d/. Although in all these examples the second form has fallen out of usage, the dimorphism is thought to reflect the several-hundred-year period during which Italian developed as a literary language divorced from any native-speaking population, with an origin in 12th/13th-century Tuscan but with many words borrowed from languages farther to the north, with different sound outcomes. (The La SpeziaÿRimini Line, the most important isogloss in the entire Romance-language area, passes only about 20 miles to the north of Florence.)\\r\\nSome other features that distinguish Italian from the Western Romance languages:\\r\\nStandard Italian also differs in some respects from most nearby Italian languages:\\r\\nItalian phonotactics do not usually permit verbs and polysyllabic nouns to end with consonants, excepting poetry and song, so foreign words may receive extra terminal vowel sounds.\\r\\nThe Italian alphabet is typically considered to consist of 21 letters. The letters j, k, w, x, y are traditionally excluded, though they appear in loanwords such as jeans, whisky, taxi, xenofobo, xilofono. The letter ?x? has become common in standard Italian with the prefix extra-, although (e)stra- is traditionally used; it is also common to use of the Latin particle ex(-) to mean \\"former(ly)\\" as in: la mia ex (\\"my ex-girlfriend\\"), \\"Ex-Jugoslavia\\" (\\"Former Yugoslavia\\"). The letter ?j? appears in the first name Jacopo and in some Italian place-names, such as Bajardo, Bojano, Joppolo, Jerzu, Jesolo, Jesi, Ajaccio, among others, and in Mar Jonio, an alternative spelling of Mar Ionio (the Ionian Sea). The letter ?j? may appear in dialectal words, but its use is discouraged in contemporary standard Italian.[78] Letters used in Foreign words can be replaced with phonetically equivalent native Italian letters and digraphs: ?gi?, ?ge?, or ?i? for ?j?; ?c? or ?ch? for ?k? (including in the standard prefix kilo-); ?o?, ?u? or ?v? for ?w?; ?s?, ?ss?, ?z?, ?zz? or ?cs? for ?x?; and ?e? or ?i? for ?y?.\\r\\nItalian has geminate, or double, consonants, which are distinguished by length and intensity. Length is distinctive for all consonants except for /?/, /dz/, /?/, /?/, which are always geminate, and /z/, which is always single. Geminate plosives and affricates are realized as lengthened closures. Geminate fricatives, nasals, and /l/ are realized as lengthened continuants. There is only one vibrant phoneme /r/ but the actual pronunciation depends on context and regional accent. Generally one can find a flap consonant [?] in unstressed position whereas [r] is more common in stressed syllables, but there may be exceptions. Especially people from the Northern part of Italy (Parma, Aosta Valley, South Tyrol) may pronounce /r/ as [?], [?], or [?].[79]\\r\\nOf special interest to the linguistic study of Italian is the gorgia toscana, or \\"Tuscan Throat\\", the weakening or lenition of certain intervocalic consonants in the Tuscan language.\\r\\nThe voiced postalveolar fricative /?/ is only present in loanwords: for example, garage [a?ra??].\\r\\nItalian grammar is typical of the grammar of Romance languages in general. Cases exist for personal pronouns (nominative, oblique, accusative, dative), but not for nouns.\\r\\nThere are two genders (masculine and feminine). Masculine nouns end in -o, which changes to -i in the plural, and feminine nouns ends in -a, which changes to -e in the plural. With few exceptions, masculine nouns refer to male people or animals, and feminine nouns refer to female people or animals. A last class of nouns end in -e in the singular and -i in the plural, and are arbitrarily assigned masculine or feminine. These nouns often denote inanimate objects. This is fixed by the grammar of Italian, and a dictionary would need to be consulted to figure out the gender.[80] There is a number of nouns that change their gender from the singular to plural, having a masculine singular and a feminine plural, and thus are sometimes considered neuter (those are derived from neuter Latin nouns). An instance of neuter gender also exists in pronouns of the third person singular.\\r\\nExamples:[81]\\r\\nNouns, adjectives, and articles inflect for gender and number (singular and plural).\\r\\nLike in English, common nouns are capitalized when occurring at the beginning of a sentence. Unlike English, nouns referring to languages (e.g. Italian), speakers of languages, or inhabitants of an area (e.g. Italians) are not capitalized.[80]\\r\\nThere are three types of adjectives: descriptive, invariable and form-changing. Descriptive adjectives are the most common, and their endings change to match the number and gender of the noun they modify. Invariable adjectives are adjectives whose endings do not change. The form changing adjectives \\"buono (good), bello (beautiful), grande (big), and santo (saint)\\" change in form when placed before different types of nouns. Italian has three degrees for comparison of adjectives: positive, comparative, and superlative.[80]\\r\\nThe order of words in the phrase is relatively free compared to most European languages.[78] The position of the verb in the phrase is highly mobile. Word order often has a lesser grammatical function in Italian than in English. Adjectives are sometimes placed before their noun and sometimes after. Subject nouns generally come before the verb. Italian is a null-subject language, so that nominative pronouns are usually absent, with subject indicated by verbal inflections (e.g. amo 'I love', ama 's/he loves', amano 'they love'). Noun objects normally come after the verb, as do pronoun objects after imperative verbs, infinitives and gerunds, but otherwise pronoun objects come before the verb.\\r\\nThere are both indefinite and definite articles in Italian. There are four indefinite articles, which vary based on the gender and first letter of the noun they modify. Uno is used before a masculine singular noun beginning with z, s+consonant, gn, or ps. Un is used before masculine singular nouns beginning with any other letters. Una is used before a feminine singular noun beginning with any consonant. Un' is used before a feminine singular noun beginning with any vowel. There are seven definite articles, both singular and plural. In the singular: lo, which corresponds to the uses of uno; il, which corresponds to the uses of un, la, which corresponds to the uses of una; l', used before both masculine and feminine nouns and corresponds to un' in the feminine and un in the masculine. In the plural: gli, the plural of lo and l'; i, the plural of il; and le, the plural of la and l'. If an adjective also precedes the noun, the article used corresponds with the adjective.[80]\\r\\nThere are numerous contractions of prepositions with subsequent articles. There are numerous productive suffixes for diminutive, augmentative, pejorative, attenuating etc., which are also used to create neologisms.\\r\\nThere are 27 pronouns, grouped in clitic and tonic pronouns. Personal pronouns are separated into three groups: subject, object (which take the place of both direct and indirect objects), and reflexive. Second person subject pronouns have both a polite and a familiar form. These two different types of address are very important in Italian social distinctions. All object pronouns have two forms: stressed and unstressed. Unstressed object pronouns are much more frequently used, and come before the verb. Stressed object pronouns come after the verb, and are used when emphasis is required or to avoid ambiguity. Aside from personal pronouns, Italian also has demonstrative, interrogative, possessive, and relative pronouns. There are two types of demonstrative pronouns: relatively near (this) and relatively far (that). Demonstratives in Italian are repeated before each noun, unlike in English.[80]\\r\\nThere are three regular sets of verbal conjugations, and various verbs are irregularly conjugated. Within each of these sets of conjugations, there are four simple (one-word) verbal conjugations by person/number in the indicative mood (present tense; past tense with imperfective aspect, past tense with perfective aspect, and future tense), two simple conjugations in the subjunctive mood (present tense and past tense), one simple conjugation in the conditional mood, and one simple conjugation in the imperative mood. Corresponding to each of the simple conjugations, there is a compound conjugation involving a simple conjugation of \\"to be\\" or \\"to have\\" followed by a past participle. \\"To have\\" is used to form compound conjugation when the verb is transitive (\\"Ha detto\\", \\"ha fatto\\": he/she has said, he/she has made/done), while \\"to be\\" is used in the case of verbs of motion and some other intransitive verbs (\\" andato\\", \\" stato\\": he/she has gone, he/she has been). \\"To be\\" may be used with transitive verbs, but in such a case it makes the verb passive (\\" detto\\", \\" fatto\\": it is said, it is made/done). This rule is not absolute, and some exceptions do exist.\\r\\nThere is a recording of Dante's Divine Comedy read by Lino Pertile available online.[83]","input":"What language was spoken in italy before italian?"},{"output":"Murder House","context":"\\r\\n\\r\\nAmerican Horror Story is an American anthology horror television series created by Ryan Murphy and Brad Falchuk.

The Harmons' lives are troubled by the meddling Langdons, the incompetent realtor Marcy (Christine Estabrook), as well as by the disfigured Larry Harvey (Denis O'Hare), a former resident of the mansion who is secretly in love with Constance, and the scorned Hayden McClaine (Kate Mara), Ben's student who follows him to Los Angeles and is pregnant from their affair. Ben and Vivien try to rekindle their relationship as Violet, suffering from depression, finds comfort with Tate (Evan Peters), the ghost of Constance's psychopathic son. The family soon discovers that the home is haunted by the ghosts of anyone who has ever died on the property, including its creators Charles (Matt Ross) and Nora Montgomery (Lily Rabe); and their deformed son Thaddeus (Ben Woolf). Flashbacks depict the mansion's previous homeowners throughout the last century, dating back to its construction in the 1920s.

Kit Walker (Evan Peters), accused of being prolific serial killer \\"Bloody Face\\" after the disappearance of his wife Alma (Britne Olford)though he claims she was abducted by aliensis incarcerated at Briarcliff. This piques the interest of ambitious journalist Lana Winters (Sarah Paulson), who is yearning to find a story for her big break. At Briarcliff, Kit meets the other patients, many of whom claim to be unjustly institutionalized, including microcephalic Pepper (Naomi Grossman), who was framed for her nephew's murder; nymphomaniac Shelley (Chloe Sevigny); and the unassuming Grace Bertrand (Lizzie Brocher) from France, who appears to be harboring a deep secret of her own. Believed to be a violent serial killer, he becomes the subject of interest of pragmatic psychiatrist Oliver Thredson (Zachary Quinto) and the sadistic Dr. Arthur Arden (James Cromwell), the latter of whom routinely conducts scientific operations on patients. The institution is run under the watchful eye of the stern Sister Jude (Jessica Lange), as well as her second-in-command, the naive Sister Mary Eunice (Lily Rabe), and the founder of the institution, Monsignor Timothy Howard (Joseph Fiennes). Briarcliff's inhabitants are routinely subject to supernatural and scientific influences, including demonic possession and extraterrestrial abduction. The season mostly deals with insanity, with other themes including female sexuality, corrupt ambition, religion versus science, racism, prejudice, death, and faith.\\r\\n\\r\\nSet in the year 2013, the season follows the dwindling descendants of the witches who survived the Salem Witch Trials and their struggle to hide their identity in the modern world. Those who share this genetic affliction are being subjected to violent attacks from outside forces, such as religious townspeople and witch hunters. Zoe Benson (Taissa Farmiga), a young teenager completely unaware of the existence of witches, discovers her identity as a Salem descendent after a violent accident that causes the death of her boyfriend. She is sent to an all-girls boarding school in New Orleans which aims to protect and house young women who carry this unique bloodline, and keep them from the dangers of the outside world. There, she meets the other students, narcissistic film star Madison Montgomery (Emma Roberts), outspoken Queenie (Gabourey Sidibe), and enigmatic Nan (Jamie Brewer), and gets romantically entangled with Kyle Spencer (Evan Peters), a non-witch and good-natured college student.

Cordelia's mother, Fiona Goode (Jessica Lange), is the Supreme and most powerful witch of her generation, though she regularly avoids her responsibilities, much to the chagrin of Cordelia and her long-time rival Myrtle. After a mob of townspeople discover and nearly kill a young witch living in the swamps named Misty Day (Lily Rabe), Fiona returns to the school to ensure the safety of the other young witches, but also to fulfill her own hidden agenda. Events reveal a long-held rivalry between the witches of Salem and the voodoo practitioners of New Orleans, as well as a historic grudge between Voodoo Queen Marie Laveau (Angela Bassett) and socialite serial killer Delphine LaLaurie (Kathy Bates).

Decades have passed since the public has looked upon freak shows as a form of entertainment, but Elsa dreams of finding a home for her \\"monsters\\", as well as for her own fame and fortune. Other members of her troupe include Jimmy Darling (Evan Peters), a boy born with syndactyly who dreams of living a normal life, and his mother Ethel (Kathy Bates), a bearded lady who is Elsa's second-in-command by maintaining law and order under the tent. A strongman from Ethel's troubled past named Dell Toledo (Michael Chiklis), and his three-breasted wife Desiree Dupree (Angela Bassett), make waves when they arrive to join the freak show. To drum up business and save her troupe once and for all, Elsa also recruits conjoined twin sisters Bette and Dot Tattler (Sarah Paulson) to perform for her show. In a time when the era of television is beginning to reign high above sideshow acts, these individuals must overcome those who persecute them based on their looks. However, as events unfold, it is revealed that multiple dark entities have taken up residence in Jupiter, with all of their eyes being set on the freaks. A conman named Stanley (Denis O'Hare), posing as a Hollywood executive, arrives with his young protege Maggie Esmerelda (Emma Roberts), with the intention of murdering the freaks and sending their bodies to a museum for profit. The wealthy and spoiled Dandy Mott (Finn Wittrock), enabled by his doting mother Gloria (Frances Conroy), develops an unhealthy obsession with the freaks, particularly Bette and Dot. Perhaps most dangerous of all is a mysterious, deformed killer clown, only known as Twisty (John Carroll Lynch), who wreaks havoc among the town and appears to be targeting freaks and townspeople alike. This season mostly deals with discrimination, with other themes including prejudice, acceptance, exploitation, entertainment, television, and medical oddities.\\r\\n\\r\\nSet in the year 2015, the season follows the strange and dangerous happenings that seem to center around the retro Hotel Cortez in downtown Los Angeles, California, initially built as a secret torture chamber to fulfill the violent desires of founder James March (Evan Peters). Detective John Lowe (Wes Bentley) arrives at the hotel, based on intel from an anonymous tip, to investigate a grisly string of murders, each of which exemplify a sin in violation of one of the Ten Commandments. He has become estranged from his wife Alex (Chloe Sevigny), who suffers from depression, and his daughter Scarlett (Shree Crooks), after the disappearance of their son Holden (Lennon Henry). As the season unfolds, the Lowes discover that the disappearance of Holden may be related to the strange activities at the hotel, led by March's fashionista widow Elizabeth Johnson (Lady Gaga), also known as the Countesswho was turned into a vampire by her former lovers, actor Rudolph Valentino (Finn Wittrock) and his wife Natacha Rambova (Alexandra Daddario)and her current lover Donovan (Matt Bomer). Throughout his investigation, John also becomes entangled with the spirits of heroin junkie named Sally (Sarah Paulson), hotel maid Hazel Evers (Mare Winningham), and James March, who is looking for a protege to continue the violent acts he started when he was alive. The hotel's tireless staff includes the surly front desk manager Iris (Kathy Bates), Donovan's mother who took the job to be close to her son, and her best friend, the transgender bartender Liz Taylor (Denis O'Hare), both of whom hesitantly cater to Elizabeth and her vampiric children. Elizabeth's relationship with Donovan becomes troubled with the arrival of male model and cocaine addict Tristan Duffy (Wittrock), New York fashion designer Will Drake (Cheyenne Jackson), and her scorned ex-lover Ramona Royale (Angela Bassett), all of whom become entangled in her violent life. This season mostly deals with addiction, with other themes including sexuality, insanity, revenge, debauchery, religion, sin, drug use, forgiveness, and death.\\r\\n\\r\\nSet in the years 2014-2017, the season follows the supernatural events that occur in a renovated farmhouse in North Carolina, which is situated on the land where the Roanoke Colony moved after their infamous 1580s disappearance. In 2015, Shelby Miller (Lily Rabe), her husband Matt (Andr Holland), along with Matt's sister Lee Harris (Adina Porter) recount their harrowing experience living in the farmhouse a year prior in a popular documentary series titled My Roanoke Nightmare, including their encounters with the ghosts of the house's previous residents, the violent ghosts of the Roanoke Colony, the cannibalistic Polk family who live nearby, and the beautiful, yet terrifying Celtic goddess, Scthach (Lady Gaga).

In 2016, the success of the documentary leads to a sequel titled Return to Roanoke: Three Days In Hell, spearheaded by the producer of the original series, Sidney Aaron James (Cheyenne Jackson), who invites the Millers, as well as many of the reenactment actors, to return to the farmhouse for three days, where all their actions will be captured by hidden cameras. Although the Millers are aware of the entities that reside in the house, all three agree to return, each with their own agenda. The production eventually descends into disaster, however, as cast and crew alike are quickly targeted when the violent entities begin to surface. This season mostly deals with exploitation, with other themes including reality, fame, motherhood, family, drug abuse, publicity, revenge, the media, and television.\\r\\n\\r\\nSet in the year 2017, the fictitious town of Brookfield Heights, Michigan, is left divided upon the wake of Donald Trump's presidential election. Local restaurant owner Ally Mayfair-Richards (Sarah Paulson) is left utterly distraught, along with her wife Ivy (Alison Pill). Despite the help of her psychiatrist, Dr. Rudy Vincent Anderson (Cheyenne Jackson), Ally becomes increasingly unstable in the following weeks, her long repressed phobias begin to re-emerge, and they begin to affect her relationships with her wife as well as their son Oz (Cooper Dodson). Across town, misogynistic alt-righter Kai Anderson (Evan Peters) rejoices at the election results, enticing him to pursue political power by running for city council, led by Bebe Babbitt (Frances Conroy), an old-school feminist, with the help of his reluctant, liberal sister Winter (Billie Lourd), who was also hired by the Mayfair-Richards household as their nanny. As Ally attempts to adjust to regular life despite her growing anxiety and paranoia, she becomes terrorized by a group of masked assailants in clown attire who are only present when she is alone, leaving those around her to wonder if she was truly attacked, or if they were merely hallucinations. Kai's faithful followers include Ally's eccentric neighbors Harrison (Billy Eichner) and Meadow Wilton (Leslie Grossman), newscast reporter Beverly Hope (Adina Porter), rogue detective Jack Samuels (Colton Haynes), as well as local grocery cashier Gary K. Longstreet (Chaz Bono). With Kai's rise to power revealing sinister motives, Ally starts to draw connections between her alleged clown attackers and the many strange incidents occurring in Brookfield Heights. She begins to fear that everyone in town is out to get her, amplifying her growing distrust of those around her, especially her neighbors. This season mostly deals with marginalization, with other themes including politics, government, conspiracies, the media, fear, power, disenfranchisement, revenge, sexism, and oppression.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn January 12, 2017, the series was renewed for an eighth season, set to premiere on September 12, 2018.[9][10] Murphy has announced the season will be set 18-months in the future, in October 2019, and will feature an Asylum and Coven tone.[11][12] Initially, Murphy stated that the ninth season would most likely be the crossover season between Murder House and Coven,[11] but the eighth season was chosen instead.[13] A crossover season was first announced on October 30, 2016.[14] Filming for the season began on June 16, 2018.[12]\\r\\n\\r\\nOn January 12, 2017, the series was renewed for a ninth season, set to air in 2019.[9]\\r\\n\\r\\nÿ Murphy on the series' anthology format[15]\\r\\n\\r\\nCreators Murphy and Falchuk began working on American Horror Story before their Fox series Glee began production. Murphy wanted to do the opposite of what he had done previously and thus began his work on the series. He stated: \\"I went from Nip/Tuck to Glee, so it made sense that I wanted to do something challenging and dark. And I always had loved, as Brad had, the horror genre. So it just was a natural for me.\\"[16] Falchuk was intrigued by the idea of putting a different angle on the horror genre, stating that their main goal in creating the series was to scare viewers. \\"You want people to be a little bit off balance afterwards,\\" he said.[17]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn February 2011, FX officially announced that it had ordered a pilot for a possible series from Ryan Murphy and Brad Falchuk, with both Murphy and Falchuk writing and Murphy directing. Dante Di Loreto was announced as executive producer. Production on the series began in April 2011.[18] In July 2011, FX officially announced the project had been picked up to series.[19]\\r\\n\\r\\nFrom the beginning, Murphy and Falchuk planned that each season of the series would tell a different story.[15] After the first season finale aired, Murphy spoke of his plans to change the cast and location for the second season.[20] He did say, however, that some actors who starred in the first season would be returning. \\"The people that are coming back will be playing completely different characters, creatures, monsters, etc. [The Harmons'] stories are done. People who are coming back will be playing entirely new characters,\\" he announced.[15] In November 2012, FX chief executive, John Landgraf, described the unique format of the series stating: \\"[T]he notion of doing an anthological series of miniseries with a repertory cast ÿ has proven groundbreaking, wildly successful and will prove to be trendsetting.\\"[21]\\r\\n\\r\\nAt the 2013 PaleyFest, Falchuk compared the series to horror films: \\"It does demand a little bit of compassion at the end because you fall in love with these characters in a different way than you would in a movie,\\" he said. \\"If you want to kill everybody in a movie except one person, you can kind of get away with that, but if you're looking to do a horror TV show, you have a different responsibility to the characters because the audience has a different affection for them.\\"[22]\\r\\n\\r\\nMurphy then explained the process of planning a series' season takes about a year. \\"We come up with story first and then we come up with the characters,\\" he said. \\"It is a repertory company, so we'll move people around and sometimes there won't yet be a role for somebody. Like when we started [the second season], I really had no idea that Dylan [McDermott] would be the person to play Sarah's son, but the deeper we got, I thought, that would work great.\\"[22]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn an August 2015 article for Entertainment Weekly, Murphy revealed that the show is mulling producing two seasons a year. The first being broadcast in the spring and the second in the fall. He explained, \\"We're doing something that we've never done before on the show where we're doing two different groups of writers rooms. Some of our writers will be bouncing around but a whole different group coming in late August. The next thing were crafting up is very, very different than [Hotel]. Not smaller. But just not opulent. More rogue and more dark.\\"[23]\\r\\n\\r\\nConnie Britton was first to be cast in the series, portraying female lead Vivien Harmon on Murder House.[24] Denis O'Hare joined second as Larry Harvey.[25] Jessica Lange soon followed as Constance, her first regular role on television.[26] Dylan McDermott joined the cast soon after Lange as the male lead Ben Harmon.[27] Taissa Farmiga and Evan Peters were the last actors to be added to the main cast, portraying Violet Harmon and Tate Langdon, respectively.[28]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn March 2012, Murphy revealed that the second season had been conceptualized around Jessica Lange who portrays Sister Jude, a sadistic nun who runs the asylum.[29] Evan Peters, Sarah Paulson, Lily Rabe and Zachary Quinto also return, with the latter three joining the main cast.[30] Peters portrays Kit Walker, an inmate accused of murdering his wife.[31] Paulson portrays Lana, a lesbian reporter who gets committed to the asylum because of her sexuality and intent to snoop around the sanitorium.[32] Rabe's character is Sister Mary Eunice, clumsy second-in-charge to Sister Jude.[33] Quinto portrays Dr. Thredson, a psychiatrist at the asylum.[34][35] Lizzie Brocher stars as Grace Bertrand, a character described originally as \\"a fierce, ferocious, extremely sexual, and dangerous wild-child sexpot\\", but the role was later heavily revamped.[36][37] James Cromwell co-stars as Dr. Arthur Arden, who proclaims to be in charge of the asylum and performs dark experiments on its patients.[38][39][40] Joseph Fiennes starred as Monsignor Timothy Howard, a possible love interest for Sister Jude.[40][41][42]\\r\\n\\r\\nFor the third season, series executive producers and co-creators Ryan Murphy and Brad Falchuk stated that, as with the second season, \\"many actors\\" would return in different roles, beginning with Jessica Lange.[43] Evan Peters and Sarah Paulson were confirmed to return, portraying Kyle Spencer and Cordelia Foxx, respectively. Murphy added that Lange would portray a \\"real glamour-cat lady\\", later revealed to be named Fiona Goode.[44] Taissa Farmiga, Violet in the first season, starred as Zoe Benson, a character that is involved in a prominent romance during the season.[45] Lily Rabe co-starred as Misty Day.[46] Recurring cast member Frances Conroy joined as a main cast member, playing the character of Myrtle Snow.[45] Oscar-winning actress Kathy Bates was confirmed to co-star. It was first reported that she would portray \\"a woman who, at the start, is Lange's character's best friend, but will become her worst enemy\\", but this was altered.[47] Murphy stated that Bates' character will be \\"five times worse than [her] Misery character\\" and is also inspired by a \\"true event\\". She portrayed Madame Delphine LaLaurie, an immortal racist.[48] It was announced in May 2013 that Emma Roberts had been added to the cast. Roberts played Madison Montgomery, a \\"self-involved party girl\\".[49] In July 2013, season one alum Denis O'Hare also joined the cast in an unknown role,[50] later revealed as Spalding. \\r\\n\\r\\nIn November 2013, Ryan Murphy confirmed that Jessica Lange would be returning for a fourth season, although in a reduced capacity. It was later revealed she would be playing Freak Show owner Elsa Mars.[51] Kathy Bates returned in a main role, portraying bearded lady Ethel Darling.[52] On March 29, 2014, Murphy announced that Sarah Paulson, Evan Peters, Frances Conroy, Emma Roberts, Denis O'Hare, and Angela Bassett would all return for the fourth season.[53] Paulson portrayed conjoined sisters Bette and Dot Tattler; Peters portrayed \\"Lobster Boy\\" Jimmy Darling; Conroy played the well-off Gloria Mott; Bassett portrayed three-breasted hermaphrodite Desiree Dupree; and O'Hare played Stanley, a conman working with Roberts' Maggie Esmerelda. At PaleyFest 2014, it was revealed that Michael Chiklis would be joining the cast as Dell Toledo, the father of Jimmy, ex-husband of Ethel, and current husband of Desiree.[54] Finn Wittrock later joined the main cast as Gloria's spoiled son, Dandy Mott.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor the series' fifth cycle, singer-songwriter Lady Gaga was announced as the first and newest main cast member on February 25, 2015.[55] After a special guest appearance on the previous season, Matt Bomer joined the fifth season's cast along with series newcomer Cheyenne Jackson during PaleyFest 2015.[56] Chlo? Sevigny and Wes Bentley were promoted as main cast members, after they appear as recurring special guests in Asylum and Freak Show respectively.[57] Murphy later announced the returns of Kathy Bates, Sarah Paulson, Evan Peters and Angela Bassett.[58] In June 2015, it was announced Denis O'Hare would also return for the fifth season.[59] In August 2015, Murphy announced the character roles for the cast: Gaga's Elizabeth Johnson also known as \\"The Countess\\", a fashionista vampire who owns the Hotel Cortez; Jackson's Will Drake, a desperate fashion designer; O'Hare's Liz Taylor, a transsexual bartender who works at the hotel's Blue Parrot Lounge bar; Sevigny's Alex Lowe, a pediatrician who was the wife of Bentley's John Lowe, a detective who investigates the murders inside the hotel; Bomer's Donovan, the lover to the Countess whom often had conflict with his mother and hotel manager, Bates' Iris; Bassett's Ramona Royale, a former actress who was the former lover of Elizabeth; Paulson's Sally, a drug addict who had a rivalry with Iris and forms a bond with John since his visit in the hotel.[60] Peters co-starred as serial killer James Patrick March and the original hotelier of the Hotel Cortez.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn February 2016, Angela Bassett confirmed she would return to join the main cast of the sixth season during an interview with Larry King.[61] Denis O'Hare announced that he will also appear in the season in a May 2016 interview.[62] In June 2016, Cheyenne Jackson, Evan Peters, Wes Bentley, and Kathy Bates announced their returns for the sixth season.[63][64][65] In August 2016, Sarah Paulson announced that she would return to the series in the sixth season and Ryan Murphy announced that Oscar winner Cuba Gooding Jr. had joined the main cast.[66][67] In September 2016, the full main cast was announced after the first episode with the inclusion of Andr Holland and returning series veteran Lily Rabe.[68] On Halloween 2016, Murphy announced that Paulson's Asylum character, Lana Winters would also appear in the series after the recent appearance of the actress' first role Billie Dean Howard from Murder House in the final episode of the fifth season.[69][70]\\r\\n\\r\\nFor the seventh season, Paulson and Peters were set to return to the series, as announced during the Winter 2017 TCA Press Tour.[71] Billie Lourd, who made her breakout appearance with Murphy in 2015, was confirmed to join the main cast in April, while Jackson was the next series regular to return in the next month.[72][73][74] In June, Alison Pill was announced to co-star in the season, portraying the partner of Paulson's character.[75]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn October 2017, it was announced that Paulson would return for the series' eighth cycle.[76] In March 2018, Kathy Bates and Evan Peters were announced to return, leading the season with Paulson.[77] In April, Joan Collins joined the cast.[78] Peters will portray a comedic hairdresser and Collins will portray his grandmother.[12] Adina Porter, Cheyenne Jackson, Billy Eichner, and Leslie Grossman, who all appeared in the previous season, were also confirmed to return.[79] Billie Lourd has also been confirmed to return.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe pilot episode was shot on location in a house in Country Club Park, Los Angeles, California, which serves as the haunted house and crime scene in the series. Designed and built in 1908 by Alfred Rosenheim, the president of the American Institute of Architects' Los Angeles chapter, the Tudor or Collegiate Gothic-style single family home was previously used as a convent.[80][81] The first season was filmed on sets which are an exact replica of the house.[82] Details such as Louis Comfort Tiffany stained glass windows and hammered bronze light fixtures were re-created to preserve the look of the house.[80]\\r\\n\\r\\nProduction and shooting for the second season began in late July 2012 for a scheduled premiere in mid October.[83] The exteriors for the second season were filmed in Hidden Valley, Ventura County, California, a rural area outside Los Angeles, although the season took place in Massachusetts.[84]\\r\\n\\r\\nPrincipal photography for the third season began on July 23, 2013,[85] in New Orleans, Louisiana.[86][87] It was first reported that the season would film in multiple locations, but filming primarily took place in New Orleans.[88]\\r\\n\\r\\nPrincipal photography for the fourth season began on July 15, 2014, in New Orleans, though the story takes place in Jupiter, Florida.\\r\\n\\r\\nPrincipal photography for the fifth season began on July 14, 2015, in Los Angeles, California, where the story also takes place.[89] Murphy revealed a six-story hotel set was being built on the Fox lot. A dummy set of the hotel was built at the 2015 San Diego Comic-Con International, showing an Art Deco style building from the 1920s, inspired by the old Hollywood era.[90]\\r\\n\\r\\nFilming for the sixth season began on July 6, 2016 at Santa Clarita, California.[91] Set constructions include a colonial settler home to speculate the disappearance of the Roanoke Colony.[92]\\r\\n\\r\\nFilming for the seventh season was originally planned to begin in Orange, California on June 2017 before it was moved to May instead.[93][94]\\r\\n\\r\\nFilming for the eighth season is set to begin on June 16, 2018.[12]\\r\\n\\r\\nAmerican Horror Story's title screens offer vague hints to important plot elements and events that compose each season. For Murder House, Murphy described the sequence as a mini-mystery and stated that: \\"By the time you see the ninth episode of this season, every image in that title sequence will be explained,\\" establishing the purpose of the title sequence for future seasons.[95]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe opening title sequence was created by Kyle Cooper and his company Prologue. He also created the title sequence for the AMC series The Walking Dead and the 1995 film Seven. The theme music was composed by sound designer Cesar Davila-Irizarry and musician Charlie Clouser.[96] The cinematography was done by Juan Ruiz Ancha and the editing by Gabriel J. Diaz.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor the first season, the sequence is set in the Harmons' basement and includes images of postmortem young children, fetuses in jars, skulls, a christening dress, a nurse's uniform, and a figure holding a pair of bloody hedge clippers. A photo of alleged axe murderer Lizzie Borden is shown.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe second season's opening sequence is done by the same creative team. \\"We are shooting a new title sequence with the same team that did last year's,\\" series creator Ryan Murphy said. \\"The song may stay... not sure.\\"[97] The music was kept, and the new title sequence was set around the Asylum, using shots of inmates raving and surgeons operating on patients with bandages obscuring their faces. Elements include a young girl walking backwards on her hands and feet up a staircase and a shot of the Virgin Mary's smile changing from one of benevolence to one of spite.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe third season's opening sequence keeps the same music, and this sequence is the first one to be filmed primarily outside and not in an enclosed location. Shots include figures wearing black robes and capirotes, a bony-skeleton creature with wings and shots of dead goats, the Minotaur from the season also appears. For the first time, there are actual backgrounds that appear with the actor names instead of an all-black background, some of these images include witches hanging and Santa Muerte. Other elements include a black man with piercing eyes and a disturbing smile as well as voodoo dolls. The final shot continues after the figures in black capirotes seize one of their own who is later seen burning at a stake where young, dress-clad witches dance around.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe fourth season's opening sequence changed things up, the series theme music remains intact albeit with an added carnival-like soundscape. The sequence is composed of both CGI and stop-motion animation and features strange characters such as a skeleton chimera of a human being and an elephant riding a bicycle, a skeleton of what appears to be a single head but two bodies, a devil-like man, a boy in a wheel chair with deformed legs, a character with severe syndactyly of the hands and feet, a clown who can twist his head around, a woman with a third leg where her genitalia should be, and a demonic cymbal-banging monkey toy. There are also shots of side show attractions like the Human Blockhead, knife throwing and sword swallowing. The main recurring element features a balloon twister popping balloons with a knife.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe fifth season's opening sequence also was very different from previous seasons', taking a more biblical approach. The font, while remaining the same as the first four seasons, glow in red against a hotel wallpaper. The Ten Commandments are also shown throughout the video. The intro returns to live-action like the first three seasons. Visuals include many people scrubbing blood all over the walls and the floor, strange things shown through peepholes, people being victims to the hotel, little kids running around the hotel, as well as many different creatures.[98]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe sixth season featured no title sequence or opening credits, instead opting for a simple title card (from the first season) which read \\"American Horror Story\\", while the series theme music plays over the end credits. At the end of the finale's credits, the title of the season \\"American Horror Story: Roanoke\\" was revealed. \\r\\n\\r\\nIn the development of the seventh season, Murphy confirmed that the opening sequence will return. The seventh season's opening sequence features the series theme music played by a marching band. The sequence is live-action. Visuals include: a gang of clowns rises from a casket, Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton masks, a George Washington statue, a dead dog killed by toxic gas, a Merry Go Round, bloody hands that cannot be washed, beehive, toxic smoke released from a grenade, holes in several forms, bloody US flag with sound of a xylophone playing The Star-Spangled Banner, blood covered couple having sex and a handcuffed pinky promise. Clowns also appear throughout the sequence.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe title sequence for all seasons of the show use a variation of the Willow typeface that very closely resembles a style for which Scottish designer Charles Rennie Mackintosh was known.[99]\\r\\n\\r\\nAs part of the promotion for the series, FX launched a \\"House Call\\" campaign, in which viewers at home could sign up and come face-to-face with a character from the series.[100] Prior to the series premiere, FX released several clues to shine light on the series. They were offered on the show's official YouTube channel. Ten clues were released.[101] In September 2011, FX launched a website which allows visitors to tour the Murder House throughout the decades and look for clues.[102]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn August 2012, the first promo for the second season was released on the American Horror Story Facebook page entitled \\"Special Delivery\\", in which a nun carries a couple of buckets filled with body parts through a field. As a church bell rings, the nun empties one bucket's bloody contents, leaving the empty bucket behind, and resumes her trek.[103] Over 20 subsequent teasers were released.[104] Four photos were also released on EW.com.[105] Two televised teasers, titled \\"Meet the Residents\\", were released on August 31, 2012. They feature the patients and some staff (such as Dr. Thredson, played by Zachary Quinto, and Sister Mary Eunice, played by Lily Rabe) lying in twin beds and dealing with their individual issues as the heads of the asylum (Jessica Lange, Joseph Fiennes and James Cromwell) look on. The song \\"Que Sera, Sera\\", mixed with the show's theme music, plays.[106] To promote Cult, a competition was set up where fans who donated to the Children's Hospital Los Angeles could get a chance to get a walk-on role in an episode, and lunch with Evan Peters.[107]\\r\\n\\r\\nOn August 16, 2016, FX announced a deal had been struck to feature an American Horror Story exhibit at Universal Studios Hollywood and Universal Orlando for their Halloween Horror Nights. The maze will feature sets and themes from Murder House, Freak Show, and Hotel. Universal said of the experience, \\"Twisted scenes from Murder House will unleash the evil spirits that possess the Harmon estate, spiraling guests through decades of the tortured dead who previously resided there. In Freak Show, guests will join a troupe of biological misfits in a sinister sideshow where they'll be stalked by the murderous and deformed Twisty the Clown. Finally, guests will succumb to the warped desires of The Countess after checking into the haunted Hotel Cortez, conceived from the beginning as a torture chamber for its customers.\\"[108]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 2017, the show returned as haunted attractions to both parks, with Universal Orlando having an attraction based on Asylum, Coven, and Roanoke, and Universal Studios Hollywood basing their attraction solely on Roanoke.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe series premiered on October 5, 2011, and is broadcast on the cable television channel FX in the United States. In November 2011, it premiered internationally on the respective countries' Fox Networks Group. The first season premiered on October 5, 2011, and concluded on December 21, 2011. The second season premiered on October 17, 2012, and concluded on January 23, 2013. The third season premiered on October 9, 2013, and concluded on January 29, 2014.

The latter three seasons premiered on the same day and same time with the American broadcasts on FX in Canada, though the first season followed a slightly different schedule as that network launched on October 31, 2011. The series is aired in India on STAR World Premiere HD shortly after its U.S. airing. Along with it, it airs on FX India on standard definition and Fox in UK and Ireland in October 2011.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe first season of American Horror Story: Murder House received generally positive reviews from critics. Review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes reported that 74% of 38 critics gave the first season a positive review. The site's consensus stated: \\"Convoluted yet effective, American Horror Story is strange, gory, and twisted enough to keep viewers hooked.\\"[109] The first season scored 62 out of 100 on Metacritic based on 30 reviews.[110] Ken Tucker from Entertainment Weekly awarded the pilot episode a B+, stating: \\"AHS is pretty much all scare, all the time: a whole lotta screams, sex, jolts, mashed faces, psychotic behavior, and dead babies.\\"[111] Hank Stuever from The Washington Post said in his review that: \\"Overdoing things is one of Murphy's trademark flaws, but this show has a captivating style and giddy gross-outs.\\"[112] Not all reviews were favorable: Alan Sepinwall of HitFix gave the series a D?, saying: \\"It is so far over the top that the top is a microscopic speck in its rearview mirror, and so full of strange sounds, sights and characters that you likely won't forget it ÿ even though many of you will wish you could.\\"[113] Sepinwall would later go on to call it one of the worst TV shows of 2011.[114] The Los Angeles Times' Mary McNamara gave it a mixed review, stating that it \\"collapses into camp... upon more than one occasion\\" but also noting that it is \\"hard to look away.\\"[115]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe second season, American Horror Story: Asylum, received mostly positive reviews from critics. Review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes reported that 84% of 43 critics gave the season a positive review. The site's consensus is: \\"American Horror Story: Asylum crosses boundaries to shock and scare with sexy subplots and some innovative takes on current social issues.\\"[116] It scored 65 out of 100 on Metacritic based on 23 reviews.[117] James Poniewozik from Time stated: \\"AHS: Asylum feels like a more focused, if equally frenetic, screamfest. It's also gorgeously realized, with a vision of its '60s institution setting so detailed you can smell the stale air and incense.\\"[118] Maureen Ryan of The Huffington Post said: \\"It's to the credit of Asylum's writers, directors and cast that the emotional pain of the characters often feels as real as their uncertainty and terror.\\"[119] Verne Gay from Newsday gave the season a C grade, stating it \\"has some good special effects, just not much of a story to hang them on.\\"[120] Linda Stasi of the New York Post thought the season was \\"over the top,\\" adding: \\"I need to enter [an asylum] myself after two hours of this craziness.\\"[121]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe third season, American Horror Story: Coven, received positive reviews. Review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes reported that 84% of 34 critics gave the season a positive review. The site's consensus reads: \\"A noteworthy ensemble cast combined with creepy storytelling and campy, outrageous thrills make American Horror Story: Coven a potently structured fright-fest.\\"[122] It scored 71 out of 100 on Metacritic based on 24 reviews, the highest score for the show to that point. Not all reviews were positive, however, with criticism focused mainly in regards to the progression of both the story and certain character arcs in the second half of the season. The A.V. Club gave this season the low rating of a D+, with critic Todd Van DerWerff remarking: \\"It lurched drunkenly from idea to idea, never settling on one long enough to build anything of worth.\\"[123]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe fourth season, American Horror Story: Freak Show, received mostly positive reviews. Review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes reports that 79% of 32 critics gave the season a positive review. The site's consensus is: \\"Though it may turn off new viewers unaccustomed to its unabashed weirdness, Freak Show still brings the thrills, thanks to its reliably stylish presentation and game cast.\\"[124] It scored 69 out of 100 on Metacritic based on 19 \\"generally favorable\\" reviews.[125]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe fifth season, American Horror Story: Hotel, received mixed reviews from critics. Rotten Tomatoes reports that 63% of 43 critics gave the season a positive review. The site's consensus is: \\"Favoring garish style over effective storytelling, the fifth American Horror Story strands a talented cast at Ryan Murphy's Hotel.\\" Audience reception on the same website was also mixed, with 57% of viewers giving the show a favorable review.[126] Hotel scored a 60 out of 100 on Metacritic based on 24 \\"mixed or average\\" reviews.[127]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe sixth season, American Horror Story: Roanoke, received positive reviews from critics. Rotten Tomatoes reports that 78% of 13 critics gave the season a positive review. The site's consensus is: \\"American Horror Story: My Roanoke Nightmare takes a surprising turn away from prior AHS formats, revisiting the deliberate pace of earlier seasons on a spookier, smaller scale, even if the true-crime format feels overdone.\\"[128] It scored a 72 on Metacritic based on six reviews.[129]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe seventh season, American Horror Story: Cult, received generally positive reviews from critics. Rotten Tomatoes reports that 72% of 42 critics gave the season a positive review.

Harriet Earle has stated that they utilize \\"the formal structure of the serialized anthology, but it does so to present serial narratives made by and about queers, openly subverting gender and sexual norms that define the majority of television\\".[130] Upon its origin, the show had positive critical response from its graphic images of sex and violence.[131] Ryan Murphy, who identifies as gay, has stated in interviews that I would stand in church with my arms spread for an hour, doing penance for my sins. The nuns told my parents there was something wrong with me.[132] Using his own experience of heteronormative fixations, and knowing that what we truly fear are things that show otherness from ourselves, he creates complicated stories that showcase alternative gender and sexual norms that celebrate people who differ from what is normalized using horror tropes.[130] While the show has received negative criticism for its representation of fetishes and sexuality, with Mike Hale writing that  \\"The show has always been all on the surfacepaper-thin in terms of ideas and drama but drenched in creepy atmosphere and peekaboo depravity\\",[133] others have praised the show as embracing of non-normative sexuality and representation of LGBT characters.[citation needed]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe pilot episode of American Horror Story was watched by 3.2 million viewers and averaged a 1.6 rating in the 18ÿ49 years adult demographic, the most sought after by advertisers.[134] These were the best numbers FX had ever received for a series premiere.[135] The episode was seen by 3.2 million total viewers in 59 countries.[136] Ratings increased as the season progressed, with the season finale being watched by 3.22 million viewers and receiving a 1.7 ratings share in the 18ÿ49 years adult demographic.[137] The series premiere aired in November 2011 across Europe and Latin America on Fox International Channels, and ranked as first or second most watched telecast in its timeslot among all paid television in most metered markets.[136] \\"Numbers so strong, it's scary. American Horror Story has brought droves of new viewers to a killer global lineup\\", said Hernan Lopez, the president of Fox International Channels.[136]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe second season's premiere gained a 2.2 18ÿ49 ratings share and gathered 3.85 million viewers,[138] marking the highest numbers for the series.[139] By the season's sixth episode, the numbers dropped to a series-low 0.9 18ÿ49 ratings share and 1.89 million viewers;[140] however, they rebounded to above two million viewers for the subsequent episodes,[141][142] and reached 2.29 million viewers for the season's finale.[143] The premiere of the fifth season of the series became the second most-watched telecast in the network's history, only behind the premiere episode of the previous season, which was watched by 6.13 million viewers.[144] The show was subsequently renewed for another season; John Landgraf, the CEO of the network, commented on the show's success by saying that American Horror Story, the network's highest rated series, \\"has unquestionably joined the ranks of television's landmark series.\\"[145] In 2016, a New York Times study of the 50 TV shows with the most Facebook Likes found that \\"unlike a lot of shows about the supernatural\\", American Horror Story was \\"more popular in cities, but also throughout parts of the Southwest\\".[146]\\r\\n\\r\\nAmerican Horror Story has won 59 of its 230 award nominations. The franchise has garnered 28 Primetime Emmy Award nominations, with Jessica Lange winning for Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Miniseries or a Movie and for Outstanding Lead Actress in a Miniseries or a Movie, James Cromwell winning for Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Miniseries or a Movie, and Kathy Bates winning for Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Miniseries or a Movie. It received an additional 50 Creative Arts Emmy Award nominations, winning eleven times, including Outstanding Hairstyling for a Miniseries or a Movie, Outstanding Costumes for a Miniseries, Movie, or Special, Outstanding Sound Editing for a Miniseries, Movie, or Special, and Outstanding Prosthetic Makeup for a Series, Limited Series, Movie or a Special.[152] It has received nine Golden Globe Award nominations, with Lange winning for Best Supporting Actress in a Series, Miniseries or Television Film,[153] and Lady Gaga winning for Best Actress in a Miniseries or Television Film.[154] The series has also received three Screen Actors Guild Award nominations, with Lange winning for Outstanding Performance by a Female Actor in a Drama Series.[155] Additional accolades include eighteen Critics' Choice Television Awards nominations, with four wins,[156] the GLAAD Media Award for Outstanding TV Miniseries,[157] four Costume Designers Guild Awards nominations, winning three times,[158] eight wins out of ten nominations at the Make-Up Artists and Hair Stylists Guild,[159] five People's Choice Awards nominations, winning once,[160] and eleven Satellite Awards nomination, with three wins.[161]","input":"What is the order of the american horror story series?"},{"output":"Marsupials","context":"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nMarsupials are any members of the mammalian infraclass Marsupialia. All extant marsupials are endemic to Australasia and the Americas. A distinctive characteristic common to these species is that most of the young are carried in a pouch. Well-known marsupials include kangaroos, wallabies, koalas, possums, opossums, wombats, and Tasmanian devils. Some lesser-known marsupials are the potoroo and the quokka.\\r\\n\\r\\nMarsupials represent the clade originating from the last common ancestor of extant metatherians. Like other mammals in the Metatheria, they give birth to relatively undeveloped young that often reside in a pouch located on their mothers abdomen for a certain amount of time. Close to 70% of the 334 extant species occur on the Australian continent (the mainland, Tasmania, New Guinea and nearby islands). The remaining 100 are found in the Americas  primarily in South America, but thirteen in Central America, and one in North America, north of Mexico.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe word marsupial comes from marsupium, the technical term for the abdominal pouch. It, in turn, is borrowed from Latin and ultimately from the ancient Greek ?Ͽ? mrsippos, meaning \\"pouch\\".\\r\\n\\r\\nMarsupials are taxonomically identified as members of the mammalian infraclass Marsupialia, first described as a family under the order Pollicata by German zoologist Johann Karl Wilhelm Illiger in his 1811 work Prodromus Systematis Mammalium et Avium. However, James Rennie, author of The Natural History of Monkeys, Opossums and Lemurs (1838), pointed out that the placement of five different groups of mammals - monkeys, lemurs, tarsiers, aye-ayes and marsupials (with the exception of kangaroos, that were placed under the order Salientia) - under a single order (Pollicata) did not appear to have a strong justification. In 1816, French zoologist George Cuvier classified all marsupials under the order Marsupialia.[1][2] In 1997, researcher J. A. W. Kirsch and others accorded infraclass rank to Marsupialia.[2] There are two primary divisions: American marsupials (Ameridelphia) and Australian marsupials (Australidelphia).[3]\\r\\n\\r\\nMarsupialia is further divided as follows:[3]\\r\\n\\r\\n? - Extinct\\r\\n\\r\\nComprising over 300 extant species, several attempts have been made to accurately interpret the phylogenetic relationships among the different marsupial orders. Studies differ on whether Didelphimorphia or Paucituberculata is the sister group to all other marsupials.[4] Though the order Microbiotheria (which has only one species, the monito del monte) is found in South America, morphological similarities suggest it is closely related to Australian marsupials.[5] Molecular analyses in 2010 and 2011 identified Microbiotheria as the sister group to all Australian marsupials. However, the relations among the four Australidelphid orders are not as well understood. The cladogram below, depicting the relationships among the various marsupial orders, is based on a 2015 phylogenetic study.[4]\\r\\n\\r\\nDidelphimorphia\\r\\n\\r\\nPaucituberculata\\r\\n\\r\\nMicrobiotheria\\r\\n\\r\\nDiprotodontia\\r\\n\\r\\nNotoryctemorphia\\r\\n\\r\\nDasyuromorphia\\r\\n\\r\\nPeramelemorphia\\r\\n\\r\\nDNA evidence supports a South American origin for marsupials, with Australian marsupials arising from a single Gondwanan migration of marsupials from South America to Australia.[6][7] There are many small arboreal species in each group. The term \\"opossum\\" is used to refer to American species (though \\"possum\\" is a common diminutive), while similar Australian species are properly called \\"possums\\".\\r\\n\\r\\nMarsupials have the typical characteristics of mammalse.g., mammary glands, three middle ear bones, and true hair. There are, however, striking differences as well as a number of anatomical features that separate them from Eutherians.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn addition to the front pouch, which contains multiple nipples for the protection and sustenance of their young, marsupials have other common structural features. Ossified patellae are absent in most modern marsupials (though a small number of exceptions are reported)[8] and epipubic bones are present. Marsupials (and monotremes) also lack a gross communication (corpus callosum) between the right and left brain hemispheres.[9]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe skull has peculiarities in comparison to placental mammals. In general, the skull is relatively small and tight. Holes (foramen lacrimale) are located in the front of the orbit. The cheekbone is enlarged and extends further to the rear. The angular extension (processus angularis) of the lower jaw is bent toward the center. Another feature is the hard palate which, in contrast to the placental mammals' foramina, always have more openings. The teeth differ from that of placental mammals, so that all taxa except wombats have a different number of incisors in the upper and lower jaws. The early marsupials had a dental formula from 5 / 4-1 / 1-3 / 3-4 / 4, that is, per pine half; they have five maxilla or four mandibular incisors, one canine, three premolars and four molars, for a total of 50 teeth. Some taxa, such as the opossum, have the original number of teeth. In other groups the number of teeth is reduced. Marsupials in many cases have 40 to 50 teeth, significantly more than placental mammals. The upper jaw has a high number of incisors, up to ten, and they have more molars than premolars. The second set of teeth grows in only at the 3rd premolar: all remaining teeth are already created as permanent teeth.\\r\\n\\r\\nFew general characteristics describe their skeleton. In addition to details in the construction of the ankle, bones (Ossa epubica) are characteristic, two from the pubic bone of the pelvis, which is a forwardly projecting bone. Since these are present in males and pouchless species, it is believed that they originally had nothing to do with reproduction, but served in the muscular approach to the movement of the hind limbs. This could be explained by an original feature of mammals, as these epipubic  bones are also found in monotremes. Marsupial reproductive organs differ from the placentalp mammals. For them, the reproductive tract is doubled. The females have two uteri and two vaginas, and before birth, a birth canal forms between them, the median vagina.[9] The males have a split or double penis lying in front of the scrotum.[10]\\r\\n\\r\\nA pouch is present in most, but not all, species. Many marsupials have a permanent bag, whereas in others the pouch develops during gestation, as with the shrew opossum, where the young are hidden only by skin folds or in the fur of the mother. The arrangement of the pouch is variable to allow the offspring to receive maximum protection. Locomotive kangaroos have a pouch opening at the front, while many others that walk or climb on all fours have the opening in the back. Usually, only females have a pouch, but the male water opossum has a pouch that is used to accommodate his genitalia while swimming or running.\\r\\n\\r\\nMarsupials have adapted to many habitats, reflected in the wide variety in their build. The largest living marsupial, the red kangaroo, grows up to 1.8 metres (5.9?ft) in height and 90 kilograms (200?lb) in weight, but extinct genera, such as Diprotodon, were significantly larger and heavier. The smallest members of this group are the marsupial mice, which often reach only 5 centimetres (2.0?in) in body length.\\r\\n\\r\\nSome species resemble placental mammals and are examples of convergent evolution. The extinct Thylacine strongly resembled the placental wolf, hence its nickname \\"Tasmanian wolf\\". Flying and the associated ability to glide occurred both with marsupials (as with sugar gliders) and some placental mammals (as with flying squirrels), which developed independently. Other groups such as the kangaroo, however, do not have clear placental counterparts, though they share similarities in lifestyle and ecological niches with ruminants.\\r\\n\\r\\nMarsupials' reproductive systems differ markedly from those of placental mammals.[11][12] During embryonic development, a choriovitelline placenta forms in all marsupials. In bandicoots, an additional chorioallantoic placenta forms, although it lacks the chorionic villi found in eutherian placentas.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe evolution of reproduction in marsupials, and speculation about the ancestral state of mammalian reproduction, have engaged discussion since the end of the 19th century. Both sexes possess a cloaca,[12] which is connected to a urogenital sac used to store waste before expulsion. The bladder of marsupials functions as a site to concentrate urine and empties into the common urogenital sinus in both females and males.[12]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nMost male marsupials, except for macropods[13] and marsupial moles,[14] have a bifurcated penis, separated into two columns, so that the penis has two ends corresponding to the females' two vaginas.[9][12][15][16][10][17][18] The penis is used only during copulation, and is separate from the urinary tract.[10][12] It curves forward when erect,[19] and when not erect, it is retracted into the body in an S-shaped curve.[10] Neither marsupials nor monotremes possess a baculum.[9] The shape of the glans penis varies among marsupial species.[10][20][21][22]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe male thylacine had a pouch that acted as a protective sheath, covering his external reproductive organs while he ran through thick brush.[23]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe shape of the urethral grooves of the males' genitalia is used to distinguish between Monodelphis brevicaudata, Monodelphis domestica, and Monodelphis americana. The grooves form 2 separate channels that form the ventral and dorsal folds of the erectile tissue.[24] Several species of dasyurid marsupials can also be distinguished by their penis morphology.[25]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe only accessory sex glands marsupials possess are the prostate and bulbourethral glands.[26] There are no ampullae, seminal vesicles or coagulating glands.[27][15] The prostate is proportionally larger in marsupials than in placental mammals.[10] During the breeding season, the male tammar wallaby's prostate and bulbourethral gland enlarge. However, there does not appear to be any seasonal difference in the weight of the testes.[28]\\r\\n\\r\\nFemale marsupials have two lateral vaginas, which lead to separate uteri, but both open externally through the same orifice. A third canal, the median vagina, is used for birth. This canal can be transitory or permanent.[9]\\r\\n\\r\\nMarsupials give birth at a very early stage of development; after birth, newborn marsupials crawl up the bodies of their mothers and attach themselves to a nipple, which is located on the underside of the mother, either inside a pouch called the marsupium, or open to the environment. There they remain for a number of weeks, attached to the nipple. The offspring are eventually able to leave the marsupium for short periods, returning to it for warmth, protection, and nourishment.\\r\\n\\r\\nAn early birth removes a developing marsupial from its mother's body much sooner than in placental mammals, thus marsupials have not developed a complex placenta to protect the embryo from its mother's immune system. Though early birth puts the tiny newborn marsupial at a greater environmental risk, it significantly reduces the dangers associated with long pregnancies, as there is no need to carry a large fetus to full term in bad seasons. Marsupials are extremely altricial animals, needing to be intensely cared for immediately following birth (cf. precocial).\\r\\n\\r\\nBecause newborn marsupials must climb up to their mother's nipples, their front limbs and facial structures are much more developed than the rest of their bodies at the time of birth.[29][30] This requirement has been argued to have resulted in the limited range of locomotor adaptations in marsupials compared to placentals. Marsupials must develop grasping forepaws during their early youth, making the evolutive transition from these limbs into hooves, wings, or flippers, as some groups of placental mammals have done, more difficult. However, several marsupials do possess atypical forelimb morphologies, such as the hooved forelimbs of the pig-footed bandicoot, suggesting that the range of forelimb specialization is not as limited as assumed.[31]\\r\\n\\r\\nAn infant marsupial is known as a joey. Marsupials have a very short gestation periodusually around four to five weeks, but as low as 12 days for some speciesand the joey is born in an essentially fetal state. The blind, furless, miniature newborn, the size of a jelly bean,[32] crawls across its mother's fur to make its way into the pouch, where it latches onto a teat for food. It will not re-emerge for several months, during which time it develops fully. After this period, the joey begins to spend increasing lengths of time out of the pouch, feeding and learning survival skills. However, it returns to the pouch to sleep, and if danger threatens, it will seek refuge in its mother's pouch for safety.\\r\\n\\r\\nJoeys stay in the pouch for up to a year in some species, or until the next joey is born. A marsupial joey is unable to regulate its own body temperature and relies upon an external heat source. Until the joey is well-furred and old enough to leave the pouch, a pouch temperature of 30ÿ32?C (86ÿ90?F) must be constantly maintained.\\r\\n\\r\\nJoeys are born with \\"oral shields\\". In species without pouches or with rudimentary pouches these are more developed than in forms with well-developed pouches, implying a role in maintaining the young attached to the mother's nipple.[33]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe first American marsupial the Europeans encountered was the common opossum. Vicente Y?ez Pinz܇n, commander of the Ni?a on Christopher Columbus' first voyage in the late 1400s, collected a female opossum with young in her pouch off the Brazilian coast. He presented them to the Spanish monarchs, though by then the young were lost and the female had died. The animal was noted for its strange pouch or \\"second belly\\", and how the offspring reached the pouch was a mystery.[34][35]\\r\\n\\r\\nOn the other hand, it was the Portuguese who first described Australian marsupials. Ant܇nio Galv?o, a Portuguese administrator in Ternate (1536-40), wrote a detailed account of the northern common cuscus (Phalanger orientalis):[34]\\r\\n\\r\\nSome animals resemble ferrets, only a little bigger. They are called Kusus. They have a long tail with which they hang from the trees in which they live continuously, winding it once or twice around a branch. On their belly they have  a pocket like an intermediate balcony; as soon as they give birth to a young one they grow it inside there at a nipple until it does not need nursing anymore. As soon as she has borne and nourished it, the mother becomes pregnant again.\\r\\n\\r\\nFrom the start of the 17th century more accounts of marsupials arrived. For instance, a 1606 record of an animal, killed on the southern coast of New Guinea, described it as \\"in the shape of a dog, smaller than a greyhound\\", with a snakelike \\"bare scaly tail\\" and hanging testicles. The meat tasted like venison, and the stomach contained ginger leaves. This description appears to closely resemble the dusky pademelon (Thylogale brunii), in which case this would be the earliest European record of a member of the kangaroo family (Macropodidae).[36][34]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe relationships among the three extant divisions of mammals (monotremes, marsupials, and placentals) were long a matter of debate among taxonomists.[38] Most morphological evidence comparing traits such as number and arrangement of teeth and structure of the reproductive and waste elimination systems as well as most genetic and molecular evidence favors a closer evolutionary relationship between the marsupials and placental mammals than either has with the monotremes.[39]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe ancestors of marsupials, part of a larger group called metatherians, probably split from those of placental mammals (eutherians) during the mid-Jurassic period, though no fossil evidence of metatherians themselves are known from this time.[40] From DNA and protein analyses, the time of divergence of the two lineages has been estimated to be around 100 to 120 mya.[34] Fossil metatherians are distinguished from eutherians by the form of their teeth; metatherians possess four pairs of molar teeth in each jaw, whereas eutherian mammals (including true placentals) never have more than three pairs.[41] Using this criterion, the earliest known metatherian is Sinodelphys szalayi, which lived in China around 125 mya.[42] This makes it a contemporary to some early eutherian species which have been found in the same area.[43] While placental fossils dominate in Asia, marsupial fossils occur in larger numbers in North America.[34]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe oldest metatherian fossils are found in present-day China.[44] About 100 mya, the supercontinent Pangaea was in the process of splitting into the northern continent Laurasia and the southern continent Gondwana, with what would become China and Australia already separated by the Tethys Ocean. From there, metatherians spread westward into modern North America (still attached to Eurasia), where the earliest true marsupials are found. Marsupials are difficult to distinguish from other fossils, as they are characterized by aspects of the reproductive system which do not normally fossilize (including pouches) and by subtle changes in the bone and tooth structure that show a metatherian is part of the marsupial crown group (the most exclusive group that contains all living marsupials). The earliest definite marsupial fossil belongs to the species Peradectes minor, from the Paleocene of Montana, dated to about 65 million years ago.[45] From their point of origin in Laurasia, marsupials spread to South America, which was possibly connected to North America at around 65 mya through a ridge that has since moved on to become the Caribbean Archipelago.[46][47] Laurasian marsupials eventually died off, for not entirely clear reasons; convention has it that they disappeared due to competition with placentals, but this is no longer accepted to be the primary reason.[48]\\r\\n\\r\\nMarsurpials, Peradectes and the related Herpetotheriidae are nested within a clade of metatherians that also included a variety of Cretaceous North American taxa.[49]\\r\\n\\r\\nHoloclemensia\\r\\n\\r\\nPappotherium\\r\\n\\r\\nSulestes\\r\\n\\r\\nOklatheridium\\r\\n\\r\\nTsagandelta\\r\\n\\r\\nLotheridium\\r\\n\\r\\nDeltatheroides\\r\\n\\r\\nDeltatheridium\\r\\n\\r\\nNanocuris\\r\\n\\r\\nAtokatheridium\\r\\n\\r\\nGurlin Tsav skull\\r\\n\\r\\nBorhyaenidae\\r\\n\\r\\nMayulestes\\r\\n\\r\\nJaskhadelphys\\r\\n\\r\\nAndinodelphys\\r\\n\\r\\nPucadelphys\\r\\n\\r\\nAsiatherium\\r\\n\\r\\nIugomortiferum\\r\\n\\r\\nKokopellia\\r\\n\\r\\nAenigmadelphys\\r\\n\\r\\nAnchistodelphys\\r\\n\\r\\nGlasbius\\r\\n\\r\\nPediomys\\r\\n\\r\\nPariadens\\r\\n\\r\\nEodelphis\\r\\n\\r\\nDidelphodon\\r\\n\\r\\nTurgidodon\\r\\n\\r\\nAlphadon\\r\\n\\r\\nAlbertatherium\\r\\n\\r\\nMarsupialia\\r\\n\\r\\nIn South America, the opossums evolved and developed a strong presence, and the Paleogene also saw the evolution of shrew opossums (Paucituberculata) alongside non-marsupial metatherian predators such as the borhyaenids and the saber-toothed Thylacosmilus. South American niches for mammalian carnivores were dominated by these marsupial and sparassodont metatherians. While placental predators were absent, the metatherians did have to contend with avian (terror bird) and terrestrial crocodylomorph competition. South America and Antarctica remained connected until 35 mya, as shown by the unique fossils found there. North and South America were disconnected until about three million years ago, when the Isthmus of Panama formed. This led to the Great American Interchange. Sparassodonts disappeared for unclear reasons ÿ again, this has classically assumed as competition from carnivoran placentals, but the last sparassodonts co-existed with a few small carnivorans like procyonids and canines, and disappeared long before the arrival of macropredatory forms like felines,[50] while didelphimorphs (opossums) invaded Central America, with the Virginia opossum reaching as far north as Canada.\\r\\n\\r\\nMarsupials reached Australia via Antarctica about 50 mya, shortly after Australia had split off. This suggests a single dispersion event of just one species, most likely a relative to South America's monito del monte (a microbiothere, the only New World australidelphian). This progenitor may have rafted across the widening, but still narrow, gap between Australia and Antarctica. In Australia, they radiated into the wide variety seen today. Modern marsupials appear to have reached the islands of New Guinea and Sulawesi relatively recently via Australia.[51][52][53] A 2010 analysis of retroposon insertion sites in the nuclear DNA of a variety of marsupials has confirmed all living marsupials have South American ancestors. The branching sequence of marsupial orders indicated by the study puts Didelphimorphia in the most basal position, followed by Paucituberculata, then Microbiotheria, and ending with the radiation of Australian marsupials. This indicates that Australidelphia arose in South America, and reached Australia after Microbiotheria split off.[6][7]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn Australia, terrestrial placental mammals disappeared early in the Cenozoic (their most recent known fossils being 55 million-year-old teeth resembling those of condylarths) for reasons that are not clear, allowing marsupials to dominate the Australian ecosystem.[51] Extant native Australian terrestrial placental mammals (such as hopping mice) are relatively recent immigrants, arriving via island hopping from Southeast Asia.[52]\\r\\n\\r\\nGenetic analysis suggests a divergence date between the marsupials and the placentals at 160?million years ago.[54] The ancestral number of chromosomes has been estimated to be 2n = 14.\\r\\n\\r\\nA new hypothesis suggests that South American microbiotheres resulted from a back-dispersal from eastern Gondwana due to new cranial and post-cranial marsupial fossils from the Djarthia murgonensis from the early Eocene Tingamarra Local Fauna in Australia that indicate the Djarthia murgonensis is the most plesiomorphic, the oldest unequivocal australidelphian, and may be the ancestral morphotype of the Australian marsupial radiation.[55]","input":"Kangaroos koalas and possums belong to what mammal group?"},{"output":"Law of the Twelve Tables","context":"Roman law is the legal system of ancient Rome, including the legal developments spanning over a thousand years of jurisprudence, from the Twelve Tables (c. 449 BC), to the Corpus Juris Civilis (AD 529) ordered by Eastern Roman Emperor Justinian I. Roman law forms the basic framework for Civil law, the most used legal system today. The historical importance of Roman law is reflected by the continued use of Latin legal terminology in many legal systems influenced by it, including Common law.\\r\\nAfter the dissolution of the Western Roman Empire, the Roman law remained in effect in the Eastern Roman Empire. From the 7th century onward, the legal language in the East was Greek.\\r\\nRoman law also denoted the legal system applied in most of Western Europe until the end of the 18th century. In Germany, Roman law practice remained in place longer under the Holy Roman Empire (963ÿ1806). Roman law thus served as a basis for legal practice throughout Western continental Europe, as well as in most former colonies of these European nations, including Latin America, and also in Ethiopia. English and Anglo-American common law were influenced also by Roman law, notably in their Latinate legal glossary (for example, stare decisis, culpa in contrahendo, pacta sunt servanda).[1] Eastern Europe was also influenced by the jurisprudence of the Corpus Juris Civilis, especially in countries such as medieval Romania (Wallachia, Moldavia, and some other medieval provinces/historical regions) which created a new system, a mixture of Roman and local law. Also, Eastern European law was influenced by the \\"Farmer's Law\\" of the medieval Byzantine legal system.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nBefore the Twelve Tables (754ÿ449 BC), private law comprised the Roman civil law (ius civile Quiritium) that applied only to Roman citizens, and was bonded to religion; undeveloped, with attributes of strict formalism, symbolism, and conservatism, e.g. the ritual practice of mancipatio (a form of sale). The jurist Sextus Pomponius said, \\"At the beginning of our city, the people began their first activities without any fixed law, and without any fixed rights: all things were ruled despotically, by kings\\".[2] It is believed that Roman Law is rooted in the Etruscan religion, emphasizing ritual.[3]\\r\\nThe first legal text is the Law of the Twelve Tables, dating from the mid-5th century BC. The plebeian tribune, C. Terentilius Arsa, proposed that the law should be written, in order to prevent magistrates from applying the law arbitrarily.[4] After eight years of political struggle, the plebeian social class convinced the patricians to send a delegation to Athens, to copy the Laws of Solon; they also dispatched delegations to other Greek cities for like reason.[4] In 451 BC, according to the traditional story (as Livy tells it), ten Roman citizens were chosen to record the laws (decemviri legibus scribundis). While they were performing this task, they were given supreme political power (imperium), whereas the power of the magistrates was restricted.[4] In 450 BC, the decemviri produced the laws on ten tablets (tabulae), but these laws were regarded as unsatisfactory by the plebeians. A second decemvirate is said to have added two further tablets in 449 BC. The new Law of the Twelve Tables was approved by the people's assembly.[4]\\r\\nModern scholars tend to challenge the accuracy of Roman historians. They generally do not believe that a second decemvirate ever took place. The decemvirate of 451 is believed to have included the most controversial points of customary law, and to have assumed the leading functions in Rome.[4] Furthermore, the question on the Greek influence found in the early Roman Law is still much discussed. Many scholars consider it unlikely that the patricians sent an official delegation to Greece, as the Roman historians believed. Instead, those scholars suggest, the Romans acquired Greek legislations from the Greek cities of Magna Graecia, the main portal between the Roman and Greek worlds.[4] The original text of the Twelve Tables has not been preserved. The tablets were probably destroyed when Rome was conquered and burned by the Gauls in 387 BC.[4]\\r\\nThe fragments which did survive show that it was not a law code in the modern sense. It did not provide a complete and coherent system of all applicable rules or give legal solutions for all possible cases. Rather, the tables contained specific provisions designed to change the then-existing customary law. Although the provisions pertain to all areas of law, the largest part is dedicated to private law and civil procedure.\\r\\nMany laws include Lex Canuleia (445 BC; which allowed the marriageius connubiibetween patricians and plebeians), Leges Licinae Sextiae (367 BC; which made restrictions on possession of public lands  ager publicus  and also made sure that one of the consuls was plebeian), Lex Ogulnia (300 BC; plebeians received access to priest posts), and Lex Hortensia (287 BC; verdicts of plebeian assemblies  plebiscita  now bind all people).\\r\\nAnother important statute from the Republican era is the Lex Aquilia of 286 BC, which may be regarded as the root of modern tort law. However, Rome's most important contribution to European legal culture was not the enactment of well-drafted statutes, but the emergence of a class of professional jurists (prudentes, sing. prudens, or jurisprudentes) and of a legal science. This was achieved in a gradual process of applying the scientific methods of Greek philosophy to the subject of law, a subject which the Greeks themselves never treated as a science.\\r\\nTraditionally, the origins of Roman legal science are connected to Gnaeus Flavius. Flavius is said to have published around the year 300 BC the formularies containing the words which had to be spoken in court to begin a legal action. Before the time of Flavius, these formularies are said to have been secret and known only to the priests. Their publication made it possible for non-priests to explore the meaning of these legal texts. Whether or not this story is credible, jurists were active and legal treatises were written in larger numbers the 2nd century BC. Among the famous jurists of the republican period are Quintus Mucius Scaevola who wrote a voluminous treatise on all aspects of the law, which was very influential in later times, and Servius Sulpicius Rufus, a friend of Marcus Tullius Cicero. Thus, Rome had developed a very sophisticated legal system and a refined legal culture when the Roman republic was replaced by the monarchical system of the principate in 27 BC .\\r\\nIn the period between about 201 to 27 BC, we can see the development of more flexible laws to match the needs of the time. In addition to the old and formal ius civile a new juridical class is created: the ius honorarium, which can be defined as \\"The law introduced by the magistrates who had the right to promulgate edicts in order to support, supplement or correct the existing law.\\"[5] With this new law the old formalism is being abandoned and new more flexible principles of ius gentium are used.\\r\\nThe adaptation of law to new needs was given over to juridical practice, to magistrates, and especially to the praetors. A praetor was not a legislator and did not technically create new law when he issued his edicts (magistratuum edicta). In fact, the results of his rulings enjoyed legal protection (actionem dare) and were in effect often the source of new legal rules. A Praetor's successor was not bound by the edicts of his predecessor; however, he did take rules from edicts of his predecessor that had proved to be useful. In this way a constant content was created that proceeded from edict to edict (edictum traslatitium).\\r\\nThus, over the course of time, parallel to the civil law and supplementing and correcting it, a new body of praetoric law emerged. In fact, praetoric law was so defined by the famous Roman jurist Papinian (Amilius Papinianusdied in 212 AD): \\"Ius praetorium est quod praetores introduxerunt adiuvandi vel supplendi vel corrigendi iuris civilis gratia propter utilitatem publicam\\" (\\"praetoric law is that law introduced by praetors to supplement or correct civil law for public benefit\\"). Ultimately, civil law and praetoric law were fused in the Corpus Juris Civilis.\\r\\nThe first 250 years of the current era are the period during which Roman law and Roman legal science reached its greatest degree of sophistication. The law of this period is often referred to as the classical period of Roman law. The literary and practical achievements of the jurists of this period gave Roman law its unique shape.\\r\\nThe jurists worked in different functions: They gave legal opinions at the request of private parties. They advised the magistrates who were entrusted with the administration of justice, most importantly the praetors. They helped the praetors draft their edicts, in which they publicly announced at the beginning of their tenure, how they would handle their duties, and the formularies, according to which specific proceedings were conducted. Some jurists also held high judicial and administrative offices themselves.\\r\\nThe jurists also produced all kinds of legal punishments. Around AD 130 the jurist Salvius Iulianus drafted a standard form of the praetor's edict, which was used by all praetors from that time onwards. This edict contained detailed descriptions of all cases, in which the praetor would allow a legal action and in which he would grant a defense. The standard edict thus functioned like a comprehensive law code, even though it did not formally have the force of law. It indicated the requirements for a successful legal claim. The edict therefore became the basis for extensive legal commentaries by later classical jurists like Paulus and Ulpian. The new concepts and legal institutions developed by pre-classical and classical jurists are too numerous to mention here. Only a few examples are given here:\\r\\nThe Roman Republic had three different branches:\\r\\nThe Assemblies could decide whether war or peace. The Senate had complete control over the Treasury, and the Consuls had the highest juridical power.[6]\\r\\nBy the middle of the 3rd century, the conditions for the flourishing of a refined legal culture had become less favourable. The general political and economic situation deteriorated as the emperors assumed more direct control of all aspects of political life. The political system of the principate, which had retained some features of the republican constitution, began to transform itself into the absolute monarchy of the dominate. The existence of a legal science and of jurists who regarded law as a science, not as an instrument to achieve the political goals set by the absolute monarch, did not fit well into the new order of things. The literary production all but ended. Few jurists after the mid-3rd century are known by name. While legal science and legal education persisted to some extent in the eastern part of the Empire, most of the subtleties of classical law came to be disregarded and finally forgotten in the west. Classical law was replaced by so-called vulgar law.\\r\\nThe Roman Republic's constitution or mos maiorum (\\"custom of the ancestors\\") was an unwritten set of guidelines and principles passed down mainly through precedent. Concepts that originated in the Roman constitution live on in constitutions to this day. Examples include checks and balances, the separation of powers, vetoes, filibusters, quorum requirements, term limits, impeachments, the powers of the purse, and regularly scheduled elections. Even some lesser used modern constitutional concepts, such as the block voting found in the electoral college of the United States, originate from ideas found in the Roman constitution.\\r\\nThe constitution of the Roman Republic was not formal or even official. Its constitution was largely unwritten, and was constantly evolving throughout the life of the Republic. Throughout the 1st century BC, the power and legitimacy of the Roman constitution was progressively eroding. Even Roman constitutionalists, such as the senator Cicero, lost a willingness to remain faithful to it towards the end of the republic. When the Roman Republic ultimately fell in the years following the Battle of Actium and Mark Antony's suicide, what was left of the Roman constitution died along with the Republic. The first Roman Emperor, Augustus, attempted to manufacture the appearance of a constitution that still governed the Empire, by utilising that constitution's institutions to lend legitimacy to the Principate, e.g. reusing prior grants of greater imperium to substantiate Augustus' greater imperium over the Imperial provinces and the prorogation of different magistracies to justify Augustus' receipt of tribunician power. The belief in a surviving constitution lasted well into the life of the Roman Empire.\\r\\nStipulatio was the basic form of contract in Roman law. It was made in the format of question and answer. The precise nature of the contract was disputed, as can be seen below.\\r\\nRei vindicatio is a legal action by which the plaintiff demands that the defendant return a thing that belongs to the plaintiff. It may only be used when plaintiff owns the thing, and the defendant is somehow impeding the plaintiff's possession of the thing. The plaintiff could also institute an actio furti (a personal action) to punish the defendant. If the thing could not be recovered, the plaintiff could claim damages from the defendant with the aid of the condictio furtiva (a personal action). With the aid of the actio legis Aquiliae (a personal action), the plaintiff could claim damages from the defendant. Rei vindicatio was derived from the ius civile, therefore was only available to Roman citizens.\\r\\nTo describe a person's position in the legal system, Romans mostly used the expression togeus. The individual could have been a Roman citizen (status civitatis) unlike foreigners, or he could have been free (status libertatis) unlike slaves, or he could have had a certain position in a Roman family (status familiae) either as the head of the family (pater familias), or some lower member.*alieni iuris-which lives by someone else's law. Two status types were senator and emperor.\\r\\nThe history of Roman Law can be divided into three systems of procedure: that of legis actiones, the formulary system, and cognitio extra ordinem. The periods in which these systems were in use overlapped one another and did not have definitive breaks, but it can be stated that the legis actio system prevailed from the time of the XII Tables (c. 450 BC) until about the end of the 2nd century BC, that the formulary procedure was primarily used from the last century of the Republic until the end of the classical period (c. AD 200), and that of cognitio extra ordinem was in use in post-classical times. Again, these dates are meant as a tool to help understand the types of procedure in use, not as a rigid boundary where one system stopped and another began.[7]\\r\\nDuring the republic and until the bureaucratization of Roman judicial procedure, the judge was usually a private person (iudex privatus). He had to be a Roman male citizen. The parties could agree on a judge, or they could appoint one from a list, called album iudicum. They went down the list until they found a judge agreeable to both parties, or if none could be found they had to take the last one on the list.\\r\\nNo one had a legal obligation to judge a case. The judge had great latitude in the way he conducted the litigation. He considered all the evidence and ruled in the way that seemed just. Because the judge was not a jurist or a legal technician, he often consulted a jurist about the technical aspects of the case, but he was not bound by the jurist's reply. At the end of the litigation, if things were not clear to him, he could refuse to give a judgment, by swearing that it wasn't clear. Also, there was a maximum time to issue a judgment, which depended on some technical issues (type of action, etc.).\\r\\nLater on, with the bureaucratization, this procedure disappeared, and was substituted by the so-called \\"extra ordinem\\" procedure, also known as cognitory. The whole case was reviewed before a magistrate, in a single phase. The magistrate had obligation to judge and to issue a decision, and the decision could be appealed to a higher magistrate.\\r\\nWhen the centre of the Empire was moved to the Greek East in the 4th century, many legal concepts of Greek origin appeared in the official Roman legislation.[8] The influence is visible even in the law of persons or of the family, which is traditionally the part of the law that changes least. For example, Constantine started putting restrictions on the ancient Roman concept of patria potestas, the power held by the male head of a family over his descendents, by acknowledging that persons in potestate, the descendents, could have proprietary rights. He was apparently making concessions to the much stricter concept of paternal authority under Greek-Hellenistic law.[8] The Codex Theodosianus (438 AD) was a codification of Constantian laws. Later emperors went even further, until Justinian finally decreed that a child in potestate became owner of everything it acquired, except when it acquired something from its father.[8]\\r\\nThe codes of Justinian, particularly the Corpus Juris Civilis (529-534) continued to be the basis of legal practice in the Empire throughout its so-called Byzantine history. Leo III the Isaurian issued a new code, the Ecloga,[9] in the early 8th century. In the 9th century, the emperors Basil I and Leo VI the Wise commissioned a combined translation of the Code and the Digest, parts of Justinian's codes, into Greek, which became known as the Basilica. Roman law as preserved in the codes of Justinian and in the Basilica remained the basis of legal practice in Greece and in the courts of the Eastern Orthodox Church even after the fall of the Byzantine Empire and the conquest by the Turks, and also formed the basis for much of the Fetha Negest, which remained in force in Ethiopia until 1931.\\r\\nThe Roman Laws up to Justinian (first 50 years) are almost fully in US Federal Code to be found (or US regulations), though not always applying as wide as they had been originally written (statutory interpretation). (Many of Justinian's Christian laws were repealed later, though religion was still high in consideration by law.)\\r\\nIt should be remembered that the first university (not to be confused with college) was in Rome (not England) and taught these laws to spread them to all of Europe \\"the same\\" (without modification): universal law. The Roman \\"university\\" was popular in its time. University law, then medicine (also an advancement of Romans - surgical tools), were taught at universities with the concept that all of them taught exactly the same words and meanings. Many of today's universities have long lapsed into being \\"colleges\\" but incorrectly retain the title. (Two students from different schools may not be able to relate to one another as the teachings and words are different. It was the intent of the Roman University to prevent the same happening with their body of law.)[citation needed]\\r\\nIn the west, Justinian's political authority never went any farther than certain portions of the Italian and Hispanic peninsulas. In Law codes were issued by the Germanic kings, however, the influence of early Eastern Roman codes on some of these is quite discernible. In many early Germanic states, Roman citizens continued to be governed by Roman laws for quite some time, even while members of the various Germanic tribes were governed by their own respective codes.\\r\\nThe Codex Justinianus and the Institutes of Justinian were known in Western Europe, and along with the earlier code of Theodosius II, served as models for a few of the Germanic law codes; however, the Digest portion was largely ignored for several centuries until around 1070, when a manuscript of the Digest was rediscovered in Italy. This was done mainly through the works of glossars who wrote their comments between lines (glossa interlinearis), or in the form of marginal notes (glossa marginalis). From that time, scholars began to study the ancient Roman legal texts, and to teach others what they learned from their studies. The center of these studies was Bologna. The law school there gradually developed into Europe's first university.\\r\\nThe students who were taught Roman law in Bologna (and later in many other places) found that many rules of Roman law were better suited to regulate complex economic transactions than were the customary rules, which were applicable throughout Europe. For this reason, Roman law, or at least some provisions borrowed from it, began to be re-introduced into legal practice, centuries after the end of the Roman empire. This process was actively supported by many kings and princes who employed university-trained jurists as counselors and court officials and sought to benefit from rules like the famous Princeps legibus solutus est (\\"The sovereign is not bound by the laws\\", a phrase initially coined by Ulpian, a Roman jurist).\\r\\nThere are several reasons that Roman law was favored in the Middle Ages. Roman law regulated the legal protection of property and the equality of legal subjects and their wills, and it prescribed the possibility that the legal subjects could dispose their property through testament.\\r\\nBy the middle of the 16th century, the rediscovered Roman law dominated the legal practice of many European countries. A legal system, in which Roman law was mixed with elements of canon law and of Germanic custom, especially feudal law, had emerged. This legal system, which was common to all of continental Europe (and Scotland) was known as Ius Commune. This Ius Commune and the legal systems based on it are usually referred to as civil law in English-speaking countries.\\r\\nOnly England and the Nordic countries did not take part in the wholesale reception of Roman law. One reason for this is that the English legal system was more developed than its continental counterparts by the time Roman law was rediscovered. Therefore, the practical advantages of Roman law were less obvious to English practitioners than to continental lawyers. As a result, the English system of common law developed in parallel to Roman-based civil law, with its practitioners being trained at the Inns of Court in London rather than receiving degrees in Canon or Civil Law at the Universities of Oxford or Cambridge. Elements of Romano-canon law were present in England in the ecclesiastical courts and, less directly, through the development of the equity system. In addition, some concepts from Roman law made their way into the common law. Especially in the early 19th century, English lawyers and judges were willing to borrow rules and ideas from continental jurists and directly from Roman law.\\r\\nThe practical application of Roman law and the era of the European Ius Commune came to an end, when national codifications were made. In 1804, the French civil code came into force. In the course of the 19th century, many European states either adopted the French model or drafted their own codes. In Germany, the political situation made the creation of a national code of laws impossible. From the 17th century, Roman law in Germany had been heavily influenced by domestic (common) law, and it was called usus modernus Pandectarum. In some parts of Germany, Roman law continued to be applied until the German civil code (Brgerliches Gesetzbuch, BGB) came into force in 1900.[citation needed]\\r\\nColonial expansion spread the civil law system.[10]\\r\\nToday, Roman law is no longer applied in legal practice, even though the legal systems of some countries like South Africa and San Marino are still based on the old jus commune. However, even where the legal practice is based on a code, many rules deriving from Roman law apply: no code completely broke with the Roman tradition. Rather, the provisions of the Roman law were fitted into a more coherent system and expressed in the national language. For this reason, knowledge of the Roman law is indispensable to understand the legal systems of today. Thus, Roman law is often still a mandatory subject for law students in civil law jurisdictions.\\r\\nAs steps towards a unification of the private law in the member states of the European Union are being taken, the old jus commune, which was the common basis of legal practice everywhere in Europe, but allowed for many local variants, is seen by many as a model.","input":"What was rome's first set of written laws called?"},{"output":"The Mickey Mouse Club","context":"Fred Newman (1989 revival, seasons 1-6)\\r\\nThe Mickey Mouse Club is an American variety television show that aired intermittently from 1955 to 1996 and returned in 2017 to social media. Created by Walt Disney and produced by Walt Disney Productions, the program was first televised in 1955 by ABC, featuring a regular but ever-changing cast of mostly teen performers. ABC broadcast reruns weekday afternoons during the 1958ÿ1959 season, airing right after American Bandstand. The show was revived after its initial 1955ÿ1959 run on ABC, first from 1977ÿ1979 for first-run syndication, again from 1989ÿ1996 as The All-New Mickey Mouse Club (also known to fans as MMC from 1993ÿ1996) airing exclusively on cable television's The Disney Channel, then rebooted in 2017 with the moniker Club Mickey Mouse airing exclusively on internet social media.\\r\\nMickey Mouse himself appeared in every show not only in vintage cartoons originally made for theatrical release but in opening, interstitial, and closing segments made especially for the show. In both the vintage cartoons and new animated segments, Mickey was voiced by his creator Walt Disney. (Disney had previously voiced the character theatrically from 1928 to 1947 before being replaced by sound effects artist Jimmy MacDonald.)\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe first official theater-based Mickey Mouse Club began on January 11, 1930 at the Fox Dome Theater in Ocean Park, California, with sixty theaters hosting clubs by March 31. The Club released its first issue of the Official Bulletin of the Mickey Mouse Club on April 15, 1930.[1] By 1932, the Club had 1 million members, and in 1933 its first British club opened at Darlington's Arcade Cinema.[2][3] In 1935, Disney began to phase out the club.[4]\\r\\nThe Mickey Mouse Club was hosted by Jimmie Dodd, a songwriter and the Head Mouseketeer, who provided leadership both on and off screen. In addition to his other contributions, he often provided short segments encouraging young viewers to make the right moral choices. These little homilies became known as \\"Doddisms\\".[5] Roy Williams, a staff artist at Disney, also appeared in the show as the Big Mouseketeer. Roy suggested the Mickey and Minnie Mouse ears worn by the cast members, which he helped create, along with Chuck Keehne, Hal Adelquist, and Bill Walsh.\\r\\nThe main cast members were called Mouseketeers, and they performed in a variety of musical and dance numbers, as well as some informational segments. The most popular of the Mouseketeers comprised the so-called Red Team, which consisted of the following:\\r\\nOther Mouseketeers that were Red Team members but not on the show for all three seasons included the following:\\r\\nThe remaining Mouseketeers, consisting of the White or Blue Teams, were Don Agrati (later known as Don Grady when starring as \\"Robbie\\" on the long-running sitcom My Three Sons), Sherry Alberoni, Billie Jean Beanblossom, Eileen Diamond, Dickie Dodd (not related to Jimmie Dodd), Mary Espinosa, Bonnie Lynn Fields,[6] Judy Harriet, Linda Hughes, Dallas Johann, John Lee Johann, Bonni Lou Kern, Charlie Laney, Larry Larsen, Paul Petersen, Lynn Ready, Mickey Rooney Jr., Tim Rooney, Mary Sartori, Bronson Scott, Margene Storey, Ronnie Steiner, and Mark Sutherland.[7] Larry Larsen, on only for the 1956ÿ57 season, was the oldest Mouseketeer, being born in 1939, and Bronson Scott, on only the 1955-56 season, was the youngest Mouseketeer, being born in July 1947. Among the thousands who auditioned but didn't make the cut were future vocalist/songwriter Paul Williams and future actress Candice Bergen.\\r\\nThe 39 Mouseketeers and the seasons they were featured in (with the team color they belonged to listed for each season):\\r\\nOther notable non-Mouseketeer performers appeared in various dramatic segments:[5]\\r\\nThese non-Mouseketeers primarily appeared in numerous original serials filmed for the series, only some of which have appeared in reruns. Certain Mouseketeers were also featured in some of the serials, particularly Annette Funicello and Darlene Gillespie.\\r\\nMajor serials included the following:[5]\\r\\n\\"Border Collie\\"\\r\\nThe opening theme, \\"The Mickey Mouse March,\\" was written by the show's primary adult host, Jimmie Dodd.[5] It was also reprised at the end of each episode, with the slower it's-time-to-say-goodbye verse. A shorter version of the opening title was used later in the series, in syndication, and on Disney Channel reruns. Dodd also wrote many other songs used in individual segments over the course of the series.\\r\\nEach day of the week had a special show theme, which was reflected in the various segments. The themes were:\\r\\nThe series ran on ABC Television for an hour each weekday in the 1955ÿ1956 and 1956ÿ1957 seasons (from 5:00 to 6:00?pm ET), and only a half-hour weekdays (5:30 to 6:00?p.m. ET) in 1957ÿ1958, the final season to feature new programming.[8] Although the show returned for the 1958ÿ1959 season (5:30 to 6:00?p.m. ET), these programs were repeats from the first two seasons, re-cut into a half-hour format. The Mickey Mouse Club was featured on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays, and Walt Disney's Adventure Time, featuring re-runs of The Mickey Mouse Club serials and several re-edited segments from Disneyland and Walt Disney Presents, appeared on Tuesdays and Thursdays.\\r\\nAlthough the show remained popular, ABC decided to cancel the show after its fourth season, as Disney and the ABC network could not come to terms for renewal.[9] The cancellation in September 1959 was attributable to several factors: the Disney studios did not realize high-profit margins from merchandise sales, the sponsors were uninterested in educational programming for children, and many commercials were needed in order to pay for the show. After canceling The Mickey Mouse Club, ABC also refused to let Disney air the show on another network.[10] Walt Disney filed a lawsuit against ABC, and won the damages in a settlement; however, he had to agree that both the Mickey Mouse Club and Zorro could not be aired on any major network. This left Walt Disney Presents (initially titled Disneyland, later retitled the Walt Disney's Wonderful World of Color when it moved to NBC) as the only Disney series left on prime time until 1972 when The Mouse Factory went on the air. The prohibition against major U.S. broadcast network play of the original Mickey Mouse Club (or any later version) became moot when Disney acquired ABC in 1996, but no plans have been announced for an ABC airing of any version of The Mickey Mouse Club produced between 1955 and 1996 or for a new network series.\\r\\nAlthough the series had been discontinued in the United States, many members of the cast assembled for highly successful tours of Australia in 1959 and 1960. The television series was very successful in Australia and was still running on Australian television. The cast surprised Australian audiences, as by then they had physically matured and in some cases, bore little resemblance to the young cast with whom Australians were so familiar. Mainstream television did not reach Australia until 1956 so the series screened well into the 1960s when the back catalogue expired.\\r\\nIn response to continuing audience demand, the original Mickey Mouse Club went into edited syndicated half-hour reruns that enjoyed wide distribution starting in the fall of 1962, achieving strong ratings especially during its first three seasons in syndicated release. (because of its popularity in some markets, a few stations continued to carry it into 1968 before the series was finally withdrawn from syndication). Some new features were added such as Fun with Science, aka \\"Professor Wonderful\\" (with scientist Julius Sumner Miller) and Marvelous Marvin in the 1964ÿ1965 season; Jimmie Dodd appeared in several of these new segments before his death in November 1964. Many markets stretched the program back to an hour's daily run time during the 1960s rerun cycle by adding locally produced and hosted portions involving educational subjects and live audience participation of local children, in a manner not unlike Romper Room.\\r\\nIn response to an upsurge in demand from baby boomers entering adulthood, the show again went into syndicated reruns from January 20, 1975, until January 14, 1977. It has since been rerun on cable specialty channels Disney in the U.S. and Family in Canada. The original Mickey Mouse Club films aired five days a week on The Disney Channel from its launch in 1983 until the third version of the series began in 1989. The last airing of the edited 1950s material was on Disney Channel's Vault Disney from 1997 to September 2002. During the baseball seasons in 1975 and 1976, WGN-TV in Chicago, Illinois aired the MMC on a delayed basis due to Cubs ballgame coverages.\\r\\nAnnette Funicello and Tim Considine were reunited on The New Mickey Mouse Club in 1977. Darlene Gillespie and Cubby O'Brien were also reunited on another episode of the same series.\\r\\n31 of the 39 original Mouseketeers were reunited for a TV special, which aired on Disney's Wonderful World in November 1980.\\r\\nCast members Annette Funicello, Bobby Burgess, Tommy Cole, Sharon Baird, Don Grady, and Sherry Alberoni were reunited on the 100th episode of The All-New Mickey Mouse Club, during the show's third season in 1991.\\r\\nMouseketeers Doreen Tracey, Cubby O'Brien, Sherry Alberoni, Sharon Baird, Don Grady, Cheryl Holdridge, Bobby Burgess, Karen Pendleton, Tommy Cole, and Mary Espinosa performed together at Disneyland in the fall of 2005, in observance of Disneyland's 50th birthday, and the 50th anniversary of the TV premiere of The Mickey Mouse Club.\\r\\nIn the 1977 Walt Disney Productions revived the concept, but modernized the show cosmetically, with a disco re-recording of the theme song and a more ethnically diverse group of young cast members. The sets were brightly colored and simpler than the detailed black and white artwork of the original. Like the original, nearly each day's episode included a vintage cartoon, though usually in color from the late 1930s and onward. The 1977 Mouseketeers were part of the halftime show of Super Bowl XI on January 9, 1977.\\r\\nSerials were usually old Disney movies, cut into segments for twice-weekly inclusion. Movies included Third Man on the Mountain, The Misadventures of Merlin Jones and its sequel The Monkey's Uncle (both starring Tommy Kirk), Emil and the Detectives (retitled The Three Skrinks), Tonka (retitled A Horse Called Comanche), The Horse Without a Head (about a toy horse), and Toby Tyler (starring Kevin Corcoran). In addition, one original serial was produced, The Mystery of Rustler's Cave, starring Kim Richards and Robbie Rist.\\r\\nTheme days were:\\r\\nThe series debuted on January 17, 1977, on 38 local television stations in the United States, and by June of that same year, when the series was discontinued, about 70 stations in total had picked up the series. Additional stations picked up the canceled program, which continued to run until January 12, 1979; 130 new episodes, with much of the original material repackaged and a bit of new footage added, and a shortened version of the theme song, were produced to start airing September 5, 1977. Since the 1970s, the series has aired only briefly in reruns, unlike its 1950s predecessor, and while both the 1950s and 1989/1990s series had DVD releases of select episodes in July 2005, the 1970s series has been largely forgotten including the generation of youthful viewers. On November 20, 1977, \\"The Mouseketeers at Walt Disney World\\" was shown on The Wonderful World of Disney. WGN-TV in Chicago, Illinois also aired this version on a delayed basis in 1977 and 1978 during the Cubs baseball season due to game coverages.\\r\\nThe cast of twelve (5 boys and 7 girls) had a more diverse ethnic background than the 1950s version. Several 1977ÿ1978 cast members went on to become TV stars and other notable icons.\\r\\nThe show's most notable alumna was Lisa Whelchel (born in 1963, in Littlefield, Texas), who later starred in the NBC television sitcom The Facts of Life before becoming a well-known Christian author and, most recently, overall runner-up, and winner of the $100,000 viewers' choice award, on the fall 2012 season of the CBS television reality series Survivor. Mouseketeer Julie Piekarski (born St. Louis, 1963) also appeared with Lisa Whelchel on the first season of The Facts of Life. Kelly Parsons (born Coral Gables, Fla., 1964) went on to become a beauty queen and runner-up to Miss USA.\\r\\nOther Mouseketeers (from seasons 1ÿ2 (1977)) from the 1977 show:[7]\\r\\nDisney voice actor and sound effects editor Wayne Allwine voiced Mickey Mouse in the animated lead-ins for the show, replacing Jimmy MacDonald, who in 1947 had replaced Walt Disney as the voice of Mickey for theatrical cartoons. Walt Disney had been the original voice of Mickey and for the original 19541959 run provided the voice for animated introductions to the original TV show but had died in 1966. Allwine would keep providing the voice for the character up to his death in 2009.\\r\\nFuture rock musician Courtney Love claims to have auditioned for a part on the show, reading a poem by Sylvia Plath; she was not selected.[11]\\r\\nFormer Mouseketeer Annette Funicello and Mouseketeer serial star Tim Considine guest starred in one episode; Former Mouseketeers Darlene Gillespie and Cubby O'Brien were also reunited on a different episode.\\r\\nThe lyrics of the \\"Mickey Mouse Club March\\" theme song were slightly different from the original, with two additional lines: \\"He's our favorite Mouseketeer; we know you will agree\\" and \\"Take some fun and mix in love, our happy recipe.\\"\\r\\nA soundtrack album[12] was released with the show.\\r\\nA new rendition of the \\"Mickey Mouse Club March\\" was made later on in 1999 by Mannheim Steamroller, a contemporary band, in hopes of connecting new-age children and their parents who watched the Mickey Mouse Club.\\r\\nThis incarnation was not distributed by Disney alone; while Disney did produce the series, it was co-produced and distributed by SFM Entertainment, which also handled 1970s-era syndication of the original 1950s series (Disney since regained sole distribution rights).\\r\\nReruns of the original The Mickey Mouse Club began airing on The Disney Channel with the channel's 1983 launch. While the show was popular with younger audiences, The Disney Channel executives felt it had become dated over the years, particularly as it was aired in black-and-white. Their answer was to create a brand-new version of the Club, one geared toward contemporary audiences. Notably, the all-new \\"club-members\\" would wear high-school like Mouseketeer jackets without the iconic Mickey Mouse ears. This show was called The All-New Mickey Mouse Club (also known as \\"MMC\\" to fans).\\r\\nThis version of the series is notable for featuring a number of cast members who went on to international success in music and acting, including Tony Lucca, Chasen Hampton, Britney Spears, Christina Aguilera, Justin Timberlake, JC Chasez, Nikki DeLoach, Keri Russell, and Ryan Gosling.\\r\\nThis was the first version of the club to have any studio audience, though a fairly small group.\\r\\nFormer Mouseketeer Don Grady guest-starred on an episode during the show's first season. Grady, along with fellow Mouseketeers Annette Funicello, Bobby Burgess, Tommy Cole, Sharon Baird, and Sherry Alberoni were reunited on the 100th episode, during the show's third season. Funicello would later appear on the show again, in an interview with the Mouseketeer Lindsey Alley.\\r\\nFrom the first through fifth seasons, the series aired Monday through Friday at 5:30pm. Through Season 6, the show aired Monday to Thursday. In its final season, Season 7, it aired Thursdays only at 7:00pm (later moved a half hour later, to 7:30pm). The series premiered Monday, April 24, 1989, ended production in October 1994, and aired its last original episode in 1996. Seasons 3 and 5 had the most episodes (55, each season). Seasons 4 and 6 were shorter, having about 35 episodes each. The remaining seasons were a standard 45 episodes (44 in Season 7) each.\\r\\nThe show was known for its sketch comedy. Some of the sketches played off well-known movies, musicals, and even cartoons, as well as holiday-related skits. During the final season, some of the skits showed everyday occurrences experienced by teens, often teaching viewers a lesson on how to handle real-life situations.\\r\\nThe series featured music videos of the Mouseketeers singing their versions of popular songs in front of a live studio audience or in the Walt Disney World Resort. This became one of the most popular segments.\\r\\nA unique feature of the show was the Mouseketeers performing concerts on certain days (which were usually taped the day before or in the summer, when the kids had more time). During the final season, the concerts were replaced primarily by live performances that featured singing and dancing in front of the audience.\\r\\nThis version maintained the \\"theme day\\" format from the previous two versions. When Disney decided to revamp the show for its final season, the show was reduced to a single weekly airing, shown only on Thursdays. Although still produced as a daily series during the final season taping in 1994, The Disney Channel, after cancelling the series once Season 7 production had concluded, decided to air the final season in a weekly format, therefore stretching the first run episodes into early 1996. The final season premiered in May 1995, almost a year after production had started and 6+ months after the series finale was taped.\\r\\nTheme days were as follows:\\r\\nThe adult co-hosts for the show were Fred Newman (1989ÿ1993, Seasons 1-6)), Mowava Pryor (1989ÿ1990, Seasons 1ÿ3)), and Terri Misner Eoff (1991ÿ1993 (Seasons 4ÿ6)).\\r\\nThe 35 Mouseketeers and the seasons they were featured in:[5]\\r\\nDuring the last two seasons of MMC they had a TV series called Emerald Cove with the cast:\\r\\nOn September 8, 2017, it was announced that the Mickey Mouse Club will be rebooted under the name \\"Club Mickey Mouse\\" with a new set of Mouseketeers,[13] and for the first time, the series will be available on Facebook and Instagram, rather than its original half hour to full hour format on television, and will be more like a reality show than a variety show, with about 90% of its content being behind the scenes. This incarnation of the Mickey Mouse Club features eight Mouseketeers who range in age from 15 to 18 (rather than 8 to 14 like the original): Regan Aliyah, Jenna Alvarez, Ky Baldwin, Gabe De Guzman, Leanne Tessa Langston, Brianna Mazzola, Sean Oliu, and Will Simmons.[14] The Mouseketeers will also be joined by Todrick Hall, who will serve as a mentor to the young cast, and Jenn Chia as the host.[15]\\r\\nOn July 9, 2015, it was announced that a new version of the series will debut on July 23, 2015 on Disney Channel (South Korea). The format of revival will include musical performances, games, and skits, as same as the original one in the US. It's planned that the series will have two pilot episodes and ten regular episodes. The Mouseketeers will consist of nine members of S.M. Entertainment's pre-debut group called SM Rookies including five boys  Mark, Jeno, Donghyuck, Jaemin, and Jisung  and four girls  Koeun, Hina, Herin, and Lami.\\r\\nThe series was hosted by Leeteuk, the leader of Super Junior.[16]\\r\\nThe show ended on December 17, 2015.\\r\\nOn May 4, 2017, it was announced that Club Mickey Mouse will be created in Malaysia.[17] The format will include musical performances, games and comedy sketches.\\r\\nThe series is hosted by YouTube personality, Charis Ow, and premiered on Disney Channel Asia on September 15, 2017.[18]","input":"What was the old mickey mouse show called?"},{"output":"Jeff Greene","context":"Palazzo di Amore is a house in Los Angeles, California.

Skinner","context":"Social learning theory is a theory of learning and social behavior which proposes that new behaviors can be acquired by observing and imitating others.[1] It states that learning is a cognitive process that takes place in a social context and can occur purely through observation or direct instruction, even in the absence of motor reproduction or direct reinforcement.[2] In addition to the observation of behavior, learning also occurs through the observation of rewards and punishments, a process known as vicarious reinforcement. When a particular behavior is rewarded regularly, it will most likely persist; conversely, if a particular behavior is constantly punished, it will most likely desist.[3] The theory expands on traditional behavioral theories, in which behavior is governed solely by reinforcements, by placing emphasis on the important roles of various internal processes in the learning individual.[1]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the 1940s, B.F. Skinner delivered a series of lectures on verbal behavior, putting forth a more empirical approach to the subject than existed in psychology at the time.[4] In them, he proposed the use of stimulus-response theories to describe language use and development, and that all verbal behavior was underpinned by operant conditioning. He did however mention that some forms of speech derived from words and sounds that had previously been heard (echoic response), and that reinforcement from parents allowed these 'echoic responses' to be pared down to that of understandable speech. While he denied that there was any \\"instinct or faculty of imitation\\",[4] Skinner's behaviorist theories formed a basis for redevelopment into social learning theory.\\r\\nAt around the same time, Clark Lewis Hull, an American psychologist, was a strong proponent of behaviorist stimulus-response theories,[5] and headed a group at Yale University's Institute of Human Relations. Under him, Neil Miller and John Dollard aimed to come up with a reinterpretation of psychoanalytic theory in terms of stimulus-response. This led to their book, Social Learning Theory, published in 1941, which posited that personality consisted of learned habits. They used Hull's drive theory, where a drive is a need that stimulates a behavioral response, crucially conceiving a drive of imitation, which was positively reinforced by social interaction and widespread as a result.[6]\\r\\nJulian B. Rotter, a professor at Ohio State University published his book, Social Learning and Clinical Psychology in 1954.[7] His theories moved away from the strictly behaviorist learning of the past, and considered instead the holistic interaction between the individual and the environment. In his theory, the social environment and individual personality created probabilities of behavior, and the reinforcement of these behaviors led to learning.He emphasized the subjective nature of the responses and effectiveness of reinforcement types.[7] While his theory used vocabulary common to that of behaviorism, the focus on internal functioning and traits differentiated his theories, and can be seen as a precursor to more cognitive approaches to learning.[6]\\r\\nIn 1959, Noam Chomsky published his criticism[8] of Skinner's book Verbal Behavior, an extension of Skinner's initial lectures.[9] In his review, Chomsky stated that pure stimulus-response theories of behavior could not account for the process of language acquisition, an argument that contributed significantly to psychology's cognitive revolution. He theorized that \\"human beings are somehow specially designed to\\" understand and acquire language, ascribing a definite but unknown cognitive mechanism to it.[8]\\r\\nWithin this context, Albert Bandura studied learning processes that occurred in interpersonal contexts and were not adequately explained by theories of operant conditioning or existing models of social learning.[2] Specifically, Bandura argued that \\"the weaknesses of learning approaches that discount the influence of social variables are nowhere more clearly revealed than in their treatment of the acquisition of novel responses.\\"[2] Skinner's explanation of the acquisition of new responses relied on the process of successive approximation, which required multiple trials, reinforcement for components of behavior, and gradual change.[10] Rotter's theory proposed that the likelihood of a behavior occurring was a function of the subjective expectancy and value of the reinforcement.[11] This model assumed a hierarchy of existing responses and thus did not (according to Bandura[2]) account for a response that had not yet been learned. Bandura began to conduct studies of the rapid acquisition of novel behaviors via social observation, the most famous of which were the Bobo doll experiments.\\r\\nSocial learning theory integrated behavioral and cognitive theories of learning in order to provide a comprehensive model that could account for the wide range of learning experiences that occur in the real world. As initially outlined by Bandura and Walters in 1963[2] and further detailed in 1977,[12] key tenets of social learning theory are as follows:[13]\\r\\nTypical stimulus-response theories rely entirely upon direct experience (of the stimulus) to inform behavior. Bandura opens up the scope of learning mechanisms by introducing observation as a possibility.[1] He adds to this the ability of modeling ÿ a means by which humans \\"represent actual outcomes symbolically\\".[1] These models, cognitively mediated, allow future consequences to have as much of an impact as actual consequences would in a typical S-R theory. An important factor in social learning theory is the concept of reciprocal determinism. This notion states that just as an individual's behavior is influenced by the environment, the environment is also influenced by the individual's behavior.[12] In other words, a person's behavior, environment, and personal qualities all reciprocally influence each other. For example, a child who plays violent video games will likely influence their peers to play as well, which then encourages the child to play more often. This could lead to the child becoming desensitized to violence, which in turn will likely affect the child's real life behaviors.\\r\\nSocial learning theory draws heavily on the concept of modeling as described above. Bandura outlined three types of modeling stimuli:\\r\\nExactly what information is gleaned from observation is influenced by the type of model, as well as a series of cognitive and behavioral processes, including:[14]\\r\\nSocial learning theory has more recently applied alongside and been used to justify the theory of cultural intelligence.[17] The cultural intelligence hypothesis argues that humans possess a set of specific behaviors and skills that allow them to exchange information culturally.[18] This hinges on a model of human learning where social learning is key, and that humans have selected for traits that maximize opportunities for social learning. The theory builds on extant social theory by suggesting that social learning abilities, like Bandura's cognitive processes required for modeling, correlate with other forms of intelligence and learning.[17] Experimental evidence has shown that humans overimitate behavior compared to chimpanzees, lending credence to the idea that we have selected for methods of social learning.[19] Some academics have suggested that our ability to learn socially and culturally have led to our success as a species.[20]\\r\\nRecent research in neuroscience has implicated mirror neurons as a neurophysiology basis for social learning, observational learning, motor cognition and social cognition.[21] Mirror neurons have been heavily linked to social learning in humans. Mirror neurons were first discovered in primates in studies which involved teaching the monkey motor activity tasks. One such study, focused on teaching primates to crack nuts with a hammer. When the primate witnessed another individual cracking nuts with a hammer, the mirror neuron systems became activated as the primate learned to use the hammer to crack nuts. However, when the primate was not presented with a social learning opportunity, the mirror neuron systems did not activate and learning did not occur.[22] Similar studies with humans also show similar evidence to the human mirror neuron system activating when observing another person perform a physical task. The activation of the mirror neuron system is thought to be critical for the understanding of goal directed behaviors and understanding their intention. Although still controversial, this provides a direct neurological link to understanding social cognition.[23]\\r\\nSocial learning theory has been used to explain the emergence and maintenance of deviant behavior, especially aggression. Criminologists Ronald Akers and Robert Burgess integrated the principles of social learning theory and operant conditioning with Edwin Sutherland's Differential Association Theory to create a comprehensive theory of criminal behavior.[24][25] Burgess and Akers emphasized that criminal behavior is learned in both social and nonsocial situations through combinations of direct reinforcement, vicarious reinforcement, explicit instruction, and observation. Both the probability of being exposed to certain behaviors and the nature of the reinforcement are dependent on group norms.\\r\\nIn her book Theories of Developmental Psychology, Patricia H. Miller lists both moral development and gender-role development as important areas of research within social learning theory.[26] Social learning theorists emphasize observable behavior regarding the acquisition of these two skills. For gender-role development, the same-sex parent provides only one of many models from which the individual learns gender-roles. Social learning theory also emphasizes the variable nature of moral development due to the changing social circumstances of each decision: \\"The particular factors the child thinks are important vary from situation to situation, depending on variables such as which situational factors are operating, which causes are most salient, and what the child processes cognitively. Moral judgments involve a complex process of considering and weighing various criteria in a given social situation.\\"[26]\\r\\nFor social learning theory, gender development has to do with the interactions of numerous social factors, involving all the interactions the individual encounters. For social learning theory, biological factors are important but take a back seat to the importance of learned, observable behavior. Because of the highly gendered society in which an individual might develop, individuals begin to distinguish people by gender even as infants. Bandura's account of gender allows for more than cognitive factors in predicting gendered behavior: for Bandura, motivational factors and a broad network of social influences determine if, when, and where gender knowledge is expressed.[26]\\r\\nSocial Learning theory proposes that rewards aren't the sole force behind creating motivation. Thoughts, beliefs, morals, and feedback all help to motivate us. Three other ways in which we learn are vicarious experience, verbal persuasion, and physiological states. Modeling, or the scenario in which we see someone's behaviors and adopt them as our own, aide the learning process as well as mental states and the cognitive process.(citation? more description)\\r\\nPrinciples of social learning theory have been applied extensively to the study of media violence. Akers and Burgess hypothesized that observed or experienced positive rewards and lack of punishment for aggressive behaviors reinforces aggression. Many research studies have discovered significant correlations between viewing violent television and aggression later in life and many have not, as well as playing violent video games and aggressive behaviors.[27][28] The role of observational learning has also been cited as an important factor in the rise of rating systems for TV, movies, and video games.\\r\\nEntertainment-education in the form of a telenovela or soap opera can help viewers learn socially desired behaviors in a positive way from models portrayed in these programs.[29] The telenovela format allows the creators to incorporate elements that can bring a desired response.[30] These elements may include music, actors, melodrama, props or costumes.[30] Entertainment education is symbolic modeling and has a formula with three sets of characters with the cultural value that is to be examined is determined ahead of time:\\r\\nWithin this formula there are at least three doubters that represent the demographic group within the target population.[30] One of these doubters will accept the value less than halfway through, the second will accept the value two-thirds of the way through and the third doubter does not accept the value and is seriously punished. This doubter is usually killed.[30] Positive social behaviors are reinforced with rewards and negative social behaviors are reinforced with punishment. At the end of the episode a short epilog done by a recognizable figure summarizes the educational content and within the program viewers are given resources in their community.[29]\\r\\nThrough observational learning a model can bring forth new ways of thinking and behaving.[31] With a modeled emotional experience, the observer shows an affinity towards people, places and objects.[29] They dislike what the models do not like and like what the models care about.[31] Television helps contribute to how viewers see their social reality.[29] \\"Media representations gain influence because people's social constructions of reality depend heavily on what they see, hear and read rather than what they experience directly\\".[29] Any effort to change beliefs must be directed towards the sociocultural norms and practices at the social system level.[29] Before a drama is developed, extensive research is done through focus groups that represent the different sectors within a culture. Participants are asked what problems in society concern them most and what obstacles they face, giving creators of the drama culturally relevant information to incorporate into the show.[29]\\r\\nThe pioneer of entertainment-education is Miguel Sabido a creative writer/producer/director in the 1970s at the Mexican national television system, Televisa. Sabido spent 8 years working on a method that would create social change and is known as the Sabido Method.[30] He credits Albert Bandura's social learning theory, the drama theory of Eric Bentley, Carl Jung's theory of archetypes, MacLean's triune brain theory and Sabido's own soap opera theory for influences his method.[32] Sabido's method has been used worldwide to address social issues such as national literacy, population growth and health concerns such as HIV.[29]\\r\\nAnother important application of social learning theory has been in the treatment and conceptualization of anxiety disorders. The classical conditioning approach to anxiety disorders, which spurred the development of behavioral therapy and is considered by some to be the first modern theory of anxiety,[33] began to lose steam in the late 1970s as researchers began to question its underlying assumptions. For example, the classical conditioning approach holds that pathological fear and anxiety are developed through direct learning; however, many people with anxiety disorders cannot recall a traumatic conditioning event, in which the feared stimulus was experienced in close temporal and spatial contiguity with an intrinsically aversive stimulus.[34][35] Social learning theory helped salvage learning approaches to anxiety disorders by providing additional mechanisms beyond classical conditioning that could account for the acquisition of fear. For example, social learning theory suggests that a child could acquire a fear of snakes by observing a family member express fear in response to snakes. Alternatively, the child could learn the associations between snakes and unpleasant bites through direct experience, without developing excessive fear, but could later learn from others that snakes can have deadly venom, leading to a re-evaluation of the dangerousness of snake bites, and accordingly, a more exaggerated fear response to snakes.[36]\\r\\nMany classroom and teaching strategies draw on principles of social learning to enhance students' knowledge acquisition and retention. For example, using the technique of guided participation, a teacher says a phrase and asks the class to repeat the phrase. Thus, students both imitate and reproduce the teacher's action, aiding retention. An extension of guided participation is reciprocal learning, in which both student and teacher share responsibility in leading discussions.[37] Additionally, teachers can shape the classroom behavior of students by modelling appropriate behavior and visibly rewarding students for good behavior. By emphasizing the teacher's role as model and encouraging the students to adopt the position of observer, the teacher can make knowledge and practices explicit to students, enhancing their learning outcomes.[38]\\r\\nIn modern field of computational intelligence, the social learning theory is adopted to develop a new computer optimization algorithm, the social learning algorithm.[39] Emulating the observational learning and reinforcement behaviors, a virtual society deployed in the algorithm seeks the strongest behavioral patterns with the best outcome. This corresponds to searching for the best solution in solving optimization problems. Compared with other bio-inspired global optimization algorithms that mimic natural evolution or animal behaviors, the social learning algorithm has its prominent advantages. First, since the self-improvement through learning is more direct and rapid than the evolution process, the social learning algorithm can improve the efficiency of the algorithms mimicking natural evolution. Second, compared with the interaction and learning behaviors in animal groups, the social learning process of human beings exhibits a higher level of intelligence. By emulating human learning behaviors, it is possible to arrive at more effective optimizers than existing swarm intelligence algorithms. Experimental results have demonstrated the effectiveness and efficiency of the social learning algorithm, which has in turn also verified through computer simulations the outcomes of the social learning behavior in human society.[39]","input":"Who came up with the social learning theory?"},{"output":"Oak Hall High School in Gainesville","context":"William Lawrence Muschamp (born August 3, 1971) is an American football coach and former player. He is currently the head coach at the University of South Carolina. He was the head coach at the University of Florida from 2011 to 2014.\\r\\nMuschamp has built a reputation for his strong defenses and his intense demeanor during games and practice.[1][2] In his second season as defensive coordinator at Auburn, Muschamp was a finalist for the 2007 Broyles Award for the most outstanding assistant coach in college football.[3] Prior to accepting the job at Florida, the University of Texas had announced that Muschamp would eventually succeed Mack Brown as head coach of the Longhorns and designated him the \\"head coach in waiting.\\"[4]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nMuschamp was born in Rome, Georgia but grew up in Gainesville, Florida. He attended Martha Manson Academy elementary school and Oak Hall High School in Gainesville. His family moved back to Rome, where his father became the headmaster of the Darlington School, and where he graduated from high school. Muschamp played football, basketball, baseball, and ran track for the Darlington Tigers.[5]\\r\\nMuschamp attended the University of Georgia in Athens, Georgia. He walked on to the Georgia Bulldogs football team and played safety from 1991 to 1994. As an undergraduate, he was initiated into the Kappa Alpha Order (Gamma Chapter) and also earned a spot on the SEC Academic Honor Roll in 1993.[6] He was a defensive team captain his senior season,[7] and played in two bowl games with the Bulldogs. Former Georgia offensive coordinator and Bulldogs quarterback Mike Bobo, who was Muschamp's college teammate, described him as \\"a hard worker. Very physical. Very intense.\\"[8] Muschamp graduated from the University of Georgia with a bachelor's degree in 1994.[9]\\r\\nAfter graduating from Georgia, Muschamp became a graduate assistant coach at Auburn University, where he worked under defensive coordinators Wayne Hall and Bill Oliver in 1995 and 1996.[1] He earned a master's degree in education from Auburn in 1996, then spent a season each at the University of West Georgia and Eastern Kentucky University as the defensive backs coach, before becoming the defensive coordinator at Valdosta State University in 2000.[7]\\r\\nMuschamp joined Nick Saban's staff at LSU as the linebackers coach in 2001, before rising to become the LSU defensive coordinator in 2002. In 2003, LSU won the BCS Championship. That season, Muschamp's defense led the nation in both scoring defense (11.0 points per game) and total defense (252.0 yards per game). The Tigers topped the SEC in every major defensive category and also ranked second nationally in defensive pass efficiency (89.8 rating) and third in rushing defense (67.0 yards per game).[5] While at LSU, Muschamp coached four All-Americans including Bradie James, Chad Lavalais, Corey Webster and Marcus Spears. Muschamp left LSU with Saban after the 2004 season to join the Miami Dolphins staff as the assistant head coach and defensive coordinator.\\r\\nAs assistant head coach/defense of the Miami Dolphins, Muschamp, along with defensive coordinator Richard Smith,[10] supervised a defense that ranked fifteenth in total defense in the NFL. The Dolphins allowed 19.8 points per game and 317.4 total yards per game during the 2005 NFL season. The unit also ranked second in the NFL with 49 quarterback sacks.\\r\\nWhen the Auburn defensive coordinator position became available in January 2006, Muschamp took the opportunity to return to the college game. In 2006, Muschamp's first season at Auburn, the defense finished seventh among NCAA Division I-FBS teams in scoring defense, allowing only 21 touchdowns.[11] In 2007, Auburn led the SEC in scoring defense and finished in the top 10 in four defensive categories (ranking 7th nationally in pass efficiency[12] and 6th nationally in total defense,[13] passing defense[14] and scoring defense[15] among NCAA Division I-FBS teams).\\r\\nOn January 3, 2008, Muschamp interviewed for the vacant co-defensive coordinator job for the University of Texas.[16] The next day, he resigned from Auburn to accept the position with Texas. Muschamp was slated to receive a raise to $425,000 per year with a two-year, no buyout, contract at Auburn for 2008, which would have made him the highest-paid assistant coach in the SEC.[17] Muschamp received a contract with a $425,000 annual salary at Texas, making him the highest-paid assistant coach in the Big 12.[18]\\r\\nOn November 18, 2008, the University of Texas announced Muschamp would succeed Brown whenever he retired. They agreed in principle to increase Muschamp's salary to $900,000. There was no timetable set for Brown's departure, and both Brown and UT said they expected Brown to stay a long time.[4][19] Fifty-nine-year-old Brown was under contract as head coach through 2016.[20][21] Upon Brown's retirement, Muschamp was slated to get a five-year contract as head coach.[22]\\r\\nIn announcing the move, the University of Texas noted, \\"Muschamp's Longhorn defense is leading the Big 12 in rushing defense (82.5 ypg/25th NCAA) and scoring defense (19.5 ppg/25th NCAA). UT ranks second nationally with four sacks per game. The Horns have held all of their Big 12 opponents below their season scoring average and limited six foes to 14 points or less.\\"[19] UT Athletics Director DeLoss Dodds said, \\"With the landscape in college football and all of the changes around the country, I've been looking at this for the last couple of years. When it's not working, you have to go outside and make changes. Things are going well here, it's working, so it's best to be prepared to build from inside and that's what we're doing. Mack has provided outstanding leadership and continues to elevate our football program to a level as high as anyone in the country. We hope he stays a long time and he will be our coach as long as he wants, but this assures us that when the time comes, we have the right guy to step up into that position and continue to build on the great things we're accomplishing.\\"[19]\\r\\nPrior to this announcement, Muschamp had been mentioned in association with head coaching job openings at Clemson, Tennessee, Washington, and Auburn.[6] He had been planning an off-week interview with Clemson[23] but as a result of this deal decided instead to wait his turn at Texas, saying, \\"This is a special place. I think it is 'the' elite job in the country.\\"[6] Austin American-Statesman columnist Kirk Bohls predicted this would be good for the program: \\"Muschamp's ascension conveys to fans and recruits that Texas values what it has now as one of the elite programs in the country and wants to maintain. This smart, bold move should bring coaching stability, sustained recruiting and possibly expanded recruiting into the Southeast and a continued framework for success.\\"[24]\\r\\nOn December 11, 2010, University of Florida athletic director Jeremy Foley named Muschamp to succeed Urban Meyer as the 23rd head coach of the Florida Gators football program.[9] In his first year as head coach, Muschamp led the Gators to a 7ÿ6 record overall and a 3-5 record in the SEC. This was the first losing conference record for the Gators since 1979. In 2011, Muschamp's Gators struggled on offense, ranking 98th in total offense and 83rd in passing offense. Muschamp's Gators earned a 24ÿ17 Gator Bowl victory over the Ohio State Buckeyes playing under interim coach, Luke Fickell. The following spring, Muschamp brought in the No. 5 recruiting class in the nation according to Scout.com. However, the class had no top offensive talent and only two offensive linemen.\\r\\nIn 2012, Muschamp led the Gators to an 11ÿ2 season with four wins over teams that were ranked among the top twelve of the BCS standings at the end of the regular season, including Texas A&M, LSU, South Carolina, and Florida State. The season also included a near loss to a non-BCS school Louisiana-Lafayette and a loss to Georgia in which Muschamp's Gators scored no touchdowns, costing the Gators the SEC East Division Title. The season ended with a disappointing 23ÿ33 loss to the Louisville Cardinals in the Sugar Bowl. Although the 2012 Gators had a top defense, the season was primarily hampered by the lack of offensive output again. In 2012, the Gators offense ranked 97th in total offense and 116th (out of 124 teams) in passing offense. The following spring, Muschamp brought in the No. 7 recruiting class in the nation according to Scout.com.\\r\\nIt initially appeared the success would continue in 2013, when the Gators started out 4-1. However, they would lose seven consecutive games, their longest losing stream in recent memory. The 4-8 record was the Gators' first losing season since 1979. Muschamp again had a losing record in the SEC, 3ÿ5. This made Muschamp the first Gators coach to have two losing SEC records since the 1950s. This also ended a 22-year bowl streak that dated back to 1991 when the Gators came off probation. The season included two particularly humiliating losses. The first was a homecoming loss to Vanderbilttheir first loss to the Commodores since 1988 and first at home since 1945. Muschamp's Gators also lost to an FCS team, Georgia Southern, the first loss to a lower division team in the history of the program. Muschamp lost to traditional rival Georgia for the third consecutive year and a 30-point loss to Florida State in the season's final game dropped his record against the Seminoles to 1ÿ2. The Gator defense was again one of the best in the nation, ranking eighth in total defense. However, the Gator offense was again ineffective, ranking 114th nationally in total offense and 107th in passing. After the season, Florida athletic director Jeremy Foley brought Muschamp back for another season. The following spring, Muschamp's Gators brought in the No. 9 recruiting class, which trailed five other SEC teams and rival Florida State.\\r\\nDespite a lackluster 2013 season, expectations were high for Muschamp and the Gators for the 2014 campaign. After a 42ÿ13 homecoming loss to Missouri, some Gator fans called for Muschamp to be fired immediately. However, Foley refused to do so and allowed Muschamp to coach the annual Florida-Georgia football game. Florida, a 10-point underdog came in starting true freshman Treon Harris with throwing the ball only six times the Gators compiled 428 yards rushing to upset the 11th ranked Bulldogs 38ÿ20. However, after a 23ÿ20 overtime home loss to South Carolina 2 weeks later on November 16, 2014, Foley announced that Muschamp would be stepping down following the conclusion of the 2014 regular season, citing the season's high number of losses. Muschamp remarked, \\"I was given every opportunity to get it done here and I simply didn't win enough gamesthat is the bottom line. I'm disappointed that I didn't get it done and it is my responsibility to get it done.\\"[25]\\r\\nOn December 12, 2014, a week after the end of the regular season, Muschamp became defensive coordinator for the Auburn Tigers. He agreed to a three-year deal with the Tigers that was worth between $1.6 million and $1.8 million annually.[26] This deal made him the highest-paid defensive coordinator in college football. He became Auburn's fourth defensive coordinator in five years and replaced Ellis Johnson, who was fired the day after the Tigers' 55-44 loss to Alabama in November of the same year.[27]\\r\\nOn December 6, 2015, Muschamp was announced as the 34th head football coach of the South Carolina Gamecocks.[28] Muschamp inherited a 3ÿ9 football team but would go 6ÿ7 in his first season as head coach of the Gamecocks. In his second season at the helm, Muschamp improved to 9ÿ4, including a 26ÿ19 win over Michigan in the Outback Bowl. South Carolina's 5ÿ3 conference record was its first winning record in conference play since 2013 under then-head coach Steve Spurrier.\\r\\nMuschamp's wife Carol (ne Davis) is from Thomaston, Georgia. They have two sons, Jackson and Whit. His brother Mike Muschamp is the head football coach at The Lovett School in Atlanta, Georgia who led the team to a state championship in 2013.\\r\\nNotable head coaches under whom Muschamp has served:\\r\\nAssistants under Muschamp who have become head coaches:\\r\\n# denotes interim head coach.\\r\\nPound sign (#) denotes interim head coach.","input":"Where did will muschamp go to high school?"},{"output":"Aerobic metabolism","context":"\\r\\n\\r\\nCellular respiration is a set of metabolic reactions and processes that take place in the cells of organisms to convert biochemical energy from nutrients into adenosine triphosphate (ATP), and then release waste products.[1] The reactions involved in respiration are catabolic reactions, which break large molecules into smaller ones, releasing energy in the process, as weak so-called \\"high-energy\\" bonds are replaced by stronger bonds in the products. Respiration is one of the key ways a cell releases chemical energy to fuel cellular activity. Cellular respiration is considered an exothermic redox reaction which releases heat. The overall reaction occurs in a series of biochemical steps, most of which are redox reactions themselves. Although cellular respiration is technically a combustion reaction, it clearly does not resemble one when it occurs in a living cell because of the slow release of energy from the series of reactions.\\r\\n\\r\\nNutrients that are commonly used by animal and plant cells in respiration include sugar, amino acids and fatty acids, and the most common oxidizing agent (electron acceptor) is molecular oxygen (O2). The chemical energy stored in ATP (its third phosphate group is weakly bonded to the rest of the molecule and is cheaply broken allowing stronger bonds to form, thereby transferring energy for use by the cell) can then be used to drive processes requiring energy, including biosynthesis, locomotion or transportation of molecules across cell membranes.\\r\\n\\r\\nAerobic respiration requires oxygen (O2) in order to create ATP. Although carbohydrates, fats, and proteins  are consumed as reactants, it is the preferred method of pyruvate breakdown in glycolysis and requires that pyruvate enter the mitochondria in order to be fully oxidized by the Krebs cycle. The products of this process are carbon dioxide and water, but the energy transferred is used to break bonds in ADP as the third phosphate group is added to form  ATP (adenosine triphosphate), by substrate-level phosphorylation, NADH and FADH2\\r\\n\\r\\nThe negative G indicates that the reaction can occur spontaneously.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe potential of NADH and FADH2 is converted to more ATP through an electron transport chain with oxygen as the \\"terminal electron acceptor\\". Most of the ATP produced by aerobic cellular respiration is made by oxidative phosphorylation. This works by the energy released in the consumption of pyruvate being used to create a chemiosmotic potential by pumping protons across a membrane. This potential is then used to drive ATP synthase and produce ATP from ADP and a phosphate group. Biology textbooks often state that 38 ATP molecules can be made per oxidised glucose molecule during cellular respiration (2 from glycolysis, 2 from the Krebs cycle, and about 34 from the electron transport system).[2] However, this maximum yield is never quite reached because of losses due to leaky membranes as well as the cost of moving pyruvate and ADP into the mitochondrial matrix, and current estimates range around 29 to 30 ATP per glucose.[2]\\r\\n\\r\\nAerobic metabolism is up to 15 times more efficient than anaerobic metabolism (which yields 2?molecules ATP per 1?molecule glucose).  However some anaerobic organisms, such as methanogens are able to continue with anaerobic respiration, yielding more ATP by using other inorganic molecules (not oxygen) as final electron acceptors in the electron transport chain.  They share the initial pathway of glycolysis but aerobic metabolism continues with the Krebs cycle and oxidative phosphorylation. The post-glycolytic reactions take place in the mitochondria in eukaryotic cells, and in the cytoplasm in prokaryotic cells.\\r\\n\\r\\n1. Glycolysis:\\r\\n\\r\\n--- 2 ATPs  +  Glucose  L  2 Pyruvic Acid  +  4 Hydrogen  +  4 ATPs\\r\\n\\r\\n2.

This pathway can function with or without the presence of oxygen. In humans, aerobic conditions produce pyruvate and anaerobic conditions produce lactate. In aerobic conditions, the process converts one molecule of glucose into two molecules of pyruvate (pyruvic acid), generating energy in the form of two net molecules of ATP. Four molecules of ATP per glucose are actually produced, however, two are consumed as part of the preparatory phase. The initial phosphorylation of glucose is required to increase the reactivity (decrease its stability) in order for the molecule to be cleaved into two pyruvate molecules by the enzyme aldolase. During the pay-off phase of glycolysis, four phosphate groups are transferred to ADP by substrate-level phosphorylation to make four ATP, and two NADH are produced when the pyruvate are oxidized. The overall reaction can be expressed this way:\\r\\n\\r\\nStarting with glucose,  1 ATP is used to donate a phosphate to glucose to produce glucose 6-phosphate. Glycogen can be converted into glucose 6-phosphate as well with the help of glycogen phosphorylase. During energy metabolism, glucose 6-phosphate becomes fructose 6-phosphate. An additional ATP is used to phosphorylate fructose 6-phosphate into fructose 1,6-disphosphate by the help of phosphofructokinase. Fructose 1,6-diphosphate then splits into two phosphorylated molecules with three carbon chains which later degrades into pyruvate.\\r\\n\\r\\nGlycolysis can be literally translated as \\"sugar splitting\\".[3]\\r\\n\\r\\nPyruvate is oxidized to acetyl-CoA and CO2 by the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (PDC).  The PDC contains multiple copies of three enzymes and is located in the mitochondria of eukaryotic cells and in the cytosol of prokaryotes. In the conversion of pyruvate to acetyl-CoA, one molecule of NADH and one molecule of CO2 is formed.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis is also called the Krebs cycle or the tricarboxylic acid cycle. When oxygen is present, acetyl-CoA is produced from the pyruvate molecules created from glycolysis. Once acetyl-CoA is formed, aerobic or anaerobic respiration can occur.[4] When oxygen is present, the mitochondria will undergo aerobic respiration which leads to the Krebs cycle.  However, if oxygen is not present, fermentation of the pyruvate molecule will occur.  In the presence of oxygen, when acetyl-CoA is produced, the molecule then enters the citric acid cycle (Krebs cycle) inside the mitochondrial matrix, and is oxidized to CO2 while at the same time reducing NAD to NADH. NADH can be used by the electron transport chain to create further ATP as part of oxidative phosphorylation. To fully oxidize the equivalent of one glucose molecule, two acetyl-CoA must be metabolized by the Krebs cycle. Two waste products, H2O and CO2, are created during this cycle.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe citric acid cycle is an 8-step process involving 18 different enzymes and co-enzymes.[4] During the cycle, acetyl-CoA (2 carbons) + oxaloacetate (4 carbons) yields citrate (6 carbons), which is rearranged to a more reactive form called isocitrate (6 carbons). Isocitrate is modified to become ϫ-ketoglutarate (5 carbons), succinyl-CoA, succinate, fumarate, malate, and, finally, oxaloacetate.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe net gain of high-energy compounds from one cycle is 3 NADH, 1 FADH2, and 1 GTP; the GTP may subsequently be used to produce ATP. Thus, the total yield from 1 glucose molecule (2 pyruvate molecules) is 6 NADH, 2 FADH2, and 2 ATP.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn eukaryotes, oxidative phosphorylation occurs in the mitochondrial cristae. It comprises the electron transport chain that establishes a proton gradient (chemiosmotic potential) across the boundary of inner membrane by oxidizing the NADH produced from the Krebs cycle. ATP is synthesized by the ATP synthase enzyme when the chemiosmotic gradient is used to drive the phosphorylation of ADP. The electrons are finally transferred to exogenous oxygen and, with the addition of two protons, water is formed.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe table below describes the reactions involved when one glucose molecule is fully oxidized into carbon dioxide. It is assumed that all the reduced coenzymes are oxidized by the electron transport chain and used for oxidative phosphorylation.\\r\\n\\r\\nAlthough there is a theoretical yield of 38 ATP molecules per glucose during cellular respiration, such conditions are generally not realized because of losses such as the cost of moving pyruvate (from glycolysis), phosphate, and ADP (substrates for ATP synthesis) into the mitochondria. All are actively transported using carriers that utilize the stored energy in the proton electrochemical gradient.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe outcome of these transport processes using the proton electrochemical gradient is that more than 3 H+ are needed to make 1 ATP. Obviously this reduces the theoretical efficiency of the whole process and the likely maximum is closer to 28ÿ30 ATP molecules.[2] In practice the efficiency may be even lower because the inner membrane of the mitochondria is slightly leaky to protons.[5] Other factors may also dissipate the proton gradient creating an apparently leaky mitochondria. An uncoupling protein known as thermogenin is expressed in some cell types and is a channel that can transport protons. When this protein is active in the inner membrane it short circuits the coupling between the electron transport chain and ATP synthesis. The potential energy from the proton gradient is not used to make ATP but generates heat. This is particularly important in brown fat thermogenesis of newborn and hibernating mammals.\\r\\n\\r\\nAccording to some of newer sources the ATP yield during aerobic respiration is not 36ÿ38, but only about 30ÿ32 ATP molecules / 1 molecule of glucose [6], because:\\r\\n\\r\\nSo finally we have, per molecule of glucose\\r\\n\\r\\nAltogether this gives 4 + 3 (or 5) + 20 + 3 = 30 (or 32) ATP per molecule of glucose\\r\\n\\r\\nThe total ATP yield in ethanol or lactic acid fermentation is only 2 molecules coming from glycolysis, because pyruvate is not transferred to the mitochondrion and finally oxidized to the carbon dioxide (CO2), but reduced to ethanol or lactic acid in the cytoplasm.[6]\\r\\n\\r\\nWithout oxygen, pyruvate (pyruvic acid) is not metabolized by cellular respiration but undergoes a process of fermentation. The pyruvate is not transported into the mitochondrion, but remains in the cytoplasm, where it is converted to waste products that may be removed from the cell. This serves the purpose of oxidizing the electron carriers so that they can perform glycolysis again and removing the excess pyruvate. Fermentation oxidizes NADH to NAD+ so it can be re-used in glycolysis.  In the absence of oxygen, fermentation prevents the buildup of NADH in the cytoplasm and provides NAD+ for glycolysis.  This waste product varies depending on the organism. In skeletal muscles, the waste product is lactic acid. This type of fermentation is called lactic acid fermentation. In strenuous exercise, when energy demands exceed energy supply, the respiratory chain cannot process all of the hydrogen atoms joined by NADH. During anaerobic glycolysis, NAD+ regenerates when pairs of hydrogen combine with pyruvate to form lactate. Lactate formation is catalyzed by lactate dehydrogenase in a reversible reaction. Lactate can also be used as an indirect precursor for liver glycogen. During recovery, when oxygen becomes available, NAD+ attaches to hydrogen from lactate to form ATP. In yeast, the waste products are ethanol and carbon dioxide. This type of fermentation is known as alcoholic or ethanol fermentation. The ATP generated in this process is made by substrate-level phosphorylation, which does not require oxygen.\\r\\n\\r\\nFermentation is less efficient at using the energy from glucose: only 2 ATP are produced per glucose, compared to the 38 ATP per glucose nominally produced by aerobic respiration. This is because the waste products of fermentation still contain chemical potential energy that can be released by oxidation. Ethanol, for example, can be burned in an internal combustion engine like gasoline. Glycolytic ATP, however, is created more quickly. For prokaryotes to continue a rapid growth rate when they are shifted from an aerobic environment to an anaerobic environment, they must increase the rate of the glycolytic reactions. For multicellular organisms, during short bursts of strenuous activity, muscle cells use fermentation to supplement the ATP production from the slower aerobic respiration, so fermentation may be used by a cell even before the oxygen levels are depleted, as is the case in sports that do not require athletes to pace themselves, such as sprinting.\\r\\n\\r\\nCellular respiration is the process by which biological fuels are oxidised in the presence of an inorganic electron acceptor (such as oxygen) to produce large amounts of energy, to drive the bulk production of ATP.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnaerobic respiration is used by some microorganisms in which neither oxygen (aerobic respiration) nor pyruvate derivatives (fermentation) is the final electron acceptor.  Rather, an inorganic acceptor such as sulfate or nitrate is used.\\r\\nSuch organisms are typically found in unusual places such as underwater caves or near hydrothermal vents at the bottom of the ocean.","input":"What are the 2 types of cellular respiration?"},{"output":"May 1939","context":"Batman is an ongoing American comic book series featuring the DC Comics hero of the same name. The character first appeared in Detective Comics #27 (cover dated May 1939). Batman proved to be so popular that a self-titled ongoing comic book series began publication with a cover date of Spring 1940.[2][3] It was first advertised in early April 1940, one month after the first appearance of his new sidekick, Robin, the Boy Wonder.\\r\\nThough the Batman comic book was initially launched as a quarterly publication, it later became a bimonthly series through the late 1950s, after which it became a monthly publication and has remained so since. The original series ended in 2011 and was relaunched with a new first issue.\\r\\nUsing the end of the New 52 initiative as a launching point, DC Comics began a second relaunch of its entire line of titles called DC Rebirth in 2016. Batman (vol. 3) #1 (August 2016) was the debut bimonthly relaunch of the comic book series.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe character of Batman made his first appearance in the pages of Detective Comics #27 in May 1939. In Spring of 1940, Batman #1 was published and introduced new characters into Batman's pantheon, most notably those of Catwoman and Batman's eventual nemesis, the Joker.[4] Alfred Pennyworth, the Wayne family butler, was introduced in issue #16 (AprilÿMay 1943).[5]\\r\\nEditor Whitney Ellsworth assigned a Batman story to artist Dick Sprang in 1941.[6] Anticipating that Bob Kane would be drafted to serve in World War II, DC inventoried Sprang's work to safeguard against delays.[6] Sprang's first published Batman work was the Batman and Robin figures on the cover of Batman #18 (Aug.-Sept. 1943), reproduced from the art for page 13 of the later-published Detective Comics #84 (Feb. 1944).[7] Sprang's first original published Batman work, and first interior-story work, appeared in Batman #19 (Oct.-Nov. 1943), for which he drew the cover and the first three Batman stories, and penciled the fourth Batman story, inked by Norm Fallon.[8] Like all Batman artists of the time, Sprang went uncredited as a ghost artist for Kane.\\r\\nVillains which debuted during this early era included the Mad Hatter in issue #49 (October 1948)[9] and Killer Moth in issue #63 (February 1951).[10] In 1953, Sheldon Moldoff became another one of the primary Batman ghost artists who, along with Win Mortimer and Dick Sprang, drew stories credited to Bob Kane, following Kane's style and under Kane's supervision.[11] Bill Finger and Moldoff introduced Ace the Bat-Hound in #92 (June 1955).[12]\\r\\nThe early part of the era known to comics fans and historians as the Silver Age of Comic Books saw the Batman title dabble in science fiction.[13] New characters introduced included Mr. Freeze[14] and Betty Kane, the original Bat-Girl.[15]\\r\\nIn 1964, Julius Schwartz was made responsible for reviving the faded Batman titles. He jettisoned the sillier aspects that had crept into the series such as Ace the Bathound and Bat-Mite and gave the character a \\"New Look\\" that premiered in Detective Comics #327 (May 1964).[16][17] Schwartz's first issue of the Batman title was #164 (June 1964)[18] which was written by France Edward Herron and drawn by Sheldon Moldoff.[19] The Riddler returned after an eighteen-year absence in #171 (May 1965).[20] Among the new villains introduced during this period was Poison Ivy in #181 (June 1966).[21] In the 1960s, Batman comics were affected by the popular Batman television series, with campy stories based on the tongue-in-cheek premise of the series. After the Batman television program's influence had died down, writer Frank Robbins and artist Irv Novick sent Dick Grayson off to attend college and moved Batman out of Wayne Manor in issue #217 (December 1969).[22]\\r\\nIn 1971, writer Dennis O'Neil and artist Neal Adams came aboard the title and re-infused it with the darker tones of the 1940s.[23] O'Neil and Adams introduced a new villain named Ra's al Ghul,[24][25] and would also revitalize the Joker by bringing him back to his roots as a homicidal maniac who murders people on a whim.[26][27] Batman #237 (December 1971) featured a metafictional story by O'Neil and Adams which featured several comics creators appearing in the story and interacting with Batman and Robin at the Rutland Halloween Parade in Rutland, Vermont.[28] O'Neil said his work on the Batman series was \\"simply to take it back to where it started. I went to the DC library and read some of the early stories. I tried to get a sense of what Kane and Finger were after.\\"[29] Comics historian Les Daniels observed that Batman's interpretation of Batman as a vengeful obsessive-compulsive, which he modestly describes as a return to the roots, was actually an act of creative imagination that has influenced every subsequent version of the Dark Knight.\\"[30] Issues #254 (Jan.ÿFeb. 1974) to #261 (MarchÿApril 1975) of the series were in the 100 Page Super Spectacular format.[31] The series reached its 300th issue with a June 1978 cover date and featured a story by writer David Vern Reed and artists Walt Simonson and Dick Giordano.[32][33] Len Wein became the writer of the series with issue #307 (January 1979) and in his first issue, created Wayne Foundation executive Lucius Fox,[34] later portrayed by Morgan Freeman in the movies Batman Begins, The Dark Knight, and The Dark Knight Rises. Julius Schwartz ended his tenure as editor of the series with issue #309 (March 1979).[18]\\r\\nMarv Wolfman briefly wrote Batman and co-created the Electrocutioner in issue #331 (Jan. 1981).[35] Roy Thomas had a brief sting on the series as well.[36][37] Writer Gerry Conway and artist Don Newton introduced Jason Todd in Batman #357 (March 1983).[38] Todd would assume the costumed identity of Robin in issue #368 (February 1984).[39][40] Writer Doug Moench began his run on the title with issue #360[41][42] and he and artist Tom Mandrake created the Black Mask character in Batman #386 (August 1985).[43] Moench's longtime collaborator, artist Paul Gulacy made his DC Comics debut with a two-part story in issues #393 and #394.[44][45] The title reached its 400th issue in October 1986 and featured work by several popular comics artists and included an introduction by novelist Stephen King.[33][46]\\r\\nDue to the events of the Crisis on Infinite Earths, the continuity of DC Comics was altered. Established characters were given the opportunity to be reintroduced in new ways. While the Batman series was not rebooted, writer Frank Miller, who had previously worked on the limited series The Dark Knight Returns, and artist David Mazzucchelli retold the character's origin story for the new continuity in the monthly pages of Batman issues 404ÿ407 (FebruaryÿMay 1987). The story, Batman: Year One, garnered high critical acclaim for its realistic interpretation of Batman's genesis, and its accessibility to new readers who had never followed Batman before.[47] IGN Comics ranked Batman: Year One at the top of a list of the 25 greatest Batman graphic novels, saying that \\"no other book before or since has quite captured the realism, the grit and the humanity of Gordon and Batman so perfectly.\\"[48] Notable comic book creators Greg Rucka, Jeph Loeb, and Judd Winick have cited Year One as their favorite Batman story.[49] Following \\"Year One\\", writer Max Allan Collins and artist Chris Warner crafted a new origin for Jason Todd.[50] Jim Starlin became the writer of Batman and one of his first storylines for the title was \\"Ten Nights of The Beast\\"[51] in issues #417-420 (MarchÿJune 1988) which introduced the KGBeast. During Starlin's tenure on the title, DC Comics was becoming aware of the fanbase's growing disdain for the character of Jason Todd, Following a cliffhanger in which the character's life hangs in the balance, DC set up a 900 number hotline which gave callers the ability to vote for or against Jason Todd's death. The kill option won by a narrow majority, and the following month the character was shown dying from wounds inflicted in the previous issue's cliffhanger. The story, entitled \\"A Death in the Family,\\" received high media exposure due to the shocking nature in which a familiar character's life had ended.[52] Writer Marv Wolfman and artist Pat Broderick created Tim Drake in issue #436 in the \\"Batman: Year Three\\" story[53] and the character became the third version of Robin in the \\"A Lonely Place of Dying\\" storyline culminating in issue #442.[54]\\r\\nPartially impacted by the tone of Tim Burton's 1989 film Batman, the comics of the 1990s took a darker tone. The Tim Drake version of Robin was given a new costume designed by Neal Adams in issue #457 (December 1990) in a story by Alan Grant and Norm Breyfogle.[55] The main writers of the Batman franchise in the 1990s were Grant, Doug Moench,[41] and Chuck Dixon. Moench and Dixon masterminded the Knightfall crossover arc, which saw Batman's back being broken by the super strong villain Bane.[56] A new character, Jean-Paul Valley, takes up the Batman mantle in Bruce Wayne's absence. Valley is driven mad with power, and Wayne forcefully reclaims it after his recovery.[57] Moench and artist Kelley Jones co-created the Ogre in Batman #535 (Oct. 1996).[58]\\r\\nThe Batman titles in 1999 were dominated by the large crossover \\"No Man's Land\\", which sees Gotham City ravaged by a large earthquake, leading to the U.S. government's order to evacuate the city and abandoning and isolating those who choose to remain behind.[59] Writer Greg Rucka adapted the story into a prose novel published in 2000.[60]\\r\\nAfter the conclusion to \\"No Man's Land\\" and Greg Rucka's move to Detective, the Batman title was handled for seven issues by writer Larry Hama and artist Scott McDaniel. At issue #582, Ed Brubaker became the writer of the series[61] and kept a trend of gritty crime drama that included more grounded villains such as the Penguin, Brubaker's new villain Zeiss, and Deadshot.[62] Brubaker's run received a short interruption with an arc title \\"Officer Down\\", which depicted Commissioner Gordon being shot in the line of duty and ultimately retiring from the Gotham police force. From there, writer Brian K. Vaughan did a three-issue arc that focused on Batman's created crime persona Matches Malone before Brubaker returned. The next crossover, masterminded by Brubaker and Rucka and titled \\"Bruce Wayne: Murderer?\\" saw Bruce Wayne framed for the murder of his girlfriend and nearly abandoning his civilian identity altogether.\\r\\nFor the #600 issue, the series moved into the next phase of Wayne's frame-up[63] and featured three backup stories, which were presented as lost issues never before published from iconic eras in Batman's history. \\"Mystery of the Black Bat\\" is presented in the style of Dick Sprang[64] and \\"Joker Tips His Hat!\\" is an homage to the 1960s stories by artists such as Gil Kane and Carmine Infantino.[65] \\"The Dark, Groovy, Solid, Far-out, Right-on, and Completely With-it Knight Returns\\" is a humorous spin on Batman's character trying to update himself into the eighties, and featured stand-up comedian Patton Oswalt's comic writing debut.[66] After the frame-up story concluded, Brubaker closed his run with two issues co-written with Geoff Johns.[67][68]\\r\\nWriter Jeph Loeb and artist Jim Lee crafted a year-long story which began with issue #608,[69] The \\"Hush\\" storyline was a murder mystery that delved through numerous periods in Batman's history. Introducing a new character that was the story's namesake, as well as redefining the Riddler, healing Harvey Dent, and calling into question the events surrounding Jason Todd's death, Following the conclusion of Hush, the creative team of the Vertigo series 100 Bullets came aboard for a six-issue arc titled \\"Broken City\\".[70][71] Writer Judd Winick became the ongoing writer for the series and in a story titled \\"Under the Hood\\", explained that Jason Todd had actually returned from the dead long ago, and became an anti-hero in Gotham under the guise of the Red Hood.[72]\\r\\nAfter the Infinite Crisis series, all the regular monthly titles of the DC Universe jumped forward in time by one year, depicting the characters in radically different situations and environments then they were in the preceding issues. \\"Face the Face\\", was written by James Robinson and saw Batman returning from a year-long overseas journey that retraced the steps he took after initially leaving Gotham City in his youth and featured the return of James Gordon to the role of Gotham City Police Commissioner.[73]\\r\\nGrant Morrison began his long-form Batman narrative in issue #655.[74] The first story, \\"Batman and Son,\\" reveals that Wayne is the father of a child named Damian, and attempts to steer the child away from the machinations of his mother, Talia al Ghul.[75] From there, Morrison began an arc that saw an evil influential organization known as the Black Glove attempt to destroy everything Batman is and what he stands for. This culminated in the storyline Batman R.I.P., where the Black Glove initially succeeds in doing so, but is thwarted by Bruce Wayne's ability to preserve his sane mind while an erratic, alternate personality takes over.[76] After stopping the Black Glove, Morrison moved Batman into his event series Final Crisis, where Batman appears to be killed by Darkseid.[77] In actuality, he was transported to the distant past and stranded there.[78] Neil Gaiman wrote issue #686, which was the first part of a story titled Whatever Happened to the Caped Crusader? It served as a quasi-send off to a generation of Batman stories, much the same way as Alan Moore's Whatever Happened to the Man of Tomorrow? did for Superman, and continued into an issue of Detective Comics.[79]\\r\\nAfter this, the main Batman series went on hiatus while the Battle for the Cowl mini-series would have Dick Grayson assume the role of Batman in the wake of Bruce Wayne's disappearance from the present-day DC Universe.[80] Grant Morrison stayed involved in writing Batman, but moved to a new series titled Batman and Robin, which followed the exploits of Grayson as Batman and Damian Wayne as the new Robin.[74] Writer Judd Winick temporarily returned to the title for Grayson's first solo arc as Batman,[81] before handing the writing and art duties off to Tony Daniel.[82]\\r\\nDaniel remained the main writer on the series until issue #699. The title reached a milestone with the publication of Batman #700 (August 2010), which saw the return of Grant Morrison to the title and a collaboration with an art team that consisted of Daniel, Frank Quitely, Andy Kubert, and David Finch. The separate stories tied together to illustrate that the legacy of Batman is unending, and will survive into the furthest reaches of time.[83] Morrison stayed on as writer on the series through issue #702, while simultaneously writing the Batman and Robin series and The Return of Bruce Wayne mini-series.[74] Tony Daniel resumed writing and art duties with issue #704.[84] Even after Bruce Wayne's return, Dick Grayson remained the star of this title through its final year, as well as being the main character in Batman and Robin and Detective Comics. Bruce Wayne starred in two new titles, Batman Incorporated and Batman: The Dark Knight.[85]\\r\\nOn June 1, 2011, it was announced that all series taking place within the shared DC Universe would be either canceled or relaunched with new #1 issues, after a new continuity was created in the wake of the Flashpoint event. Batman was no exception, and the first issue of the new series was released on September 21, 2011.\\r\\nDC Comics relaunched Batman with issue #1 in September 2011, written by Scott Snyder and drawn by Greg Capullo,[86] as part of DC's company-wide title relaunch, The New 52.[87][88] As with all of the books associated with the DC relaunch, Bruce Wayne appears to be about five years younger than the previous incarnation of the character. Superheroes at large have appeared only in the past five years, and are viewed with, at best, suspicion, and, at worst, outright hostility. All of the characters that have served as Robin, except Stephanie Brown, have been accounted for as still having served at Batman's side in the new continuity. The stories build on recent developments, with most of the character's previous history remaining intact, and Bruce Wayne is again the only Batman, with Dick Grayson having returned to his role as Nightwing.[89]\\r\\nThe first story arc of the title, \\"The Court of Owls\\", focuses on Batman's discovery of a secret society in Gotham City that he had never known about before, dating back to the time of Gotham's founding and his ancestor Alan Wayne, and his battles against the Talons, the agents of the Court of Owls.[90] This led to the first major New 52 crossover, \\"Night of the Owls\\".[91] The finale of the story sees Thomas Wayne Jr. as the head Talon of the Court of Owls in Gotham.[92]\\r\\nThe second arc was named \\"Death of the Family\\", a name-play on the \\"Batman: A Death in the Family\\". It picked up on the cliffhanger involving the Joker from Tony Daniel's run on Detective Comics.[93]\\r\\nTalon, a spin-off of the \\"Court of Owls\\" storyline, launched in September 2012 and focused on a rogue Talon from the Court.[94]\\r\\nAfter a storyline involving Clayface and a one shot dealing with the aftermath of \\"Death of the Family\\", Snyder's next arc was \\"Batman: Zero Year\\". This followed up on Batman #0 and retold how Bruce Wayne became Batman, not done since Frank Miller's \\"Batman: Year One\\". The \\"Endgame\\" storyline ran from October 2014 to April 2015, and concluded with the apparent deaths of both Batman and the Joker. James Gordon, having taken on the Batman mantle, became the main character of the series in June 2015.\\r\\nIn the \\"Superheavy\\" storyline, James Gordon encounters a new super villain, Mr. Bloom, who is distributing various seed-like devices that grant its user extraordinary superpowers at the cost of their lives to select few individuals. It is also revealed the Bruce Wayne is alive and has started a new life at the Lucius Fox Center for Gotham Youth alongside Julie Madison who Bruce has started a relationship with. Gordon is able to subdue Bloom but multiple Mr. Bloom doppelgangers arrive and begin their attack on Gotham City. During an encounter with Duke Thomas, Bruce begins to regain his memories and realizes that he is Batman. He returns to Wayne Manor and forces Alfred to bring Batman back. Using a machine that Batman planned to use to implant his memories into clones to continue his lineage, Bruce tries to regain his memories but fails repeatedly whenever he reaches the point of near-brain death. He decides to invoke brain death so that his old memories can be returned to him. He is then revived with his original memories. Bruce dons a new Batsuit and heads out to face Bloom. Batman arrives and dispatches the Bloom doppelgangers and cuffs Gordon to a helicopter, not wanting him to risk further injury. Duke Thomas discovers that Daryl Gutierrez is the original Mr. Bloom, having created the seeds to give Gotham's citizens the power to protect themselves until one of his 'victims' took his seeds and identity, becoming Mr. Bloom. Duke dispatches Daryl just as Bruce using a giant mecha Batsuit and Jim in his own mecha Batsuit battle Mr. Bloom and defeat him. Jim Gordon is made the Commissioner of the GCPD once again and Bruce thanks him for protecting Gotham in his stead. Bruce approaches Duke Thomas with an offer and soon returns to watching over Gotham once more.[95]\\r\\nAs part of DC Rebirth, Batman was relaunched with a Rebirth one-shot and began shipping twice-monthly, starting with Batman vol. 3 #1 in June 2016 (cover dated Aug. 2016). The series is written by Tom King and drawn by David Finch and Mikel Jann.[96][97][98] The series saw the introduction of two vigilantes, Gotham and Gotham Girl.\\r\\nThe Batman series has had annuals published beginning in 1961. Seven issues of Batman Annual were published from 1961 ÿ Summer 1964.[99] An additional 17 issues were published from 1982 to 2000 and the numbering continued from the 1961 series.[100] Writer Mike W. Barr and artist Trevor Von Eeden crafted Batman Annual #8 (1982)[101] and Von Eeden has noted that it is \\"the book Im most proud of, in my 25 year career at DC Comics. I was able to ink it myself, and also got my girlfriend at the time, Lynn Varley, to colour it - her first job in comics.\\"[102]\\r\\nFour more annuals were published from 2006 to 2011, again with the numbering continued from the previous series.[103] In 2012, a new annual series was begun with a #1 issue.[104]\\r\\nThe first stories appearing in the Batman comic book were written by Bill Finger and illustrated by Bob Kane, though Finger went uncredited for years thereafter. These early stories depicted a vengeful Batman, not hesitant to kill when he saw it as a necessary sacrifice. In one of the early stories he is depicted using a gun and metal bat to stop a group of giant assailants and again with a group of average criminals. The Joker, a psychopath who is notorious for using a special toxin that kills and mutilates his victims, remains one of the most prolific and notorious Batman villains created in this time period. Later, during the Silver Age, this type of super-villain changed from disturbing psychological assaults to the use of amusing gimmicks.\\r\\nTypically, the primary challenges that the Batman faced in this era were derived from villains who were purely evil; however, by the 1970s, the motivations of these characters, including obsessive compulsion, child abuse, and environmental fanaticism, were being explored more thoroughly. Batman himself also underwent a transformation and became a much less one-dimensional character, struggling with deeply rooted internal conflicts. Although not canonical, Frank Miller's The Dark Knight Returns introduced a significant evolution of the Batman's character in his eponymous series; he became uncompromising and relentless in his struggle to revitalize Gotham. The Batman often exhibited behavior that Gotham's elite labeled as excessively violent as well as antisocial tendencies. This aspect of the Batman's personality was also toned down considerably in the wake of the DC-wide crossover Infinite Crisis, wherein Batman experienced a nervous breakdown and reconsidered his philosophy and approaches to his relationships. Currently, the Batman's attributes and personality are said to have been greatly influenced by the traditional characterization by Dennis O'Neil and Neal Adams' portrayals during the 1970s, although hints of the Miller interpretation appear in certain aspects of his character.\\r\\nThese are crossovers that include most ÿ if not all ÿ of the Batman related titles published at the time.","input":"When did batman first appeared in comic books?"},{"output":"Guadalupe Mountains of southeastern New Mexico","context":"Carlsbad Caverns National Park is a United States National Park in the Guadalupe Mountains of southeastern New Mexico. The primary attraction of the park is the show cave, Carlsbad Cavern. Carlsbad Caverns National Park is open every day of the year except Thanksgiving, Christmas, and New Year's Day. Visitors to the cave can hike in on their own via the natural entrance or take an elevator from the visitor center.\\r\\nThe park entrance is located on US Highway 62/180, approximately 18 miles (29?km) southwest of Carlsbad, New Mexico. Carlsbad Caverns National Park participates in the Junior Ranger Program.[4] The park has two entries on the National Register of Historic Places: The Caverns Historic District and the Rattlesnake Springs Historic District.[5] Approximately two thirds of the park has been set aside as a wilderness area, helping to ensure no future changes will be made to the habitat.\\r\\nCarlsbad Cavern includes a large cave chamber (The Big Room), a natural limestone chamber almost 4,000 feet (1,220?m) long, 625 feet (191?m) wide, and 255 feet (78?m) high at the highest point. It is the fifth largest chamber in North America and the twenty-eighth largest in the world.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nAn estimated 250 million years ago, the area surrounding Carlsbad Caverns National Park served as the coastline for an inland sea. Present in the sea was a plethora of marine life, whose remains formed a reef.[6] Unlike modern reef growths, the Permian reef contained bryozoans, sponges, and other microorganisms. After the Permian Period, most of the water evaporated and the reef was buried by evaporites and other sediments. Tectonic movement occurred during the late Cenozoic, uplifting the reef above ground. Susceptible to erosion, water sculpted the Guadalupe Mountain region into its present-day state.[7]\\r\\nCarlsbad Caverns National Park is situated in a bed of limestone above groundwater level. During cavern development, it was within the groundwater zone.[citation needed] Deep below the limestones are petroleum reserves (part of the Mid-Continent Oil Field). At a time near the end of the Cenozoic, hydrogen sulfide (H2S) began to seep upwards from the petroleum into the groundwater. The combination of hydrogen sulfide and oxygen from the water formed sulfuric acid: H2S?+?2O2?L?H2SO4. The sulfuric acid then continued upward, aggressively dissolving the limestone deposits to form caverns. The presence of gypsum within the cave is a confirmation of the occurrence of this process, as it is a byproduct of the reaction between sulfuric acid and limestone.[6] Once the acidic groundwater drained from the caverns, speleothems began to be deposited within the cavern. Erosion above ground created the natural entrance to the Carlsbad Caverns within the last million years. Exposure to the surface has allowed for the influx of air into the cavern. Rainwater and snowmelt percolating downward into the ground pick up carbon dioxide; once this water reaches a cavern ceiling, it precipitates and evaporates, leaving behind a small calcium carbonate deposit. Growths from the roof downward formed through this process are known as stalactites. Additionally, water on the floor of the caverns can contain carbonic acid and generate mineral deposits by evaporation. Growths from the floor upward through this process are known as stalagmites. Different formations of speleothems include columns, soda straws, draperies, helictites, and popcorn. Changes in the ambient air temperature and rainfall affect the rate of growth of speleothems, as higher temperatures increase carbon dioxide production rates within the overlying soil. The color of the speleothems is determined by the trace constituents in the minerals of the formation.[citation needed]\\r\\nWhile a young boy, Jim White explored the cavern with his homemade wire ladder. He named many of the rooms, including the Big Room, New Mexico Room, Kings Palace, Queens Chamber, Papoose Room, and Green Lake Room. He also named many of the cave's more prominent formations, such as the Totem Pole, Witch's Finger, Giant Dome, Bottomless Pit, Fairyland, Iceberg Rock, Temple of the Sun, and Rock of Ages.\\r\\nMax Frisch incorporates the story about White's discovery of the caves in his novel I'm Not Stiller.\\r\\nThe town of Carlsbad, which lends its name to the cavern and national park, is in turn named after the Czech town formerly known by the German name Karlsbad (English spelling Carlsbad) and now known by the Czech name Karlovy Vary, both of which mean \\"Charles' Bath[s].\\"\\r\\nUntil 1932, visitors to the cavern had to walk down a switchback ramp that took them 750 feet (230?m) below the surface. The walk back up was tiring for some. In 1932 the national park opened up a large visitor center building that contained two elevators that would take visitors in and out of the caverns below. The new center included a cafeteria, waiting room, museum and first aid area.[8]\\r\\nCarlsbad Caverns had an average annual visitation of about 410,000 in the period from 2007 to 2016.[2] Peak visitation typically occurs on the weekends following Memorial Day and the Fourth of July. Free admittance for self-guided tours is often granted on holidays such as Martin Luther King, Jr. weekend, National Park Week, and Veterans Day weekend.[16] Camping is permitted in the back country of the park, but a permit is required from the visitor center.\\r\\nOne of the extra events hosted by the park is the bat flight viewing. A program is given in the early evening at the amphitheater near the main entrance prior to the start of the flight, which varies with the sunset time. Flight programs are scheduled from Memorial Day weekend through the middle of October.[17] Optimal viewing normally occurs in July and August when the current year bat pups first join the flight of adult bats. Morning programs are also hosted pre-dawn to witness the return of bats into the cave. Once a year, a bat flight breakfast is held where visitors can eat breakfast at the park prior to the morning return of bats.\\r\\nThroughout the year, star parties are hosted by the park at night. Rangers host informational programs on the celestial night sky and telescopes are also made available. These parties are often held in conjunction with special astronomical events, such as a transit of Venus.[18]\\r\\nIn 1985 a distinctive method of exploration was invented. In a dome area 255 feet (78?m) above the Big Room floor not far from the Bottomless Pit, a stalagmite leaned out. Using a balsa wood loop with helium-filled balloons attached, the explorers, (after several tries over several years), floated a lightweight cord up, over the target stalagmite, and back down to the ground. Then they pulled a climbing rope into position, and the explorers ascended into what they named The Spirit World.[19] A similar, smaller room was found in the main entrance corridor, and was named Balloon Ballroom in honor of this technique.\\r\\nIn 1993, a series of small passages totaling nearly a mile in combined length was found in the ceiling of the New Mexico Room. Named \\"Chocolate High\\", it was the largest discovery in the cave since the Guadalupe Room was found in 1966.\\r\\nThe Bottomless Pit was originally said to have no bottom. Stones were tossed into it, but no sound of the stones striking the bottom was heard. Later exploration revealed the bottom was about 140 feet (43?m) deep and covered with soft dirt. The stones made no sound when they struck the bottom because they were lodged in the soft soil.\\r\\nOn October 31, 2013, a cave technician exploring the Spirit World area discovered a new chamber hundreds of feet up from the main area. Dubbed \\"Halloween Hall\\" for the date of its discovery, the fresh find marks the biggest discovery for the caverns in more than 25 years. The room's diameter is about 100 feet (30?m), and more than 1,000 bat bones were discovered inside the room.[20]\\r\\nThe park contains over 119 caves.[21] Three caves are open to public tours. Carlsbad Caverns is the most famous and is fully developed with electric lights, paved trails, and elevators. Slaughter Canyon Cave[22] and Spider Cave[23] are undeveloped, excepted for designated paths for the guided \\"adventure\\" caving tours.\\r\\nLechuguilla Cave is well known for its delicate speleothems and pristine underground environment. Guano mining occurred in the pit below the entrance in the 1910s.[24] After gaining permission from the national park managers to dig into a rubble pile where wind whistled between the rocks when the weather changed, cavers broke through into a room in 1986.[24] Over 120 miles (190?km) of cave passage has been explored and mapped.[24] It has been mapped to a depth of 1,600 feet (490?m), making it the second deepest limestone cave in the U.S.[25] To protect the fragile environment, access is limited to permitted scientific expeditions only.[24]\\r\\nSeventeen species of bats live in the park, including a large number of Mexican free-tailed bats.[26] It has been estimated that the population of Mexican free-tailed bats once numbered in the millions but has declined drastically in modern times. The cause of this decline is unknown but the pesticide DDT is often listed as a primary cause.[citation needed] A study published in 2009 by a team from Boston University questions whether millions of bats ever existed in the caverns.[27]\\r\\nMany techniques have been used to estimate the bat population in the cave. The most recent and most successful of these attempts involved the use of thermal imaging camera to track and count the bats.[28] A count from 2005 estimated a peak of 793,000.[26]\\r\\nThe Mexican free-tailed bats are present from April or May to late October or early November.[29] They emerge in a dense group, corkscrewing upwards and counterclockwise, usually starting around sunset and lasting about three hours.[30] (Jim White decided to investigate the caverns when he saw the bats from a distance and at first thought they were a volcano or a whirlwind.)[31] Every early evening from Memorial Day weekend to mid October (with possible exceptions for bad weather), a ranger gives a talk on the bats while visitors sitting in the amphitheater wait to watch the bats emerge.[29]\\r\\nThree hiking trails and an unpaved drive provide access to the desert scenery and ecosystem. The developed portion around the cave entrance has been designated as The Caverns Historic District.[32]\\r\\nA detached part of the park, Rattlesnake Springs Picnic Area, is a natural oasis with landscaping, picnic tables, and wildlife habitats. As a wooded riparian area in the desert, it is home to remarkable variety of birds; over 300 species have been recorded.[33] About 500 species have been recorded in the whole state of New Mexico.[34] Rattlesnake Springs is designated a historic district on the National Register of Historic Places.[35] The National Audubon Society has designated Rattlesnake Springs an Important Bird Area (IBA). The natural entrance to the caverns is also an IBA because of its colony of cave swallows, possibly the world's largest.[33]\\r\\nAntibiotic-resistant bacteria have been discovered in the isolated and little-visited Lechuguilla Cave within the park.[36]","input":"Where is the carlsbad caverns national park located?"},{"output":"June 1, 2018","context":"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Trump tariffs are a series of tariffs imposed during the presidency of Donald Trump. In January 2018, Trump imposed tariffs on solar panels and washing machines,[1] and later the same year, he imposed tariffs on steel and aluminum.[2][3] On June 1, 2018, the United States imposed a 25% tariff on imports of steel, and a 10% tariff on aluminum, on the European Union, Canada, and Mexico.[3]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe tariffs angered trading partners, who implemented retaliatory tariffs on U.S. goods.[4] Canada imposed matching retaliatory tariffs  on July 1, 2018.[5][6] China accused the U.S. of starting a trade war[7] and on July 6[8] implemented tariffs equivalent to the $34 billion tariff imposed on it by the U.S. India plans to recoup trade penalties of $241 million on $1.2 billion worth of Indian steel and aluminium.[9] Other countries, such as Australia, are concerned of the consequences of a trade war.[8]\\r\\n\\r\\nMorgan Stanley estimated that Trump's tariffs on steel, aluminum, washing machines, and solar panels, as of March 2018, covered 4.1% of U.S. imports.[10] The tariffs measures were poorly received by the vast majority of economists; almost 80% of 60 economists surveyed by Reuters believed that tariffs on steel and aluminum imports would be a net harm to the U.S. economy, with the rest believing that the tariffs would have little or no effect; none of the economists surveyed believed that the tariffs would benefit the U.S. economy.[11]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn July 2018 the Trump administration announced it would use a Great Depression-era program, the Commodity Credit Corporation, to pay farmers up to $12 billion. This government assistance program aims to make up a shortfall as farmers lose sales abroad due to the trade war with China, the European Union and other states.[12]\\r\\n\\r\\nDuring the 2016 presidential campaign, Trump repeatedly favored policy proposals that renegotiate trade agreements for the United States. During a meeting with the New York Times Editorial Board in January 2016, Trump said that he would tax Chinese imports into the United States by 45%.[15] Trump  frequently criticized the North American Free Trade Agreement calling it \\"the worst  trade deal the U.S. has ever signed.\\"[16] He also called Trans-Pacific Partnership \\"the death blow for American manufacturing\\" and that it would \\"put the interests of foreign countries above our own.\\"[17]\\r\\n\\r\\nOn November 21, 2016, in a video message, Trump introduced an economic strategy of \\"putting America first\\", stating that he would negotiate \\"fair, bilateral trade deals that bring jobs and industry back onto American shores.\\" On January 23, 2017, three days after becoming president, Trump withdrew the United States from the politically divisive Trans-Pacific Partnership believing that the agreement would \\"undermine\\" the U.S. economy and sovereignty.[18][19][20][21]\\r\\n\\r\\nTrump has also indicated a desire to end the North American Free Trade Agreement with Canada and Mexico. His administration has been in the process of renegotiating the terms of the agreement. Although vague on the exact terms he seeks in a renegotiated NAFTA, Trump threatened to withdraw from it if negotiations fail.[22] He has specifically criticized the Ford Motor Co.,[23] Carrier Corporation,[23] and Mondelez International for having operations based in Mexico.[23][24][25] In August 2015, in response to Oreo maker Mondelez International's announcement that it would move manufacturing to Mexico, Trump said that he would boycott Oreos.[25]\\r\\n\\r\\nSimilar to his approach to trade deals, Trump also pledged, as part of the Contract with the American Voter, to impose tariffs to discourage companies from laying off workers or relocating to other countries, through an \\"End the Offshoring Act\\".[26][27][28] No such act has been introduced in Congress,[29][30][31] but Trump has moved to impose tariffs on solar panels, washing machines, steel, and aluminum. The enforcement of the tariffs falls primarily within the purview of the Department of Commerce and Office of the United States Trade Representative.  \\r\\n\\r\\nOn March 1, 2018 Trump announced his intention to impose a 25% tariff on steel and a 10% tariff on aluminum imports.[32] In a tweet the next day, Trump asserted, \\"Trade wars are good, and easy to win.\\"[33] On March 8, he signed an order to impose the tariffs effective after 15 days.[2] The EU, Canada, Mexico, Australia, Argentina, Brazil and South Korea were temporarily exempted from the order under a carve-out provision.[34] But Canada, Mexico and the EU became subject to the steel and aluminium tariffs later in an announcement on May 31, 2018.[2][35][36]\\r\\n\\r\\nWhile the steel tariff as a rule applies to all countries worldwide, there are nevertheless four countries that have successfully negotiated a permanent exemption from the steel tariff with the Trump administration.[37][38][39]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe legal basis cited in Trump's tariff order is Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962 which under certain circumstances allows the president to impose tariffs based on the recommendation from the U.S. Secretary of Commerce if \\"an article is being imported into the United States in such quantities or under such circumstances as to threaten or impair the national security.\\"[40] This section is rarely used,[40] and has never been invoked since the World Trade Organization was established in 1995.[41]\\r\\n\\r\\nChina initiated a WTO complaint against the U.S. steel and aluminum tariffs on April 9, 2018.[42] The EU opened a similar WTO case on June 1, 2018.[43]\\r\\n\\r\\nOn June 9, 2018, Trump tweeted a statement addressing Prime Minister of Canada Justin Trudeau in which he said that American tariffs targeting Canada \\"are in response to his [tariffs] of 270% on dairy!\\"[44] In the tweet, Trump did not cite national security, the legal basis for implementing the tariff.[45][46]\\r\\n\\r\\nA survey of leading economists by the Initiative on Global Markets at the University of Chicago Booth School of Business showed a consensus that imposing new US tariffs on steel and aluminum will not improve Americans welfare.[47] Economists say that the tariffs will lead to more harm than gains, as the price for steel increases, which will harm consumers and Americans working in manufacturing industries that use steel (these jobs outnumber those who work in steel-producing sectors by 80 to 1).[48][49][50] The big winners of the tariffs are some American steel- and aluminum-producing industries; some of the producers (especially small- and middle-sized ones) who are reliant on foreign inputs may struggle as a result of the tariffs.[50][51][52] A study of the proposal indicated that it would lead to an estimated loss of 146,000 jobs.[53] Studies of the 2002 steel tariffs enacted by the Bush administration show that they caused more job losses than job gains.[48] Jobs losses could be even greater if other countries retaliate against the United States with their own tariffs on various American products.[54]\\r\\n\\r\\nScholars warned that the Trump administration's use of \\"national security\\" rationales[55] (these have not been commonly used by past administrations) for the tariffs could undermine the international trading order, as other states could use the same rationales for their own tariffs.[48][56][50][57] The WTO allows states to take actions necessary to ensure their national security, but this provision has been sparsely used, given that it could be abused.[58] Whereas national security reasons were cited for the tariffs, it has been noted that tariffs primarily harm American allies, not enemies; the United States imports very little steel and aluminum from China directly.[59] Trade experts furthermore noted that the United States already produces more than two-thirds of its own steel.[57]\\r\\n\\r\\nForty-five U.S. trade associations are urging Trump not to impose tariffs on China, warning it would be \\"particularly harmful\\" to the U.S. economy and consumers.[60]\\r\\n\\r\\nDomestically, reactions from elected officials often varied among regional lines rather than ideological lines.[61] The tariffs have seen widespread criticism from conservatives and Republicans.[62][63][64] However, the Republican-controlled Congress has thus far declined to take any action to counter Trump's imposition of tariffs.[65][66] Speaker Paul Ryan said that Congress would not pass any tariff legislation that Trump would veto.[65]\\r\\n\\r\\nReception was mixed among Democratic officials,[67] with Democrats from Rust Belt states voicing support for tariffs on steel and aluminum imports.[68]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe AFL-CIO, the largest labor union in the U.S., praised Trump for the tariffs, as did Democratic Ohio Senator Sherrod Brown, who said that the action would be a boon for \\"steel plants across Ohio.\\" Many congressional Republicans expressed fear that the tariffs might damage the economy or lead to retaliatory tariffs from other countries. Speaker of the House Paul Ryan and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell urged Trump to rethink his proposal or to target the tariffs more narrowly so as to avoid \\"unintended consequences and collateral damage.\\"[69] House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, while calling for  strategic and targeted actions against \\"trade  cheaters,\\" criticized Trump's rollout  of the tariffs, calling it \\"chaotic\\" and that  it was \\"maximizing the collateral damage to American workers, consumers and our international alliances.\\"[70] The proposal drew comparisons to a tariff imposed by his Republican presidential predecessor, George W. Bush;[71] in 2002 the U.S. imposed heavy steel tariffs that were largely seen as ineffectual or even harmful to the U.S., and were withdrawn after 18 months.[72]\\r\\n\\r\\nOn March 6, 2018, Gary Cohn, chair of the National Economic Council, announced his intention to resign; the announcement followed Trump's cancellation of a meeting with end-users of steel and aluminum that Cohn had arranged in an attempt to dissuade the president from the planned tariffs.[73]\\r\\n\\r\\nA March 2018 Quinnipiac University poll showed widespread disapproval of the tariffs, with only 29% of Americans agreeing with a \\"25% tariff on steel imports and a 10% tariff on aluminum imports\\" if it raised their cost of living.[74]\\r\\n\\r\\nChina, Canada, and the European Union responded negatively to the initial announcement (which did not mention any temporary exemptions). Canada supplies 16% of U.S. demand for steel, followed by Brazil at 13%, South Korea at 10%,[75] Mexico at 9%, and China at 2%.[71]\\r\\n\\r\\nFrom 2013 to 2016, Canada was the largest source of aluminum imports to the U.S.[76][77]\\r\\n\\r\\nTrump invoked national security grounds as justification for imposing tariffs on Canada. Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said that this was \\"absurd\\" and stated: \\"That Canada could be considered a national security risk to the United States is inconceivable...Let me be clear, these tariffs are totally unacceptable.\\" He announced $16.6 billion in retaliatory tariffs, stating that \\"American people are not the target ... We hope eventually that common sense will triumph. Unfortunately the actions taken today by the United States government do not appear headed in that direction.\\"[78]\\r\\n\\r\\nFrom July 1, 2018, Canada implemented retaliatory tariffs on U.S. imports.[5] The value of the Canadian tariffs will match the value of the U.S. tariffs dollar-for-dollar and cover 299 U.S. goods, including steel, aluminum, and a variety of other products, including inflatable boats, yogurt, whiskies, candles, and sleeping bags.[6]\\r\\n\\r\\nJean-Claude Juncker, the president of the European Commission, condemned U.S. steel and aluminum tariffs and announced that a legal challenge at the World Trade Organization would follow.[79] The EU filed the WTO challenge against the United States on June 1, once the tariffs took effect.[80]\\r\\n\\r\\nEuropean Union retaliatory tariffs took effect on June 22, 2018, imposing tariffs on 180 types of products, over $3 billion of U.S. goods. Affected products include steel and aluminum, agricultural goods (including orange juice and cranberry juice), clothing, washing machines, cosmetics, and boats.[81] European Commissioner for Trade Cecilia Malmstr?m stated: \\"The rules of international trade, which we have developed ... with our American partners, cannot be violated without a reaction from our side. Our response is measured, proportionate and fully in line with WTO rules.\\"[81] Among the U.S. manufacturers affected by the EU's responsive tariffs is Harley-Davidson, which announced that it would move some of their manufacturing out of the United States.[82]\\r\\n\\r\\nChina said that it will retaliate for the tariffs imposed on $50 billion of Chinese goods that came into effect on July 6.[8] China threatened to curb imports of U.S. soybeans.[83]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn response to the imposition of U.S. tariffs, Mexico implemented retaliatory tariffs on around $3 billion worth of U.S. goods. These Mexican tariffs, which went into effect on June 5, are imposed on U.S. steel, pork, cheese, whiskey, and apples, among other goods.[5][84]\\r\\n\\r\\nOn January 23, 2018, news outlets announced that Trump had imposed tariffs on solar panels produced outside the United States. The tariffs initially start at 30% and will gradually fall to 15% in four years.[85][86] The first 2.5 gigawatts of solar cells imported each year will be exempted from the tariff.[87]\\r\\n\\r\\nChina is currently the world leader in solar panel manufacture, and has decried the tariffs.[88] Zhong Shan, the Chinese Ministry of Commerce said in a statement, \\"With regard to the wrong measures taken by the United States, China will work with other W.T.O. members to resolutely defend our legitimate interests.\\"[89]\\r\\n\\r\\nEnvironmentalists and animal rights advocates have expressed concern that the new tariffs will hurt the growth of sustainable energy and the species which are on the endangered list due to climate change.[90]\\r\\n\\r\\nOn January 23, 2018, in conjunction with the tariffs placed on solar panels, the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative announced tariffs on washing machines.[87] According to the U.S. International Trade Commission (ITC), imports of large residential washers increased \\"steadily\\" from 2012 to 2016, and that domestic producers' financial performance \\"declined precipitously\\".[91] In the first year, the tariffs start at 20% for the first 1.2 million units of imported finished washers, and all subsequent washers within that year will have a 50% tariff. By the third year initial tariff will go down to 16-40%, following the same pattern.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe tariffs came after a petition was filed by Whirlpool, a U.S.-based washing machine manufacturer facing tough competition from LG Electronics and Samsung both based in South Korea.[92]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 2016, China exported $425 million worth of washers to the United States, followed by Mexico with $240 million, and South Korean companies $130 million.[91] Samsung and LG are among the top exporters of washers to the United States. Two weeks before the tariff announcement, Samsung had moved its production of washing machines to a new plant in South Carolina. In response Samsung said U.S. consumers will \\"pay more, with fewer choices.\\" Mexican officials said they would respond to the tariffs during the ongoing NAFTA renegotiations.[93]\\r\\n\\r\\nOn March 22, 2018, Trump signed a memorandum under the Section 301 of the Trade Act of 1974, instructing the United States Trade Representative (USTR) to apply tariffs of $50 billion on Chinese goods. Trump stated that the tariffs would be imposed due to Chinese theft of U.S intellectual property.[94] Trump said that his planned tariffs on Chinese imports would make the United States \\"a much stronger, much richer nation.\\"[95] However, the steps toward imposing the tariffs led to increased concerns of a global trade war.[94]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 724 points, or 2.9%, after the tariffs were announced due to concerns over a trade war.[96] Corporations that traded with China, such as Caterpillar Inc.and Boeing suffered large losses in their stock price.[97]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn response, the Ministry of Commerce of the People's Republic of China announced plans to implement its own tariffs on 128 U.S. products. 120 of those products, such as fruit and wine, will be taxed at a 15% duty while the remaining 8 products, including pork, will receive a 25% tariff.[98][99] China implemented their tariffs on April 2, 2018.[100][101]\\r\\n\\r\\nOn April 3, 2018, the U.S. Trade Representative's office published an initial list of 1,300+ Chinese goods to impose levies upon, including products like flat-screen televisions, weapons, satellites, medical devices, aircraft parts and batteries.[102][103][104] Chinese Ambassador Cui Tiankai responded by warning the US that they may fight back, saying \\"We have done the utmost to avoid this kind of situation, but if the other side makes the wrong choice, then we have no alternative but to fight back.\\"[105]\\r\\n\\r\\nOn April 4, 2018, China's Customs Tariff Commission of the State Council decided to announce a plan of additional tariffs of 25% on 106 items of products including automobiles, airplanes, and soybeans.[106] Soybeans are the top U.S. agricultural export to China.[107][108]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe increased tit-for-tat tariff announcements stoked fears that the two countries are inching closer to a trade war.[109][110][111] On April 4, 2018, President Trump responded to speculation tweeting: \\"We are not in a trade war with China, that war was lost many years ago by the foolish, or incompetent, people who represented the U.S. Now we have a Trade Deficit of $500 Billion a year, with Intellectual Property Theft of another $300 Billion. We cannot let this continue!\\"[112] The next day Trump directed the USTR to consider $100 billion in additional tariffs.[113][114]\\r\\n\\r\\nOn May 9, 2018, China cancelled soybean orders exported from United States to China. Zhang Xiaoping, Chinese director for the U.S. Soybean Export Council, said that Chinese buyers simply stopped buying from the U.S.[115]\\r\\n\\r\\nOn June 15, Donald Trump released a list of $34 billion of Chinese goods to face a 25% tariff, starting on July 6.  Another list with $16 billion of Chinese goods was released, with an implementation date of August 23.[116]\\r\\n\\r\\nOn July 10, the United States Trade Representative, in reaction to China's retaliatory tariffs that took effect July 6, requested comments, gave notice of public hearings and issued a proposed list of Chinese products amounting to an annual trade value of about $200 billion dollars that would be subjected to an additional 10% in duties on top of what those imported articles would normally pay.[117]\\r\\n\\r\\nOn March 28, 2018 the United States and South Korea announced major changes to the bilateral United StatesÿKorea Free Trade Agreement (KORUS FTA) in response to the numerous tariffs and the proposed North Korean-United States diplomatic meeting.[118] The 25 percent tariff on South Korean trucks will be extend until 2041, adding twenty years to the current 2021 target phase out date. No South Korean auto manufacturer exports trucks to the United States. The United States  exempted South Korea from its steel and aluminum tariffs, but imposed an import quota of about 2.68 million tonnes.[119][120]\\r\\n\\r\\nDuring the campaign, Trump said he would impose tariffs  in the range of 15 to 35%  on companies that move their operations to Mexico.[24]  Trump proposed a 35% tariff on \\"every car, every truck and every part manufactured in Ford's Mexico plant that comes across the border.\\"[121] Tariffs at that level would be far higher than the international norms (which are around 2.67% for the U.S. and most other advanced economies and under 10% for most developing countries).[122]\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter the European Union threatened to impose retaliatory tariffs should a tariff on steel and aluminum be imposed, on March 3, 2018 Trump countered with a threat to impose tariffs on European car manufacturers.[123]","input":"When did the steel and aluminum tariffs start?"},{"output":"the Lorax","context":"The Lorax (also known as Dr. Seuss' The Lorax) is a 2012 American 3D computer-animated musical fantasyÿcomedy film produced by Illumination Entertainment and based on Dr. Seuss's children's book of the same name. The film was released by Universal Pictures on March 2, 2012, on what it would be the 108th birthday of Dr. Seuss.\\r\\nThe second film adaptation of the book (following the 1972 animated television special), the film builds on the book by expanding the story of the Lorax and Ted, the previously unnamed boy who visits the Once-ler. The cast includes Danny DeVito as the Lorax, Ed Helms as the Once-ler and Zac Efron as Ted. New characters introduced in the film are Audrey (voiced by Taylor Swift), Aloysius O'Hare (Rob Riggle), Mrs. Wiggins, Ted's mother (Jenny Slate), and Grammy Norma, Ted's grandmother (Betty White).[4]\\r\\nThe film received mixed reviews from critics, but it was a box office success, grossing $348.8 million worldwide based on a $70 million budget.[3]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nTed Wiggins is a 12-year-old, idealistic boy, who lives in Thneedville, a walled city that, aside from the human citizens, is almost completely artificial; everything is made of plastic, metal, or synthetics with no living plants. Ted has a crush on local environmentalist Audrey, who wants to see a \\"real tree\\" more than anything in the world, and decides to find one in order to impress her. His energetic Granny Norma secretly tells Ted the legend of the Once-ler, who will tell anyone about trees if they brought him fifteen cents, a nail, and a shell of a great-great-great grandfather snail. When Ted leaves Thneedville in search of the Once-ler, he discovers that the outside world is a contaminated, empty, barren wasteland. Once the boy finds him, the Once-ler agrees to tell Ted about the trees on the condition that he listens to the story over multiple visits. Ted agrees, but on his next trip, he encounters the mayor of Thneedville, Aloysius O'Hare, who is also the proprietor of a company that sells bottled oxygen (\\"fresh air\\") to Thneedville residents. O'Hare forbids Ted from talking about trees, saying they are dangerous, but really it's because trees produce oxygen free of charge, he considers it a threat to his business. After revealing that he has \\"security camera eyes\\" all over the city, O'Hare pressures Ted to stay in town. However, Ted continues to sneak out of O'Hare's sight (with his grandmother's encouragement) and learns more of the trees' history.\\r\\nOver Ted's various visits, the Once-ler recounts the story that when he was a young man, he departed his family to find good material for his Thneed invention and make a business. The Once-ler meets the guardian of the forest, the Lorax, after cutting down a Truffula tree in a lush Truffula tree forest valley. The Lorax urges the Once-ler to leave the forest, but the Once-ler refuses. Eventually, the Once-ler promises not to chop another tree down, and the two seem to begin a friendship of sorts. Then, the young businessman's Thneed invention becomes a major success and the Once-ler's family arrives to participate in the business. At first keeping his promise, the Once-ler continues Thneed production by harvesting the Truffula tree tufts in a slow, but sustainable manner. However, his greedy and lazy relatives soon convince him to resume chopping down the trees. Overtime, the Once-ler's deforestation spirals into a mass overproduction. Flushed with wealth, the Once-ler rationalizes his short-sighted needs into arrogant self-righteousness, and the Lorax's helpless protests do not stop him. The Once-ler pollutes the sky, river, and landscape, until the very last Truffula Tree falls. With no further chance of business, he is left broken and his mother disowns him. With the region uninhabitable because of the pollution and deforestation from the Once-ler's business, the Lorax sends the animals off to find a new place to live before the Once-ler sees him depart into the sky, leaving only a stone-cut word: \\"Unless\\". Distraught and ruined, the Once-ler becomes a recluse.\\r\\nAfter he finishes telling his story, the Once-ler finally understands the meaning behind the Lorax's last message, and gives Ted the last Truffula seed in hopes that he can plant it and make others care about real trees once more. Ted's desire to impress Audrey also becomes a personal mission to remind his town of the importance of nature. O'Hare, still determined not to have trees undermine his business, takes heavy-handed steps such as covering Audrey's nature paintings, closing off the door that Ted uses to see the Once-ler, and forcibly searching Ted's room for the seed, which has begun to grow after accidentally having some water from Ted's falling bottle. Ted enlists his family and Audrey to help plant the seed. O'Hare and his two henchmen pursue the dissidents until they manage to elude him and reach the town center. When Ted finally attempts to plant the seed, he is interrupted by O'Hare, who rallies the population to stop them by telling the people that trees are extremely dangerous and filthy. To convince them otherwise, Ted takes an earthmover and rams down a section of the city wall to reveal the environmental destruction outside, thereby showing them what O'Hare is encouraging. Horrified at the sight and inspired by Ted's conviction (as though a part of the Lorax is within him), the crowd turns against O'Hare when they discover his true nature, with his own henchmen expelling him from the town with his jet pack-like helmet, and the seed is finally planted. Time passes and the land starts to recover; new trees sprout, the animals begin to return, and the redeemed, now-mustached Once-ler happily reunites with the Lorax.\\r\\nThe film is the fourth feature film based on a book by Dr. Seuss, the second fully computer-animated adaptation (the first one being Horton Hears a Who!), and the first to be released in 3-D. The Lorax was also Illumination's first film presented in IMAX 3D (known as \\"IMAX Tree-D\\" in publicity for the film).[9] The idea for the film was initiated by Audrey Geisel, Dr. Seuss' wife, who had an established partnership with Chris Meledandri, the producer of the film, from a collaboration on Horton Hears a Who!. Geisel approached Meledandri when he launched Illumination Entertainment, saying \\"This is the one I want to do next\\".[10] The film was officially announced in July 2009, with Meledandri attached as the producer and Geisel as the executive producer. Chris Renaud and Kyle Balda were announced as the director and co-director of the film, while Cinco Paul and Ken Daurio, the duo who wrote the script for Horton Hears a Who!, were set to write the screenplay.[11] In 2010, it was announced that Danny DeVito would be voicing the titular character.[12]\\r\\nThe film was fully produced at the French studio \\"Illumination Mac Guff\\", which was the animation department of Mac Guff which was acquired by Illumination Entertainment in the summer of 2011.[13] DeVito reprised his role in five different languages, including the original English audio, and also for the Spanish, Italian, German, and Russian language dub editions.[14] Universal added an environmental message to the film's website after a fourth-grade class in Brookline, Massachusetts launched a successful petition through Change.org.[15]\\r\\nThe film was released on March 2, 2012 in the United States and Canada and was released on July 27, 2012 in the United Kingdom.\\r\\nMazda used the likeness of The Lorax's setting and characters in an advertisement for their CX-5 SUV.[16] This was seen by some as the complete opposite of the work's original meaning.[17] In response, Stephanie Sperber, president of Universal partnerships and licensing, said Universal chose to partner with the Mazda CX-5 because it is \\"a really good choice for consumers to make who may not have the luxury or the money to buy electric or buy hybrid. It's a way to take the better environmental choice to everyone.\\"[18]\\r\\nThe film has also been used to sell Seventh Generation disposable diapers.[19] In total, Illumination Entertainment struck more than 70 different product integration deals for the film.[20]\\r\\nThe film was released on DVD and Blu-ray Disc on August 7, 2012.\\r\\nThree mini-movies were released on the Lorax Blu-ray/DVD Combo Pack on August 7, 2012: Serenade, Wagon Ho!, and Forces of Nature.[21]\\r\\nLou wants to impress a girl Barbaloot, but he has some competition.\\r\\nThe Once-ler arrives with his wagon and Melvin.

When the Once-ler goes inside his house, Pipsqueak and Lou start cranking up the wagon, but Melvin refuses to pull it because he is angry that they whipped the reins. So Pipsqueak hangs a truffula fruit in front of Melvin as an incentive. However, Melvin gets exhausted going up a steep hill. Then the wagon gets unhooked from Melvin, and it rolls downhill backwards while Pipsqueak and Lou scream in terror. Melvin chases the runaway wagon. Lou tries to stop the wagon by stabbing a stick in one of its wheels, but he gets stuck on the wheel instead. Finally, he lands back on the seat next to Pipsqueak, who hugs him happily. The wagon hits a rock and is propelled downhill even faster. When it approaches a cliff, Pipsqueak panics and grabs the wagon canopy, which flies offonly to be held in place by Lou. The wagon flies off the cliff, but the canopy acts as a parachute and they make their descent calmly, landing in the same place they left. Melvin appears shortly after. The Once-ler comes out of the house and is surprised to see them. He expresses surprise that they listened to instructions, but just when it seems like they fooled him, Lou sneezes and the wagon falls apart. Melvin hides beneath his hooves and Lou and Pipsqueak curl up into a ball. The Once-ler looks annoyed and makes a small, disgruntled \\"Grr\\" sound, causing Lou and Pipsqueak to run away into the trees.\\r\\nThe Lorax makes Pipsqueak an Honorary Lorax and team up to scare the Once-ler by using two sticks that looks like a monster's hand to freak him out. The Once-ler finds out it's fake and sprays water on the Lorax, which makes his fur puff-up. When the Lorax tells Pipsqueak that he's going to turn out like him, Pipsqueak gets scared and runs away. The short ends with the Lorax telling Pipsqueak that he lost his Honorary Lorax title.\\r\\nBlockdot created a mobile puzzle game based on the film, titled Truffula Shuffula.

B. Morse","context":"Joseph Henry  (December 17, 1797?ÿ May 13, 1878) was an American scientist who served as the first Secretary of the Smithsonian Institution. He was the secretary for the National Institute for the Promotion of Science, a precursor of the Smithsonian Institution.[1] He was highly regarded during his lifetime. While building electromagnets, Henry discovered the electromagnetic phenomenon of self-inductance. He also discovered mutual inductance independently of Michael Faraday, though Faraday was the first to make the discovery and publish his results.[2][3][4] Henry developed the electromagnet into a practical device. He invented a precursor to the electric doorbell (specifically a bell that could be rung at a distance via an electric wire, 1831)[5] and electric relay (1835).[6] The SI unit of inductance, the henry, is named in his honor. Henry's work on the electromagnetic relay was the basis of the practical electrical telegraph, invented by Samuel F. B. Morse and Sir Charles Wheatstone, separately.\\r\\n\\r\\nHenry was born in Albany, New York, to Scottish immigrants Ann Alexander Henry and William Henry. His parents were poor, and Henry's father died while he was still young. For the rest of his childhood, Henry lived with his grandmother in Galway, New York. He attended a school which would later be named the \\"Joseph Henry Elementary School\\" in his honor. After school, he worked at a general store, and at the age of thirteen became an apprentice watchmaker and silversmith. Joseph's first love was theater and he came close to becoming a professional actor. His interest in science was sparked at the age of sixteen by a book of lectures on scientific topics titled Popular Lectures on Experimental Philosophy. In 1819 he entered The Albany Academy, where he was given free tuition. Even with free tuition he was so poor that he had to support himself with teaching and private tutoring positions. He intended to go into medicine, but in 1824 he was appointed an assistant engineer for the survey of the State road being constructed between the Hudson River and Lake Erie. From then on, he was inspired to a career in either civil or mechanical engineering.\\r\\n\\r\\nHenry excelled at his studies (so much so, that he would often help his teachers teach science) and in 1826 was appointed Professor of Mathematics and Natural Philosophy at The Albany Academy by Principal T. Romeyn Beck. Some of his most important research was conducted in this new position. His curiosity about terrestrial magnetism led him to experiment with magnetism in general. He was the first to coil insulated wire tightly around an iron core in order to make a more powerful electromagnet, improving on William Sturgeon's electromagnet which used loosely coiled uninsulated wire. Using this technique, he built the strongest electromagnet at the time for Yale. He also showed that, when making an electromagnet using just two electrodes attached to a battery, it is best to wind several coils of wire in parallel, but when using a set-up with multiple batteries, there should be only one single long coil. The latter made the telegraph feasible. Because of his early experiments in electromagnetism some historians credit Henry with discoveries pre-dating Faraday and Hertz, however, Henry is not credited due to not publishing his work.[7]\\r\\n\\r\\nUsing his newly developed electromagnetic principle, Henry in 1831 created one of the first machines to use electromagnetism for motion. This was the earliest ancestor of modern DC motor. It did not make use of rotating motion, but was merely an electromagnet perched on a pole, rocking back and forth. The rocking motion was caused by one of the two leads on both ends of the magnet rocker touching one of the two battery cells, causing a polarity change, and rocking the opposite direction until the other two leads hit the other battery.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis apparatus allowed Henry to recognize the property of self inductance. British scientist Michael Faraday also recognized this property around the same time. Since Faraday published his results first, he became the officially recognized discoverer of the phenomenon.\\r\\n\\r\\nFrom 1832 to 1846, Henry served as the first Chair of Natural History at the College of New Jersey (now Princeton University).[8][9] While in Princeton, he taught a wide range of courses including natural history, chemistry, and architecture, and ran a laboratory on campus. Decades later, Henry wrote that he made \\"several thousand original investigations on electricity, magnetism, and electro-magnetism\\" while on the Princeton faculty.[10] Henry relied heavily on an African American research assistant, Sam Parker, in his laboratory and experiments. Parker was a free black man hired by the Princeton trustees to assist Henry. In an 1841 letter to mathematician Elias Loomis, Henry wrote:\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Trustees have however furnished me with an article which I now find indispensible namely with a coloured servant whom I have taught to manage my batteries and who now relieves me from all the dirty work of the laboratory.[11]\\r\\nIn his letters, Henry described Parker providing materials for experiments, fixing technical issues with Henry's equipment, and at times being used as a test subject in electrical experiments in which Henry and his students would shock Parker in classroom demonstrations.[8][9] In 1842, when Parker fell ill, Henry's experiments stopped completely until he recovered.[8][9]\\r\\n\\r\\nHenry was appointed the first Secretary of the Smithsonian Institution in 1846, and served in this capacity until 1878. In 1848, while Secretary, Henry worked in conjunction with Professor Stephen Alexander to determine the relative temperatures for different parts of the solar disk. They used a thermopile to determine that sunspots were cooler than the surrounding regions.[12][13][14][15] This work was shown to the astronomer Angelo Secchi who extended it, but with some question as to whether Henry was given proper credit for his earlier work.[16]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn late 1861 and early 1862, during the American Civil War, Henry oversaw a series of lectures by prominent abolitionists at the Smithsonian Institution.[17] Speakers included white clergymen, politicians, and activists such as Wendell Phillips, Horace Greeley, Henry Ward Beecher, and Ralph Waldo Emerson. Famous orator and former fugitive slave Frederick Douglass was scheduled as the final speaker; Henry, however, refused to allow him to attend, stating: \\"I would not let the lecture of the coloured man be given in the rooms of the Smithsonian.\\"[8][17]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the fall of 2014 history author Jeremy T.K. Farley released \\"The Civil War Out My Window: Diary of Mary Henry.\\"  The 262-page book featured the diary of Henry's daughter Mary, from the years of 1855 to 1878. Throughout the diary, Henry is repeatedly mentioned by his daughter, who showed a keen affection to her father.[18]\\r\\n\\r\\nProf. Henry was introduced to Prof. Thaddeus Lowe, a balloonist from New Hampshire who had taken interest in the phenomenon of lighter-than-air gases, and exploits into meteorology, in particular, the high winds which we call the Jet stream today. It was Lowe's intent to make a transatlantic crossing by utilizing an enormous gas-inflated aerostat. Henry took a great interest in Lowe's endeavors, promoting him among some of the more prominent scientists and institutions of the day.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn June 1860, Lowe had made a successful test flight with his gigantic balloon, first named the City of New York and later renamed The Great Western, flying from Philadelphia to Medford, New York. Lowe would not be able to attempt a transatlantic flight until late Spring of the 1861, so Henry convinced him to take his balloon to a point more West and fly the balloon back to the eastern seaboard, an exercise that would keep his investors interested.\\r\\n\\r\\nLowe took several smaller balloons to Cincinnati, Ohio in March 1861. On 19 April, he launched on a fateful flight that landed him in Confederate South Carolina. With the Southern States seceding from the Union, during that winter and spring of 1861, and the onset of Civil War, Lowe abandoned further attempts at a trans-Atlantic crossing and, with Henry's endorsement, went to Washington, D.C. to offer his services as an aeronaut to the Federal government. Henry submitted a letter to U.S. Secretary of War at the time Simon Cameron of Pennsylvania which carried Henry's endorsement:\\r\\n\\r\\nHon. SIMON CAMERON\\r\\n\\r\\nDEAR SIR: In accordance with your request made to me orally on the morning of the 6th of June, I have examined the apparatus and witnessed the balloon experiments of Mr. Lowe, and have come to the following conclusions\\r\\n\\r\\n1st. The balloon prepared by Mr. Lowe, inflated with ordinary street gas, will retain its charge for several days.\\r\\n\\r\\n2d. In an inflated condition it can be towed by a few men along an ordinary road, or over fields, in ordinarily calm weather, from the places where it is galled [i.e. swelled or inflated] to another, twenty or more miles distant.\\r\\n\\r\\n3d. It can be let up into the air by means of a rope in a calm day to a height sufficient to observe the country for twenty miles around and more, according to the degree of clearness of the atmosphere. The ascent may also be made at night and the camp lights of the enemy observed.\\r\\n\\r\\n4th. From experiments made here for the first time it is conclusively proved that telegrams can be sent with ease and certainty between the balloon and the quarters of the commanding officer.\\r\\n\\r\\n5th. I feel assured, although I have not witnessed the experiment, that when the surface wind is from the east, as it was for several days last week, an observer in the balloon can be made to float nearly to the enemy's camp (as it is now situated to the west of us), or even to float over it, and then return eastward by rising to a higher elevation. This assumption is based on the fact that the upper strata of wind in this latitude is always flowing eastward. Mr. Lowe informs me, and I do not doubt his statement, that he will on any day which is favorable make an excursion of the kind above mentioned.\\r\\n\\r\\n6th. From all the facts I have observed and the information I have gathered I am sure that important information may be obtained in regard to the topography of the country and to the position and movements of an enemy by means of the balloon now, and that Mr. Lowe is well qualified to render service in this way by the balloon now in his possession.\\r\\n\\r\\n7th. The balloon which Mr. Lowe now has in Washington can only be inflated in a city where street gas is to be obtained. If an exploration is required at a point too distant for the transportation of the inflated balloon, an additional apparatus for the generation of hydrogen gas will be required. The necessity of generating the gas renders the use of the balloon more expensive, but this, where important results are required, is of comparatively small importance.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor these preliminary experiments, as you may recollect, a sum not to exceed $200 or $250 was to be appropriated, and in accordance with this Mr. Lowe has presented me with the in closed statement of items, which I think are reasonable, since nothing is charged for labor and time of the aeronautic.\\r\\n\\r\\nI have the honor to remain, very respectfully, your obedient servant,\\r\\n\\r\\nOn Henry's recommendation Lowe went on to form the United States Army/\\"Union Army\\" Balloon Corps and served two years with the Army of the Potomac as a Civil War \\"Aeronaut\\".\\r\\n\\r\\nAs a famous scientist and director of the Smithsonian Institution, Henry received visits from other scientists and inventors who sought his advice. Henry was patient, kindly, self-controlled, and gently humorous.[19] One such visitor was Alexander Graham Bell, who on 1 March 1875 carried a letter of introduction to Henry. Henry showed an interest in seeing Bell's experimental apparatus, and Bell returned the following day. After the demonstration, Bell mentioned his untested theory on how to transmit human speech electrically by means of a \\"harp apparatus\\" which would have several steel reeds tuned to different frequencies to cover the voice spectrum. Henry said Bell had \\"the germ of a great invention\\". Henry advised Bell not to publish his ideas until he had perfected the invention. When Bell objected that he lacked the necessary knowledge, Henry firmly advised: \\"Get it!\\"\\r\\n\\r\\nOn 25 June 1876, Bell's experimental telephone (using a different design) was demonstrated at the Centennial Exhibition in Philadelphia where Henry was one of the judges for electrical exhibits. On 13 January 1877, Bell demonstrated his instruments to Henry at the Smithsonian Institution and Henry invited Bell to demonstrate them again that night at the Washington Philosophical Society. Henry praised \\"the value and astonishing character of Mr. Bell's discovery and invention.\\"[20]\\r\\n\\r\\nHenry died on 13 May 1878, and was buried in Oak Hill Cemetery in the Georgetown section of northwest Washington, D.C. John Phillips Sousa wrote the Transit of Venus March for the unveiling of the Joseph Henry statue in front of the Smithsonian Castle.\\r\\n\\r\\nHenry was a member of the United States Lighthouse Board from 1852 until his death. He was appointed chairman in 1871 and served in that position the remainder of his life. He was the only civilian to serve as chairman. The United States Coast Guard honored Henry for his work on lighthouses and fog signal acoustics by naming a cutter after him. The Joseph Henry, usually referred to as the Joe Henry, was launched in 1880 and was active until 1904.[21]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1915 Henry was inducted into the Hall of Fame for Great Americans in the Bronx, New York.\\r\\n\\r\\nBronze statues of Henry and Isaac Newton represent science on the balustrade of the galleries of the Main Reading Room in the Thomas Jefferson Building of the Library of Congress on Capitol Hill in Washington, D.C. They are two of the 16 historical figures depicted in the reading room, each pair representing one of the 8 pillars of civilization.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1872 John Wesley Powell named a mountain range in southeastern Utah after Henry. The Henry Mountains were the last mountain range to be added to the map of the 48 contiguous U.S. states.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt Princeton, the Joseph Henry Laboratories and the Joseph Henry House are named for him.[22]\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter the Albany Academy moved out of its downtown building in the early 1930s, its old building in Academy Park was renamed Joseph Henry Memorial, with a statue of him out front. It is now the main offices of the Albany City School District. In 1971 it was listed on the National Register of Historic Places; later it was included as a contributing property when the Lafayette Park Historic District was listed on the Register.\\r\\n\\r\\nElected a member of the American Antiquarian Society in 1851.[23]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe District of Columbia named a school, built in 1878ÿ80, on P Street between 6th and 7th the Joseph Henry School.

Some species within the order, not quite as flat, are known as sea biscuits. Related animals include other sea urchins, sea cucumbers, and starfish.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nSand dollars, like all members of the order Clypeasteroida, possess a rigid skeleton known as a test. The test consists of calcium carbonate plates arranged in a fivefold radial pattern.[2] In living individuals, the test is covered by a skin of velvet-textured spines which are covered with very small hairs (cilia). Coordinated movements of the spines enable sand dollars to move across the seabed. The velvety spines of live sand dollars appear in a variety of colorsgreen, blue, violet, or purpledepending on the species. Individuals which are very recently dead or dying (moribund) are sometimes found on beaches with much of the external morphology still intact. Dead individuals are commonly found with their empty test devoid of all surface material and bleached white by sunlight.\\r\\nThe bodies of adult sand dollars, like those of other echinoids, display radial symmetry. The petal-like pattern in sand dollars consists of five paired rows of pores. The pores are perforations in the endoskeleton through which podia for gas exchange project from the body. The mouth of the sand dollar is located on the bottom of its body at the center of the petal-like pattern. Unlike other urchins, the bodies of sand dollars also display secondary front-to-back bilateral symmetry. The anus of sand dollars is located at the back rather than at the top as in most urchins, with many more bilateral features appearing in some species. These result from the adaptation of sand dollars, in the course of their evolution, from creatures that originally lived their lives on top of the seabed (epibenthos) to creatures that burrow beneath it (endobenthos).\\r\\nThe common sand dollar, Echinarachnius parma, is widespread from intertidal zones to considerable depths in the ocean waters of the Northern Hemisphere. It can be found in temperate and tropical zones. The keyhole sand dollar (three species, genus Mellita) is found on a wide range of coasts in and around the Caribbean Sea.\\r\\nEccentric sand dollars (Dendraster excentricus) at Monterey Bay Aquarium.\\r\\nAccording to World Register of Marine Species:\\r\\nThe term \\"sand dollar\\" derives from the appearance of the tests (skeletons) of dead individuals after being washed ashore. The test lacks its velvet-like skin of spines and has often been bleached white by sunlight. To beachcombers of the past, this suggested a large, silver coin, such as the old Spanish or American dollar (diameter 38-40mm).\\r\\nOther English names for the creatures include sand cake and cake urchin.[3] In South Africa, they are known as pansy shells from their suggestion of a five-petaled garden flower. The Caribbean sand dollar or inflated sea biscuit, Clypeaster rosaceus, is thicker in height than most.\\r\\nIn Spanish-speaking areas of the Americas, the sand dollar is most often known as galleta de mar (sea cookie); the translated term is often encountered in English.\\r\\nThe various common terms (sand dollar, sea biscuit, etc.) sometimes appear printed in hyphenated forms (sand-dollar, sea-biscuit).\\r\\nSand dollars live beyond the mean low water line on top of or just beneath the surface of sandy or muddy areas. The spines on the somewhat flattened underside of the animal allow it to burrow or to slowly creep through the sediment. Fine, hair-like cilia cover the tiny spines. Podia line the food grooves that move food to the mouth opening, which is in the center of the star-shaped grooves on the underside of the animal (called the oral surface). Its food consists of crustacean larvae, small copepods, diatoms, algae and detritus.[4]\\r\\nOn the ocean bottom, sand dollars are frequently found together. This is due in part to their preference for soft bottom areas, which are convenient for their reproduction. The sexes are separate and, as with most echinoids, gametes are released into the water column and are conceived by external fertilization. The nektonic larvae metamorphose through several stages before the skeleton or test begins to form, at which point they become benthic.\\r\\nIn 2008, biologists learned that sand dollar larvae clone themselves as a mechanism of self-defense. Cloning is an asexual reproductive mechanism, where the cost is borne by the larva both in resources as well as in development time. Larvae have been observed to undergo this process when food is plentiful or temperature conditions are optimal. It has also been suggested that cloning may occur to make use of the tissues that are normally lost during metamorphosis. Recent research has shown that the larvae of some sand dollars clone themselves when they detect predators (by sensing dissolved fish mucus). Larvae exposed to mucus from predatory fish respond to the threat by cloning themselves, thus doubling their numbers while effectively halving their size. The smaller larvae are better able to escape detection by fish, but may be more vulnerable to predation by smaller animals, such as pelagic and planktonic larval stages of crustaceans.[5][6]\\r\\nSand dollars in their mature form have few natural predators, though ocean pouts and sunflower starfish are known to eat them on occasion.[7]\\r\\nThe ancestors of sand dollars diverged from the other irregular echinoids, namely the cassiduloids, during the early Jurassic,[8] with the first true sand dollar genus, Togocyamus, arising during the Paleocene. Soon after Togocyamus, more modern-looking groups emerged during the Eocene.[1]\\r\\nA variety of imaginative associations have been made by idle beachcombers who run across the bleached skeletons of dead sand dollars. The tests are sometimes said to represent coins lost by mermaids or the people of Atlantis. Christian missionaries found symbolism in the fivefold radial pattern and dove-shaped internal structures. \\"Aristotle's lantern\\" has been discerned in the distinctive perforations of keyhole sand dollars.","input":"What type of symmetry do sand dollars have?"},{"output":"240 miles (384 km)","context":"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Salt March, also known as the Dandi March and the Dandi Satyagraha, was an act of nonviolent civil disobedience in colonial India led by Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi to produce salt from the seawater in the coastal village of Dandi (now in Gujarat), as was the practice of the local populace until British officials introduced taxation on salt production, deemed their sea-salt reclamation activities illegal, and then repeatedly used force to stop it.  The 26-day march lasted from 12 March 1930 to 6 April 1930 as a direct action campaign of tax resistance and nonviolent protest against the British salt monopoly. It gained worldwide attention which gave impetus to the Indian independence movement and started the nationwide Civil Disobedience Movement. Mahatma Gandhi started this march with 78 of his trusted volunteers. The march was over 240 miles. They walked for 24 days 10 miles a day.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe march was the most significant organised challenge to British authority since the Non-cooperation movement of 1920ÿ22, and directly followed the Purna Swaraj declaration of sovereignty and self-rule by the Indian National Congress on 26 January 1930.[1]\\r\\n\\r\\nGandhi led the Dandi March from his base, Sabarmati Ashram, 240 miles (384 km) to the coastal village of dandi, which was at a small town called Navsari (now in the state of Gujarat) to produce salt without paying the tax, growing numbers of Indians joined them along the way. When Gandhi broke the salt laws at 6:30 am on 6 April 1930, it sparked large scale acts of civil disobedience against the British Raj salt laws by millions of Indians.[2] The campaign had a significant effect on changing world and British attitudes towards Indian sovereignty and self-rule [3][4] and caused large numbers of Indians to join the fight for the first time.\\r\\nAfter making salt at Dandi, Gandhi continued southward along the coast, making salt and addressing meetings on the way. The Congress Party planned to stage a satyagraha at the Dharasana Salt Works, 25 miles south of Dandi. However, Gandhi was arrested on the midnight of 4ÿ5 May 1930, just days before the planned action at Dharasana. The Dandi March and the ensuing Dharasana Satyagraha drew worldwide attention to the Indian independence movement through extensive newspaper and newsreel coverage. The satyagraha against the salt tax continued for almost a year, ending with Gandhi's release from jail and negotiations with Viceroy Lord Irwin at the Second Round Table Conference.[5] Over 60,000 Indians were jailed as a result of the Salt Satyagraha.[6] However, it failed to result in major concessions from the British.[7]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Salt Satyagraha campaign was based upon Gandhi's principles of non-violent protest called satyagraha, which he loosely translated as \\"truth-force\\".\\"[8] Literally, it is formed from the Sanskrit words satya, \\"truth\\", and agraha, \\"insistence\\".  In early 1930 the Indian National Congress chose satyagraha as their main tactic for winning Indian sovereignty and self-rule from British rule and appointed Gandhi to organise the campaign. Gandhi chose the 1882 British Salt Act as the first target of satyagraha. The Salt March to Dandi, and the beating by British police of hundreds of nonviolent protesters in Dharasana, which received worldwide news coverage, demonstrated the effective use of civil disobedience as a technique for fighting social and political injustice.[9] The satyagraha teachings of Gandhi and the March to Dandi had a significant influence on American activists Martin Luther King Jr., James Bevel, and others during the Civil Rights Movement for civil rights for African Americans and other minority groups in the 1960s.[10]\\r\\n\\r\\nAt midnight on 31 December 1929, the Indian National Congress raised the tricolour flag of India on the banks of the Ravi at Lahore. The Indian National Congress, led by Gandhi and Jawaharlal Nehru, publicly issued the Declaration of sovereignty and self-rule, or Purna Swaraj, on 26 January 1930.[11] (Literally in Sanskrit, purna, \\"complete,\\" swa, \\"self,\\" raj, \\"rule,\\" so therefore \\"complete self-rule\\".) The declaration included the readiness to withhold taxes, and the statement:\\r\\n\\r\\nWe believe that it is the inalienable right of the Indian people, as of any other people, to have freedom and to enjoy the fruits of their toil and have the necessities of life, so that they may have full opportunities of growth. We believe also that if any government deprives a people of these rights and oppresses them the people have a further right to alter it or abolish it. The British government in India has not only deprived the Indian people of their freedom but has based itself on the exploitation of the masses, and has ruined India economically, politically, culturally and spiritually. We believe therefore, that India must sever the British connection and attain Purna Swaraji or complete sovereignty and self-rule.[12]\\r\\nThe Congress Working Committee gave Gandhi the responsibility for organising the first act of civil disobedience, with Congress itself ready to take charge after Gandhi's expected arrest.[13] Gandhi's plan was to begin civil disobedience with a satyagraha aimed at the British salt tax. The 1882 Salt Act gave the British a monopoly on the collection and manufacture of salt, limiting its handling to government salt depots and levying a salt tax.[14] Violation of the Salt Act was a criminal offence. Even though salt was freely available to those living on the coast (by evaporation of sea water), Indians were forced to buy it from the colonial government.\\r\\n\\r\\nInitially, Gandhi's choice of the salt tax was met with incredulity by the Working Committee of the Congress,[15] Jawaharlal Nehru and Dibyalochan Sahoo were ambivalent; Sardar Patel suggested a land revenue boycott instead.[16][17] The Statesman, a prominent newspaper, wrote about the choice: \\"It is difficult not to laugh, and we imagine that will be the mood of most thinking Indians.\\"[17]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe British establishment too was not disturbed by these plans of resistance against the salt tax. The Viceroy himself, Lord Irwin, did not take the threat of a salt protest seriously, writing to London, \\"At present the prospect of a salt campaign does not keep me awake at night.\\"[18]\\r\\n\\r\\nHowever, Gandhi had sound reasons for his decision. An item of daily use could resonate more with all classes of citizens than an abstract demand for greater political rights.[19] The salt tax represented 8.2% of the British Raj tax revenue, and hurt the poorest Indians the most significantly.[20]\\r\\nExplaining his choice, Gandhi said, \\"Next to air and water, salt is perhaps the greatest necessity of life.\\" In contrast to the other leaders, the prominent Congress statesman and future Governor-General of India, C. Rajagopalachari, understood Gandhi's viewpoint. In a public meeting at Tuticorin, he said:\\r\\n\\r\\nSuppose, a people rise in revolt. They cannot attack the abstract constitution or lead an army against proclamations and statutes...Civil disobedience has to be directed against the salt tax or the land tax or some other particular point  not that; that is our final end, but for the time being it is our aim, and we must shoot straight.[17]\\r\\nGandhi felt that this protest would dramatise Purna Swaraj in a way that was meaningful to every Indian. He also reasoned that it would build unity between Hindus and Muslims by fighting a wrong that touched them equally.[13]\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter the protest gathered steam, the leaders realised the power of salt as a symbol. Nehru remarked about the unprecedented popular response, \\"it seemed as though a spring had been suddenly released.\\"[17]\\r\\n\\r\\nGandhi had a long-standing commitment to nonviolent civil disobedience, which he termed satyagraha, as the basis for achieving Indian sovereignty and self-rule .[21][22] Referring to the relationship between satyagraha and Purna Swaraj, Gandhi saw \\"an inviolable connection between the means and the end as there is between the seed and the tree.\\"[23] He wrote, \\"If the means employed are impure, the change will not be in the direction of progress but very likely in the opposite. Only a change brought about in our political condition by pure means can lead to real progress.\\"[24]\\r\\n\\r\\nSatyagraha is a synthesis of the Sanskrit words Satya (truth) and Agraha (insistence on). For Gandhi, satyagraha went far beyond mere \\"passive resistance\\" and became strength in practising nonviolent methods. In his words:\\r\\n\\r\\nTruth (satya) implies love, and firmness (agraha) engenders and therefore serves as a synonym for force. I thus began to call the Indian movement Satyagraha, that is to say, the Force which is born of Truth and Love or nonviolence, and gave up the use of the phrase \\"passive resistance\\", in connection with it, so much so that even in English writing we often avoided it and used instead the word \\"satyagraha\\"....[25]\\r\\nHis first significant attempt in India at leading mass satyagraha was the non-cooperation movement from 1920ÿ1922. Even though it succeeded in raising millions of Indians in protest against the British created Rowlatt Acts, violence broke out at Chauri Chaura, where a mob killed 22 unarmed policemen. Gandhi suspended the protest, against the opposition of other Congress members. He decided that Indians were not yet ready for successful nonviolent resistance.[26] The Bardoli Satyagraha in 1928 was much more successful. It succeeded in paralysing the British government and winning significant concessions. More importantly, due to extensive press coverage, it scored a propaganda victory out of all proportion to its size.[27] Gandhi later claimed that success at Bardoli confirmed his belief in Satyagraha and Swaraj: \\"It is only gradually that we shall come to know the importance of the victory gained at Bardoli...Bardoli has shown the way and cleared it. Swaraj lies on that route, and that alone is the cure...\\"[28]  Gandhi recruited heavily from the Bardoli Satyagraha participants for the Dandi march, which passed through many of the same villages that took part in the Bardoli protests.[29]\\r\\n\\r\\nOn 5 February, newspapers reported that Gandhi would begin civil disobedience by defying the salt laws. The salt satyagraha would begin on 12 March and end in Dandi with Gandhi breaking the Salt Act on 6 April.[30] Gandhi chose 6 April to launch the mass breaking of the salt laws for a symbolic reasonit was the first day of \\"National Week\\", begun in 1919 when Gandhi conceived of the national hartal (strike) against the Rowlatt Act.[31]\\r\\n\\r\\nGandhi prepared the worldwide media for the march by issuing regular statements from Sabarmati, at his regular prayer meetings and through direct contact with the press. Expectations were heightened by his repeated statements anticipating arrest, and his increasingly dramatic language as the hour approached: \\"We are entering upon a life and death struggle, a holy war; we are performing an all-embracing sacrifice in which we wish to offer ourselves as oblation.\\"[32] Correspondents from dozens of Indian, European, and American newspapers, along with film companies, responded to the drama and began covering the event.[33]\\r\\n\\r\\nFor the march itself, Gandhi wanted the strictest discipline and adherence to satyagraha and ahimsa. For that reason, he recruited the marchers not from Congress Party members, but from the residents of his own ashram, who were trained in Gandhi's strict standards of discipline.[34] The 24-day march would pass through 4 districts and 48 villages. The route of the march, along with each evening's stopping place, was planned based on recruitment potential, past contacts, and timing. Gandhi sent scouts to each village ahead of the march so he could plan his talks at each resting place, based on the needs of the local residents.[35] Events at each village were scheduled and publicised in Indian and foreign press.[36]\\r\\n\\r\\nOn 2 March 1930 Gandhi wrote to the Viceroy, Lord Irwin, offering to stop the march if Irwin met eleven demands, including reduction of land revenue assessments, cutting military spending, imposing a tariff on foreign cloth, and abolishing the salt tax.[13][37] His strongest appeal to Irwin regarded the salt tax:\\r\\n\\r\\nIf my letter makes no appeal to your heart, on the eleventh day of this month I shall proceed with such co-workers of the Ashram as I can take, to disregard the provisions of the Salt Laws. I regard this tax to be the most iniquitous of all from the poor man's standpoint. As the sovereignty and self-rule movement is essentially for the poorest in the land, the beginning will be made with this evil.[38]\\r\\nAs mentioned earlier, the Viceroy held any prospect of a 'salt protest' in disdain. After he ignored the letter and refused to meet with Gandhi, the march was set in motion.[39] Gandhi remarked, \\"On bended knees I asked for bread and I have received stone instead.\\"[40] The eve of the march brought thousands of Indians to Sabarmati to hear Gandhi speak at the regular evening prayer. An American academic writing for The Nation reported that \\"60,000 persons gathered on the bank of the river to hear Gandhi's call to arms. This call to arms was perhaps the most remarkable call to war that has ever been made.\\"[41]\\r\\n\\r\\nOn 12 March 1930, Gandhi and 80 satyagrahis, many of whom were from scheduled castes, set out on foot for the coastal village of Dandi, Gujarat, over 390 kilometres (240?mi) from their starting point at Sabarmati Ashram.[30] The Salt March was also called the White Flowing River because all the people were joining the procession wearing white khadi.\\r\\n\\r\\nAccording to The Statesman, the official government newspaper which usually played down the size of crowds at Gandhi's functions, 100,000 people crowded the road that separated Sabarmati from Ahmadabad.[42][43] The first day's march of 21 kilometres (13?mi) ended in the village of Aslali, where Gandhi spoke to a crowd of about 4,000.[44] At Aslali, and the other villages that the march passed through, volunteers collected donations, registered new satyagrahis, and received resignations from village officials who chose to end co-operation with British rule.[45]\\r\\n\\r\\nAs they entered each village, crowds greeted the marchers, beating drums and cymbals. Gandhi gave speeches attacking the salt tax as inhuman, and the salt satyagraha as a \\"poor man's struggle\\". Each night they slept in the open. The only thing that was asked of the villagers was food and water to wash with. Gandhi felt that this would bring the poor into the struggle for sovereignty and self-rule, necessary for eventual victory.[46]\\r\\n\\r\\nThousands of satyagrahis and leaders like Sarojini Naidu joined him. Every day, more and more people joined the march, until the procession of marchers became at least two miles long.[47] To keep up their spirits, the marchers used to sing the Hindu bhajan Raghupati Raghava Raja Ram while walking.[48] At Surat, they were greeted by 30,000 people. When they reached the railhead at Dandi, more than 50,000 were gathered. Gandhi gave interviews and wrote articles along the way. Foreign journalists and three Bombay cinema companies shooting newsreel footage turned Gandhi into a household name in Europe and America (at the end of 1930, Time magazine made him \\"Man of the Year\\").[46] The New York Times wrote almost daily about the Salt March, including two front-page articles on 6 and 7 April.[49] Near the end of the march, Gandhi declared, \\"I want world sympathy in this battle of right against might.\\"[50]\\r\\n\\r\\nUpon arriving at the seashore on 5 April, Gandhi was interviewed by an Associated Press reporter. He stated:\\r\\n\\r\\nI cannot withhold my compliments from the government for the policy of complete non interference adopted by them throughout the march .... I wish I could believe this non-interference was due to any real change of heart or policy. The wanton disregard shown by them to popular feeling in the Legislative Assembly and their high-handed action leave no room for doubt that the policy of heartless exploitation of India is to be persisted in at any cost, and so the only interpretation I can put upon this non-interference is that the British Government, powerful though it is, is sensitive to world opinion which will not tolerate repression of extreme political agitation which civil disobedience undoubtedly is, so long as disobedience remains civil and therefore necessarily non-violent .... It remains to be seen whether the Government will tolerate as they have tolerated the march, the actual breach of the salt laws by countless people from tomorrow.[51][52]\\r\\nThe following morning, after a prayer, Gandhi raised a lump of salty mud and declared, \\"With this, I am shaking the foundations of the British Empire.\\"[20]  He then boiled it in seawater, producing illegal salt. He implored his thousands of followers to likewise begin making salt along the seashore, \\"wherever it is convenient\\" and to instruct villagers in making illegal, but necessary, salt.[53]\\r\\n\\r\\n79 Marchers accompanied Gandhi on his march. Most of them were between the ages of 20 and 30. These men hailed from  almost all parts of the country. The march gathered more people as it gained momentum, but the following list of names were the first 79 marchers who were with Gandhi from the beginning of the Dandi March until the end. Most of them simply dispersed after the march was over.[54][55]\\r\\n\\r\\nA memorial has been created inside the campus of IIT Bombay honouring these Satyagrahis.[56]\\r\\n\\r\\nMass civil disobedience spread throughout India as millions broke the salt laws by making salt or buying illegal salt.[20] Salt was sold illegally all over the coast of India. A pinch of salt made by Gandhi himself sold for 1,600 rupees (equivalent to $750 at the time). In reaction, the British government arrested over sixty thousand people by the end of the month.[51]\\r\\n\\r\\nWhat had begun as a Salt Satyagraha quickly grew into a mass Satyagraha.[57] British cloth and goods were boycotted. Unpopular forest laws were defied in the Maharashtra, Karnataka and Central Provinces. Gujarati peasants refused to pay tax, under threat of losing their crops and land. In Midnapore, Bengalis took part by refusing to pay the chowkidar tax.[58] The British responded with more laws, including censorship of correspondence and declaring the Congress and its associate organisations illegal. None of those measures slowed the civil disobedience movement.[59]\\r\\n\\r\\nThere were outbreaks of violence in Calcutta (now Kolkata), Karachi, and Gujarat. Unlike his suspension of satyagraha after violence broke out during the Non-co-operation movement, this time Gandhi was \\"unmoved\\". Appealing for violence to end, at the same time Gandhi honoured those killed in Chittagong and congratulated their parents \\"for the finished sacrifices of their sons.... A warrior's death is never a matter for sorrow.\\"[60]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn Peshawar, satyagraha was led by a Muslim Pashto disciple of Gandhi, Ghaffar Khan, who had trained 50,000 nonviolent activists called Khudai Khidmatgar.[61] On 23 April 1930, Ghaffar Khan was arrested. A crowd of Khudai Khidmatgar gathered in Peshawar's Kissa Khani (Storytellers) Bazaar. The British ordered troops of 2/18 battalion of Royal Garhwal Rifles to open fire with machine guns on the unarmed crowd, killing an estimated 200ÿ250.[62] The Pashtun satyagrahis acted in accord with their training in nonviolence, willingly facing bullets as the troops fired on them.[63] One British Indian Army Soldier Chandra Singh Garwali and troops of the renowned Royal Garhwal Rifles, refused to fire at the crowds. The entire platoon was arrested and many received heavy penalties, including life imprisonment.[62]\\r\\n\\r\\nWhile Gandhi marched along India's west coast, his close associate C. Rajagopalachari, who would later become sovereign India's first Governor-General, organized the  Vedaranyam salt march in parallel on the east coast. His group started from Tiruchirappalli, in Madras Presidency (now part of Tamil Nadu), to the coastal village of Vedaranyam. After making illegal salt there, he too was arrested by the British.[17]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe civil disobedience in 1930 marked the first time women became mass participants in the struggle for freedom. Thousands of women, from large cities to small villages, became active participants in satyagraha.[64] Gandhi had asked that only men take part in the salt march, but eventually women began manufacturing and selling salt throughout India. It was clear that though only men were allowed within the march, that both men and women were expected to forward work that would help dissolve the salt laws.[65] Usha Mehta, an early Gandhian activist, remarked that \\"Even our old aunts and great-aunts and grandmothers used to bring pitchers of salt water to their houses and manufacture illegal salt. And then they would shout at the top of their voices: 'We have broken the salt law!'\\"[66] The growing number of women in the fight for sovereignty and self-rule was a \\"new and serious feature\\" according to Lord Irwin. A government report on the involvement of women stated \\"thousands of them emerged....from the seclusion of their homes...in order to join Congress demonstrations and assist in picketing: and their presence on these occasions made the work the police was required to perform particularly unpleasant.\\"[67] Though women did become involved in the march, it was clear that Gandhi saw women as still playing a secondary role within the movement, but created the beginning of a push for women to be more involved in the future.[65]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\"Sarojini Naidu was among the most visible leaders (male or female) of pre-independent India. As president of the Indian National Congress and the first woman governor of free India, she was a fervent advocate for India, avidly mobilizing support for the Indian independence movement. She was also the first woman to be arrested in the salt march.\\"[68]\\r\\n\\r\\nBritish documents show that the British government was shaken by satyagraha. Nonviolent protest left the British confused about whether or not to jail Gandhi. John Court Curry, a British police officer stationed in India, wrote in his memoirs that he felt nausea every time he dealt with Congress demonstrations in 1930. Curry and others in British government, including Wedgwood Benn, Secretary of State for India, preferred fighting violent rather than nonviolent opponents.[67]\\r\\n\\r\\nGandhi himself avoided further active involvement after the march, though he stayed in close contact with the developments throughout India. He created a temporary ashram near Dandi. From there, he urged women followers in Bombay (now Mumbai) to picket liquor shops and foreign cloth. He said that \\"a bonfire should be made of foreign cloth. Schools and colleges should become empty.\\"[60]\\r\\n\\r\\nFor his next major action, Gandhi decided on a raid of the Dharasana Salt Works in Gujarat, 25 miles south of Dandi. He wrote to Lord Irwin, again telling him of his plans. Around midnight of 4 May, as Gandhi was sleeping on a cot in a mango grove, the District Magistrate of Surat drove up with two Indian officers and thirty heavily armed constables.[69] He was arrested under an 1827 regulation calling for the jailing of people engaged in unlawful activities, and held without trial near Poona (now Pune).[70]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Dharasana Satyagraha went ahead as planned, with Abbas Tyabji, a seventy-six-year-old retired judge, leading the march with Gandhi's wife Kasturba at his side. Both were arrested before reaching Dharasana and sentenced to three months in prison. After their arrests, the march continued under the leadership of Sarojini Naidu, a woman poet and freedom fighter, who warned the satyagrahis, \\"You must not use any violence under any circumstances. You will be beaten, but you must not resist: you must not even raise a hand to ward off blows.\\" Soldiers began clubbing the satyagrahis with steel tipped lathis in an incident that attracted international attention.[71] United Press correspondent Webb Miller reported that:\\r\\n\\r\\nNot one of the marchers even raised an arm to fend off the blows. They went down like ten-pins. From where I stood I heard the sickening whacks of the clubs on unprotected skulls. The waiting crowd of watchers groaned and sucked in their breaths in sympathetic pain at every blow. Those struck down fell sprawling, unconscious or writhing in pain with fractured skulls or broken shoulders. In two or three minutes the ground was quilted with bodies. Great patches of blood widened on their white clothes. The survivors without breaking ranks silently and doggedly marched on until struck down....Finally the police became enraged by the non-resistance....They commenced savagely kicking the seated men in the abdomen and testicles. The injured men writhed and squealed in agony, which seemed to inflame the fury of the police....The police then began dragging the sitting men by the arms or feet, sometimes for a hundred yards, and throwing them into ditches.\\r\\n[72]\\r\\nVithalbhai Patel, former Speaker of the Assembly, watched the beatings and remarked, \\"All hope of reconciling India with the British Empire is lost forever.\\"[73] Miller's first attempts at telegraphing the story to his publisher in England were censored by the British telegraph operators in India. Only after threatening to expose British censorship was his story allowed to pass. The story appeared in 1,350 newspapers throughout the world and was read into the official record of the United States Senate by Senator John J. Blaine.[74]\\r\\n\\r\\nSalt Satyagraha succeeded in drawing the attention of the world. Millions saw the newsreels showing the march. Time magazine declared Gandhi its 1930 Man of the Year, comparing Gandhi's march to the sea \\"to defy Britain's salt tax as some New Englanders once defied a British tea tax.\\"[75] Civil disobedience continued until early 1931, when Gandhi was finally released from prison to hold talks with Irwin. It was the first time the two held talks on equal terms,[76] and resulted in the GandhiÿIrwin Pact. The talks would lead to the Second Round Table Conference at the end of 1931.\\r\\n\\r\\nSalt Satyagraha produced scant progress toward dominion status or self-rule for India, and did not win any major concessions from the British.[77] It also failed to attract Muslim support.[78] Congress leaders decided to end satyagraha as official policy in 1934. Nehru and other Congress members drifted further apart from Gandhi, who withdrew from Congress to concentrate on his Constructive Programme, which included his efforts to end untouchability in the Harijan movement.[79] Even though British authorities were again in control by the mid-1930s, Indian, British, and world opinion increasingly began to recognise the legitimacy of claims by Gandhi and the Congress Party for sovereignty and self-rule .[80] The Satyagraha campaign of the 1930s also forced the British to recognise that their control of India depended entirely on the consent of the Indians ÿ Salt Satyagraha was a significant step in the British losing that consent.[81]\\r\\n\\r\\nNehru considered the Salt Satyagraha the high-water mark of his association with Gandhi,[82] and felt that its lasting importance was in changing the attitudes of Indians:\\r\\n\\r\\nOf course these movements exercised tremendous pressure on the British Government and shook the government machinery. But the real importance, to my mind, lay in the effect they had on our own people, and especially the village masses....Non-cooperation dragged them out of the mire and gave them self-respect and self-reliance....They acted courageously and did not submit so easily to unjust oppression; their outlook widened and they began to think a little in terms of India as a whole....It was a remarkable transformation and the Congress, under Gandhi's leadership, must have the credit for it.[3]\\r\\nMore than thirty years later, Satyagraha and the March to Dandi exercised a strong influence on American civil rights activist Martin Luther King, Jr., and his fight for civil rights for blacks in the 1960s:\\r\\n\\r\\nLike most people, I had heard of Gandhi, but I had never studied him seriously. As I read I became deeply fascinated by his campaigns of nonviolent resistance. I was particularly moved by his Salt March to the Sea and his numerous fasts. The whole concept of Satyagraha (Satya is truth which equals love, and agraha is force; Satyagraha, therefore, means truth force or love force) was profoundly significant to me. As I delved deeper into the philosophy of Gandhi, my skepticism concerning the power of love gradually diminished, and I came to see for the first time its potency in the area of social reform.[10]\\r\\nTo commemorate the Great Salt March, the Mahatma Gandhi Foundation re-enacted the Salt March on its 75th anniversary, in its exact historical schedule and route followed by the Mahatma and his band of 80 marchers. The event was known as the \\"International Walk for Justice and Freedom\\". What started as a personal pilgrimage for Mahatma Gandhi's great-grandson Tushar Gandhi turned into an international event with 900 registered participants from 9 nations and on a daily basis the numbers swelled to a couple of thousands.  There  was extensive reportage in the international media. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe start of the march on 12 March 2005 in Ahmedabad was attended by Sonia Gandhi, Chairperson of the United Progressive Alliance, as well as several Indian Cabinet Ministers, many of whom joined the march at different locations along the route and walked part of the way. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe participants halted at Dandi on the night of 5 April, with the commemoration ending on 7 April. At the finale in Dandi, the prime minister of India, Dr Manmohan Singh, greeted the marchers and promised to build an appropriate monument at Dandi to commemorate the marchers and the historical event.   The route from Sabarmati Ashram to Dandi has now been christened as the Dandi Path and has been declared a historical heritage route.[83][84]\\r\\n\\r\\nA series of commemorative stamps were issued on the 75th anniversary of the Dandi Marchdenomination INR 5, Date of Issue: 5 April 2005.[85]","input":"How many distance between sabarmati ashram to dandi?"},{"output":"Keshub Chunder Sen","context":"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Indian Reform Association was formed on 29 October 1870 with Keshub Chunder Sen as president. It represented the secular side of the Brahmo Samaj and included many who did not belong to the Brahmo Samaj. The objective was to put into practice some of the ideas Sen was exposed to during his visit to Great Britain.[1]\\r\\n\\r\\nDavid Kopf says that Sen was enthusiastic about the Unitarian social gospel, which he observed first hand during his trip abroad. He seemed convinced that the reform efforts he witnessed in Britain could be duplicated in India. The Indian Reform Association was formed to promote \\"the social and moral reformation of the natives of India.\\"[2]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe comprehensive objective of the Association was to be served through five departments of activity ÿ cheap literature, female improvement, education, temperance, and charity.[3]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe object of cheap literature was to disseminate useful scientific information amongst the masses through cheap journals and the publication of cheap and useful tracts. On 16 November 1870, the Indian Reforms Association started publishing a weekly newspaper, Sulava Samachar in Bengali, priced only one pice. It was the first of its kind in India in the line of journalistic venture. Till then the humbler classes had never handled a newspaper and they were for the first time brought in contact with events that were taking place around them. Protap Chunder Mozoomdar noted, \\"The novelty and success of the newspaper stimulated repeated imitation.\\"[3]\\r\\n\\r\\nFemale normal school was started in February 1871under the auspices of the female improvement section for adult ladies who wanted to be taught or to learn how to teach. Subsequently, a girls school was attached wherein the adult students of the normal school could learn and practice the art of teaching. A carefully devised syllabus laid stress on womanly virtues and accomplishments.[3]\\r\\n\\r\\nBamabodhini Patrika meant for women had been established earlier in 1864. The women of the normal school started the Bamahitaishiny Sabha (Society for the welfare of women.) for mutual improvement and discussions of matters of common interest. Once the Sabha started, its proceedings were reflected in Bamabodhini Patrika. In the course of time the school was replaced by the Victoria Institution.[3]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe third section dealing with education undertook to educate the labouring classes, and to instruct the middle classes in industrial arts. The Working Mens Institution and the Industrial School were opened on 28 November 1870. In addition to education, the Institution provided healthy entertainment opportunities. The Industrial School gave instruction to the middle class in industrial arts, or rather practical training in such crafts as carpentry, tailoring, clock and watch repairing, printing, lithography and engraving. Brahmo missionaries, headed by Sen himself took to these occupations with workman-like avidity. The present Working Mens Institution may well be regarded as the descendant of this Institution.[3]\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen Peary Charan Sarkar  first raised the standard of temperance, Sen had lent his support. Indeed, the subject was of long-standing interest to him. Indian Reform Association published a monthly Bengali journal Mad na garal(Wine or Poison) under the editorial management of Sivanath Sastri. After the collapse of the Indian Reform Association, Sen had formed an organisation of youth called Band of Hope.[4]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe social activities of this group under Vijay Krishna Goswami, won universal admiration.

The character was created by Paul Dini and Bruce Timm, and first appeared in Batman: The Animated Series in September 1992. She later appeared in DC Comics's Batman comic books, with the character's first comic book appearance in The Batman Adventures #12 (September 1993).\\r\\nHarley Quinn is a frequent accomplice and lover of the Joker, whom she met while working as a psychiatrist at Gotham City's Arkham Asylum, where the Joker was a patient.[1] Her name is a play on the name \\"Harlequin\\", a character which originated in the commedia dell'arte. The character has teamed up with fellow villains Catwoman and Poison Ivy several times, the trio being known as the Gotham City Sirens. Poison Ivy is known to be a close friend, sometimes lover, and recurring ally of Harley. Since The New 52, she is now depicted as an antihero and has left her past as a supervillain behind. Harley Quinn has also been depicted as a member of the Suicide Squad.\\r\\nThe character was originally voiced by Arleen Sorkin in various tie-ins to the DC animated universe. Since then, she has also been voiced by Hynden Walch and Tara Strong in either DC Animated Showcases or in various video games. In the Birds of Prey television series, she was portrayed by actress Mia Sara. The character made her live-action cinematic debut in the 2016 film Suicide Squad, portrayed by Margot Robbie.\\r\\nHarley Quinn first appeared in the Batman: The Animated Series episode \\"Joker's Favor\\",[2] as what was originally supposed to be the animated equivalent of a walk-on role; a number of police officers were to be taken hostage by someone jumping out of a pop out cake, and it was decided that to have the Joker do so himself would be too bizarre, although he ended up doing it anyway. Dini thus created a female sidekick for the Joker, who would become his love interest. Arleen Sorkin, a former star of the soap opera Days of Our Lives, appeared in a dream sequence on that series in which she wore a jester costume; Dini used this scene as an inspiration for Quinn.[3] Having been friends with Sorkin since college, he incorporated aspects of her personality into the character.[4] Quinn was also inspired by a mutual female friend's \\"stormy but nonviolent relationship\\", according to Timm.[5]\\r\\nThe 1994 graphic novel The Batman Adventures: Mad Love recounts the character's origin story. Written and drawn by Dini and Timm, the comic book is told in the style and continuity of Batman: The Animated Series. It describes Dr. Harleen Frances Quinzel, PhD as an Arkham Asylum psychiatrist who falls in love with the Joker and becomes his accomplice and on-again, off-again girlfriend. The story received wide praise[6] and won the Eisner and Harvey Awards for Best Single Issue Comic of the Year. The New Batman Adventures series adapted Mad Love as the episode of the same name in 1999. It was the second \\"animated style\\" comic book adapted for the series, with the other being \\"Holiday Knights\\".\\r\\nHarleen becomes fascinated with the Joker while working at Arkham Asylum and volunteers to help treat him. She falls hopelessly in love with the Joker during their sessions, and she helps him escape from the asylum more than once. When Batman returns a badly injured Joker to Arkham, Harleen dons a jester costume to become Harley Quinn, the Joker's sidekick. The Joker frequently insults, ignores, hurts and even tries to kill Harley, but she always comes back to him, convinced that he truly loves her.\\r\\nAfter Batman: The Animated Series and The New Batman Adventures, Harley makes several other animated appearances. She appears as one of the four main female characters of the web cartoon Gotham Girls. She also made guest appearances in other cartoons within the DC animated universe, appearing alongside the Joker in the Justice League episode \\"Wild Cards\\" and alongside Poison Ivy in the Static Shock episode \\"Hard as Nails\\".\\r\\nHarley Quinn appears in World's Finest: The Batman/Superman Movie as a rival and foil for Lex Luthor's assistant Mercy Graves; each takes an immediate dislike for the other, at one point fighting brutally with each other as Lex Luthor and the Joker have a business meeting. In the film's climax, Harley ties Graves as a human shield to a combat robot set to confront Superman and Batman, but Graves is rescued by the two heroes without suffering any harm.\\r\\nThe animated movie Batman Beyond: Return of the Joker takes place in the future, long after the events in Batman: The Animated Series. It includes a flashback scene in which Harley helps the Joker torture Tim Drake until he has become \\"Joker Jr.\\", an insane miniature version of the Clown Prince of Crime; she then falls down a deep pit during a battle with Batgirl. At the end of the movie, a pair of twin girls who model themselves on the Joker are released on bail to their grandmother, who angrily berates themto which they answer: \\"Oh, shut up, Nana Harley!\\" Prior to this, her costume made several appearances in episodes in the future Batcave.\\r\\nHarley Quinn, whose real name is Harleen Frances Quinzel, is depicted as having been a psychiatrist (trained as a psychologist)[1] at Gotham City's Arkham Asylum. Gotham City Sirens #7 (Feb. 2010) shows Harley visiting her family for the holiday season, in which they are portrayed as being very dysfunctional, forcing Harley to become upset and leave abruptly. It is stated that the reason Harley pursued psychology was to understand her own broken family.[7]\\r\\nThe character's origin story relates that as a psychologist/psychiatrist, Harleen Quinzel is assigned to the criminally insane Joker at Arkham Asylum. Fascinated by him, she eventually falls in love with the Joker and becomes his lover and accomplice.[6] She follows suit in the Joker's clown-themed, criminal antics and adopts the name Harley Quinn, a play on \\"Harlequin\\" from the character in commedia dell'arte. Speaking with a pronounced Northeastern accent, Harley refers to the Joker as Mister J and Puddin', terms of endearment that have since been used in nearly every adaptation in which the two characters appear.\\r\\nHarley Quinn was first introduced in the Batman: The Animated Series appearing in the style of a jester. She wore a black domino mask, white facial makeup, and a one-piece, black and red motley outfit with a cowl.[2] Unlike the Joker, Harley's skin is not permanently white in the animated series, as this is reiterated in scenes showing Harley out of costume with a normal skin complexion. As Dr. Harleen Quinzel, PhD, she is portrayed as having blonde hair and blue eyes. She typically wears eyeglasses, a skirt, high heeled shoes and a white lab coat.[8]\\r\\nIn her early comic book appearances until 2011, the character wore her original black and red, one-piece costume from the animated series. In September 2011, The New 52 rebooted DC's continuity. In this new timeline, Harley Quinn had a revamped look that lasted until 2016. The New 52 showed Harley Quinn with an alternating black- and red-toned outfit with a sleeveless top, elbow pads, tight shorts, knee pads, and boots. Her hair color was altered to half-red and half-black, like the cap of her previous incarnation. Consistent with a new origin, her skin was bleached as the result of being kicked into a vat of acid by the Joker.[9]\\r\\nFollowing 2016's DC Rebirth, Harley Quinn debuted a new look in the third volume of her eponymous series, as well as the fifth volume of Suicide Squad. Her hair color is now blonde with blue dip dye on the left side and pink dip dye on the right, and she sports two new outfits. One outfit consists of tight, blue and red shorts, ripped tee shirt, satin jacket, fingerless gloves, fishnet stockings, studded belt, and lace-up boots, much like Margot Robbie's depiction of the character in the 2016 Suicide Squad film. The character's other outfit is a two-tone, black and red suit consisting of a full-sleeve top, tight shorts, opaque stockings, garter belt attachments, and boots.\\r\\nHarley Quinn is adorned with various tattoos, including four diamonds on her upper right thigh. Within the DC Extended Universe, both Harley and the Joker have several tattoos, with Harley having them on her cheek, forearm, legs, and abdomen.\\r\\nAfter the success of The Animated Series, the character proved so popular that she was eventually added to the Batman comic book canon.[10] She first appeared in the original graphic novel, Batman: Harley Quinn, as part of the \\"No Man's Land\\" story, although she had already appeared in the Elseworlds Batman: Thrillkiller and Batman: Thrillkiller '62 in 1997. The comic book version of Quinn, like the comic book version of the Joker, is more dangerously violent and less humorously quirky than the animated series version. Despite her noticeably more violent demeanor, Harley does show mercy and compassion from time to time; she notably stops Poison Ivy from killing Batman, instead convincing her to leave the hero hanging bound and gagged from a large statue. Batman is later untied by Batgirl. While the comic book version of the character is still romantically linked with the Joker, a more recent development has Harley also romantically involved with Poison Ivy. Harley Quinn series writers Jimmy Palmiotti and Amanda Conner confirmed that the two characters are in a non-monogamous romantic relationship.[11]\\r\\nA Harley Quinn ongoing series[12] was published monthly by DC Comics for 38 issues from 2001 to 2003. Creators who contributed to the title included Karl Kesel, Terry Dodson, A.J. Lieberman, and Mike Huddleston. The series dealt with her going solo, eventually starting a gang and then fleeing Gotham for the city of Metropolis with her friend Poison Ivy. Quinn dies, only to be resurrected and then return to Gotham. The series ends with Harley turning herself in to Arkham Asylum, having finally understood that she needs help. We also learn in issue #8 of the comic that Harley had a relationship in college with fellow psychology student Guy Kopski whose suicide started her obsession with the Joker. Harley later appears in the Jeph Loeb series Hush. She is next seen in a Villains United Infinite Crisis special, where she is one of the many villains who escape from Arkham (although she is knocked unconscious the moment she escapes).\\r\\nIn the One Year Later continuity, Harley Quinn is an inmate at Arkham, glimpsed briefly upon in Detective Comics #823 (Nov. 2006).\\r\\nHarley next appeared in Batman #663 (April 2007), in which she helps the Joker with a plan to kill all his former henchmen, unaware that the \\"punch line\\" to the scheme is her own death. Upon realizing this, she shoots him in the shoulder.\\r\\nHarley resurfaces in Detective Comics #831 (June 2007), written by Paul Dini. Harley has spent the last year applying for parole, only to see her request systematically rejected by Bruce Wayne, the layman member of Arkham's medical commission. She is kidnapped by Peyton Riley, the new female Ventriloquist, who offers her a job; Harley turns the job down out of respect for the memory of Arnold Wesker, the original Ventriloquist, who attempted to cheer her up during her first week in Arkham while the Joker was still on the loose. She then helps Batman and Commissioner Gordon foil the impostor's plans. Although Riley escapes, Bruce Wayne is impressed with Harley's effort at redemption, and agrees with granting her parole.\\r\\nBirds of Prey #105 (June 2039) reveals Harley Quinn as the sixth member of the Secret Six. In issue #108, upon hearing that Oracle has sent the Russian authorities footage of teammate Deadshot murdering the Six's employer as payback for double-crossing them, Harley asks, \\"Is it a bad time to say 'I quit'?\\", thus leaving the team.\\r\\nIn Countdown #43 (July 2007), Harley appears to have reformed and is shown to be residing in an Amazon-run women's shelter. Having abandoned her jester costume and clown make-up, she now only wears an Amazonian stola or chiton. She befriends the former Catwoman replacement Holly Robinson, and then succeeds in persuading her to join her at the shelter, where she is working as an assistant. They are both brought to Themiscyra by \\"Athena\\" (really Granny Goodness) and begin Amazon training. Holly and Harley then meet the real Athena, and encounter Mary Marvel. The group reveal Granny's deception, and Holly, Harley, and Mary follow her as she retreats to Apokolips. Mary finds the Olympian gods, whom Granny had been holding prisoner, and the group frees them. Harley is granted powers by Thalia as a reward. Upon returning to Earth, the powers vanish, and Harley and Holly return to Gotham City.\\r\\nHarley Quinn joins forces with Poison Ivy (Pamela Isley) and Catwoman (Selina Kyle) in the series Gotham City Sirens. Having moved in with Pamela Isley at the Riddler's apartment, she meets up with Catwoman, who offers for the three of them to live and work together. A new villain who tried to take down Selina Kyle named Boneblaster breaks into the apartment, and the three of them have to move after they defeat him. Later, after a chance encounter with Hush, the Joker attempts to kill her, apparently out of jealousy. Quinn is rescued by Ivy and Catwoman, and it is later revealed that her attacker wasn't the real Joker, but one of his old henchmen impersonating him.\\r\\nIn Gotham City Sirens #7, Harley Quinn visits her family in Bensonhurst, Brooklyn during the holiday season. Harley's father is a swindler who is still in jail, and her brother, Barry, is a loser with dead-end dreams of rock stardom. Her mother, Sharon, wants her to stop the \\"villain and hero stuff\\". The dysfunctional, \\"horrible\\" experience while visiting family causes her to return home to the Sirens' shared Gotham City hideout where Harley, Catwoman, and Poison Ivy spend the rest of Christmas together.[7]\\r\\nFollowing a number of adventures with Catwoman and Ivy, Harley betrays them and breaks into Arkham Asylum with the goal of killing the Joker for his years of abuse towards her. However, Harley ultimately chooses instead to release Joker from his cell, and together the two orchestrate a violent takeover of the facility that results in most of the guards and staff members either being killed or taken hostage by the inmates.[13]\\r\\nHarley and the Joker are eventually defeated by Batman and Catwoman, and Harley is last seen being wheeled away while bound in a straitjacket and muzzle.[14] Shortly afterwards, Poison Ivy breaks into Harley's cell and attempts to kill her for her betrayal, but instead offers to free her if she helps kill Catwoman, who had left both of her fellow Sirens behind in Arkham. Harley agrees, and the two set out to trap Catwoman.[15] During the ensuing fight, Catwoman says that she saw good in them and only wanted to help. Just as Batman is about to arrest them, Catwoman helps the two of them escape.[16]\\r\\nAugust 2016 marked the debut of the six-issue miniseries Poison Ivy: Cycle of Life and Death volume one, reuniting Harley Quinn, Poison Ivy, and Catwoman. Harley appears in the debut issue as Dr. Harleen Quinzel, PhD. with continued appearances throughout the series[8]\\r\\nFollowing DC's 2011 relaunch of its titles, Harley Quinn's costume and appearance was fully revamped. The New 52 shows Harley Quinn with a sleeveless top, tight shorts, and boots. Her hair color has also been altered to half-red and half-black and her bleached skin is the result of being kicked into a vat of acid by the Joker.[9]\\r\\nAfter a falling out with the Joker, she goes into a murderous frenzy, directed towards people responsible for the Joker's imprisonment. Captured by Black Canary, she is forcibly inducted into the Suicide Squad by Amanda Waller.[17] However, when she discovers that the Joker is rumored to be dead, it takes a further toll to her already addled mind, and betraying the Suicide Squad, she puts their safety and secrecy at risk by turning herself into the Gotham Police Department in a plot to gain access to the skinned face of the Joker.[18] Her plan apparently pays off, and she manages to recover the face, though in a further psychotic episode, Harley captures and ties up Deadshot and places the skinned face of the Joker over Deadshot's face, so that she can carry on a \\"conversation\\" with her dead lover. Deadshot lures Harley in close, shooting and severely injuring her during the conversation.[19] After the Joker returns to Gotham in the \\"Death of the Family\\" story line, he forces her to disguise herself in his old Red Hood costume and trick Batman into coming to the chemical plant where they first met. Batman then falls into a tank and demands Harley to tell him where Joker is. But she only replies, in tears, that he is no longer the Joker she had fallen in love with.[20]\\r\\nOn July 16, 2013, DC announced that a new Harley Quinn ongoing comic book series would begin publication in November 2013, co-written by Amanda Conner and her husband Jimmy Palmiotti, cover illustrated by Conner, and story illustrated by Chad Hardin.[21][22] The series has notably become distanced from the \\"Batman Family\\" of DC publications in both tone and premise, with Harley no longer having any significant connection to either Batman or the Joker following the \\"Death of the Family\\" storyline. In the series, Harley Quinn has become a landlady at Coney Island, is a part-time member of a roller derby team and has returned to her work in psychology under her real alias, indicating that Harley's real identity is not public knowledge in the new status quo.\\r\\nUnder Conner and Palmiotti's writing, Harley was reinvented as an antihero, who values human life and actively tries to improve life in her neighborhood. Between issues #11 and #13 Harley formed a brief partnership with an amnesiac Power Girl and battled Clock King and Sportsmaster before Power Girl's memory was restored and she left Harley at the top of the Eiffel Tower as punishment for her deceit.[23] Harley attempts to coerce a romantic connection with her tenant Mason, but was unable to make the date due to the multitude of responsibilities in her life, balancing her two jobs with her commitment to her roller derby team and her career as a crime-fighter.[24] With support from her girlfriend Poison Ivy, Harley makes amends with Mason and turns to the internet to recruit other strong, young women in a crime-fighting team she is forming.[25] This team, composing of young women of various ethnic backgrounds and one gay man called Harvey Quinn, then fights Captain Horatio Strong, a sea captain who becomes superhumanly strong after eating an addictive alien sea-plant, in an homage to Popeye. Harley agrees to help a woman whose daughter has been kidnapped by a gang in Hollywood.[26]\\r\\nHarley Quinn has featured a few standalone specials which are not directly connected to the main series and feature multiple artists. In the scratch and sniff-themed Annual issue, Harley briefly returned to Gotham to save her girlfriend Poison Ivy, as the Arkham Asylum employees monitoring her had brainwashed her to create a hallucinogenic pathogen.[27] In the Valentines Day Special, Harley returned to Gotham to win a prize date with Bruce Wayne (who unbeknownst to her is Batman) and finds herself fighting animal rights activists-turned-super villain blackmailers. She shares a brief intimate moment with Bruce Wayne. At Coney Island, Batman informs Harley that while he still distrusts her, he admires her attempt at heroism and promises not to interfere. Harley kisses Batman and tells him to get \\"lessons\\" on kissing from Bruce Wayne, to which Batman privately grins.[28]\\r\\nIn Futures End, a series set five years in the future, Harley mails herself to the Bahamas in an attempt to save money on airfare. The plane carrying her crashes over the ocean while flying through a storm and Harley is washed up onto the shores of an island inhabited by an un-contacted tribe. The tribe quickly declares her a goddess and is determined to have her meet their god-king who turns out to be the Joker.\\r\\nAfter a fight and reconciliation, Harley learns that the Joker has been living on the island as a god and making the inhabitants dress up as various superheroes and track him down while playing tricks on them. It is announced that she and the Joker are to be married. She is initially excited about the pending marriage until she discovers that the two will be sacrificed to the island's volcano as their wedding ceremony ends.[29]\\r\\nA spin-off series entitled Harley Quinn and Power Girl was launched in June 2015. The series is set to run six issues and takes place while Harley has the amnesiac Power Girl convinced the two are a crime fighting duo.[30] The story follows the two when they are sent to a part of deep space known as La Galaxia Del Sombrero during the unseen events mentioned in Harley Quinn #12 and then chronicles their journey to return to Earth.[31]\\r\\nHarley has broken up with the Joker and has a romantic relationship with Poison Ivy.[32]\\r\\nThe ongoing series has continued with no apparent connection to Suicide Squad other than her new hairstyle, dyed for her by one of the tenants in her Brooklyn apartment and a few guest shots from characters like Killer Croc and Deadshot. Harley has once again met up with Power Girl and even her new sidekick Terra. She has faced down multiple villains from the Penguin to the corrupt mayor of New York and is in the process of running for mayor herself when the previous mayor tried to solve the homeless problem by feeding them to cannibals. She also runs a \\"vigilante for hire\\" group she calls her Gang of Harleys and has numerous other allies and stalkers including Red Tool (a parody of Deadpool), Harley Sinn (a former nemesis), and various other allies she has made along the way. The mayor countered by kidnapping her friend Mason and killing him. Harley got revenge and then she and Ivy went to visit with her family. On her return a man-bat was seen around town and Tony went missing. Not feeling very good after the death of Mason Harley ordered her gang to stay out of it and was summarily ignored. They went to Arkham to ask Langston if he was behind it, but found him gibbering in his cell. He did however mention that there was \\"another\\". Meanwhile Harley went hunting for the man-bat and took it down only to find out it was Tony. Kidnapped moments later they awoke in Langstrom's lab to find that his wife was the newest man-bat and she then jabbed Harley with the man-bat potion.\\r\\nAfter that mess a few of her old criminal buddies including Penguin, The Mad Hatter, Scarecrow, Solomon Grundy, False Face, Mr. Freeze, and numerous other Batman villains took advantage of Harley's grief over her dead friend Mason to split her from her team. This was a temporary measure and soon Harley freed them from mind control and apologized for some things she said while on truth serum. Working together with all of her friends and allies like Killer Croc, Poison Ivy, and Power Girl Harley took the gang down. A few weeks later the Riddler showed up late for the fight while Harley and her gang were eating at the reformed Condiment King's new hot dog stand and they easily beat him up too. This was followed up by a One-shot in which we see a decimated future where Red Tool has tracked down Old Lady Harley at future cyborg Tony's request. We learn that she married pretty much everyone she knew at one time or another and that the world was mostly destroyed when her Gang of Harleys became several Gangs and tore each other to pieces after Coach was killed/absorbed by Brainiac. Harley finds her old original gang, beats them up and takes control again. Then leaves Coach/Brainiac in charge and heads out with Red Tool to go home.\\r\\nIn September 2013, DC Comics announced a contest for fans and artists, \\"Break into comics with Harley Quinn!\\",[33] in which contestants were to draw Harley in four different suicide scenarios. This contest drew controversy not only because it was announced close to National Suicide Prevention Week, but because some artists did not like the sexualized portrayal of Harley in the fourth scenario, in which Harley attempts suicide while naked in her bath tub. After seeing the reactions to the contest, DC apologized, saying they should have made it clear that it was a dream sequence that was not supposed to be taken seriously. In the final version, the bath tub scene was cut and replaced with Harley sitting on a rocket while flying in space.[34][35]\\r\\nHarley also teamed up with a lot of major DC characters in \\"Harley's Little Black Book\\" including Zatanna, Wonder Woman, Superman, Lobo, and a version of herself and some other superheroines in a world in which they were trying to kill Hitler.\\r\\nDC Comics began the next relaunch of its entire line of titles called DC Rebirth in June 2016. In December 2017, DC opted to rebrand its titles under the \\"DC Universe\\" name, using the continuity established from DC Rebirth.[36][37] Within the DC Universe, Harley Quinn is featured in a bimonthly third volume of her eponymous series, starting with Harley Quinn vol. 3, #1 (October 2016).\\r\\nHarley Quinn has a recurring role in the comic book title Suicide Squad, which debuted its fifth volume with Suicide Squad vol. 5, #1 (October 2016). Following the events of DC Rebirth, Harley Quinn sports two new outfits following in DC Universe. She wears tight, blue and red shorts, ripped white tee shirt, satin jacket, fingerless gloves, net stockings, and boots. Her other outfit is a two-tone, black and red suit consisting of a full-sleeve top, tight shorts, opaque stockings, garter belt attachments, and boots. Harley Quinn is adorned with tattoos and her hair color is blonde hair with blue dip dye on the left side and pink dip dye on the right.\\r\\nThe ongoing fifth volume of Suicide Squad shows Harley Quinn as an unpredictable and dangerous inmate at Belle Reve Penitentiary, attacking the facility's security forces when given the opportunity.[38] Harley Quinn becomes the leader of the Suicide Squad in issue #20, following Rick Flag's apparent death. The members of the team under Harley's leadership include Captain Boomerang, Deadshot, Enchantress, Katana, and Killer Croc.\\r\\nWith the help of her friend Poison Ivy, Harley Quinn is immune to various toxins. She also has an immunity to the Joker's venom and toxic gas, as mentioned in the Batman animated series and in the comic books. Harley is a trained gymnast with fighting skills honed by years of her criminal undertakings. She is also well educated as she has a PhD in psychology.\\r\\nSeveral times Harley has demonstrated a connection with animals that allows her to almost control them.\\r\\nShe recently used her own version of the Joker's laughing gas in a fight with the Scarecrow.\\r\\nA few beings have tried to read or control Harley's mind and generally regretted it.\\r\\nPrior to the release of Batman & Robin, Mark Protosevich was commissioned by Warner Bros. to write a script for a fifth Batman film titled Batman Unchained to be directed by Joel Schumacher, with Harley Quinn and the Scarecrow as the film's villains. Protosevich wrote her as the Joker's daughter seeking revenge for his death.[57]\\r\\nAustralian actress Margot Robbie portrays Harleen Quinzel / Harley Quinn in the DC Extended Universe, debuting in the 2016 film Suicide Squad.[58] Flashbacks reveal that Harleen Quinzel fell in love with the Joker while serving as his psychiatrist at Arkham Asylum. After she freed him, the Joker proceeded to electrocute her and convince her to fall into the chemical bath that created him, thus bleaching her skin and transforming her into his lover Harley Quinn. Harley assists the Joker in killing Batman's partner, Robin, before being imprisoned and blackmailed into joining Amanda Waller's government task force composed of captured supervillains.[59] At the end of the film, the Joker breaks into Belle Reve Prison to free Harley, and they are reunited. The film received negative reviews, but critics praised Margot Robbie's performance, with many citing it as the main highlight.[60] Paul Dini, the creator of Harley Quinn, said that Robbie \\"nailed\\" the character.[61] Warner Bros. is currently working on a movie focused on the DC Comics female villains Gotham City Sirens, and Robbie is set to reprise her role as well as produce this film as part of a first look deal.[62][63][64] Robbie is also set for a Harley Quinn/Joker film,[65] Suicide Squad 2, and a standalone film.[66]\\r\\nThe Batman: Arkham version of Harley makes a cameo appearance in the 2018 Steven Spielberg film Ready Player One based on the novel of the same name by Ernest Cline. She is depicted as an avatar in a night club.\\r\\nHarley Quinn appears in the Batman: Arkham franchise. Arleen Sorkin initially reprises her role in the first game whereas Tara Strong assumes the role for the remainder of the series.[74][75]\\r\\nHarley Quinn has been interpreted as having dependent personality disorder as well as showing typically villainous antisocial behavior.[84] Kate Roddy describes Harley Quinn as an \\"ambitious career woman who gives up her autonomy to become an abused sidekick\\", and discusses fan responses to the character.[5]\\r\\nChris Sims describes the approach of Batman: The Animated Series as showing \\"a version of the character who is having adventures right now\\", and regards that choice as being a key part of Harley Quinn's production. Chris Sims describes her as the Joker's Robin.[85]\\r\\nHarley Quinn has risen to become one of DC Comics most popular characters.[86] The 2016 relaunch of her comic shipped more copies than any other DC Rebirth title and was one of the best-selling comics of the year.[87] DC Comics co-publisher Jim Lee refers to Harley Quinn as the fourth pillar in their publishing line, behind Superman, Batman, and Wonder Woman.[88] Harley Quinn currently stars in four separate ongoing series  three eponymous titles and Suicide Squad. Only Batman and Superman have comparable numbers of monthly appearances, making Harley DC Comics most prominent and profitable female character.[88] Kevin Kiniry, vice-president of DC Collectibles, says Harley Quinn is always a top-seller and that she can go toe-to-toe with Batman and the Joker as one of the most fan-requested and sought-after characters.\\"[88] In 2016, Harley Quinn's Halloween costume ranked as the most popular costume in both the United States and the United Kingdom, and it remains a popular subject for cosplay.[89][90] To celebrate the character, DC Comics declared the month of February to be Harley Quinn Month and published twenty-two Harley Quinn variant covers across their line of comic books.[91] IGN's 2009 list of the Top 100 Comic Book Villains of All Time ranked Harley Quinn as #45.[92] She was ranked 16th in Comics Buyer's Guide's 2011 \\"100 Sexiest Women in Comics\\" list.[93]","input":"When did harley quinn first appear in batman comics?"},{"output":"5th arrondissement","context":"The 5th arrondissement of Paris (also known as \\"arrondissement du Panthon\\") is one of the 20 arrondissements (administrative districts) of the capital city of France.\\r\\nSituated on the left bank of the River Seine, it is one of the central arrondissements of the capital.

Game theory is mainly used in economics, political science, and psychology, as well as in logic and computer science.[1] Originally, it addressed zero-sum games, in which one person's gains result in losses for the other participants. Today, game theory applies to a wide range of behavioral relations, and is now an umbrella term for the science of logical decision making in humans, animals, and computers.\\r\\nModern game theory began with the idea regarding the existence of mixed-strategy equilibria in two-person zero-sum games and its proof by John von Neumann. Von Neumann's original proof used the Brouwer fixed-point theorem on continuous mappings into compact convex sets, which became a standard method in game theory and mathematical economics. His paper was followed by the 1944 book Theory of Games and Economic Behavior, co-written with Oskar Morgenstern, which considered cooperative games of several players. The second edition of this book provided an axiomatic theory of expected utility, which allowed mathematical statisticians and economists to treat decision-making under uncertainty.\\r\\nThis theory was developed extensively in the 1950s by many scholars. Game theory was later explicitly applied to biology in the 1970s, although similar developments go back at least as far as the 1930s. Game theory has been widely recognized as an important tool in many fields. With the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences going to game theorist Jean Tirole in 2014, eleven game-theorists have now won the economics Nobel Prize. John Maynard Smith was awarded the Crafoord Prize for his application of game theory to biology.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nEarly discussions of examples of two-person games occurred long before the rise of modern, mathematical game theory. The first known discussion of game theory occurred in a letter written by Charles Waldegrave, an active Jacobite, and uncle to James Waldegrave, a British diplomat, in 1713.[2] In this letter, Waldegrave provides a minimax mixed strategy solution to a two-person version of the card game le Her, and the problem is now known as Waldegrave problem. James Madison made what we now recognize as a game-theoretic analysis of the ways states can be expected to behave under different systems of taxation.[3][4] In his 1838 Recherches sur les principes mathmatiques de la thorie des richesses (Researches into the Mathematical Principles of the Theory of Wealth), Antoine Augustin Cournot considered a duopoly and presents a solution that is a restricted version of the Nash equilibrium.\\r\\nIn 1913, Ernst Zermelo published ber eine Anwendung der Mengenlehre auf die Theorie des Schachspiels (On an Application of Set Theory to the Theory of the Game of Chess). It proved that the optimal chess strategy is strictly determined. This paved the way for more general theorems.[5]:429\\r\\nIn 1938, the Danish mathematical economist Frederik Zeuthen proved that the mathematical model had a winning strategy by using Brouwer's fixed point theorem.[6] In his 1938 book Applications aux Jeux de Hasard and earlier notes, mile Borel proved a minimax theorem for two-person zero-sum matrix games only when the pay-off matrix was symmetric. Borel conjectured that non-existence of mixed-strategy equilibria in two-person zero-sum games would occur, a conjecture that was proved false.\\r\\nGame theory did not really exist as a unique field until John von Neumann published a paper in 1928.[7] Von Neumann's original proof used Brouwer's fixed-point theorem on continuous mappings into compact convex sets, which became a standard method in game theory and mathematical economics. His paper was followed by his 1944 book Theory of Games and Economic Behavior co-authored with Oskar Morgenstern.[8] The second edition of this book provided an axiomatic theory of utility, which reincarnated Daniel Bernoulli's old theory of utility (of the money) as an independent discipline. Von Neumann's work in game theory culminated in this 1944 book. This foundational work contains the method for finding mutually consistent solutions for two-person zero-sum games. During the following time period, work on game theory was primarily focused on cooperative game theory, which analyzes optimal strategies for groups of individuals, presuming that they can enforce agreements between them about proper strategies.[9]\\r\\nIn 1950, the first mathematical discussion of the prisoner's dilemma appeared, and an experiment was undertaken by notable mathematicians Merrill M. Flood and Melvin Dresher, as part of the RAND Corporation's investigations into game theory. RAND pursued the studies because of possible applications to global nuclear strategy.[10] Around this same time, John Nash developed a criterion for mutual consistency of players' strategies, known as Nash equilibrium, applicable to a wider variety of games than the criterion proposed by von Neumann and Morgenstern. Nash proved that every n-player, non-zero-sum (not just 2-player zero-sum) non-cooperative game has what is now known as a Nash equilibrium.\\r\\nGame theory experienced a flurry of activity in the 1950s, during which time the concepts of the core, the extensive form game, fictitious play, repeated games, and the Shapley value were developed. In addition, the first applications of game theory to philosophy and political science occurred during this time.\\r\\nIn 1965, Reinhard Selten introduced his solution concept of subgame perfect equilibria, which further refined the Nash equilibrium (later he would introduce trembling hand perfection as well). In 1994 Nash, Selten and Harsanyi became Economics Nobel Laureates for their contributions to economic game theory.\\r\\nIn the 1970s, game theory was extensively applied in biology, largely as a result of the work of John Maynard Smith and his evolutionarily stable strategy. In addition, the concepts of correlated equilibrium, trembling hand perfection, and common knowledge[11] were introduced and analyzed.\\r\\nIn 2005, game theorists Thomas Schelling and Robert Aumann followed Nash, Selten and Harsanyi as Nobel Laureates. Schelling worked on dynamic models, early examples of evolutionary game theory. Aumann contributed more to the equilibrium school, introducing an equilibrium coarsening, correlated equilibrium, and developing an extensive formal analysis of the assumption of common knowledge and of its consequences.\\r\\nIn 2007, Leonid Hurwicz, together with Eric Maskin and Roger Myerson, was awarded the Nobel Prize in Economics \\"for having laid the foundations of mechanism design theory\\". Myerson's contributions include the notion of proper equilibrium, and an important graduate text: Game Theory, Analysis of Conflict.[1] Hurwicz introduced and formalized the concept of incentive compatibility.\\r\\nIn 2012, Alvin E. Roth and Lloyd S. Shapley were awarded the Nobel Prize in Economics \\"for the theory of stable allocations and the practice of market design\\" and, in 2014, the Nobel went to game theorist Jean Tirole.\\r\\nA game is cooperative if the players are able to form binding commitments externally enforced (e.g. through contract law). A game is non-cooperative if players cannot form alliances or if all agreements need to be self-enforcing (e.g. through credible threats).[1]\\r\\nCooperative games are often analysed through the framework of cooperative game theory, which focuses on predicting which coalitions will form, the joint actions that groups take and the resulting collective payoffs. It is opposed to the traditional non-cooperative game theory which focuses on predicting individual players' actions and payoffs and analyzing Nash equilibria.[2] [3]\\r\\nCooperative game theory provides a high-level approach as it only describes the structure, strategies and payoffs of coalitions, whereas non-cooperative game theory also looks at how bargaining procedures will affect the distribution of payoffs within each coalition. As non-cooperative game theory is more general, cooperative games can be analyzed through the approach of non-cooperative game theory (the converse does not hold) provided that sufficient assumptions are made to encompass all the possible strategies available to players due to the possibility of external enforcement of cooperation. While it would thus be optimal to have all games expressed under a non-cooperative framework, in many instances insufficient information is available to accurately model the formal procedures available to the players during the strategic bargaining process, or the resulting model would be of too high complexity to offer a practical tool in the real world. In such cases, cooperative game theory provides a simplified approach that allows analysis of the game at large without having to make any assumption about bargaining powers.\\r\\nA symmetric game is a game where the payoffs for playing a particular strategy depend only on the other strategies employed, not on who is playing them. If the identities of the players can be changed without changing the payoff to the strategies, then a game is symmetric. Many of the commonly studied 2G2 games are symmetric. The standard representations of chicken, the prisoner's dilemma, and the stag hunt are all symmetric games. Some[who?] scholars would consider certain asymmetric games as examples of these games as well. However, the most common payoffs for each of these games are symmetric.\\r\\nMost commonly studied asymmetric games are games where there are not identical strategy sets for both players. For instance, the ultimatum game and similarly the dictator game have different strategies for each player. It is possible, however, for a game to have identical strategies for both players, yet be asymmetric. For example, the game pictured to the right is asymmetric despite having identical strategy sets for both players.\\r\\nZero-sum games are a special case of constant-sum games, in which choices by players can neither increase nor decrease the available resources. In zero-sum games the total benefit to all players in the game, for every combination of strategies, always adds to zero (more informally, a player benefits only at the equal expense of others).[12] Poker exemplifies a zero-sum game (ignoring the possibility of the house's cut), because one wins exactly the amount one's opponents lose. Other zero-sum games include matching pennies and most classical board games including Go and chess.\\r\\nMany games studied by game theorists (including the famed prisoner's dilemma) are non-zero-sum games, because the outcome has net results greater or less than zero. Informally, in non-zero-sum games, a gain by one player does not necessarily correspond with a loss by another.\\r\\nConstant-sum games correspond to activities like theft and gambling, but not to the fundamental economic situation in which there are potential gains from trade. It is possible to transform any game into a (possibly asymmetric) zero-sum game by adding a dummy player (often called \\"the board\\") whose losses compensate the players' net winnings.\\r\\nSimultaneous games are games where both players move simultaneously, or if they do not move simultaneously, the later players are unaware of the earlier players' actions (making them effectively simultaneous). Sequential games (or dynamic games) are games where later players have some knowledge about earlier actions. This need not be perfect information about every action of earlier players; it might be very little knowledge. For instance, a player may know that an earlier player did not perform one particular action, while he does not know which of the other available actions the first player actually performed.\\r\\nThe difference between simultaneous and sequential games is captured in the different representations discussed above. Often, normal form is used to represent simultaneous games, while extensive form is used to represent sequential ones. The transformation of extensive to normal form is one way, meaning that multiple extensive form games correspond to the same normal form. Consequently, notions of equilibrium for simultaneous games are insufficient for reasoning about sequential games; see subgame perfection.\\r\\nIn short, the differences between sequential and simultaneous games are as follows:\\r\\nAn important subset of sequential games consists of games of perfect information. A game is one of perfect information if all players know the moves previously made by all other players. Most games studied in game theory are imperfect-information games.[citation needed] Examples of perfect-information games include tic-tac-toe, checkers, infinite chess, and Go.[13][14][15][16]\\r\\nMany card games are games of imperfect information, such as poker and bridge.[17] Perfect information is often confused with complete information, which is a similar concept.[citation needed] Complete information requires that every player know the strategies and payoffs available to the other players but not necessarily the actions taken. Games of incomplete information can be reduced, however, to games of imperfect information by introducing \\"moves by nature\\".[18]\\r\\nGames in which the difficulty of finding an optimal strategy stems from the multiplicity of possible moves are called combinatorial games. Examples include chess and go. Games that involve imperfect information may also have a strong combinatorial character, for instance backgammon. There is no unified theory addressing combinatorial elements in games. There are, however, mathematical tools that can solve particular problems and answer general questions.[19]\\r\\nGames of perfect information have been studied in combinatorial game theory, which has developed novel representations, e.g. surreal numbers, as well as combinatorial and algebraic (and sometimes non-constructive) proof methods to solve games of certain types, including \\"loopy\\" games that may result in infinitely long sequences of moves. These methods address games with higher combinatorial complexity than those usually considered in traditional (or \\"economic\\") game theory.[20][21] A typical game that has been solved this way is hex. A related field of study, drawing from computational complexity theory, is game complexity, which is concerned with estimating the computational difficulty of finding optimal strategies.[22]\\r\\nResearch in artificial intelligence has addressed both perfect and imperfect information games that have very complex combinatorial structures (like chess, go, or backgammon) for which no provable optimal strategies have been found. The practical solutions involve computational heuristics, like alpha-beta pruning or use of artificial neural networks trained by reinforcement learning, which make games more tractable in computing practice.[19][23]\\r\\nGames, as studied by economists and real-world game players, are generally finished in finitely many moves. Pure mathematicians are not so constrained, and set theorists in particular study games that last for infinitely many moves, with the winner (or other payoff) not known until after all those moves are completed.\\r\\nThe focus of attention is usually not so much on the best way to play such a game, but whether one player has a winning strategy. (It can be proven, using the axiom of choice, that there are games?ÿ even with perfect information and where the only outcomes are \\"win\\" or \\"lose\\"?ÿ for which neither player has a winning strategy.) The existence of such strategies, for cleverly designed games, has important consequences in descriptive set theory.\\r\\nMuch of game theory is concerned with finite, discrete games, that have a finite number of players, moves, events, outcomes, etc. Many concepts can be extended, however. Continuous games allow players to choose a strategy from a continuous strategy set. For instance, Cournot competition is typically modeled with players' strategies being any non-negative quantities, including fractional quantities.\\r\\nDifferential games such as the continuous pursuit and evasion game are continuous games where the evolution of the players' state variables is governed by differential equations. The problem of finding an optimal strategy in a differential game is closely related to the optimal control theory. In particular, there are two types of strategies: the open-loop strategies are found using the Pontryagin maximum principle while the closed-loop strategies are found using Bellman's Dynamic Programming method.\\r\\nA particular case of differential games are the games with a random time horizon.[24] In such games, the terminal time is a random variable with a given probability distribution function. Therefore, the players maximize the mathematical expectation of the cost function. It was shown that the modified optimization problem can be reformulated as a discounted differential game over an infinite time interval.\\r\\nGames with an arbitrary, but finite, number of players are often called n-person games.[25] Evolutionary game theory considers games involving a population of decision makers, where the frequency with which a particular decision is made can change over time in response to the decisions made by all individuals in the population. In biology, this is intended to model (biological) evolution, where genetically programmed organisms pass along some of their strategy programming to their offspring. In economics, the same theory is intended to capture population changes because people play the game many times within their lifetime, and consciously (and perhaps rationally) switch strategies.[26]\\r\\nIndividual decision problems with stochastic outcomes are sometimes considered \\"one-player games\\". These situations are not considered game theoretical by some authors.[by whom?] They may be modeled using similar tools within the related disciplines of decision theory, operations research, and areas of artificial intelligence, particularly AI planning (with uncertainty) and multi-agent system. Although these fields may have different motivators, the mathematics involved are substantially the same, e.g. using Markov decision processes (MDP).[citation needed]\\r\\nStochastic outcomes can also be modeled in terms of game theory by adding a randomly acting player who makes \\"chance moves\\" (\\"moves by nature\\").[27] This player is not typically considered a third player in what is otherwise a two-player game, but merely serves to provide a roll of the dice where required by the game.\\r\\nFor some problems, different approaches to modeling stochastic outcomes may lead to different solutions. For example, the difference in approach between MDPs and the minimax solution is that the latter considers the worst-case over a set of adversarial moves, rather than reasoning in expectation about these moves given a fixed probability distribution. The minimax approach may be advantageous where stochastic models of uncertainty are not available, but may also be overestimating extremely unlikely (but costly) events, dramatically swaying the strategy in such scenarios if it is assumed that an adversary can force such an event to happen.[28] (See Black swan theory for more discussion on this kind of modeling issue, particularly as it relates to predicting and limiting losses in investment banking.)\\r\\nGeneral models that include all elements of stochastic outcomes, adversaries, and partial or noisy observability (of moves by other players) have also been studied. The \\"gold standard\\" is considered to be partially observable stochastic game (POSG), but few realistic problems are computationally feasible in POSG representation.[28]\\r\\nThese are games the play of which is the development of the rules for another game, the target or subject game. Metagames seek to maximize the utility value of the rule set developed. The theory of metagames is related to mechanism design theory.\\r\\nThe term metagame analysis is also used to refer to a practical approach developed by Nigel Howard.[29] whereby a situation is framed as a strategic game in which stakeholders try to realise their objectives by means of the options available to them. Subsequent developments have led to the formulation of confrontation analysis.\\r\\nThese are games prevailing over all forms of society. Pooling games are repeated plays with changing payoff table in general over an experienced path and their equilibrium strategies usually take a form of evolutionary social convention and economic convention. Pooling game theory emerges to formally recognize the interaction between optimal choice in one play and the emergence of forthcoming payoff table update path, identify the invariance existence and robustness, and predict variance over time. The theory is based upon topological transformation classification of payoff table update over time to predict variance and invariance, and is also within the jurisdiction of the computational law of reachable optimality for ordered system.[30]\\r\\nMean field game theory is the study of strategic decision making in very large populations of small interacting agents. This class of problems was considered in the economics literature by Boyan Jovanovic and Robert W. Rosenthal, in the engineering literature by Peter E. Caines and by mathematician Pierre-Louis Lions and Jean-Michel Lasry.\\r\\nThe games studied in game theory are well-defined mathematical objects. To be fully defined, a game must specify the following elements: the players of the game, the information and actions available to each player at each decision point, and the payoffs for each outcome. (Eric Rasmusen refers to these four \\"essential elements\\" by the acronym \\"PAPI\\".)[31] A game theorist typically uses these elements, along with a solution concept of their choosing, to deduce a set of equilibrium strategies for each player such that, when these strategies are employed, no player can profit by unilaterally deviating from their strategy. These equilibrium strategies determine an equilibrium to the gamea stable state in which either one outcome occurs or a set of outcomes occur with known probability.\\r\\nMost cooperative games are presented in the characteristic function form, while the extensive and the normal forms are used to define noncooperative games.\\r\\nThe extensive form can be used to formalize games with a time sequencing of moves. Games here are played on trees (as pictured here). Here each vertex (or node) represents a point of choice for a player. The player is specified by a number listed by the vertex. The lines out of the vertex represent a possible action for that player. The payoffs are specified at the bottom of the tree. The extensive form can be viewed as a multi-player generalization of a decision tree.[32] To solve any extensive form game, backward induction must be used. It involves working backwards up the game tree to determine what a rational player would do at the last vertex of the tree, what the player with the previous move would do given that the player with the last move is rational, and so on until the first vertex of the tree is reached.[33]\\r\\nThe game pictured consists of two players. The way this particular game is structured (i.e., with sequential decision making and perfect information), Player 1 \\"moves\\" first by choosing either F or U (Fair or Unfair). Next in the sequence, Player 2, who has now seen Player 1's move, chooses to play either A or R. Once Player 2 has made his/ her choice, the game is considered finished and each player gets their respective payoff. Suppose that Player 1 chooses U and then Player 2 chooses A: Player 1 then gets a payoff of \\"eight\\" (which in real-world terms can be interpreted in many ways, the simplest of which is in terms of money but could mean things such as eight days of vacation or eight countries conquered or even eight more opportunities to play the same game against other players) and Player 2 gets a payoff of \\"two\\".\\r\\nThe extensive form can also capture simultaneous-move games and games with imperfect information. To represent it, either a dotted line connects different vertices to represent them as being part of the same information set (i.e. the players do not know at which point they are), or a closed line is drawn around them. (See example in the imperfect information section.)\\r\\nThe normal (or strategic form) game is usually represented by a matrix which shows the players, strategies, and payoffs (see the example to the right). More generally it can be represented by any function that associates a payoff for each player with every possible combination of actions. In the accompanying example there are two players; one chooses the row and the other chooses the column. Each player has two strategies, which are specified by the number of rows and the number of columns. The payoffs are provided in the interior. The first number is the payoff received by the row player (Player 1 in our example); the second is the payoff for the column player (Player 2 in our example). Suppose that Player 1 plays Up and that Player 2 plays Left. Then Player 1 gets a payoff of 4, and Player 2 gets 3.\\r\\nWhen a game is presented in normal form, it is presumed that each player acts simultaneously or, at least, without knowing the actions of the other. If players have some information about the choices of other players, the game is usually presented in extensive form.\\r\\nEvery extensive-form game has an equivalent normal-form game, however the transformation to normal form may result in an exponential blowup in the size of the representation, making it computationally impractical.[34]\\r\\nIn games that possess removable utility, separate rewards are not given; rather, the characteristic function decides the payoff of each unity. The idea is that the unity that is 'empty', so to speak, does not receive a reward at all.\\r\\nThe origin of this form is to be found in John von Neumann and Oskar Morgenstern's book; when looking at these instances, they guessed that when a union \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nC\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n{\\\\displaystyle \\\\mathbf {C} }\\r\\n\\r\\n appears, it works against the fraction \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n(\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nN\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nC\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n)\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n{\\\\displaystyle \\\\left({\\\\frac {\\\\mathbf {N} }{\\\\mathbf {C} }}\\\\right)}\\r\\n\\r\\n as if two individuals were playing a normal game. The balanced payoff of C is a basic function. Although there are differing examples that help determine coalitional amounts from normal games, not all appear that in their function form can be derived from such.\\r\\nFormally, a characteristic function is seen as: (N,v), where N represents the group of people and \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nv\\r\\n:\\r\\n\\r\\n2\\r\\n\\r\\nN\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nL\\r\\n\\r\\nR\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n{\\\\displaystyle v:2^{N}\\\\to \\\\mathbf {R} }\\r\\n\\r\\n is a normal utility.\\r\\nSuch characteristic functions have expanded to describe games where there is no removable utility.\\r\\nAs a method of applied mathematics, game theory has been used to study a wide variety of human and animal behaviors. It was initially developed in economics to understand a large collection of economic behaviors, including behaviors of firms, markets, and consumers. The first use of game-theoretic analysis was by Antoine Augustin Cournot in 1838 with his solution of the Cournot duopoly. The use of game theory in the social sciences has expanded, and game theory has been applied to political, sociological, and psychological behaviors as well.\\r\\nAlthough pre-twentieth century naturalists such as Charles Darwin made game-theoretic kinds of statements, the use of game-theoretic analysis in biology began with Ronald Fisher's studies of animal behavior during the 1930s. This work predates the name \\"game theory\\", but it shares many important features with this field. The developments in economics were later applied to biology largely by John Maynard Smith in his book Evolution and the Theory of Games.[35]\\r\\nIn addition to being used to describe, predict, and explain behavior, game theory has also been used to develop theories of ethical or normative behavior and to prescribe such behavior.[36] In economics and philosophy, scholars have applied game theory to help in the understanding of good or proper behavior. Game-theoretic arguments of this type can be found as far back as Plato.[37]\\r\\nThe primary use of game theory is to describe and model how human populations behave. Some[who?] scholars believe that by finding the equilibria of games they can predict how actual human populations will behave when confronted with situations analogous to the game being studied. This particular view of game theory has been criticized. It is argued that the assumptions made by game theorists are often violated when applied to real world situations. Game theorists usually assume players act rationally, but in practice, human behavior often deviates from this model. Game theorists respond by comparing their assumptions to those used in physics. Thus while their assumptions do not always hold, they can treat game theory as a reasonable scientific ideal akin to the models used by physicists. However, empirical work has shown that in some classic games, such as the centipede game, guess 2/3 of the average game, and the dictator game, people regularly do not play Nash equilibria. There is an ongoing debate regarding the importance of these experiments and whether the analysis of the experiments fully captures all aspects of the relevant situation.[38]\\r\\nSome game theorists, following the work of John Maynard Smith and George R. Price, have turned to evolutionary game theory in order to resolve these issues. These models presume either no rationality or bounded rationality on the part of players. Despite the name, evolutionary game theory does not necessarily presume natural selection in the biological sense. Evolutionary game theory includes both biological as well as cultural evolution and also models of individual learning (for example, fictitious play dynamics).\\r\\nSome scholars, like Leonard Savage,[citation needed] see game theory not as a predictive tool for the behavior of human beings, but as a suggestion for how people ought to behave. Since a strategy, corresponding to a Nash equilibrium of a game constitutes one's best response to the actions of the other players ÿ provided they are in (the same) Nash equilibrium ÿ playing a strategy that is part of a Nash equilibrium seems appropriate. This normative use of game theory has also come under criticism.\\r\\nGame theory is a major method used in mathematical economics and business for modeling competing behaviors of interacting agents.[39] Applications include a wide array of economic phenomena and approaches, such as auctions, bargaining, mergers & acquisitions pricing,[40] fair division, duopolies, oligopolies, social network formation, agent-based computational economics,[41] general equilibrium, mechanism design,[42] and voting systems;[43] and across such broad areas as experimental economics,[44] behavioral economics,[45] information economics,[31] industrial organization,[46] and political economy.[47][48]\\r\\nThis research usually focuses on particular sets of strategies known as \\"solution concepts\\" or \\"equilibria\\". A common assumption is that players act rationally. In non-cooperative games, the most famous of these is the Nash equilibrium. A set of strategies is a Nash equilibrium if each represents a best response to the other strategies. If all the players are playing the strategies in a Nash equilibrium, they have no unilateral incentive to deviate, since their strategy is the best they can do given what others are doing.[49][50]\\r\\nThe payoffs of the game are generally taken to represent the utility of individual players.\\r\\nA prototypical paper on game theory in economics begins by presenting a game that is an abstraction of a particular economic situation. One or more solution concepts are chosen, and the author demonstrates which strategy sets in the presented game are equilibria of the appropriate type. Naturally one might wonder to what use this information should be put. Economists and business professors suggest two primary uses (noted above): descriptive and prescriptive.[36]\\r\\nThe application of game theory to political science is focused in the overlapping areas of fair division, political economy, public choice, war bargaining, positive political theory, and social choice theory. In each of these areas, researchers have developed game-theoretic models in which the players are often voters, states, special interest groups, and politicians.\\r\\nEarly examples of game theory applied to political science are provided by Anthony Downs. In his book An Economic Theory of Democracy,[51] he applies the Hotelling firm location model to the political process. In the Downsian model, political candidates commit to ideologies on a one-dimensional policy space. Downs first shows how the political candidates will converge to the ideology preferred by the median voter if voters are fully informed, but then argues that voters choose to remain rationally ignorant which allows for candidate divergence. Game Theory was applied in 1962 to the Cuban missile crisis during the presidency of John F. Kennedy.[52]\\r\\nIt has also been proposed that game theory explains the stability of any form of political government. Taking the simplest case of a monarchy, for example, the king, being only one person, does not and cannot maintain his authority by personally exercising physical control over all or even any significant number of his subjects. Sovereign control is instead explained by the recognition by each citizen that all other citizens expect each other to view the king (or other established government) as the person whose orders will be followed. Coordinating communication among citizens to replace the sovereign is effectively barred, since conspiracy to replace the sovereign is generally punishable as a crime. Thus, in a process that can be modeled by variants of the prisoner's dilemma, during periods of stability no citizen will find it rational to move to replace the sovereign, even if all the citizens know they would be better off if they were all to act collectively.[53]\\r\\nA game-theoretic explanation for democratic peace is that public and open debate in democracies send clear and reliable information regarding their intentions to other states. In contrast, it is difficult to know the intentions of nondemocratic leaders, what effect concessions will have, and if promises will be kept. Thus there will be mistrust and unwillingness to make concessions if at least one of the parties in a dispute is a non-democracy.[54]\\r\\nOn the other hand, game theory predicts that two countries may still go to war even if their leaders are cognizant of the costs of fighting. War may result from asymmetric information; two countries may have incentives to mis-represent the amount of military resources they have on hand, rendering them unable to settle disputes agreeably without resorting to fighting. Moreover, war may arise because of commitment problems: if two countries wish to settle a dispute via peaceful means, but each wishes to go back on the terms of that settlement, they may have no choice but to resort to warfare. Finally, war may result from issue indivisibilities.[55]\\r\\nGame theory could also help predict a nation's responses when there is a new rule or law to be applied to that nation. One example would be Peter John Wood's (2013) research when he looked into what nations could do to help reduce climate change. Wood thought this could be accomplished by making treaties with other nations to reduce green house gas emissions. However, he concluded that this idea could not work because it would create a prisoner's dilemma to the nations.[56]\\r\\nUnlike those in economics, the payoffs for games in biology are often interpreted as corresponding to fitness. In addition, the focus has been less on equilibria that correspond to a notion of rationality and more on ones that would be maintained by evolutionary forces. The best known equilibrium in biology is known as the evolutionarily stable strategy (ESS), first introduced in (Smith & Price 1973). Although its initial motivation did not involve any of the mental requirements of the Nash equilibrium, every ESS is a Nash equilibrium.\\r\\nIn biology, game theory has been used as a model to understand many different phenomena. It was first used to explain the evolution (and stability) of the approximate 1:1 sex ratios. (Fisher 1930) suggested that the 1:1 sex ratios are a result of evolutionary forces acting on individuals who could be seen as trying to maximize their number of grandchildren.\\r\\nAdditionally, biologists have used evolutionary game theory and the ESS to explain the emergence of animal communication.[57] The analysis of signaling games and other communication games has provided insight into the evolution of communication among animals. For example, the mobbing behavior of many species, in which a large number of prey animals attack a larger predator, seems to be an example of spontaneous emergent organization. Ants have also been shown to exhibit feed-forward behavior akin to fashion (see Paul Ormerod's Butterfly Economics).\\r\\nBiologists have used the game of chicken to analyze fighting behavior and territoriality.[58]\\r\\nAccording to Maynard Smith, in the preface to Evolution and the Theory of Games, \\"paradoxically, it has turned out that game theory is more readily applied to biology than to the field of economic behaviour for which it was originally designed\\". Evolutionary game theory has been used to explain many seemingly incongruous phenomena in nature.[59]\\r\\nOne such phenomenon is known as biological altruism. This is a situation in which an organism appears to act in a way that benefits other organisms and is detrimental to itself. This is distinct from traditional notions of altruism because such actions are not conscious, but appear to be evolutionary adaptations to increase overall fitness. Examples can be found in species ranging from vampire bats that regurgitate blood they have obtained from a night's hunting and give it to group members who have failed to feed, to worker bees that care for the queen bee for their entire lives and never mate, to vervet monkeys that warn group members of a predator's approach, even when it endangers that individual's chance of survival.[60] All of these actions increase the overall fitness of a group, but occur at a cost to the individual.\\r\\nEvolutionary game theory explains this altruism with the idea of kin selection. Altruists discriminate between the individuals they help and favor relatives. Hamilton's rule explains the evolutionary rationale behind this selection with the equation c<b*r where the cost (c) to the altruist must be less than the benefit (b) to the recipient multiplied by the coefficient of relatedness (r). The more closely related two organisms are causes the incidences of altruism to increase because they share many of the same alleles. This means that the altruistic individual, by ensuring that the alleles of its close relative are passed on, (through survival of its offspring) can forgo the option of having offspring itself because the same number of alleles are passed on. Helping a sibling for example (in diploid animals), has a coefficient of ?, because (on average) an individual shares ? of the alleles in its sibling's offspring. Ensuring that enough of a siblings offspring survive to adulthood precludes the necessity of the altruistic individual producing offspring.[60] The coefficient values depend heavily on the scope of the playing field; for example if the choice of whom to favor includes all genetic living things, not just all relatives, we assume the discrepancy between all humans only accounts for approximately 1% of the diversity in the playing field, a co-efficient that was ? in the smaller field becomes 0.995. Similarly if it is considered that information other than that of a genetic nature (e.g. epigenetics, religion, science, etc.) persisted through time the playing field becomes larger still, and the discrepancies smaller.\\r\\nGame theory has come to play an increasingly important role in logic and in computer science. Several logical theories have a basis in game semantics. In addition, computer scientists have used games to model interactive computations. Also, game theory provides a theoretical basis to the field of multi-agent systems.\\r\\nSeparately, game theory has played a role in online algorithms; in particular, the k-server problem, which has in the past been referred to as games with moving costs and request-answer games.[61] Yao's principle is a game-theoretic technique for proving lower bounds on the computational complexity of randomized algorithms, especially online algorithms.\\r\\nThe emergence of the internet has motivated the development of algorithms for finding equilibria in games, markets, computational auctions, peer-to-peer systems, and security and information markets. Algorithmic game theory[62] and within it algorithmic mechanism design[63] combine computational algorithm design and analysis of complex systems with economic theory.[64]\\r\\nGame theory has been put to several uses in philosophy. Responding to two papers by W.V.O. Quine?(1960, 1967), Lewis (1969) used game theory to develop a philosophical account of convention. In so doing, he provided the first analysis of common knowledge and employed it in analyzing play in coordination games. In addition, he first suggested that one can understand meaning in terms of signaling games. This later suggestion has been pursued by several philosophers since Lewis.[65] Following Lewis (1969) game-theoretic account of conventions, Edna Ullmann-Margalit (1977) and Bicchieri (2006) have developed theories of social norms that define them as Nash equilibria that result from transforming a mixed-motive game into a coordination game.[66][67]\\r\\nGame theory has also challenged philosophers to think in terms of interactive epistemology: what it means for a collective to have common beliefs or knowledge, and what are the consequences of this knowledge for the social outcomes resulting from agents' interactions. Philosophers who have worked in this area include Bicchieri (1989, 1993),[68][69] Skyrms (1990),[70] and Stalnaker (1999).[71]\\r\\nIn ethics, some[who?] authors have attempted to pursue Thomas Hobbes' project of deriving morality from self-interest. Since games like the prisoner's dilemma present an apparent conflict between morality and self-interest, explaining why cooperation is required by self-interest is an important component of this project. This general strategy is a component of the general social contract view in political philosophy (for examples, see Gauthier (1986) and Kavka (1986)).[72]\\r\\nOther authors have attempted to use evolutionary game theory in order to explain the emergence of human attitudes about morality and corresponding animal behaviors. These authors look at several games including the prisoner's dilemma, stag hunt, and the Nash bargaining game as providing an explanation for the emergence of attitudes about morality (see, e.g., Skyrms?(1996, 2004) and Sober and Wilson?(1999)).\\r\\nLists","input":"Who gave the concept of game theory first?"},{"output":"\\"White Christmas\\"","context":"Christmas music comprises a variety of genres of music normally performed or heard around the Christmas season. Music associated with Christmas may be purely instrumental, or in the case of many carols or songs may employ lyrics whose subject matter ranges from the nativity of Jesus Christ, to gift-giving and merrymaking, to cultural figures such as Santa Claus, among other topics. Performances of Christmas music at public concerts, in churches, at shopping malls, on city streets, and in private gatherings is an integral staple of the Christmas holiday in many cultures across the world.\\r\\nMusic associated with Christmas is thought to have its origins in 4th century Rome, in Latin hymns such as Veni redemptor gentium.[1] By the 13th century, under the influence of Francis of Assisi, the tradition of popular Christmas songs in regional native languages developed.[2] Christmas carols in the English language first appear in a 1426 work of John Awdlay, an English chaplain, who lists twenty five \\"caroles of Cristemas\\", probably sung by groups of 'wassailers' who would travel from house to house.[3] In the 16th century, various Christmas carols still sung to this day, including \\"The 12 Days of Christmas\\", \\"God Rest You Merry, Gentlemen\\", and \\"O Christmas Tree\\", first emerged.[4]\\r\\nThe Victorian Era saw a surge of Christmas carols associated with a renewed admiration of the holiday, including \\"Silent Night\\", \\"O Little Town of Bethlehem\\", and \\"O Holy Night\\". The first Christmas songs associated with Saint Nicholas or other gift-bringers also came during 19th century, including \\"Up on the Housetop\\" and \\"Jolly Old St. Nicholas\\".[5] Many older Christmas hymns were also translated or had lyrics added to them during this period, particularly in 1871 when John Stainer published a widely influential collection entitled \\"Christmas Carols New & Old\\".[5] Few notable carols were produced from the beginning of the 20th century until the Great Depression era of the 1930s, when a stream of songs of often American origin were published, most of which did not explicitly reference the Christian nature of the holiday, but rather the more secular traditional Western themes and customs associated with Christmas. These included songs aimed at children such as \\"Santa Claus Is Comin' to Town\\" and \\"Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer\\", as well as sentimental ballad-type songs performed by famous crooners of the era, such as \\"Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas\\" and \\"White Christmas\\", the latter of which remains the best-selling single of all time as of 2017.[6][7]\\r\\nPopular Christmas music produced from after World War II until the present day has generally remained thematically, lyrically, and instrumentally similar to the songs produced in the early 20th century. Since the dawn of the rock era in the mid-1950s, much of the Christmas music produced for popular audiences has had explicitly romantic overtones, only using Christmas as a setting. Exceptions such as \\"The Christmas Shoes\\" (2000) have re-introduced Christian themes as complementary to the secular Western themes, and a plethora of traditional carol cover versions by various artists have explored virtually all music genres.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nMusic was an early feature of the Christmas season and its celebrations. The earliest examples are hymnographic works (chants and litanies) intended for liturgical use in observance of both the Feast of the Nativity and Theophany, many of which are still in use by the Eastern Orthodox Church. The 13th century saw the rise of the carol written in the vernacular, under the influence of Francis of Assisi.\\r\\nIn the Middle Ages, the English combined circle dances with singing and called them carols. Later, the word carol came to mean a song in which a religious topic is treated in a style that is familiar or festive. From Italy, it passed to France and Germany, and later to England. Christmas carols in English first appear in a 1426 work of John Audelay, a Shropshire priest and poet, who lists 25 \\"caroles of Cristemas\\", probably sung by groups of wassailers, who went from house to house.[8] Music in itself soon became one of the greatest tributes to Christmas, and Christmas music includes some of the noblest compositions of the great musicians.\\r\\nDuring the Commonwealth of England government under Cromwell, the Rump Parliament prohibited the practice of singing Christmas carols as Pagan and sinful. Like other customs associated with popular Catholic Christianity, it earned the disapproval of Protestant Puritans. Famously, Cromwell's interregnum prohibited all celebrations of the Christmas holiday. This attempt to ban the public celebration of Christmas can also be seen in the early history of Father Christmas.\\r\\nThe Westminster Assembly of Divines established Sunday as the only holy day in the calendar in 1644. The new liturgy produced for the English church recognised this in 1645, and so legally abolished Christmas. Its celebration was declared an offence by Parliament in 1647.[9] There is some debate as to the effectiveness of this ban, and whether or not it was enforced in the country.[9]\\r\\nPuritans generally disapproved of the celebration of Christmasa trend which continually resurfaced in Europe and the USA through the eighteenth, nineteenth and twentieth centuries.[10]\\r\\nWhen in May 1660 Charles II restored the Stuarts to the throne, the people of England once again practiced the public singing of Christmas carols as part of the revival of Christmas customs, sanctioned by the king's own celebrations.[9] William Sandys's Christmas Carols Ancient and Modern (1833), contained the first appearance in print of many now-classic English carols, and contributed to the mid-Victorian revival of the holiday.[11] Singing carols in church was instituted on Christmas Eve 1880 (Nine Lessons and Carols) in Truro Cathedral, Cornwall, England, which is now seen in churches all over the world.[12]\\r\\nAccording to one of the only observational research studies of Christmas caroling, Christmas observance and caroling traditions vary considerably between nations in the 21st century, while the actual sources and meanings of even high-profile songs are commonly misattributed, and the motivations for carol singing can in some settings be as much associated with family tradition and national cultural heritage as with religious beliefs.[13] Christmas festivities, including music, are also celebrated in a more secular fashion by such institutions as the Santa Claus Village, in Rovaniemi, Finland.[14]\\r\\nThe tradition of singing Christmas carols in return for alms or charity began in England in the seventeenth century after the Restoration. Town musicians or 'waits' were licensed to collect money in the streets in the weeks preceding Christmas, the custom spread throughout the population by the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries up to the present day. Also from the seventeenth century, there was the English custom, predominantly involving women, of taking a wassail bowl to their neighbours to solicit gifts, accompanied by carols. Despite this long history, many Christmas carols date only from the nineteenth century onwards, with the exception of songs such as the Wexford Carol, \\"God Rest You Merry Gentlemen\\", \\"As I Sat on a Sunny Bank\\", \\"The Holly and the Ivy,\\"[15] the \\"Coventry Carol\\" and \\"I Saw Three Ships\\".\\r\\nThe status of Christmas as an important feast within the church year also means there is a long tradition of music specially composed for celebrating the season. The following is a brief and non-exhaustive list of notable compositions:\\r\\nSongs which are traditional, even some without a specific religious context, are often called Christmas carols. Each of these has a rich history, some dating back many centuries.\\r\\nA popular set of traditional carols that might be heard at any Christmas-related event include:[16]\\r\\nThese songs hearken from centuries ago, the oldest ('Wexford Carol') originating in the 12th century. The newest came together in the mid- to late-19th century. Many began in non-English speaking countries, often with non-Christmas themes, and were later converted into English carols with English lyrics addednot always translated from the original, but newly createdsometimes as late as the early 20th century.[citation needed]\\r\\nPopular secular Christmas songs from mid-19th century America include \\"Jingle Bells\\", \\"Jolly Old Saint Nicholas\\" and \\"Up on the House Top\\".\\r\\nMore recent, copyrighted carols about the Nativity include \\"I Wonder as I Wander\\" (1933), \\"Mary's Boy Child\\" (1956), \\"Carol of the Drum\\" (\\"Little Drummer Boy\\") (1941), \\"Do You Hear What I Hear?\\" (1962), and \\"Mary, Did You Know?\\" (1984), \\"Little Donkey\\" by Eric Boswell (1959) and the \\"Calypso Carol\\" by Michael Perry (1964).\\r\\nJohn Rutter has composed many carols including All Bells in Paradise, Angels' Carol, Candlelight Carol, Donkey Carol, Jesus Child, Shepherds' Pipe Carol and Star Carol.\\r\\nChristmas music has been published as sheet music for centuries. One of the earliest collections of printed Christmas music was Piae Cantiones, a Finnish songbook first published in 1582 which contained a number of songs that have survived today as well-known Christmas carols. The publication of Christmas music books in the 19th century, such as Christmas Carols, New and Old (Bramley and Stainer, 1871), played an important role in widening the popular appeal of carols.[18] In the 20th century, Oxford University Press (OUP) published some highly successful Christmas music collections such as The Oxford Book of Carols (Martin Shaw, Ralph Vaughan Williams and Percy Dearmer, 1928), which revived a number of early folk songs and established them as modern standard carols.[17][19] This was followed by the bestselling Carols for Choirs series (David Willcocks, Reginald Jacques and John Rutter), first published in 1961 and now available in a five volumes. The popular books have proved to be a popular resource for choirs and church congregations in the English-speaking world, and remain in print today.[20]\\r\\nMore recently popular Christmas songsoften Christmas songs introduced in theater, television, film, or other entertainment mediatend to be specifically about Christmas, or have a wintertime theme. They are typically not overtly religious. The most popular set of these titlesheard over airwaves, on the Internet, in shopping centers malls, in elevators and lobbies, even on the street during the Christmas seasonhave been composed and performed from the 1930s onward. \\"Jingle Bells\\", \\"Jolly Old Saint Nicholas\\", and \\"Up on the House Top\\", however, date from the mid-19th century.\\r\\nThe largest portion of these songs in some way describes or is reminiscent of Christmas traditions, how Western Christian countries tend to celebrate the holiday, i.e., with caroling, mistletoe, exchanging of presents, a Christmas tree, feasting, jingle bells, etc. Celebratory or sentimental, and nostalgic in tone, they hearken back to simpler times with memorable holiday practicesexpressing the desire either to be with someone or at home for Christmas.\\r\\nMany titles help define the mythical aspects of modern Christmas celebration: Santa Claus bringing presents, coming down the chimney, being pulled by reindeer, etc. New mythical characters are created, defined, and popularized by these songs; \\"Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer\\", adapted from a major retailer's promotional poem, was introduced to radio audiences by Gene Autry in 1949. His follow-up a year later introduced \\"Frosty the Snowman\\", the central character of his song.\\r\\nThough overtly religious, and authored (at least partly) by a writer of many church hymns, no drumming child appears in any biblical account of the Christian nativity scene. This character was introduced to the tradition by Katherine K. Davis in her \\"The Little Drummer Boy\\" (written in 1941, with a popular version being released in 1958).\\r\\nThe winter-related songs celebrate the climatic season, with all its snow, dressing up for the cold, sleighing, etc.\\r\\nAccording to the American Society of Composers, Authors and Publishers in 2016, \\"Santa Claus Is Coming to Town,\\" written by Fred Coots and Haven Gillespie in 1934, is the most played holiday song of the last 50 years. It was first performed live by Eddie Cantor on his radio show. Tommy Dorsey and his orchestra recorded their version in 1935, followed later by a range of artists including: Frank Sinatra, The Supremes, The Jackson 5, The Beach Boys, and Glenn Campbell. Bruce Springsteen add a rock rendition in 1975.\\r\\nLong-time Christmas classics still dominate the holiday charts  such as \\"Let It Snow! Let It Snow! Let It Snow!,\\" \\"Winter Wonderland,\\" \\"Sleigh Ride\\" and \\"Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas\\"  new songs to enter the top tier of the seasons canon include \\"Wonderful Christmastime\\" by Paul McCartney, \\"All I Want for Christmas Is You\\" by Walter Afanasieff and Mariah Carey, and \\"Last Christmas\\" by George Michael.\\r\\nThe top thirty most-played holiday songs for the 2015 holiday season are ranked here, all titles written or co-written by ASCAP songwriters and composers.[21]\\r\\nThe above ranking results from an aggregation of performances of all different artist versions of each cited holiday song, across all forms of media, from 1/1/15 through 12/31/15.\\r\\nIn addition to Bing Crosby, major acts that have popularized and successfully covered a number of the titles in the top 30 most performed Christmas songs in 2015 include: Frank Sinatra, Elvis Presley, Andy Williams, and the Jackson 5. Bruce Springsteen had a major hit with his version of \\"Santa Claus Is Coming to Town\\".\\r\\nWhile the ASCAP list is relatively popular in the UK and Ireland, it remains largely overshadowed by a collection of chart hits recorded in a bid to be crowned the UK Christmas number one single during the 1970s and 1980s. Band Aid's 1984 song \\"Do They Know It's Christmas?\\" is the second best selling single in UK Chart history. The 1987 single \\"Fairytale of New York\\" by The Pogues, a rock band from London, is regularly voted the British public's favourite ever Christmas song, and it is also the most-played Christmas song of the 21st century in the UK.[25][26][27] British glam rock bands had major hit singles with Christmas songs in the 1970s; \\"Merry Xmas Everybody\\" by Slade, \\"I Wish It Could Be Christmas Everyday\\" by Wizzard and \\"Lonely This Christmas\\" by Mud, all of which have remained hugely popular.[28] The top ten most played Christmas songs in the UK based on a 2012 survey conducted by PRS for Music, who collect and pay royalties to its 75,000 song-writing and composing members, are as follows:[29]\\r\\nIncluded in the 2009 and 2008 lists are such other titles as Jona Lewie's \\"Stop the Cavalry\\", Bruce Springsteen's \\"Santa Claus is Coming to Town\\", Elton John's \\"Step into Christmas\\", Mud's \\"Lonely This Christmas\\", \\"Walking in the Air\\" by Aled Jones, Shakin' Stevens' \\"Merry Christmas Everyone\\", Chris Rea's \\"Driving Home for Christmas\\" and \\"Mistletoe and Wine\\" and \\"Saviour's Day\\" by Cliff Richard.\\r\\nThe best Christmas song \\"to get adults and children in the festive spirit for the party season in 2016\\" was judged by the Daily Mirror to be \\"Fairytale of New York\\".[30] Mariah Careys \\"All I Want For Christmas is You\\" was declared \\"the UKs favourite Christmas song,\\" narrowly beating out \\"Fairytale of New York\\" according to a \\"points system\\" created by The Independent in 2017. Both score well ahead of all others on the list of top twenty Christmas songs in the U.K.[23]\\r\\nIn Britain and Ireland, the terms \\"Christmas number one single\\" and \\"Christmas number two single\\" denote songs released around the time of the Christmas holiday and that reach the top of the UK Singles Chart and/or Irish Singles Chart respectively. Because of the two countries' proximity to each other, the Irish No. 1 is usually the same as the British No. 1 or No. 2. Though some of these songs do tend to develop an association with Christmas or the holiday season, such an association tends to be much shorter lived than the more traditionally themed Christmas songs such as \\"I Wish It Could Be Christmas Everyday\\", \\"Mistletoe and Wine\\" and \\"Merry Christmas Everyone\\", and the songs may have nothing to do with Christmas or even winter. Past Christmas number-ones include children's songs such as \\"Mr Blobby\\" (#1, 1993) and the theme from Bob the Builder (#1, 2000), novelty songs such as Benny Hill's \\"Ernie\\" (#1, 1971) and South Park's \\"Chocolate Salty Balls\\" (#2, 1998), and several examples of standard pop fare that would likely be just as popular outside the holiday season. Some songs will be \\"tweaked\\" to make them more related to Christmas. This is almost exclusively a British cultural phenomenon; some notable and longer-lasting examples include Band Aid's \\"Do They Know It's Christmas?\\" (#1, 1985, the second biggest selling single in UK Chart history; two re-recordings also hit #1 in 1989 and 2004), Slade's \\"Merry Xmas Everybody\\" (#1, 1973) and Wham!'s \\"Last Christmas\\" (#2, 1984).\\r\\nIn 2002, Popstars The Rivals produced the top three singles on the British Christmas charts. The \\"rival\\" groups produced by the series(the girl group Girls Aloud and the boy band One True Voice)finished first and second respectively on the charts. Failed contestants The Cheeky Girls charted with a novelty hit at third. Briton Will Young, winner of the first Pop Idol, charted at the top of the Irish charts in 2003.\\r\\nThe winning song from the December-ending The X Factor earned the Christmas number one in at least one of the two countries every year from 2005 to 2014, and in both countries in five of those ten years. Each year since 2008 has seen protest campaigns to outsell the X Factor single (which benefits from precisely-timed release and corresponding media buzz) and prevent it from reaching number one. In 2009, \\"Killing in the Name\\" by Rage Against the Machine reached number one in the UK instead of that year's X Factor winner, Joe McElderry. McElderry did reach number one in Ireland. A fractured campaign to unseat the 2010 X Factor winner, plus a delay in delivery of The Rubberbandits' \\"Horse Outside\\" to stores in Ireland, resulted in X Factor winner Matt Cardle earning the Christmas number one in both countries.\\r\\nIn 2011, \\"Wherever You Are\\", the single from a choir of military wives assembled by the TV series The Choir, earned the Christmas number-one single in BritainupsettingX Factor winners Little Mix. With the Military Wives Choir single not being released in Ireland, Little Mix won Christmas number-one in Ireland that year.[32]\\r\\nIn 2012 the Christmas No. 1 was a cover of \\"He Ain't Heavy, He's My Brother\\" from an ensemble of Liverpudlian celebrities in commemoration of the 1989 Hillsborough Disaster. X Factor winner Sam Bailey's single won the Christmas number-one competition in both countries in 2013.\\r\\nSituated in the southern hemisphere, where seasons are reversed from the northern, the heat of early summer in Australia affects the way Christmas is celebrated and how northern hemisphere Christmas traditions are followed. Australians generally spend Christmas out of doors, going to the beach for the day, or heading to camp grounds for a vacation. International visitors to Sydney at Christmastime often go to Bondi Beach where tens of thousands gather on Christmas Day.\\r\\nThe tradition of an Australian Christmas Eve carol service lit by candles, started in 1937 by Victorian radio announcer Norman Banks, has taken place in Melbourne annually since then. Carols by Candlelight events can be \\"huge gatherings . . televised live throughout the country\\" or smaller \\"local community and church events.\\" Carols in the Domain in Sydney is now a \\"popular platform for the stars of stage and music.\\"\\r\\nSome homegrown Christmas songs have become popular. William G. James' six sets of Australian Christmas Carols, with words by John Wheeler, include \\"The Three Drovers\\", \\"The Silver Stars are in the Sky\\", \\"Christmas Day\\", \\"Carol of the Birds\\" and others. \\"Light-hearted Australian Christmas songs\\" have become \\"an essential part of the Australian Christmas experience.\\" Rolf Harris' \\"Six White Boomers\\", Colin Buchanan's \\"Aussie Jingle Bells\\", and the \\"Australian Twelve Days of Christmas\\",[33] proudly proclaim the differing traditions Down Under. A verse from \\"Aussie Jingle Bells\\" makes the point:\\r\\n\\"The Twelve Days of Christmas\\" has been revised to fit the Australian context, as an example: \\"On the twelfth day of Christmas, my true love sent to me: 12 parrots prattling, 11 numbats nagging, 10 lizards leaping, 9 wombats working, 8 dingoes digging, 7 possums playing, 6 brolgas dancing, 5 kangaroos, 4 koalas cuddling, 3 kookaburras laughing, 2 pink galahs, and an emu up a gum tree.\\"[35]\\r\\nOther popular Australian Christmas songs include: 'White Wine in the Sun\\" by Tim Minchin, \\"Aussie Jingle Bells\\" by Bucko & Champs, \\"Christmas Photo\\" by John Williamson, \\"Go Santa, Go\\" by The Wiggles, and \\"Six White Boomers\\" by Russel Coight.[36]\\r\\n\\"The Australian carols that do exist are mostly novelty re-workings of existing songs with the holly and the ivy replaced by gum trees and wattle. Santa swapping his fur hat for a corked Akubra and a token Aboriginal word is deemed sufficient to localise the celebration of the day a Middle Eastern tradesman wasnt actually born.\\"[37]\\r\\n\\"My Little Christmas Belle\\" (1909) composed by Joe Slater (1872-1926) to words by Ward McAlister (1872ÿ1928) celebrates eastern Australian flora coming into bloom during the heat of Christmas. Blandfordia nobilis, also known as Christmas Bells, are the specific subject of the songwith the original sheet music bearing a depiction of the blossom.[38] Whereas \\"The Holly and The Ivy\\" (1937) by Australian Louis Lavater (1867ÿ1953) mentions northern hemisphere foliage.[39]\\r\\nAustralian singer-songwriter Paul Kelly first released \\"How to Make Gravy\\" as part of a four-track EP November 4, 1996 through White Label Records. The title track, written by Kelly, tells the story in a letter to his brother from a newly imprisoned man who laments how he will be missing the family Christmas. It received a 'Song of the Year' nomination at the 1998 Australasian Performing Rights Association (APRA) Music Awards. Kelly's theme reflects a national experience with Christmas:\\r\\n\\"A lot of the early imagery of Christmas in Australia is related to isolation and distance. Youve got the Sydney Mail in 1879 saying The revels of Christmas tide cannot endure the ordeal of immigration. Its that sense that its alien here and were so conscious of being away from family and that figures very prominently in the imagery of Christmas back in that time.\\"[37]\\r\\nOther popular Christmas songs often heard around the holidays include: \\"I've Got My Love to Keep Me Warm\\" (1937), \\"The Little Boy that Santa Claus Forgot\\" (1937), \\"I'll Be Home for Christmas\\" (1943), \\"Merry Christmas Baby\\" (1947)  all recorded by a number of acts.\\r\\nOther song titles that have joined the Christmas music canon in ensuing decades include:\\r\\nIn their \\"admittedly subjective\\" list of the top Christmas songs of all time, ThoughtCo. ranked their top five favorites as:[46]\\r\\nIn 2007 surveys of United States radio listeners by two different research groups,[47] the most liked songs were standards such as Bing Crosby's \\"White Christmas\\" (1942), Nat King Cole's \\"The Christmas Song\\" (1946), and Burl Ives' \\"A Holly Jolly Christmas\\" (1965). Other favorites like \\"Rockin' Around the Christmas Tree\\" (Brenda Lee, 1958), \\"Jingle Bell Rock\\" (Bobby Helms, 1957) and John Lennon and Yoko Ono's \\"Happy Xmas\\" (1971), scored well in one study. Also \\"loved\\" were Johnny Mathis' \\"Do You Hear What I Hear?\\" and Harry Simeone Chorale's \\"Little Drummer Boy\\".\\r\\nThe Pinnacle Media Worldwide survey divided its listeners into music-type categories:\\r\\nAmong the most-hated Christmas songs, according to Edison Media Research's 2007 survey, are Barbra Streisand's \\"Jingle Bells?\\", the Jackson 5's \\"Santa Claus Is Coming to Town\\", Elmo & Patsy's \\"Grandma Got Run Over by a Reindeer\\", and \\"O Holy Night\\" as performed by cartoon characters from Comedy Central's \\"South Park\\". The \\"most-hated Christmastime recording\\" is a rendition of \\"Jingle Bells\\" by Don Charles's Singing Dogs, a revolutionary novelty song originally released in 1955, and re-released as an edited version in 1970.[47]\\r\\nRolling Stone magazine ranked Darlene Love's version of \\"Christmas (Baby Please Come Home)\\" (1963) first on its list of The Greatest Rock and Roll Christmas Songs in December 2010.[48] Carey's \\"All I Want for Christmas Is You\\", co-written by Carey and Walter Afanasieff, was No. 1 on Billboard's Holiday Digital Songs chart in December 2013.[49] \\"Fairytale of New York\\" by The Pogues is cited as the best Christmas song of all time in various television, radio and magazine related polls in the U.K. and Ireland.[50]\\r\\nApproximately half of the 30 best-selling Christmas songs by ASCAP members in 2015 were written by Jewish composers. Johnny Marks has three top Christmas songs, the most for any writer\\"Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer\\", \\"Rockin' Around the Christmas Tree\\", and \\"A Holly Jolly Christmas\\". By far the most recorded Christmas song is \\"White Christmas\\" by Irving Berlin (born Israel Isidore Beilin in Russia)who also wrote \\"Happy Holiday\\"with well over 500 versions in dozens of languages.\\r\\nOthers include:[51][52][53][54]\\r\\nLyricist Jerome \\"Jerry\\" Leiber and composer Mike Stoller wrote \\"Santa Claus Is Back in Town\\", which Elvis Presley debuted on his first Christmas album in 1957. \\"Christmas (Baby Please Come Home)\\" was written by Ellie Greenwich and Jeff Barry (with Phil Spector), originally for Ronnie Spector of The Ronettes. It was made into a hit by Darlene Love in 1963.\\r\\n\\"Peace on Earth\\" was written by Ian Fraser, Larry Grossman, and Alan Kohan as a counterpoint to \\"The Little Drummer Boy\\" (1941) to make David Bowie comfortable recording \\"Peace on Earth/Little Drummer Boy\\" with Bing Crosby on September 11, 1977  for Crosby's then-upcoming television special, Bing Crosby's Merrie Olde Christmas.[56]\\r\\nWhat is known as Christmas music today was often adopted from works initially composed for other purposes, coming to be associated with the holiday in some way. Many tunes adopted into the Christmas canon fall into the generic Winter classification, as they carry no Christmas connotation at all. Others were written to celebrate other holidays and gradually came to cover the Christmas season.\\r\\nBorrowing from the title of the Robert Burns standard \\"Auld Lang Syne,\\" Dan Fogelberg's \\"Same Old Lang Syne\\" (released 1980) tells a Christmas Eve story and is now frequently played during the holiday season. Perry Como famously sang Franz Schubert's setting of \\"Ave Maria\\" in his televised Christmas special each year, including the song on The Perry Como Christmas Album (1968) which \\"became a staple of family holiday record collections.\\"[58]\\r\\nWith a Welsh melody dating back to the sixteenth century, and English lyrics from 1862, \\"Deck the Halls\\" celebrates the pagan holiday of Yule and the New Year, but not explicitly Christmas:\\r\\n\\"Jingle Bells\\", first published under the title \\"One Horse Open Sleigh\\" in 1857, was originally associated with Thanksgiving rather than Christmas.[59] \\"Sleigh Ride\\", composed originally in 1948 as an instrumental by Leroy Anderson, was inspired by a heatwave in Connecticut. The song premiered with the Boston Pops Orchestra in May 1948 with no association with Christmas. The lyrics added in 1950 have \\"nothing to do with Santa, Jesus, presents or reindeer.\\" The jingling bells and the sleigh in the title, though, made it a natural Christmas song. Lyricist Sammy Cahn and composer Julie Styne also found themselves in a heatwave in July 1945 when they wrote \\"Let It Snow! Let It Snow! Let It Snow!\\", with no reference to Christmas in the song.[60]\\r\\nMany popular Christmas tunes of the 20th century mention winter imagery, and for this have been adopted into the Christmas and holiday season, including:\\r\\nIn the 21st century, some songs mention the holiday season or winter imagery. \\"Holiday\\" (2010) is about the summer holidays, but has been used in some Christmas ad campaigns. \\"Do You Want to Build a Snowman?\\" (2013), is from the movie Frozen. Its lyrics are more of an illustration of the relationship between the two main characters than a general description of winter or the holidays, but it is considered a holiday song due to its title rhetoric and the winter imagery used throughout the film.\\r\\nFollowing the 2016 death of songwriter Leonard Cohen and the resulting uptick in interest in his work, various versions of his signature song \\"Hallelujah,\\" including a version by American a capella group Pentatonix that had already been recorded and released on their Christmas album shortly before Cohen's death, were added into Christmas music playlists on radio stations in the United States and Canada.\\r\\nChristmas songs introduced in theater, television, and film include \\"White Christmas\\" from Holiday Inn (1942), \\"Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas\\" from Meet Me in St. Louis (1944), and \\"Silver Bells\\" in The Lemon Drop Kid (1950). Some musical films have been set around Christmas time, and because of that some of the songs are popular during the holiday season, including:\\r\\nA popular form of Christmas song are the musical parodies of the seasoncomical or nonsensical songs performed principally for their comical effectusually classified as \\"novelty songs\\". The term arose in the Tin Pan Alley world of popular songwriting, with novelty songs achieved great popularity during the 1920s and 1930s.\\r\\nMany novelty songs employ unusual lyrics, subjects, sounds, or instrumentation, and may not even be particularly musical. This Christmas novelty song genre started off with \\"I Yust Go Nuts At Christmas\\" written by Yogi Yorgesson and sung by him with the Johnny Duffy Trio in 1949, and include such notable titles as:\\r\\nIn the Seventies comedic singing duo Cheech & Chong's debut single in 1971 was \\"Santa Claus and His Old Lady\\". The Kinks did \\"Father Christmas\\" in 1977, and Elmo & Patsy came out with \\"Grandma Got Run Over by a Reindeer\\" in 1979. More recent titles added to the canon include:\\r\\nSeattle radio personality Bob Rivers became nationally famous for his line of novelty Christmas songs and released five albums (collectively known as the Twisted Christmas quintilogy, after the name of Rivers' radio program, \\"Twisted Radio\\") consisting entirely of Christmas parodies from 1987 to 2002. \\"Don't Shoot Me Santa\\" was released by The Killers in 2007, benefiting various AIDS charities. Christmas novelty songs can involve gallows humor and even morbid humor like that found in \\"Christmas at Ground Zero\\" and \\"The Night Santa Went Crazy\\", both by \\"Weird Al\\" Yankovic. The Dan Band released several adult-oriented Christmas songs on their 2007 album \\"Ho: A Dan Band Christmas\\" which included \\"Ho, Ho, Ho\\" (ho being slang for a prostitute), \\"I Wanna Rock You Hard This Christmas\\", \\"Please Don't Bomb Nobody This Holiday\\" and \\"Get Drunk & Make Out This Christmas\\".\\r\\nKristen Bell and a cappella group Straight No Chaser \\"teamed up to poke fun at the modern seasons greeting\\" with \\"Text Me Merry Christmas\\":\\r\\nStraight No Chaser singer Randy Stine said of the song: \\"We wanted a Christmas song that spoke to how informal communication has become.\\"[63]\\r\\nChristmas novelty songs include many sung by young teens, or performed largely for the enjoyment of a young audience. Kicking off with \\"I Saw Mommy Kissing Santa Claus\\" sung by 13-year-old Jimmy Boyd in 1952, other few notable novelty songs written to parody the Christmas season and sung by young singers include:\\r\\nChristmas novelty songs aimed at a young audience include:\\r\\nThe number of Christmas novelty songs is so immense that radio host Dr. Demento devotes an entire month of weekly two-hour episodes to the format each year, and the novelty songs receive frequent requests at radio stations across the country.\\r\\nRadio broadcasting of Christmas music has been around for several decades in the United States and elsewhere. Traditionally, U.S. radio stations (particularly those with such formats as adult contemporary, adult standards, easy listening, oldies, or beautiful music) began adding some Christmas-themed selections to their regular playlists shortly after Thanksgiving each year, typically culminating in 36ÿ48 hours of continuous Christmas music between December 24ÿ25. Since the mid-1990s, it has become increasingly common for stations to switch their programming to continuous Christmas music around Thanksgiving, or earlier. This practice became even more widespread after 9/11, when many radio stations across the U.S. sought a sort of musical \\"comfort food\\".[64]\\r\\nAs a part of a phenomenon known as \\"Christmas creep\\", radio stationsresponsible for so much of Christmas music broadcasting, popularization, and appreciationare \\"going Christmas\\" earlier each year. Many stations now start rolling out holiday music in early November instead of Thanksgiving or Black Friday (and a select few, such as WEZW since 2011, have earned a reputation for beginning their Christmas music as early as October), because programmers \\"think that listeners will stick with the first station to change to a seasonal theme.\\" About 400 radio stations \\"across the U.S. play Christmas music around the clock.\\" In Chicago, WLIT-FM saw its share of all radio listeners grow from a 2.9/3.6 share earlier in the year to 9.3 during the Nov. 28 to Dec. 11, 2003 Arbitron rating period. A 2002 Arbitron ratings study confirmed holiday-music surges at stations around the country.[65]\\r\\nThe 24/7 all-Christmas format has been generally successful due in large part to Christmas creep. In the United States, many radio stations begin airing an all-Christmas format by Thanksgiving weekend,[66] with others starting the Friday one week prior and some making the switch as early as November 1. As of November 24, 2015 (two days before Thanksgiving), there were over 244 commercial U.S. radio stations airing 24/7 Christmas music.\\r\\nWhen a radio station in the U.S. makes the temporary switch to all-Christmas music, its listener share regularly doubles.[67] A sampling of radio stations that made the switch in 2010 with the change in market share:[68]\\r\\nAdult contemporary, oldies, and country listeners tend to adjust better to an all-Christmas switch than do listeners of other formats such as hip-hop or hard rock. However: \\"Nine times out of 10, many new listeners pour in, outweighing the listeners that do opt out,\\" says Greg Strassell, senior vice president of programming at CBS Radio.[68] However, this may not always transition well into financial success, since advertisers do not universally recognise Arbitron's holiday ratings book.[69]\\r\\nA 2005 study published in the Journal of Business Research noted that shoppers respond well to hearing Christmas music in stores.[70] Psychologists have noted that continuous exposure to Christmas music for a prolonged period of time can create a hostile work environment for employees.[71]\\r\\nEven many stations that do not play full-time Christmas music prior to Christmas Eve will often play Christmas music commercial-free the entire day on Christmas Day and often a portion of Christmas Eve as well, with only recorded interruptions for Christmas messages from station personnel and personnel from the station's parent company to give all but the governmental body-required number of personnel (in the U.S., two people must have a presence at a station at all times) the day off.\\r\\nAlthough the Christmas season by definition runs until January 6 (Epiphany), and is observed until at least New Year's Eve by the public, almost all broadcasters skip the last Twelve Days of Christmas, abruptly ending all holiday music at or even before midnight on December 25, and not playing a single Christmas song again until the next November. (Several radio stations actually promote this, with ads that proudly proclaim to listeners weary of the Christmas music that the station's regular format will indeed return on December 26, as soon as Christmas Day is over.) It is not uncommon for broadcasters to market the twelve-day period preceding Christmas (December 14 to 25) as the \\"Twelve Days of Christmas\\", contrary to the traditional definition. One reason for this is that much popular Christmas music is so closely associated with Christmas Day itself that it would be difficult or impossible to play after December 25 without bringing up references that the broadcaster may wish to ignore (such as those that involve Santa Claus, who has already come and gone by Christmas morning). On occasion, some Christmas music stations will continue to play at least some Christmas music through the weekend following Christmas, or even through New Year's Day (particularly when stunting in anticipation of a format change; see below), but never any later.\\r\\nChristmas music is a popular stunt format, used when a station is transitioning to a different format. For instance, a rock music station changing to a rhythmic oldies format will often air Christmas music in-between. This can occur at times when Christmas music seems out of place, such as in summer. The end of the calendar year is a common time of year for format switches. As such, Christmas music may be aired for a prolonged period of time from as early as October and/or extend as late as New Year's Day, while the station prepares the switch. Conversely, when 94.9 in Atlanta changed from adult contemporary to country music in the middle of December 2006, it abruptly stopped playing its annual Christmas music a week before the holiday.\\r\\nA brief 24/7 Christmas music format is also common during Christmas in July stunts.\\r\\nOutside of traditional AM/FM radio, satellite radio providers XM and Sirius typically devote multiple channels to different genres of Christmas music during the holiday season.[72] Numerous Internet radio services also offer Christmas music channels, some of them available year-round. Citadel Media produced The Christmas Channel, a syndicated 24-hour radio network, during the holiday season in past years (though in 2010, Citadel instead included Christmas music on its regular Classic Hits network). Music Choice offers nonstop holiday music to its digital cable, cable modem, and mobile phone subscribers between November 1 and New Year's Day on its \\"Sounds of the Seasons\\" (traditional), \\"R&B\\" (soul), \\"Tropicales\\" (Latin), and \\"Soft Rock\\" (contemporary) channels. DMX provides holiday music as part of its SonicTap music service for digital cable and DirecTV subscribers, as does Dish Network via its in-house Dish CD music channels. Services such as Muzak also distribute Christmas music to retail stores for use as in-store background music during the holidays.\\r\\nThe growing popularity of Internet radio has inspired other media outlets to begin offering Christmas music. In 2009 Phoenix television station KTVK launched four commercial-free online radio stations including Ho Ho Radio, which streams Christmas music throughout the month of December.\\r\\nIn Ireland, a temporary radio station named Christmas FM broadcasts on a temporary license in Dublin and Cork from November 28 to December 26, solely playing Christmas music.\\r\\nIn the U.K., the Festive Fifty list of indie rock songs is broadcast starting on Christmas Day, originally by DJ John Peel, and nowadays by Internet radio station Dandelion Radio.","input":"What is the most recorded christmas song in history?"},{"output":"Anaerobic glycolysis","context":"Anaerobic glycolysis is the transformation of glucose to lactate when limited amounts of oxygen (O2) are available.

Its epicenter was about 55?km (34?mi) south of the city of Puebla. The earthquake caused damage in the Mexican states of Puebla and Morelos and in the Greater Mexico City area, including the collapse of more than 40 buildings.[2][3][4] 370 people were killed by the earthquake and related building collapses, including 228 in Mexico City,[5][6] and more than 6,000 were injured.[7]\\r\\nThe quake coincidentally occurred on the 32nd anniversary of the 1985 Mexico City earthquake, which killed around 10,000 people. The 1985 quake was commemorated, and a national earthquake drill was held, at 11?a.m. local time, just two hours before the 2017 earthquake.[8][9] Twelve days earlier, the even larger 2017 Chiapas earthquake struck 650?km (400?mi) away, off the coast of the state of Chiapas.[10]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nMexico is one of the world's most seismically active regions, sitting atop several intersecting tectonic plates. The border between the Cocos Plate and North American Plate, along the Pacific Coast of Mexico, creates a subduction zone that generates large seismic events.[2] Activity along the edges of the Rivera and Caribbean plates also generate seismic events. All together, these seismic forces cause an average of 40 earthquakes a day in Mexico.[11]\\r\\nMexico City is built on a dry lakebed with soft soil made up of sand and clay, which amplifies the destruction that major earthquakes cause.[12] Loose sediments near the surface slow the shockwaves' speed from 1.5 miles (2,414m) per second (8690.4?km/h) to roughly 150 feet (45,72m) per second (164.592?km/h).[13] This increases the shockwaves' amplitude, which causes more violent shaking. Deeper and denser soil layers increase amplified shockwaves' destructive duration.[13]\\r\\nLess than two weeks before the Puebla earthquake, Mexico had been struck by an earthquake in Chiapas on 7 September, which killed almost 100 people. Despite its close timing, the Puebla earthquake was not an aftershock of the Chiapas event, as the epicenters were 650?km (400?mi) apart.[14]\\r\\nThe possibility of a link between the earthquakes was being investigated in the days after the second one. Big earthquakes can increase the long-term risk of seismic activity by transferring \\"static stress\\" to adjacent faults, but only at a distance of up to four times the length of the original rupture. In 19 September earthquake, static stress transfer was considered unlikely due to the distance between the earthquakes, in excess of the expected 400?km maximum. \\"Dynamic triggering\\", with seismic waves propagating from one quake affecting other faults, may operate at much longer distances, but usually happens within hours or a few days of the triggering quake; a 12-day gap is hard to explain.[15]\\r\\n19 September is designated as a day of remembrance for the 1985 Mexico City earthquake, which killed approximately 10,000 civilians. Every year at 11?a.m., a national earthquake drill is conducted by the government through the use of public loudspeakers located throughout Mexico City.[16] The 2017 drill took place as scheduled, at 11?a.m., around two hours before the central Mexico earthquake.[9][17]\\r\\nAccording to the National Seismological Service (SSN) of Mexico, the epicenter was located 12?km (7.5?mi) southeast of Axochiapan, Morelos, and 120?km (75?mi) from Mexico City.[11] The earthquake was measured at a magnitude of 7.1, occurring at 13:14:40 Central Daylight Time, at a depth of 51?km (32?mi).[11] The United States Geological Survey (USGS) placed the epicenter 5?km (3.1?mi) ENE of San Juan Raboso and reported a measurement of VIII (Severe) on the Mercalli intensity scale;[2] While there was a report of strong shaking for about one minute, which is a long time for an earthquake,[18] acceleration/velocity/displacement seismograms at UNAM showed about 20?seconds of strong shaking with a period of 1?second.[19] SSN reported a peak ground acceleration of 112?cm/s2 (0.114?g0) at the Popocatpetl reporting station in Tlamacas, Estado de Mxico.[11] According to the USGS, the earthquake occurred on a moderately dipping normal fault.[2]\\r\\nAccording to the bulletin of Mexico's SASMEX earthquake warning system, 20 seconds' advance warning was given in Mexico City;[20] however the general experience in the capital was that the alarm and cellphone alerts started only a few seconds before, or during the quake.[21][22][23][24] Some residents reportedly mistook the alert for a continuation of the earlier drill.[25] 25 of the early-warning seismic sensors detected the earthquake, and alerts were also provided to Oaxaca, Acapulco, Chilpancingo, and Puebla, with lead times stated to range from 12 to 48 seconds.\\r\\nNine days after the earthquake, at least 361 people had been reported killed.[27][26] At least 74 people were killed in the state of Morelos, 220 in Mexico City, 45 in Puebla, 13 in the State of Mexico, 6 in the state of Guerrero and one in the state of Oaxaca.[27][28][26] In Mexico City, the bodies of 26 students and four instructors were pulled from the rubble of the Enrique C. Rbsamen school; 30 students and 8 adults were still unaccounted for as of the evening of 19 September[update].[29][30] The Mexico City campus of the Monterrey Institute of Technology and Higher Education suffered damage, with at least 5 people killed and 40 injured.[31]\\r\\nMore than 6,000 people had been reported injured by the day after the earthquake, with more than 300 confirmed dead[32] as Mexico earthquake rescue efforts continue.\\r\\nOn 1 October the number of people known to have been killed was stated to be 361,[26] with more than 4,500 injured. By place, 220 were killed in Mexico City, 74 in the state of Morelos, 45 in Puebla, 15 in Mexico State, six in Guerrero, and one in Oaxaca.[33]\\r\\nAn investigation published in October 2017 revealed that since 2012 there had been over 6,000 complaints about construction violations in Mexico City, with no public record of how many were followed up. Many of the buildings complained about collapsed in the 19 September earthquake. After the earthquake the Urban Development and Housing Secretariat (Seduvi) did not respond to requests for information on responses to complaints. Local activists called the construction system totally corrupt, and said that some developers circumvent building regulations, and city authorities frequently ignore complaints.[34]\\r\\nIn Puebla, church steeples had toppled in the city of Cholula,[35] and a church on the slopes of Popocatpetl in Atzitzihuacan collapsed during mass, killing 15 people.[35] A second church, which was built in the 17th century, fell in Atzala during a baptism, killing 11 people including the baby.[36]\\r\\nAt least 44 buildings collapsed in Mexico City due to the earthquake, trapping people inside, creating large plumes of dust, and starting fires.[35] At least 50 to 60 people were rescued by emergency workers and citizens.[28][37][28] Several buildings caught fire.[38] Condesa, Roma and del Valle neighbourhoods were among those most affected in the zone: a building located on lvaro Obreg܇n Avenue collapsed, and several buildings on msterdam Avenue suffered damage.[39][40][41]\\r\\nGas leaks were reported, along with \\"piles\\" of rubble from collapsed buildings.[37] Stock prices declined at the Mexico Stock Exchange but recovered before trading was suspended.[42] Comisi܇n Federal de Electricidad, the national electric utility, reported that 4.78 million customers lost power in Guerrero, Morelos, Puebla, State of Mexico, Oaxaca, Tlaxcala, and parts of Mexico Cityroughly 35% of the company's customers in those states. However, none of the generating stations in the region sustained structural damage.[43]\\r\\nMexico City International Airport suspended operations while damage assessments took place, but reopened at 4:00?p.m.?CDT (2100 UTC). 180 flights were cancelled or diverted during the closure.[44][3][45] A plane carrying President Enrique Pe?a Nieto, returning from touring damage in Oaxaca from the earlier Chiapas earthquake, was diverted to Santa Luca Air Force Base.[46] Mexico City Metro service was temporarily cancelled on several subway lines due to a power failure, but restored by 17:30, offering free service to stranded passengers.[47] Building evacuations also caused delays to Metrob~s service in the city.[48]\\r\\nThe federal Secretariat of the Interior (SEGOB) declared a state of emergency for all 33 municipalities of Morelos,[49] for all 16 boroughs of Mexico City,[50] and 112 of the 217 municipalities of Puebla.[51] The declarations allow funds from the National Natural Disaster Fund (FONDEN) to be used during the emergency response phase.[49][50][51] The Mexican Army and Mexican Navy deployed 3,000 active-duty troops to Mexico City through the DN-III-E and Plan Marina emergency response plans. The troops were tasked with debris cleanup, search and rescue, and security missions. Additionally, the Secretariat of National Defence moved eight helicopters to Mexico City, and activated 3 shelters in the affected areas.[52]\\r\\nA damage survey by American structural engineers revealed that a number of collapsed buildings had been erected in the 1960s and 1970s with unreinforced masonry walls confined by non-ductile concrete frames.[53]\\r\\nAll Round of 16 matches of the Copa MX, an association football cup competition, were suspended until further notice.[54]\\r\\nThe hashtag #FuerzaMxico (Be strong, Mexico) was used on social media outlets.[55]\\r\\nThe Israel Defense Forces sent a group of 71 search and rescue soldiers[56] including engineers, to help in the aftermath of the earthquake.

Murphy received the Medal of Honor for valor demonstrated at the age of 19 for single-handedly holding off an entire company of German soldiers for an hour at the Colmar Pocket in France in January 1945, then leading a successful counterattack while wounded and out of ammunition. Murphy was born into a large sharecropper family in Hunt County, Texas. His father abandoned them, and his mother died when he was a teenager. Murphy left school in fifth grade to pick cotton and find other work to help support his family; his skill with a hunting rifle was a necessity for putting food on the table.\\r\\nAfter the attack on Pearl Harbor, Murphy's older sister helped him to falsify documentation about his birthdate to meet the minimum-age requirement for enlisting in the military. Turned down by the Navy and the Marine Corps, he enlisted in the Army. He first saw action in the 1943 Allied invasion of Sicily; then in 1944 he participated in the Battle of Anzio, the liberation of Rome, and the invasion of southern France. Murphy fought at Montlimar, and led his men on a successful assault at the L'Omet quarry near Cleurie in northeastern France in October.\\r\\nAfter the war, Murphy enjoyed a 21-year acting career. He played himself in the 1955 autobiographical film To Hell and Back, based on his 1949 memoirs of the same name, but most of his roles were in westerns. He made guest appearances on celebrity television shows and starred in the series Whispering Smith. Murphy was a fairly accomplished songwriter. He bred quarter horses in California and Arizona, and became a regular participant in horse racing.\\r\\nSuffering from what would today be described as post traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), Murphy slept with a loaded handgun under his pillow. He looked for solace in addictive sleeping pills. In his last few years, he was plagued by money problems but refused offers to appear in alcohol and cigarette commercials because he did not want to set a bad example. Murphy died in a plane crash in Virginia in 1971, which was shortly before his 46th birthday. He was interred with full military honors at Arlington National Cemetery. His grave is one of the most visited sites in the cemetery.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nMurphy was the seventh of twelve children born to Emmett Berry Murphy and his wife Josie Bell Killian in Kingston, Texas.[ALM 1] The Murphys were sharecroppers of Irish descent.[7]\\r\\nAs a child, Murphy was a loner with mood swings and an explosive temper.[8] He grew up in Texas, around Farmersville, Greenville, and Celeste, where he attended elementary school.[9] His father drifted in and out of the family's life and eventually deserted them. Murphy dropped out of school in fifth grade and got a job picking cotton for a dollar a day (equivalent to $18 in 2017) to help support his family; he also became skilled with a rifle, hunting small game to help feed them. After his mother died of endocarditis and pneumonia[10] in 1941, he worked at a radio repair shop and at a combination general store, garage and gas station in Greenville.[11] Hunt County authorities placed his three youngest siblings in Boles Children's Home,[12] a Christian orphanage in Quinlan. After the war, he bought a house in Farmersville for his eldest sister Corinne and her husband, Poland Burns. His other siblings briefly shared the home.[13]\\r\\nThe loss of his mother stayed with Murphy throughout his life. He later stated:\\r\\nShe died when I was sixteen. She had the most beautiful hair I've ever seen. It reached almost to the floor. She rarely talked; and always seemed to be searching for something. What it was I don't know. We didn't discuss our feelings. But when she passed away, she took something of me with her. It seems I've been searching for it ever since.[14]\\r\\nMurphy had always wanted to be a soldier. After the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor in December 1941, he tried to enlist,[11] but the Army, Navy and Marine Corps all turned him down for being underweight and underage. After his sister provided an affidavit that falsified his birth date by a year, he was accepted by the U.S. Army on 30 June 1942.[ALM 1][ALM 2] After basic training at Camp Wolters,[20] he was sent to Fort Meade for advanced infantry training.[21] During basic training, he earned the Marksman Badge with Rifle Component Bar and Expert Badge with Bayonet Component Bar.[22]\\r\\nMurphy was shipped to Casablanca in French Morocco on 20 February 1943. He was assigned to Company B, 1st Battalion, 15th Infantry Regiment, 3rd Infantry Division, which trained under the command of Major General Lucian Truscott.[23][24] He participated as a platoon messenger with his division at Arzew in Algeria in rigorous training for the Allied assault landings in Sicily.[25] He was promoted to private first class on 7 May and corporal on 15 July.[26][27]\\r\\nWhen the 3rd Infantry landed at Licata, Sicily, on 10 July, Murphy was a division runner.[28][29] On a scouting patrol, he killed two fleeing Italian officers near Canicatt.[30] Sidelined with illness for a week when Company B arrived in Palermo on 20 July,[31] he rejoined them when they were assigned to a hillside location protecting a machine-gun emplacement, while the rest of the 3rd Infantry Division fought at San Fratello en route to the Allied capture of the transit port of Messina.[32]\\r\\nMurphy participated in the September 1943 mainland Salerno landing at Battipaglia.[33] While on a scouting party along the Volturno River, he and two other soldiers were ambushed; German machine gun fire killed one soldier. Murphy and the other survivor responded by killing five Germans with hand grenades and machine gun fire.[34] While taking part in the October Allied assault on the Volturno Line,[33][35] near Mignano Monte Lungo Hill 193, he and his company repelled an attack by seven German soldiers, killing three and taking four prisoner.[36] Murphy was promoted to sergeant on 13 December.[37]\\r\\nIn January 1944, Murphy was promoted to staff sergeant.[37] He was hospitalized in Naples with malaria on 21 January and was unable to participate in the initial landing at the Anzio beachhead.[38] He returned on 29 January and participated in the First Battle of Cisterna,[39][40] and was made a platoon sergeant in Company B following the battle.[41] He returned with the 3rd Division to Anzio, where they remained for months.[42] Taking shelter from the weather in an abandoned farmhouse on 2 March, Murphy and his platoon killed the crew of a passing German tank.[43] He then crawled out alone close enough to destroy the tank with rifle grenades, for which he received the Bronze Star with \\"V\\" Device.[44][45]\\r\\nMurphy continued to make scouting patrols to take German prisoners before being hospitalized for a week on 13 March with a second bout of malaria. Sixty-one infantry officers and enlisted men of Company B, 15th Infantry, including Murphy, were awarded the Combat Infantryman Badge on 8 May.[46]\\r\\nMurphy was awarded a Bronze Oak Leaf Cluster for his Bronze Star.[47][48] American forces liberated Rome on 4 June, and Murphy remained bivouacked in Rome with his platoon throughout July.[49]\\r\\nDuring the first wave of the Allied invasion of southern France, Murphy received the Distinguished Service Cross[50][51] for action taken on 15 August 1944.[52]\\r\\nAfter landing on Yellow Beach near Ramatuelle,[53] Murphy's platoon was making its way through a vineyard when the men were attacked by German soldiers. He retrieved a machine gun that had been detached from the squad and returned fire at the German soldiers, killing two and wounding one.[53] Two Germans exited a house about 100 yards (91?m) away and appeared to surrender; when Murphy's best friend responded, they shot and killed him. Murphy advanced alone on the house under direct fire. He killed six, wounded two and took 11 prisoner.[53]\\r\\nMurphy was with the 1st Battalion, 15th Infantry Regiment during the 27ÿ28 August offensive at Montlimar that secured the area from the Germans.[52][54] Along with the other soldiers who took part in the action, he received the Presidential Unit Citation.[55]\\r\\nMurphy's first Purple Heart was for a heel wound received in a mortar shell blast on 15 September 1944 in northeastern France.[56][57][58] His first Silver Star came after he killed four and wounded three at a German machine gun position on 2 October at L'Omet quarry in the Cleurie river valley.[50] Three days later, Murphy crawled alone towards the Germans at L'Omet, carrying an SCR-536 radio and directing his men for an hour while the Germans fired directly at him. When his men finally took the hill, 15 Germans had been killed and 35 wounded. Murphy's actions earned him a Bronze Oak Leaf Cluster for his Silver Star.[59] He was awarded a battlefield commission to second lieutenant on 14 October, which elevated him to platoon leader.[60] While en route to Brouvelieures on 26 October, the 3rd Platoon of Company B was attacked by a German sniper group. Murphy captured two before being shot in the hip by a sniper; he returned fire and shot the sniper between the eyes. At the 3rd General Hospital at Aix-en-Provence,[61] the removal of gangrene from the wound caused partial loss of his hip muscle and kept him out of combat until January.[50] Murphy received his first Bronze Oak Leaf Cluster for his Purple Heart for this injury.[62][63]\\r\\nThe Colmar Pocket, 850 square miles (2,200?km2) in the Vosges Mountains, had been held by German troops since November 1944.[64] On 14 January 1945, Murphy rejoined his platoon, which had been moved to the Colmar area in December.[65] He moved with the 3rd Division on 24 January to the town of Holtzwihr, where they faced a strong German counterattack.[66] He was wounded in both legs, for which he received a second Bronze Oak Leaf Cluster for his Purple Heart.[67] As the company awaited reinforcements on 26 January, he was made commander of Company B.[68]\\r\\nThe Germans scored a direct hit on an M10 tank destroyer, setting it alight, forcing the crew to abandon it.[69] Murphy ordered his men to retreat to positions in the woods, remaining alone at his post, shooting his M1 carbine and directing artillery fire via his field radio while the Germans aimed fire directly at his position.[70] Murphy mounted the abandoned, burning tank destroyer and began firing its .50 caliber machine gun at the advancing Germans, killing a squad crawling through a ditch towards him.[71] For an hour, Murphy stood on the flaming tank destroyer returning German fire from foot soldiers and advancing tanks, killing or wounding 50 Germans. He sustained a leg wound during his stand, and stopped only after he ran out of ammunition. Murphy rejoined his men, disregarding his own injury, and led them back to repel the Germans. He insisted on remaining with his men while his wounds were treated.[69]\\r\\nFor his actions that day, he was awarded the Medal of Honor.[72] The 3rd Infantry Division was awarded the Presidential Unit Citation for its actions at the Colmar Pocket, giving Murphy a Bronze Oak Leaf Cluster for the emblem.[73]\\r\\nOn 16 February, Murphy was promoted to first lieutenant[74] and was awarded the Legion of Merit for his service from 22 January 1944 to 18 February 1945.[75] He was moved from the front lines to Regimental Headquarters and made a liaison officer.[76]\\r\\nThe United States additionally honored Murphy's war contributions with the American Campaign Medal,[77] the EuropeanÿAfricanÿMiddle Eastern Campaign Medal with arrowhead device and 9 campaign stars, the World War II Victory Medal,[77] and the Army of Occupation Medal with Germany Clasp.[45][77] France recognized his service with the French Legion of Honor ÿ Grade of Chevalier,[78] the French Croix de guerre with Silver Star,[79] the French Croix de guerre with Palm,[80] the French Liberation Medal[45][77] and the French Fourragre in Colors of the Croix de guerre,[45] which was authorized for all members of the 3rd Infantry Division who fought in France during World War II. Belgium awarded Murphy the Belgian Croix de guerre with 1940 Palm.[80]\\r\\nBrigadier General Ralph B. Lovett and Lieutenant Colonel Hallet D. Edson recommended Murphy for the Medal of Honor.[81][82] Near Salzburg, Austria on 2 June 1945,[83] Lieutenant General A.M. Patch[15] presented Murphy with the Medal of Honor and Legion of Merit for his actions at Holtzwihr. When asked after the war why he had seized the machine gun and taken on an entire company of German infantry, he replied, \\"They were killing my friends.\\"[84]\\r\\nMurphy received every U.S. military combat award for valor available from the U.S. Army for his World War II service.[ALM 3]\\r\\nInquiries were made through official channels about the prospect of Murphy attending West Point upon his return to the United States, but he never enrolled.[6][87] According to author Don Graham, Murphy suggested the idea and then dropped it, possibly when he realized the extent of academic preparation needed to pass the entrance exam.[88]\\r\\nMurphy was one of several military personnel who received orders on 8 June 1945 to report to Fort Sam Houston in San Antonio, Texas, for temporary duty and reassignment.[6][87] Upon arrival on 13 June, he was one of four assigned to Fort Sam Houston Army Ground & Services Redistribution Station and sent home for 30 days of recuperation, with permission to travel anywhere within the United States during that period.[6] While on leave, Murphy was feted with parades, banquets, and speeches.[89] He received a belated Good Conduct Medal on 21 August.[90]\\r\\nHe was discharged with the rank of first lieutenant at a 50 percent disability classification on 21 September and transferred to the Officers' Reserve Corps.[ALM 4]\\r\\nSince his military service, Murphy had been plagued with insomnia and bouts of depression, and he slept with a loaded pistol under his pillow.[92][93] A post-service medical examination on 17 June 1947 revealed symptoms of headaches, vomiting, and nightmares about the war. His medical records indicated that he took sleeping pills to help prevent nightmares.[94] During the mid-1960s, he recognized his dependence on Placidyl, and locked himself alone in a hotel room for a week to successfully break the addiction.[15] Post-traumatic stress levels exacerbated his innate moodiness,[8] and surfaced in episodes that friends and professional colleagues found alarming.[95] His first wife, Dixie Wanda Hendrix, claimed he once held her at gunpoint.[96] She witnessed her husband being guilt-ridden and tearful over newsreel footage of German war orphans.[97] Murphy briefly found a creative stress outlet in writing poetry after his Army discharge. His poem \\"The Crosses Grow on Anzio\\" appeared in his book To Hell and Back,[98] but was attributed to the fictitious character Kerrigan.[99]\\r\\nIn an effort to draw attention to the problems of returning Korean War and Vietnam War veterans, Murphy spoke out candidly about his own problems with posttraumatic stress disorder.[100] It was known during Murphy's lifetime as \\"battle fatigue\\" and \\"shell shock\\", terminology that dated back to World War I. He called on the government to give increased consideration and study to the emotional impact of combat experiences, and to extend health care benefits to war veterans.[101][102]\\r\\nAs a result of legislation introduced by U.S. Congressman Olin Teague five months after Murphy's death in 1971, the Audie L. Murphy Memorial VA Hospital[103] in San Antonio, now a part of the South Texas Veterans Health Care System, was dedicated in 1973.[104][105]\\r\\nAt the end of World War II, the 36th Infantry Division reverted to state control as part of the Texas Army National Guard,[106] and Murphy's friends, Major General H. Miller Ainsworth and Brigadier General Carl L. Phinney, were the 36th's commander and deputy commander respectively. After the 25 June 1950 commencement of the Korean War, Murphy began a second military career and was commissioned as a captain in the 36th Infantry Division of the Texas Army National Guard.[107][108] He drilled new recruits in the summer training camps, and granted the Guard permission to use his name and image in recruiting materials.[109] Although he wanted to join the fighting and juggled training activities with his film career, the 36th Infantry Division was never sent to Korea.[110][111]\\r\\nAt his request, he transferred to inactive status on 1 October 1951 because of his film commitments with MGM Studios, and returned to active status in 1955. Murphy was promoted to the rank of major by the Texas Army National Guard in 1956 and returned to inactive status in 1957.[112] In 1969, his official separation from the Guard transferred him to the United States Army Reserve.[113] He remained with the USAR until his transfer to the Retired Reserve in 1969.[114]\\r\\nThroughout an acting career spanning from 1948 to 1969, Murphy made more than 40 feature films and one television series.[ALM 5] When actor and producer James Cagney saw the 16 July 1945 issue of Life magazine depicting Murphy as the \\"most decorated soldier\\",[86] he brought him to Hollywood. Cagney and his brother William signed him as a contract player for their production company and gave him training in acting, voice and dance. They never cast Murphy in a movie and a personal disagreement ended the association in 1947.[116] Murphy later worked with acting coach Estelle Harman, and honed his diction by reciting dialogue from William Shakespeare and William Saroyan.[117]\\r\\nMurphy moved into Terry Hunt's Athletic Club in Hollywood where he lived until 1948.[118][119] Hollywood writer David \\"Spec\\" McClure befriended Murphy, collaborating with him on Murphy's 1949 book To Hell and Back.[120] McClure used his connections to get Murphy a $500 (equivalent to $5,000 in 2017) bit part in Texas, Brooklyn and Heaven.[121] The agent of Wanda Hendrix, whom he had been dating since 1946,[122] got him a bit part in the 1948 Alan Ladd film Beyond Glory directed by John Farrow.[123] His 1949 film Bad Boy gave him his first leading role.[124] The film's financial backers refused to bankroll the project unless Murphy was given the lead;[125] thus, Allied Artists put aside their reservations about using an inexperienced actor and gave him the starring role.[126]\\r\\nUniversal Studios signed Murphy to a seven-year studio contract at $2,500 a week (equivalent to $25,400 in 2017).[127][128] His first film for them was as Billy the Kid in The Kid from Texas in 1950. He wrapped up that year making Sierra starring Wanda Hendrix, who by that time had become his wife,[129] and Kansas Raiders as outlaw Jesse James. Universal lent him to MGM in 1951 at a salary of $25,000[130] to play the lead of The Youth[ALM 6] in The Red Badge of Courage, directed by John Huston.[132] Murphy and Huston worked together again in the 1960 film The Unforgiven.[133]\\r\\nThe only film Murphy made in 1952 was The Duel at Silver Creek with director Don Siegel. Murphy worked with Siegel one more time in 1958 for The Gun Runners. In 1953, he starred in Frederick de Cordova's Column South,[134] and played Jim Harvey in Nathan Juran's Tumbleweed, an adaptation of the Kenneth Perkins novel Three Were Renegades.[135][136] Director Nathan Juran also directed Gunsmoke and Drums Across the River.[137] George Marshall directed Murphy in the 1954 Destry, a remake of Destry Rides Again, based on a character created by author Max Brand.[138]\\r\\nAlthough Murphy was initially reluctant to appear as himself in To Hell and Back, the 1955 adaptation of his book directed by Jesse Hibbs, he eventually agreed;[139] it became the biggest hit in the history of Universal Studios at the time.[140][141] To help publicize the release of the film, he made guest appearances on television shows such as What's My Line?,[ALM 7] Toast of the Town,[142] and Colgate Comedy Hour.[ALM 8] The Hibbs-Murphy team proved so successful in To Hell and Back[143] that the two worked together on five subsequent films. The partnership resulted in the 1956 western Walk the Proud Land,[144] and the non-westerns Joe Butterfly[145] and World in My Corner. They worked together for the last time in the 1958 western Ride a Crooked Trail.[146]\\r\\nJoseph L. Mankiewicz hired Murphy to play the titular role[ALM 9] in the 1958 film The Quiet American.[148] Murphy formed a partnership with Harry Joe Brown to make three films, starting with The Guns of Fort Petticoat (1957). The partnership fell into disagreement over the remaining two projects, and Brown filed suit against Murphy.[149]\\r\\nMurphy was featured in three westerns in 1959: he starred opposite Sandra Dee in The Wild and the Innocent,[150] collaborated as an uncredited co-producer with Walter Mirisch on the black and white Cast a Long Shadow, and performed as a hired killer in No Name on the Bullet, a film that was well received by critics.[151] Thelma Ritter was his costar in the 1960 Startime television episode \\"The Man\\".[152] During the early 1960s, Murphy donated his time and otherwise lent his name and image for three episodes of The Big Picture television series produced by the United States Army. He received the 1960 Outstanding Civilian Service Medal for his cooperation in the episode Broken Bridge, which featured his visits to military installations in Germany, Italy, Turkey and the U.S. state of New Mexico to showcase the military's latest weaponry.[153][154]\\r\\nWriter Clair Huffaker wrote the 1961 screenplays for Murphy's films Seven Ways from Sundown and Posse from Hell.[155] Willard W. Willingham and his wife Mary Willingham befriended Murphy in his early days in Hollywood and worked with him on a number of projects.[156][157][158]\\r\\nWillard was a producer on Murphy's 1961 television series Whispering Smith,[159] and co-wrote the screenplay for Battle at Bloody Beach that year.[160] He collaborated on Bullet for a Badman[161] in 1964 and Arizona Raiders in 1965.[162] The Willinghams as a team wrote the screenplay for Gunpoint[163] as well as the script for Murphy's last starring lead in the western 40 Guns to Apache Pass in 1967.[164] Murphy made Trunk to Cairo in Israel in 1966.[165]\\r\\nHe first met director Budd Boetticher when Murphy requested to be his boxing partner at Terry Hunt's Athletic Club.[166] He subsequently appeared in the 1951 title role of Boetticher's first western The Cimarron Kid.[167] Boetticher wrote the script in 1969 for Murphy's last film, A Time for Dying.[168] Two other projects that Murphy and Boetticher planned to collaborate on?ÿ A Horse for Mr Barnum and When There's Sumpthin' to Do?ÿ never came to fruition.[169]\\r\\nMurphy married actress Wanda Hendrix in 1949.[170] Their divorce became final two years later in 1951.[171] Four days later, he married former airline stewardess Pamela Opal Lee Archer (October 7, 1923 - April 8, 2010), with whom[172] he had two sons: Terry Michael (born 14 March 1952),[173][174] and James Shannon (born 1954).[175]\\r\\nMurphy bred quarter horses at the Audie Murphy Ranch in what is now Menifee, California, and the Murphy Ranch in Pima County, Arizona.[ALM 10] His horses raced at the Del Mar Racetrack, and he invested large sums of money in the hobby.[178] Murphy's gambling left his finances in a poor state. In 1968 he stated that he lost $260,000 in an Algerian oil deal and was dealing with the Internal Revenue Service over unpaid taxes.[179] In spite of his financial difficulties, Murphy refused to appear in commercials for alcohol and cigarettes, mindful of the influence he would have on the youth market.[180]\\r\\nOn 28 May 1971, Murphy was killed when the private plane in which he was a passenger crashed into Brush Mountain, near Catawba, Virginia, 20 miles (32?km) west of Roanoke in conditions of rain, clouds, fog and zero visibility.[181] The pilot and four other passengers were also killed.[182]\\r\\nThe aircraft was a twin-engine Aero Commander 680 flown by a pilot who had a private-pilot license and a reported 8,000 hours of flying time, but who held no instrument rating. The aircraft was recovered on 31 May.[183] After her husband's death, Pamela Murphy moved into a small apartment and got a clerk position at the Sepulveda Veterans Administration Hospital in Los Angeles, where she remained employed for 35 years.[184]\\r\\nIn 1975, a court awarded Murphy's widow and two children $2.5 million in damages because of the accident.[185]\\r\\nOn 7 June 1971, Murphy was buried with full military honors at Arlington National Cemetery.[186] In attendance were Ambassador to the U.N. George H.W. Bush, Army Chief of Staff William Westmoreland, and many of the 3rd Infantry Division.[187] Murphy's gravesite is in Section 46, headstone number 46-366-11, located across Memorial Drive from the Amphitheater. A special flagstone walkway was later constructed to accommodate the large number of people who visit to pay their respects. It is the cemetery's second most-visited gravesite, after that of President John F. Kennedy.[188]\\r\\nThe headstones of Medal of Honor recipients buried at Arlington National Cemetery are normally decorated in gold leaf. Murphy previously requested that his stone remain plain and inconspicuous, like that of an ordinary soldier.[189] The headstone contains the birth year 1924, based upon purportedly falsified materials among his military records.[190] In 1974, a large granite marker was erected just off the Appalachian Trail at 372152N 801333W? / ?37.364554N 80.225748W? / 37.364554; -80.225748? (Audie Murphy monument) at 3,100 elevation, near the crash site.[191]\\r\\nCivilian honors were bestowed on Murphy during his lifetime and posthumously, including a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame.[192] In 2013, Murphy was honored by his home state with the Texas Legislative Medal of Honor.[ALM 11]\\r\\nSwedish power metal band Sabaton wrote a song on their 2014 studio album, Heroes, also entitled \\"To Hell and Back\\", commemorating and recognizing Audie Murphy as one of the most decorated American veterans of World War II.[197]\\r\\nDavid McClure, his collaborator on the book To Hell and Back, discovered Murphy's talent for poetry during their work on the memoir when he found discarded verses in Murphy's Hollywood apartment. One of those poems, \\"The Crosses Grow on Anzio\\", appears in To Hell and Back attributed to a soldier named Kerrigan. Only two others survived, \\"Alone and Far Removed\\" and \\"Freedom Flies in Your Heart Like an Eagle\\". The latter was part of a speech Murphy had written at a 1968 dedication of the Alabama War Memorial in Montgomery, and later set to music by Scott Turner under the title \\"Dusty Old Helmet\\".[198]\\r\\nMurphy was a fan of country music, in particular Bob Wills and Chet Atkins, but was not a singer or musician himself.[199] Through his friend Guy Mitchell, Murphy was introduced to songwriter Scott Turner in 1961.[200][201] The two collaborated on numerous songs between 1962 and 1970, the most successful of which was \\"Shutters and Boards\\" and \\"When the Wind Blows in Chicago\\".[202]","input":"Who was the most decorated soldier of world war 2?"},{"output":"more than 2,000 restaurants, mainly in the United States","context":"Chick-fil-A (/t??kf??le?/ chik-fil-AY, a play on the American English pronunciation of \\"fillet\\") is an American fast food restaurant chain headquartered in the Atlanta district of College Park, Georgia, specializing in chicken sandwiches.[3][4] Founded in May 1946, it has more than 2,000 restaurants, mainly in the United States.\\r\\nThe company's culture is influenced by its founder, Truett Cathy's, Southern Baptist beliefs;[5] all Chick-fil-A restaurants are closed for business on Sunday as well as Thanksgiving and Christmas.[5]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe chain's origin can be traced to the Dwarf Grill (now the Dwarf House), a restaurant opened by S. Truett Cathy, the chain's former chairman and CEO, in 1946. The restaurant is located in Hapeville, Georgia, a suburb of Atlanta,[3] and is near the location of the now-demolished Ford Motor Company Atlanta Assembly Plant, for many years a source of many of the restaurant's patrons.\\r\\nIn 1961, after 15 years in the fast food business, Cathy found a pressure-fryer that could cook the chicken sandwich in the same amount of time it took to cook a fast-food hamburger.[6] Following this discovery, he registered the name Chick-fil-A, Inc. The company's trademarked slogan, \\"We Didn't Invent the Chicken, Just the Chicken Sandwich,\\"[7] refers to their flagship menu item, the Chick-fil-A chicken sandwich.\\r\\nThe first Chick-fil-A opened in 1967, in the food court of the Greenbriar Mall, in a suburb of Atlanta.[3] During the 1970s and early 1980s, the chain expanded by opening new franchises in suburban malls' food courts.[8] The first freestanding franchise was opened April 16, 1986, on North Druid Hills Road in Atlanta, Georgia,[9] and the company began to focus more on this type of franchise than on the food court type. Although it has expanded outward from its original geographic base, most new restaurants are located in Southern suburban areas.[3] In October 2015, the company opened a three-story 5,000-square-foot restaurant in Manhattan that became the largest free-standing Chick-fil-A in the country at that time.[10][11] As of 2016, the chain has approximately 1,950 locations.[3] It also has 31 drive-through-only locations.[3] Chick-fil-A also can be found at universities, hospitals, and airports through licensing agreements.[3]\\r\\nSince 1997, the Atlanta-based company has been the title sponsor of the Peach Bowl, an annual college football bowl game played in Atlanta on New Year's Eve. Chick-fil-A also is a key sponsor of the SEC and the ACC of college athletics.[12][13]\\r\\nThe company expanded for the first time outside of the United States by opening an outlet at the Calgary International Airport in Calgary, Alberta, Canada in May 2014.[14][15] This restaurant is located near the departure area for flights bound for the United States.[14] However, per tradition, it is closed Sundays and Christmas Day.\\r\\nChick-fil-A retains ownership of each restaurant. Chick-fil-A selects the restaurant location and builds it.[16] Chick-fil-A franchisees need only a $10,000 initial investment to become an operator.[17] Since 2010, Chick-fil-A has led the fast food industry in average sales per restaurant, despite being open only six days a week,[18] earning an average $4.8 million per restaurant in 2016 (Whataburger was second with $2.7 million per restaurant).[19]\\r\\n\\"Eat Mor Chikin\\" is the chain's most prominent advertising slogan, created by The Richards Group in 1995. The slogan is often seen in advertisements, featuring Holstein dairy cows[20] that are often seen wearing (or holding) signs that (usually) read: \\"Eat Mor Chikin\\" in all capital letters. The ad campaign was temporarily halted during a mad cow disease scare on January 1, 2004, so as not to make the chain seem insensitive or appear to be taking advantage of the scare to increase its sales. Two months later, the cows were put up again. The cows replaced the chain's old mascot, Doodles, an anthropomorphized chicken who still appears as the C on the logo.[21]\\r\\nChick-fil-A vigorously protects its intellectual property, sending cease and desist letters to those they think have infringed on their trademarks.[22] The corporation has successfully protested at least 30 instances of the use of an \\"eat more\\" phrase, saying that the use would cause confusion of the public, dilute the distinctiveness of their intellectual property, and diminish its value.[23]\\r\\nA 2011 letter to Vermont artist Bo Muller-Moore who screen prints T-shirts reading: \\"Eat More Kale\\" demanded that he cease printing the shirts and turn over his website.[24] The incident drew criticism from Vermont governor Peter Shumlin, and has created backlash against what he termed Chick-fil-A's \\"corporate bullying.\\"[25] On December 11, 2014, Bo Muller-Moore announced that the U.S. Patent Office granted his application to trademark his \\"Eat More Kale\\" phrase. A formal announcement of his victory took place on December 12, 2014, with Shumlin and other supporters on the Statehouse steps. His public fight drew regional and national attention, the support of Shumlin, and a team of pro-bono law students from the University of New Hampshire legal clinic.[26]\\r\\nAfter 22 years with The Richards Group, Chick-fil-A switched to McCann New York in 2016. Along with the cows, ads included famous people in history in a campaign called \\"Chicken for Breakfast. It's not as crazy as you think.\\"[27]\\r\\nTruett Cathy opened his first restaurant, The Dwarf Grill?ÿ later renamed the Dwarf House?ÿ in Hapeville, Georgia, in 1946, and developed the pressure-cooked chicken breast sandwich there.[3] At the original Chick-fil-A Dwarf Grill, in addition to the full-size entrances, there is also an extra small-sized front door.[30] The original Dwarf House in Hapeville, Georgia is open 24 hours a day, six days a week, except on Sundays, Thanksgiving, and Christmas. The store closes at 10:00?p.m. on Saturday nights, and the day before Thanksgiving and Christmas and reopens at 6?a.m. on Monday mornings and day after Thanksgiving and Christmas. It has a larger dine-in menu than the other Dwarf House locations as well as an animated seven dwarfs display in the back of the restaurant.[30] It was across the street from the former Ford Motor Company factory called Atlanta Assembly.\\r\\nTruett's original, full-service restaurants offer a substantial menu and provide customers a choice of table service, walk-up counter service or a drive-thru window. As of 2012[update], 13 Chick-fil-A Dwarf House restaurants were operating in the metro Atlanta area.[3]\\r\\nIn 1996, the first Truett's Grill was opened in Morrow, Georgia. The second location opened in 2003 in McDonough, Georgia, and a third location opened in 2006 in Griffin, Georgia.[31] Similar to the Chick-fil-A Dwarf Houses, these independently owned restaurants offer traditional, sit-down dining and expanded menu selections in a diner-themed dinner. [32][33][34] In 2017, Chick-fil-A demolished several Dwarf House locations to replace them with Truett's Grill locations.[35][36] Note to editors there was actually a Truetts grill or maybe they called it a drawf house that opened up in Riverdale GA near the Krystal's on the main highway (111?) in 1988 or 1987.\\r\\nS. Truett Cathy was a devout Southern Baptist; his religious beliefs had a major impact on the company.[37] The company's official statement of corporate purpose says that the business exists \\"To glorify God by being a faithful steward of all that is entrusted to us. To have a positive influence on all who come in contact with Chick-fil-A.\\"[38]\\r\\nCathy's beliefs are also responsible for one of the chain's distinctive features: all Chick-fil-A locations (corporate owned and franchised) are closed on Sundays,[39] as well as on Thanksgiving and Christmas.[40] Cathy states as the final step in his Five-Step recipe for Business Success \\"I was not so committed to financial success that I was willing to abandon my principles and priorities. One of the most visible examples of this is our decision to close on Sunday. Our decision to close on Sunday was our way of honoring God and of directing our attention to things that mattered more than our business.\\"[41]\\r\\nIn an interview with ABC News's Nightline, Truett's son Dan T. Cathy told reporter Vicki Mabrey that the company is also closed on Sundays because \\"by the time Sunday came, he was just worn out. And Sunday was not a big trading day, anyway, at the time. So he was closed that first Sunday and we've been closed ever since. He figured if he didn't like working on Sundays, that other people didn't either.\\" The younger Cathy also quoted his father as saying, \\"I don't want to ask people to do that what I am not willing to do myself.\\"[42]\\r\\nTheir website states, \\"The Chick-fil-A culture and service tradition in our Restaurants is to treat every person with honor, dignity and respect ÿregardless of their belief, race, creed, sexual orientation or gender.\\"[43]\\r\\nChick-fil-A's reputation on being closed on Sundays extends to non-traditional locations. In addition to countless shopping malls and airports, a Chick-fil-A location at Mercedes-Benz Stadium in Atlanta will be closed on Sundays despite its main tenant, the Atlanta Falcons, playing most of their home games on Sundays. The location will be open when the Falcons have a Monday night or Thursday night home game, as well as non-Sunday home games of Atlanta United FC and other events at the stadium. On Sundays, the digital signs will be flipped and concessionaire Levy Restaurants will sell nonbranded food and drinks at the location.[44]\\r\\nIn January 2011, the media reported that Chick-fil-A was co-sponsoring a marriage conference with the Pennsylvania Family Institute (PFI), an organization that has opposed same-sex marriage legislation.[45][46][47][48][49] Chick-fil-A clarified that \\"one of our independent Restaurant Operators in Pennsylvania was asked to provide sandwiches to two Art of Marriage video seminars\\".[50] The WinShape Foundation, a charitable organization founded by Truett and his wife, also stated that it would not allow same-sex couples to participate in its marriage retreats.[51]\\r\\nChick-fil-A has donated over $5?million, via WinShape, to groups that oppose same-sex marriage. Of this, more than $3?million was donated primarily to Christian organizations whose agendas included positions that oppose same-sex marriage,[52] with the money donated between 2003 and 2009.[53][54][55][56][57][58][59][60] A total of $1.9?million was donated in 2010 to groups such as the Marriage & Family Foundation, Exodus International, and the Family Research Council (FRC).[61] That year, the FRC, which received $1,000[53][54][55][56][57][58][59][60] was listed as an anti-gay[62] hate group by the Southern Poverty Law Center.[63][64][65] WinShape has also contributed to Christian groups including the Fellowship of Christian Athletes and Exodus International, the latter is noted for supporting ex-gay conversion therapy.[61] In response, students at several colleges and universities worked to ban or remove the company's restaurants from their campuses. On January 28, 2013, Shane L. Windmeyer, the leader of Campus Pride, suspended their campaign.[66][67][68]\\r\\nIn June and July 2012, Chick-fil-A's chief operating officer Dan T. Cathy made several public statements about same-sex marriage, saying that those who \\"have the audacity to define what marriage is about\\" were \\"inviting God's judgment on our nation\\".[69][70][71][72][73] Several prominent politicians expressed disapproval.[74] Boston Mayor Thomas Menino and Chicago Alderman Proco \\"Joe\\" Moreno said they hoped to block franchise expansion into their areas.[75][76][77] The proposed bans drew criticism from liberal pundits, legal experts, and the American Civil Liberties Union.[78][79][80] The Jim Henson Company, which had a Pajanimals kids' meal toy licensing arrangement with Chick-fil-A, said it would cease its business relationship, and donate the payment to the Gay & Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation.[81][82][83] Chick-fil-A stopped distributing the toys, citing unrelated safety concerns that had arisen prior to the controversy.[84] Chick-fil-A released a statement on July 31, 2012, saying, \\"We are a restaurant company focused on food, service, and hospitality; our intent is to leave the policy debate over same-sex marriage to the government and political arena.\\"[85]\\r\\nIn response to the controversy, former Arkansas Governor Mike Huckabee initiated a Chick-fil-A Appreciation Day movement to counter a boycott of Chick-fil-A launched by same-sex marriage activists.[86][87][88] More than 600,000 people RSVPed on Facebook for Huckabee's appreciation event.[87] On August 1, Chick-fil-A restaurants experienced a large show of public support across the nation with the company reporting record-breaking sales.[86][87][88] A consulting firm estimated that the average Chick-fil-A restaurant had 29.9 percent more sales and 367 more customers than it did on a typical Wednesday.[17]\\r\\nIn September 2012, The Civil Rights Agenda (TCRA) announced that Chick-fil-A had \\"ceased donating to organizations that promote discrimination, specifically against LGBT civil rights.\\" Chick-fil-A officials did state in an internal document that they \\"will treat every person equally, regardless of sexual orientation.\\"[89] In a letter from Chick-fil-A's Senior Director of Real Estate, the company states, \\"The WinShape Foundation is now taking a much closer look at the organizations it considers helping, and in that process will remain true to its stated philosophy of not supporting organizations with political agendas.\\"[90][91]\\r\\nAccording to Chicago Alderman Proco \\"Joe\\" Moreno, Chick-fil-A has a statement of respect for all people regardless of sexual orientation in an internal document called Chick-fil-A: Who We Are. A document released by Chick-fil-A on September 20, 2012, does not mention any organizations opposed to same-sex marriage as being part of Chick-fil-A's donation base. WinShape Marriage will continue to be supported financially, with a stated focus on couple retreats to strengthen marriages.[92]\\r\\nAccording to Focus on the Family's website, CitizenLink.com, \\"Chick-fil-A and its charitable-giving arm, the WinShape Foundation, did not agree to stop making donations to groups that support the Biblical definition of marriage in exchange for being allowed to open a franchise in Chicago.\\"[93] Mike Huckabee stated that he \\"talked earlier today personally with Dan Cathy, CEO of Chick Fil-A about the new reports that Chick Fil-A had capitulated to demands of the supporters of same sex marriage. This is not true. The company continues to focus on the fair treatment of all of its customers and employees, but to end confusion gave me this statement.\\" The statement provided by Chick-fil-A was posted on Huckabee's website.[94][95]\\r\\nThough Chick-fil-A has always used trans-fat free processes in its chicken sandwiches, anticipating the dietary concerns of consumers, in 2008, it became the first fast-food restaurant to become completely trans-fat free.[96]\\r\\nIn 2011, food blogger and activist Vani Hari wrote a post titled \\"Chick-fil-A or Chemical Fil-A?\\" on her website, FoodBabe.com. She noted that Chick-fil-A sandwiches contained nearly 100 ingredients, including peanut oil with TBHQ.[97] In October 2012, Chick-fil-A invited Hari to meet with company executives at its Atlanta, GA headquarters.[98] In December 2013, Chick-fil-A notified Hari that it had eliminated the dye Yellow No. 5 and had reduced the sodium content in its chicken soup. The company also said that it is testing a peanut oil that does not contain TBHQ and that it would start testing sauces and dressings made without high-fructose corn syrup in 2014.[98]\\r\\nAccording to the Food and Drug Administration, antibiotics used in livestock, many of which are also used to treat humans, have contributed to the rise of dangerous bacteria.

It is a large active stratovolcano located 54 miles (87?km) south-southeast of Seattle, in the Mount Rainier National Park. It is the most topographically prominent mountain in the contiguous United States and the Cascade Volcanic Arc, with a summit elevation of 14,411?ft (4,392?m).[4][5]\\r\\nMt. Rainier is considered one of the most dangerous volcanoes in the world, and it is on the Decade Volcano list.[6] Because of its large amount of glacial ice, Mt. Rainier could produce massive lahars that could threaten the entire Puyallup River valley, and poses a grave threat to the southern sections of the 3.7-million-resident Seattle metropolitan area.[7]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nMount Rainier was first known by the local Salishan speakers as Talol, or Tacoma or Tahoma. One hypothesis of the word origin is [t??q?u?b??] (\\"mother of waters\\"), in the Lushootseed language spoken by the Puyallup people.[8] Another hypothesis is that \\"Tacoma\\" means \\"larger than Mount Baker\\" in Lushootseed: \\"Ta\\", larger, plus \\"Koma (Kulshan)\\", Mount Baker.[9] Other names originally used include Tahoma, Tacobeh, and Pooskaus.[10]\\r\\nThe current name was given by George Vancouver, who named it in honor of his friend, Rear Admiral Peter Rainier.[11] The map of the Lewis and Clark expedition of 1804-1806 refers to it as \\"Mt. Regniere\\".\\r\\nAlthough \\"Rainier\\" had been considered the official name of the mountain, Theodore Winthrop, in his posthumously published 1862 travel book The Canoe and the Saddle, referred to the mountain as \\"Tacoma\\" and for a time, both names were used interchangeably, although \\"Mt. Tacoma\\" was preferred in the city of Tacoma.[12][13]\\r\\nIn 1890, the United States Board on Geographic Names declared that the mountain would be known as \\"Rainier\\".[14] Following this in 1897, the Pacific Forest Reserve became the Mount Rainier Forest Reserve, and the national park was established three years later. Despite this, there was still a movement to change the mountain's name to \\"Tacoma\\" and Congress was still considering a resolution to change the name as late as 1924.[15][16]\\r\\nIn the lead up to Super Bowl XLVIII, the Washington State Senate passed a resolution on Friday, January?31, 2014, temporarily renaming the mountain Mount Seattle Seahawks until the midnight after the Super Bowl, Monday, February?3, 2014,[17] in response to the renaming of 53 mountains in Colorado after the 53 members of the Denver Broncos by Governor of Colorado John Hickenlooper.[18]\\r\\nAfter the 2015 restoration of the original name Denali to Mount McKinley in Alaska, debate over Mount Rainier's name intensified.[19]\\r\\nMount Rainier is the highest mountain in Washington and the Cascade Range. This peak is located just east of Eatonville and just southeast of Seattle and Tacoma.[20] Mount Rainier is ranked third of the 128 ultra-prominent mountain peaks of the United States. Mount Rainier has a topographic prominence of 13,210?ft (4,026?m), which is greater than that of K2, the world's second-tallest mountain, at 13,189?ft (4,020?m).[21] On clear days it dominates the southeastern horizon in most of the Seattle-Tacoma metropolitan area to such an extent that locals sometimes refer to it simply as \\"the Mountain.\\"[22] On days of exceptional clarity, it can also be seen from as far away as Corvallis, Oregon (at Marys Peak) and Victoria, British Columbia.[23]\\r\\nWith 26 major glaciers[24] and 36?sq?mi (93?km2) of permanent snowfields and glaciers,[25] Mount Rainier is the most heavily glaciated peak in the lower 48 states. The summit is topped by two volcanic craters, each more than 1,000?ft (300?m) in diameter, with the larger east crater overlapping the west crater. Geothermal heat from the volcano keeps areas of both crater rims free of snow and ice, and has formed the world's largest volcanic glacier cave network within the ice-filled craters,[26] with nearly 2?mi (3.2?km) of passages.[27] A small crater lake about 130 by 30?ft (39.6 by 9.1?m) in size and 16?ft (5?m) deep, the highest in North America with a surface elevation of 14,203?ft (4,329?m), occupies the lowest portion of the west crater below more than 100?ft (30?m) of ice and is accessible only via the caves.[28][29]\\r\\nThe Carbon, Puyallup, Mowich, Nisqually, and Cowlitz Rivers begin at eponymous glaciers of Mount Rainier. The sources of the White River are Winthrop, Emmons, and Fryingpan Glaciers. The White, Carbon, and Mowich join the Puyallup River, which discharges into Commencement Bay at Tacoma; the Nisqually empties into Puget Sound east of Lacey; and the Cowlitz joins the Columbia River between Kelso and Longview.\\r\\nThe broad top of Mount Rainier contains three named summits. The highest is called the Columbia Crest. The second highest summit is Point Success, 14,158?ft (4,315?m), at the southern edge of the summit plateau, atop the ridge known as Success Cleaver. It has a topographic prominence of about 138?ft (42?m), so it is not considered a separate peak. The lowest of the three summits is Liberty Cap, 14,112?ft (4,301?m), at the northwestern edge, which overlooks Liberty Ridge, the Sunset Amphitheater, and the dramatic Willis Wall. Liberty Cap has a prominence of 492?ft (150?m), and so would qualify as a separate peak under most strictly prominence-based rules. A prominence cutoff of 400?ft (122?m) is commonly used in Washington state.[30]\\r\\nHigh on the eastern flank of Mount Rainier is a peak known as Little Tahoma Peak, 11,138?ft (3,395?m), an eroded remnant of the earlier, much higher, Mount Rainier. It has a prominence of 858?ft (262?m), and it is almost never climbed in direct conjunction with Columbia Crest, so it is usually considered a separate peak. If considered separately from Mt. Rainier, Little Tahoma Peak would be the third highest mountain peak in Washington.[31][32]\\r\\nMount Rainier is a stratovolcano in the Cascade Volcanic Arc that consists of lava flows, debris flows, and pyroclastic ejecta and flows. Its early volcanic deposits are estimated at more than 840,000?years old and are part of the Lily Formation (about 2.9?million to 840,000?years ago). The early deposits formed a \\"proto-Rainier\\" or an ancestral cone prior to the present-day cone.[33] The present cone is more than 500,000?years old.[34]\\r\\nThe volcano is highly eroded, with glaciers on its slopes, and appears to be made mostly of andesite. Rainier likely once stood even higher than today at about 16,000?ft (4,900?m) before a major debris avalanche and the resulting Osceola Mudflow approximately 5,000 years ago.[35] In the past, Rainier has had large debris avalanches, and has also produced enormous lahars (volcanic mudflows) due to the large amount of glacial ice present. Its lahars have reached all the way to Puget Sound, a distance of more than 30?mi (48?km). Around 5,000 years ago, a large chunk of the volcano slid away and that debris avalanche helped to produce the massive Osceola Mudflow, which went all the way to the site of present-day Tacoma and south Seattle.[36] This massive avalanche of rock and ice removed the top 1,600?ft (500?m) of Rainier, bringing its height down to around 14,100?ft (4,300?m). About 530 to 550 years ago, the Electron Mudflow occurred, although this was not as large-scale as the Osceola Mudflow.[37]\\r\\nAfter the major collapse approximately 5,000?years ago, subsequent eruptions of lava and tephra built up the modern summit cone until about as recently as 1,000?years ago. As many as 11 Holocene tephra layers have been found.[33]\\r\\nThe most recent recorded volcanic eruption was between 1820 and 1854, but many eyewitnesses reported eruptive activity in 1858, 1870, 1879, 1882 and 1894 as well.[38]\\r\\nAlthough Mount Rainier is now dormant, as of 2016[update] Seismic monitors have been located in Mount Rainier National Park and on the mountain itself to monitor activity.[39] However, an eruption could be deadly for all living in areas within the immediate vicinity of the volcano and an eruption would also cause trouble from Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada to San Francisco[40] because of the massive amounts of ash blasting out of the volcano into the atmosphere.\\r\\nMount Rainier is located in an area that itself is part of the eastern rim of the Pacific Ring of Fire. This includes mountains and calderas like Mount Shasta and Lassen Peak in California, Crater Lake, Three Sisters, and Mount Hood in Oregon, Mount Saint Helens, Mount Adams, Glacier Peak, and Mount Baker in Washington, and Mount Cayley, Garibaldi, Silverthrone, and Mount Meager in British Columbia. All of the above are dormant, but alive, and scientists on both sides of the border gather research of the past eruptions of each in order to predict how mountains in this arc will behave and what they are capable of in the future, including Mount Rainier.[41][42] Of these, only two have erupted since the beginning of the twentieth century: Lassen in 1915 and St. Helens in 1980 and 2004. However, past eruptions in this volcanic arc have multiple examples of sub-plinian eruptions or higher: Crater Lake's last eruption as Mount Mazama was large enough to cause its cone to implode,[43] and Mt. Rainier's closest neighbor, Mount St. Helens, had a huge chunk of the side of the mountain blow up in a phreatic explosion caused by a mix of gas and water. Where St. Helens was once perfectly symmetrical there is now, thirty five years later, a huge crater at the top of one face. Statistics place the likelihood of a major eruption in this range at 2-3 per century.[44]\\r\\nMount Rainier is currently listed as a Decade Volcano, or one of the 16 volcanoes with the greatest likelihood of causing great loss of life and property if eruptive activity resumes.[45] If Mt. Rainier were to erupt as powerfully as Mount St. Helens did in its May?18, 1980 eruption, the effect would be cumulatively greater, because of the far more massive amounts of glacial ice locked on the volcano compared to Mount St. Helens,[37] the vastly more heavily populated areas surrounding Rainier, and the simple fact that Mt Rainier is a much bigger volcano, almost twice the size of St. Helens.[46] Lahars from Rainier pose the most risk to life and property,[47] as many communities lie atop older lahar deposits. According to the United States Geological Survey (USGS), about 150,000 people live on top of old lahar deposits of Rainier.[7] Not only is there much ice atop the volcano, the volcano is also slowly being weakened by hydrothermal activity. According to Geoff Clayton, a geologist with a Washington State Geology firm, RH2 Engineering, a repeat of the Osceola mudflow would destroy Enumclaw, Orting, Kent, Auburn, Puyallup, Sumner and all of Renton.[36] Such a mudflow might also reach down the Duwamish estuary and destroy parts of downtown Seattle, and cause tsunamis in Puget Sound and Lake Washington.[48] Rainier is also capable of producing pyroclastic flows and expelling lava.[48]\\r\\nAccording to K. Scott, a scientist with the USGS:\\r\\n\\"A home built in any of the probabilistically defined inundation areas on the new maps is more likely to be damaged or destroyed by a lahar than by fire...For example, a home built in an area that would be inundated every 100 years, on the average, is 27 times more likely to be damaged or destroyed by a flow than by fire. People know the danger of fire, so they buy fire insurance and they have smoke alarms, but most people are not aware of the risks of lahars, and few have applicable flood insurance.\\"[49]\\r\\nThe volcanic risk is somewhat mitigated by lahar warning sirens and escape route signs in Pierce County.[50] The more populous King County is also in the lahar area, but currently has no zoning restrictions due to volcanic hazard.[51] More recently (since 2001) funding from the federal government for lahar protection in the area has dried up, leading local authorities in at-risk cities like Orting to fear a disaster similar to the Armero tragedy.[52][53]\\r\\nTypically, up to five earthquakes are recorded monthly near the summit. Swarms of five to ten shallow earthquakes over two or three days take place from time to time, predominantly in the region of 13,000 feet (4?km) below the summit. These earthquakes are thought to be caused by the circulation of hot fluids beneath Mount Rainier. Presumably, hot springs and steam vents within Mount Rainier National Park are generated by such fluids.[54] Seismic swarms (not initiated with a mainshock) are common features at volcanoes, and are rarely associated with eruptive activity. Rainier has had several such swarms; there were days-long swarms in 2002, 2004, and 2007, two of which (2002 and 2004) included M 3.2 earthquakes. A 2009 swarm produced the largest number of events of any swarm at Rainier since seismic monitoring began over two decades earlier.[55] Yet another swarm was observed in 2011.[56]\\r\\nGlaciers are among the most conspicuous and dynamic geologic features on Mount Rainier. They erode the volcanic cone and are important sources of streamflow for several rivers, including some that provide water for hydroelectric power and irrigation. Together with perennial snow patches, the 26 major glaciers cover about 36 square miles (93?km2) of the mountain's surface and have a volume of about 1 cubic mile (4.2?km3).[24][25]\\r\\nGlaciers flow under the influence of gravity by the combined action of sliding over the rock on which they lie and by deformation, the gradual displacement between and within individual ice crystals. Maximum speeds occur near the surface and along the centerline of the glacier. During May 1970, Nisqually Glacier was measured moving as fast as 29 inches (74?cm) per day. Flow rates are generally greater in summer than in winter, probably due to the presence of large quantities of meltwater at the glacier base.[25]\\r\\nThe size of glaciers on Mount Rainier has fluctuated significantly in the past. For example, during the last ice age, from about 25,000 to about 15,000?years ago, glaciers covered most of the area now within the boundaries of Mount Rainier National Park and extended to the perimeter of the present Puget Sound Basin.[25]\\r\\nBetween the 14th?century and 1850, many of the glaciers on Mount Rainier advanced to their farthest extent downvalley since the last ice age. Many advances of this sort occurred worldwide during this time period known to geologists as the Little Ice Age. During the Little Ice Age, the Nisqually Glacier advanced to a position 650 to 800?ft (200 to 240?m) downvalley from the site of the Glacier Bridge, Tahoma and South Tahoma Glaciers merged at the base of Glacier Island, and the terminus of Emmons Glacier reached within 1.2?mi (1.9?km) of the White River Campground.[25]\\r\\nRetreat of the Little Ice Age glaciers was slow until about 1920 when retreat became more rapid. Between the height of the Little Ice Age and 1950, Mount Rainier's glaciers lost about one-quarter of their length. Beginning in 1950 and continuing through the early 1980s, however, many of the major glaciers advanced in response to relatively cooler temperatures of the mid-century. The Carbon, Cowlitz, Emmons, and Nisqually Glaciers advanced during the late 1970s and early 1980s as a result of high snowfalls during the 1960s and 1970s. Since the early-1980s, however, many glaciers have been thinning and retreating and some advances have slowed.[25]\\r\\nThe glaciers on Mount Rainier can generate mudflows, through glacial outburst floods not associated with any eruption. The South Tahoma Glacier generated 30 floods in the 1980s and early 1990s, and again in August, 2015.[57]\\r\\nAt the time of European contact, the river valleys and other areas near the mountain were inhabited by many Pacific Northwest tribes who hunted and gathered berries in its forests and mountain meadows. These included the Nisqually, Cowlitz, Yakama, Puyallup, and Muckleshoot.[citation needed]\\r\\nCaptain George Vancouver reached Puget Sound in early May 1792 and became the first European to see the mountain.[11]\\r\\nIn 1833, Dr. William Fraser Tolmie explored the area looking for medicinal plants. Hazard Stevens and P. B. Van Trump received a hero's welcome in the streets of Olympia after their successful summit climb in 1870.[60][61] The first female ascent was made in 1890 by Fay Fuller, accompanied by Van Trump and three other teammates.[62]\\r\\nJohn Muir climbed Mount Rainier in 1888, and although he enjoyed the view, he conceded that it was best appreciated from below. Muir was one of many who advocated protecting the mountain. In 1893, the area was set aside as part of the Pacific Forest Reserve in order to protect its physical and economic resources, primarily timber and watersheds.[63]\\r\\nCiting the need to also protect scenery and provide for public enjoyment, railroads and local businesses urged the creation of a national park in hopes of increased tourism. On March?2, 1899, President William McKinley established Mount Rainier National Park as America's fifth national park. Congress dedicated the new park \\"for the benefit and enjoyment of the people\\"[64] and?\\"... for the preservation from injury or spoliation of all timber, mineral deposits, natural curiosities, or wonders within said park, and their retention in their natural condition.\\"[65]\\r\\nOn 24 June 1947, Kenneth Arnold reported seeing a formation of nine unidentified flying objects over Mount Rainier. His description led to the term \\"flying saucers\\".[66]\\r\\nIn 1998, the United States Geological Survey began putting together the Mount Rainier Volcano Lahar Warning System to assist in the emergency evacuation of the Puyallup River valley in the event of a catastrophic debris flow. It is now run by the Pierce County Department of Emergency Management. Tacoma, at the mouth of the Puyallup, is only 37?mi (60?km) west of Rainier, and moderately sized towns such as Puyallup and Orting are only 27 and 20?mi (43 and 32?km) away, respectively.[67]\\r\\nMt. Rainier appears on four distinct United States postage stamp issues. In 1934, it was the 3-cent issue in a series of National Park stamps, and was also shown on a souvenir sheet issued for a philatelic convention. The following year, in 1935, both of these were reprinted by Postmaster General James A. Farley as special issues given to officials and friends. Because of complaints by the public, \\"Farley's Follies\\" were reproduced in large numbers. The second stamp issue is easy to tell from the original because it is imperforate. Both stamps and souvenir sheets are widely available.[68]\\r\\nThe Washington state quarter, which was released on April?11, 2007, features Mount Rainier and a salmon.[69][70]\\r\\nMountain climbing on Mount Rainier is difficult, involving traversing the largest glaciers in the U.S. south of Alaska. Most climbers require two to three days to reach the summit, with a success rate of approximately 50%. Climbing teams require experience in glacier travel, self-rescue, and wilderness travel. About 8,000 to 13,000?people attempt the climb each year,[71] about 90% via routes from Camp Muir on the southeast flank.[72] Most of the rest ascend Emmons Glacier via Camp Schurman on the northeast. About half of the attempts are successful, with weather and physical conditioning of the climbers being the most common reasons for failure. All climbers who plan to climb above high camps, Camp Muir and Camp Schurman, are required by law to purchase a Mount Rainier Climbing Pass and register for their climb.[73] Additionally, solo climbers must fill out a solo climbing request form and receive written permission from the Superintendent before attempting to climb.[74]\\r\\nAll climbing routes on Mount Rainier require climbers to possess some level of technical climbing skill. This includes ascending and descending the mountain with the use of technical climbing equipment such as crampons, ice axes, harnesses, and ropes. Difficulty and technical challenge of climbing Mount Rainier can vary wildly between climbing routes. Routes are graded in NCCS Alpine Climbing format.\\r\\nThe normal route to the summit of Mount Rainier is the Disappointment Cleaver Route, grade II-III. As climbers on this route have access to the permanently established Camp Muir, it sees the significant majority of climbing traffic on the mountain. This route is also the most common commercially guided route. The term \\"cleaver\\" is used in the context of a rock ridge that separates two glaciers. The reason for naming this cleaver a \\"disappointment\\" is unrecorded, but it is thought to be due to climbers reaching it only to recognize their inability to reach the summit.[75] An alternative route to the Disappointment Cleaver is the Ingraham Glacier Direct Route, grade II, and is often used when the Disappointment Cleaver route cannot be climbed due to poor route conditions.\\r\\nThe Emmons Glacier Route, grade II, is an alternative to the Disappointment Cleaver route and poses a lower technical challenge to climbers. The climbers on the route can make use of Camp Schurman (9,500?ft), a glacial camp site. Unlike Camp Muir, Camp Schurman has no permanent structure, so climbers must carry their overnight equipment to the location.[76]\\r\\nThe Liberty Ridge Route, grade IV, was first climbed by Ome Daiber, Arnie Campbell and Jim Burrow in 1935 and is listed as one of the Fifty Classic Climbs of North America by Steve Roper and Allen Steck. The Liberty Ridge Route is a considerably more challenging and objectively dangerous route than the normal route to the summit. This route only accounts for approximately 2% of climbers on the mountain, but accounts for approximately 25% of deaths on the mountain.[77] The Liberty Ridge Route runs up the center of the North Face of Mount Rainier and crosses the very active Carbon Glacier.\\r\\nAbout two mountaineering deaths each year occur because of rock and ice fall, avalanche, falls, and hypothermia associated with severe weather (58 reported since and including the 1981 accident through 2010 per American Alpine Club Accidents in North American Mountaineering and the NPS).\\r\\nThe worst mountaineering accident on Mount Rainier occurred in 1981, when eleven people lost their lives in an ice fall on the Ingraham Glacier.[78] This was the largest number of fatalities on Mount Rainier in a single incident since 32 people were killed in a 1946 plane crash on the South Tahoma Glacier.[79]\\r\\nMore recently, the mountain received media attention in 2012, as one of the park rangers lost his life when several climbers were caught in a storm while trying to ascend the mountain. While trying to help load the climbers into a rescue helicopter, the ranger lost his footing, and slid 3,700 feet (1,100?m) to his death.[80][81]\\r\\nIn one of the worst disasters on the mountain in over thirty years, six climberstwo guides, and four clientslast heard from on May?28, 2014, were presumed dead on May?31, 2014, when low-flying search helicopters pinged the signals from the avalanche beacons worn by the climbers. Officials concluded that there was no possible chance of survival after the climbers fell 3,300 feet (1,000 m) while attempting or returning from the summit via the Liberty Ridge climbing route. Searchers found tents and clothes along with rock and ice strewn across a debris field on the Carbon Glacier at 9,500?ft (2,900?m), possible evidence for a slide or avalanche in the vicinity where the team went missing, though the exact cause of the accident is unknown.[82] The bodies of three of the guest climbers were spotted on August?7, 2014, during a training flight and subsequently recovered on August?19, 2014. The bodies of the fourth guest climber and two guides have not been located.[83][84]\\r\\nHiking, backcountry skiing, photography, and camping are popular in the park. Hiking trails, including the Wonderland Traila 93-mile or 150-kilometre circumnavigation of the peakprovide access to the backcountry. Mount Rainier is also popular for winter sports, including snowshoeing and cross-country skiing.[85]\\r\\nThe summit of Mount Rainier has an alpine climate.\\r\\nUniversity of Washington Libraries, Digital Collections:","input":"When did mt. rainier last have a significant eruption?"},{"output":"Mean platelet volume","context":"Mean platelet volume (MPV) is a machine-calculated measurement of the average size of platelets found in blood and is typically included in blood tests as part of the CBC.

When Lampert decided to go out on his own, Rubin warned him it would be a bad career decision.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn April 1988, Lampert left the bank to form ESL Investments, based in Greenwich, Connecticut (the name ESL derives from Lampert's initials). Richard Rainwater, whom Lampert had met on Nantucket Island, gave him $28 million in seed money and introduced him to clients, such as David Geffen.\\r\\n\\r\\nLampert typically holds his investments for several years and usually has between three and fifteen stocks in his portfolio.

These were the famous war elephants used by Carthage in the Punic Wars, their conflict with the Roman Republic. Although the subspecies has been formally described,[1][2] it has not been widely recognized by taxonomists. Other names for this animal include the North African forest elephant, Carthaginian elephant, and Atlas elephant. Originally, its natural range probably extended across North Africa and down to the present Sudanese and Eritrean coasts.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCarthaginian frescoes[3] and coins minted by whoever controlled North Africa at various times show very small elephants, perhaps 2.5 metres (8?ft 2?in) at the shoulder, with the large ears and concave back typical of modern African elephants. The North African elephant was smaller than the modern African bush elephant (L. a. africana), probably similar in size to the modern African forest elephant (L. cyclotis). It is also possible that it was more docile and plainer than the African bush elephant, which is generally untamable, allowing the Punics to tame it as a war elephant by a method now lost to history.\\r\\nAfter they conquered Sicily in 242 BC, the Romans wanted to capture some specimens that had been left behind in the middle of the island by the Carthaginians, but failed in the endeavor. The elephants with which Hannibal crossed the Pyrenees and the Alps in order to invade Italy during the Second Punic War (218-201 BC) belonged to this group, with the exception of Hannibal's personal animal, Surus (meaning \\"the Syrian,\\" or possibly \\"One-Tusker\\"[4]). This individual, according to his documented name and large size, may have been a Syrian elephant (Elephas maximus asurus), a subspecies of the extant Asian elephant, which became extinct shortly after Hannibal invaded Italy but before the extinction of the North African elephant.[citation needed]\\r\\nThe North African elephant was also trained and used by the Ptolemaic dynasty of Egypt. Writing in the 2nd century BC, Polybius (The Histories; 5.84) described their inferiority in battle against the larger Indian elephants used by the Seleucid kings. A surviving Ptolemaic inscription enumerates three types of war elephant, the \\"Troglodytic\\" (probably Libyan), the \\"Ethiopian\\", and the \\"Indian\\". The Ptolemaic king prides himself with being the first to tame the Ethiopian elephants, a stock which could be identical to one of the two extant African species.[citation needed]\\r\\nDuring the reign of Augustus, Roman circus games resulted in the killing of 3,500 elephants.[5][specify]\\r\\nGiven the relatively recent date of its disappearance, the status of this population can probably be resolved through ancient DNA sequence analyses, if specimens of definite North African origin are located and examined.","input":"When did the north african elephant became extinct?"},{"output":"Orson Welles","context":"The War of the Worlds is an episode of the American radio drama anthology series The Mercury Theatre on the Air. It was performed as a Halloween episode of the series on Sunday, October 30, 1938, and aired over the Columbia Broadcasting System radio network. Directed and narrated by actor and future filmmaker Orson Welles, the episode was an adaptation of H. G. Wells' novel The War of the Worlds (1898). It became famous for allegedly causing mass panic, although the scale of the panic is disputed as the program had relatively few listeners.[3]\\r\\nThe first two-thirds of the one-hour broadcast was presented as a series of simulated news bulletins. The first news update interrupted a program of dance music to report that a series of odd explosions had been spotted on Mars, which was followed soon thereafter by a seemingly unrelated report of an unusual object falling on a farm in Grover's Mill, New Jersey. Martians emerged from the object and attacked using a heat ray during the next interruption, which was followed by a rapid series of news reports describing a devastating alien invasion taking place across the United States and the world. The illusion of realism was furthered because the Mercury Theatre on the Air was a sustaining show without commercial interruptions, and the first break in the program came almost 30 minutes into the broadcast. Popular legend holds that some of the radio audience may have been listening to Edgar Bergen and tuned in to \\"The War of the Worlds\\" during a musical interlude, thereby missing the clear introduction that the show was a drama, but recent research suggests this only happened in rare instances.[4]:67ÿ69\\r\\nIn the days following the adaptation, widespread outrage was expressed in the media. The program's news-bulletin format was described as deceptive by some newspapers and public figures, leading to an outcry against the perpetrators of the broadcast and calls for regulation by the Federal Communications Commission.[3] The episode secured Welles' fame as a dramatist.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nH. G. Wells's original novel tells the story of a Martian invasion of Earth. The novel was adapted by Howard E. Koch for the 17th episode of the CBS Radio series The Mercury Theatre on the Air, broadcast at 8?pm ET on Sunday, October 30, 1938.[2]:390, 394 The program's format was a simulated live newscast of developing events. The setting was switched from 19th-century England to contemporary Grover's Mill, an unincorporated village in West Windsor Township, New Jersey, in the United States.\\r\\nThe first two-thirds of the hour-long play is a contemporary retelling of events of the novel, presented as news bulletins interrupting another program. \\"I had conceived the idea of doing a radio broadcast in such a manner that a crisis would actually seem to be happening,\\" Welles later said, \\"and would be broadcast in such a dramatized form as to appear to be a real event taking place at that time, rather than a mere radio play.[5] This approach was similar to Ronald Knox's radio hoax Broadcasting the Barricades, about a riot overtaking London, that was broadcast by the BBC in 1926,[6][7] which Welles later said gave him the idea for \\"The War of the Worlds\\".[8] A 1927 drama aired by Adelaide station 5CL depicted an invasion of Australia via the same techniques and inspired reactions similar to those of the Welles broadcast.[9]\\r\\nHe was also influenced by the Columbia Workshop presentations \\"The Fall of the City\\", a 1937 radio play in which Welles played the role of an omniscient announcer, and \\"Air Raid\\", a vibrant as-it-happens drama starring Ray Collins that aired October 27, 1938.[10]:159, 165ÿ166 Welles had previously used a newscast format for \\"Julius Caesar\\" (September 11, 1938), with H. V. Kaltenborn providing historical commentary throughout the story.[11]:93\\r\\n\\"The War of the Worlds\\" broadcast used techniques similar to those of The March of Time, the CBS news documentary and dramatization radio series.[12] Welles was a member of the program's regular cast, having first performed on The March of Time in March 1935.[1]:74, 333 The Mercury Theatre on the Air and The March of Time shared many cast members, as well as sound effects chief Ora D. Nichols.[4]:41, 61, 63\\r\\nWelles discussed his fake newscast idea with producer John Houseman and assistant director Paul Stewart; together, they decided to adapt a work of science fiction. They considered adapting M. P. Shiel's The Purple Cloud and Arthur Conan Doyle's The Lost World before purchasing the radio rights to The War of the Worlds. Houseman later wrote that he suspected Welles had never read it.[2]:392[4]:45[5][a]\\r\\nHoward Koch had written the first drafts for the Mercury Theatre broadcasts \\"Hell on Ice\\" (October 9), \\"Seventeen\\" (October 16),[10]:164 and \\"Around the World in 80 Days\\" (October 23).[11]:92 Monday, October 24, he was assigned to rescript \\"The War of the Worlds\\" for broadcast the following Sunday night.[10]:164\\r\\nTuesday night, 36 hours before rehearsals were to begin, Koch telephoned Houseman in what the producer characterized as \\"deep distress\\". Koch said he could not make The War of the Worlds interesting or credible as a radio play, a conviction echoed by his secretary Anne Froelick, a typist and aspiring writer whom Houseman had hired to assist him. With only his own abandoned script for Lorna Doone to fall back on, Houseman told Koch to continue adapting the Wells fantasy. He joined Koch and Froelick and they worked on the script throughout the night. On Wednesday night, the first draft was finished on schedule.[2]:392ÿ393\\r\\nOn Thursday, associate producer Paul Stewart held a cast reading of the script, with Koch and Houseman making necessary changes. That afternoon, Stewart made an acetate recording, with no music or sound effects. Welles, immersed in rehearsing the Mercury stage production of Danton's Death scheduled to open the following week, played the record at an editorial meeting that night in his suite at the St. Regis Hotel. After hearing \\"Air Raid\\" on the Columbia Workshop earlier that same evening, Welles viewed the script as dull. He stressed the importance of inserting news flashes and eyewitness accounts into the script to create a sense of urgency and excitement.[10]:166\\r\\nHouseman, Koch, and Stewart reworked the script that night,[2]:393 increasing the number of news bulletins and using the names of real places and people whenever possible. Friday afternoon, the script was sent to Davidson Taylor, executive producer for CBS, and the network legal department. Their response was that the script was 'too' credible and its realism had to be toned down. As using the names of actual institutions could be actionable, CBS insisted upon some 28 changes in phrasing.[10]:167\\r\\n\\"Under protest and with a deep sense of grievance we changed the Hotel Biltmore to a nonexistent Park Plaza, Trans-America to Inter-Continent, the Columbia Broadcasting Building to Broadcasting Building,\\" Houseman wrote.[2]:393 \\"The United States Weather Bureau in Washington, D.C.\\" was changed to \\"The Government Weather Bureau\\", \\"Princeton University Observatory\\" to \\"Princeton Observatory\\", \\"McGill University\\" in Montreal to \\"Macmillan University\\" in Toronto, \\"New Jersey National Guard\\" to \\"State Militia\\", \\"United States Signal Corps\\" to \\"Signal Corps\\", \\"Langley Field\\" to \\"Langham Field\\", and \\"St. Patrick's Cathedral\\" to \\"the cathedral\\".[10]:167\\r\\nOn Saturday, Stewart rehearsed the show with the sound effects team, giving special attention to crowd scenes, the echo of cannon fire, and the sound of the boat horns in New York Harbor.[2]:393ÿ394\\r\\nEarly Sunday afternoon, Bernard Herrmann and his orchestra arrived in the studio, where Welles had taken over production of that evening's program.[2]:391, 398\\r\\nTo create the role of reporter Carl Phillips, actor Frank Readick went to the record library and played the recording of Herbert Morrison's radio report of the Hindenburg disaster over and over.[2]:398 Working with Bernard Herrmann and the orchestra that had to sound like a dance band fell to Paul Stewart,[16] the person Welles would later credit as being largely responsible for the quality of \\"The War of the Worlds\\" broadcast.[17]:195\\r\\nWelles wanted the music to play for unbearably long stretches of time.[18]:159 The studio's emergency fill-in, a solo piano playing Debussy and Chopin, was heard several times. \\"As it played on and on,\\" Houseman wrote, \\"its effect became increasingly sinistera thin band of suspense stretched almost beyond endurance. That piano was the neatest trick of the show.\\"[2]:400\\r\\nDress rehearsal was scheduled for 6?pm.[2]:391\\r\\n\\"Our actual broadcasting time, from the first mention of the meteorites to the fall of New York City, was less than forty minutes,\\" wrote Houseman. \\"During that time, men travelled long distances, large bodies of troops were mobilized, cabinet meetings were held, savage battles fought on land and in the air. And millions of people accepted itemotionally if not logically.[2]:401\\r\\nThe cast of characters of \\"The War of the Worlds\\" appears in order as first heard in the broadcast.[19][20]\\r\\n\\"The War of the Worlds\\" begins with a paraphrase of the beginning of the novel, updated to contemporary times. The announcer introduces Orson Welles:\\r\\nWe know now that in the early years of the 20th century, this world was being watched closely by intelligences greater than man's and yet as mortal as his own. We know now that as human beings busied themselves about their various concerns, they were scrutinized and studied, perhaps almost as narrowly as a man with a microscope might scrutinize the transient creatures that swarm and multiply in a drop of water. With infinite complacence, people went to and fro over the earth about their little affairs, serene in the assurance of their dominion over this small spinning fragment of solar driftwood which by chance or design man has inherited out of the dark mystery of Time and Space. Yet across an immense ethereal gulf, minds that are to our minds as ours are to the beasts in the jungle, intellects vast, cool and unsympathetic, regarded this earth with envious eyes and slowly and surely drew their plans against us. In the 39th year of the 20th century came the great disillusionment. It was near the end of October. Business was better. The war scare was over. More men were back at work. Sales were picking up. On this particular evening, October 30th, the Crossley service estimated that 32 million people were listening in on radios[2]:394ÿ395[20]\\r\\nThe program continues with a weather report and an ordinary dance band remote featuring \\"Ramon Raquello and His Orchestra\\", interrupted by news flashes about strange explosions on Mars. An interview is arranged with reporter Carl Phillips and Princeton-based Professor of Astronomy Richard Pierson, who dismisses speculation about life on Mars. The news grows more frequent and increasingly ominous as a cylindrical meteorite lands in Grover's Mill, New Jersey. A crowd gathers at the site, where Phillips and Pierson relate the events. The cylinder unscrews, and onlookers catch a glimpse of a tentacled, pulsating, barely mobile Martian inside before it incinerates the crowd with heat-rays. Phillips's shouts about incoming flames are cut off mid-sentence.\\r\\nRegular programming breaks down as the studio struggles with casualty and fire-fighting updates. A shaken Pierson speculates about Martian technology. The New Jersey state militia declares martial law and attacks the cylinder; a captain from their field headquarters lectures about the overwhelming force of properly equipped infantry and the helplessness of the Martians, until a tripod rises from the pit. The tripod obliterates the militia, and the studio returns, now describing the Martians as an invading army. Emergency response bulletins give way to damage and evacuation reports as thousands of refugees clog the roads. Three Martian tripods from the cylinder destroy power stations and uproot bridges and railroads, reinforced by three others from a second cylinder that landed in the Great Swamp near Morristown, as gas explosions continue. The Secretary of the Interior addresses the nation.\\r\\nA live connection is established to a field artillery battery in the Watchung Mountains. Its gun crew damages a machine, resulting in a release of black smoke, before fading into the sound of coughing. The lead plane of a wing of bombers from Langham Field broadcasts its approach and remains on the air as their engines are burned by the heat-ray and the plane dives on the invaders. Radio operators go active and fall silent ÿ although the bombers destroyed one machine, the remaining five are spreading black smoke across the Jersey Marshes into Newark.\\r\\nEventually, a news reporter, broadcasting from atop the Broadcasting Building, describes the Martian invasion of New York City ÿ \\"five great machines\\" wading the Hudson \\"like [men] wading through a brook\\", black smoke drifting over the city, people diving into the East River \\"like rats\\", others in Times Square \\"falling like flies\\". He reads a final bulletin stating that Martian cylinders have fallen all over the country, and is eventually killed by the smoke. Finally, a ham radio operator is heard calling, \\"2X2L calling CQ, New York. Isn't there anyone on the air? Isn't there anyone on the air? Isn't there... anyone?\\"\\r\\nAfter a period of silence comes the voice of announcer Dan Seymour:\\r\\nYou are listening to a CBS presentation of Orson Welles and the Mercury Theatre of the Air, in an original dramatization of The War of the Worlds by H. G. Wells. The performance will continue after a brief intermission.\\r\\nThe last third of the program is a monologue and dialogue. Professor Pierson, having survived the attack on Grover's Mill, attempts to make contact with other humans. In Newark, he encounters an opportunistic militiaman who holds fascist ideals in regards to man's relationship with the Martians, and intends to use Martian weaponry to take control of both species. Declaring that he wants no part of \\"his world\\", Pierson leaves the stranger with his delusions. His journey takes him to the ruins of New York, where he discovers that the Martians have died ÿ as with the novel, they fell victim to earthly pathogenic germs, to which they had no immunity. Life eventually returns to normal, and Pierson finishes writing his recollections of the invasion and its aftermath.\\r\\nAfter the play, Welles assumes his role as host and tells listeners that the broadcast was a Halloween concoction: the equivalent, he says, \\"of dressing up in a sheet, jumping out of a bush and saying, 'Boo!'\\"[21] Popular mythology holds this disclaimer was hastily added to the broadcast at the insistence of CBS executives as they became aware of panic inspired by the program. In fact, at the station break network executive Davidson Taylor attempted to prevent Welles, who had added the speech at the last minute, from reading it on-air, because it could have opened the network up to legal liability, but Welles delivered it anyway.[4]:95ÿ96\\r\\nRadio programming charts in Sunday newspapers listed the CBS drama, \\"The War of the Worlds\\". The New York Times for October 30, 1938, also included the show in its \\"Leading Events of the Week\\" (\\"Tonight ÿ Play: H. G. Wells's 'War of the Worlds'\\") and published a photograph of Welles with some of the Mercury players, captioned, \\"Tonight's show is H. G. Wells' 'War of the Worlds'\\".[10]:169\\r\\nAnnouncements that \\"The War of the Worlds\\" is a dramatization of a work of fiction were made on the full CBS network at four points during the broadcast October 30, 1938 ÿ at the beginning, before the middle break, after the middle break, and at the end.[22]:43 The middle break was delayed 10 minutes to accommodate the dramatic content.[11]:94\\r\\nAnother announcement was repeated on the full CBS network that same evening at 10:30?pm, 11:30?pm and midnight: \\"For those listeners who tuned in to Orson Welles's Mercury Theatre on the Air broadcast from 8 to 9 pm Eastern Standard Time tonight and did not realize that the program was merely a modernized adaptation of H. G. Wells's famous novel War of the Worlds, we are repeating the fact which was made clear four times on the program, that, while the names of some American cities were used, as in all novels and dramatizations, the entire story and all of its incidents were fictitious.\\"[22]:43ÿ44\\r\\nProducer John Houseman noticed that at about 8:32?pm. ET, CBS supervisor Davidson Taylor received a telephone call in the control room. Creasing his lips, Taylor left the studio and returned four minutes later, \\"pale as death\\", as he had been ordered to interrupt \\"The War of the Worlds\\" broadcast immediately with an announcement of the program's fictional content. But by the time the order was given, the program was already less than a minute away from its first scheduled break, and the fictional news reporter played by actor Ray Collins was choking on poison gas as the Martians overwhelmed New York.[2]:404\\r\\nActor Stefan Schnabel recalled sitting in the anteroom after finishing his on-air performance. \\"A few policemen trickled in, then a few more. Soon, the room was full of policemen and a massive struggle was going on between the police, page boys, and CBS executives, who were trying to prevent the cops from busting in and stopping the show. It was a show to witness.\\"[23]\\r\\nDuring the sign-off theme, the phone began ringing. Houseman picked it up and the furious caller announced he was mayor of a Midwestern town where mobs were in the streets. Houseman hung up quickly: \\"For we were off the air now and the studio door had burst open.\\"[2]:404\\r\\nThe following hours were a nightmare. The building was suddenly full of people and dark-blue uniforms. Hustled out of the studio, we were locked into a small back office on another floor. Here we sat incommunicado while network employees were busily collecting, destroying, or locking up all scripts and records of the broadcast. Finally, the Press was let loose upon us, ravening for horror. How many deaths had we heard of? (Implying they knew of thousands.) What did we know of the fatal stampede in a Jersey hall? (Implying it was one of many.) What traffic deaths? (The ditches must be choked with corpses.) The suicides? (Haven't you heard about the one on Riverside Drive?) It is all quite vague in my memory and quite terrible.[2]:404\\r\\nPaul White, head of CBS News, was quickly summoned to the office ÿ \\"and there bedlam reigned\\", he wrote:\\r\\nThe telephone switchboard, a vast sea of light, could handle only a fraction of incoming calls. The haggard Welles sat alone and despondent. \\"I'm through,\\" he lamented, \\"washed up.\\" I didn't bother to reply to this highly inaccurate self-appraisal. I was too busy writing explanations to put on the air, reassuring the audience that it was safe. I also answered my share of incessant telephone calls, many of them from as far away as the Pacific Coast.[24]:47ÿ48\\r\\nBecause of the crowd of newspaper reporters, photographers, and police, the cast left the CBS building by the rear entrance. Aware of the sensation the broadcast had made, but not its extent, Welles went to the Mercury Theatre where an all-night rehearsal of Danton's Death was in progress. Shortly after midnight, one of the cast, a late arrival, told Welles that news about \\"The War of the Worlds\\" was being flashed in Times Square. They immediately left the theatre, and standing on the corner of Broadway and 42nd Street, they read the lighted bulletin that circled the New York Times building: ORSON WELLES CAUSES PANIC.[10]:172ÿ173\\r\\nSome listeners heard only a portion of the broadcast, and in the tension and anxiety prior to World War II, mistook it for a genuine news broadcast.[25] Thousands of those people rushed to share the false reports with others, or called CBS, newspapers, or the police to ask if the broadcast was real. Many newspapers assumed that this large number of phone calls, and scattered reports of listeners rushing about or even fleeing their homes, proved the existence of a mass panic, though such behavior was never widespread.[4]:82ÿ90, 98ÿ103[26][27][28]\\r\\nFuture Tonight Show host Jack Paar had announcing duties that night for Cleveland CBS affiliate WGAR. As panicked listeners called the studio, Paar attempted to calm them on the phone and on air by saying: \\"The world is not coming to an end. Trust me. When have I ever lied to you?\\" When the listeners started charging Paar with \\"covering up the truth\\", he called WGAR's station manager for help. Oblivious to the situation, the manager advised Paar to calm down, saying it was \\"all a tempest in a teapot\\".[29]\\r\\nIn a 1975 interview with radio historian Chuck Schaden, radio actor Alan Reed recalled being one of several actors recruited to answer phone calls at CBS's New York headquarters.[30]\\r\\nIn Concrete, Washington, phone lines and electricity suffered a short circuit at the Superior Portland Cement Company's substation. Residents were unable to call neighbors, family, or friends to calm their fears. Reporters who heard of the coincidental blackout sent the story over the news-wire, and soon Concrete was known worldwide.[31]\\r\\nWelles continued with the rehearsal of Danton's Death (scheduled to open November 2), leaving shortly after dawn October 31. He was operating on three hours of sleep when CBS called him to a press conference. He read a statement later printed in newspapers nationwide, and took questions from reporters:[10]:173, 176\\r\\nIn its editions of October 31, 1938, the Tucson Citizen reported that three Arizona affiliates of CBSKOY in Phoenix, KTUC in Tucson and KSUN in Bisbeehad originally scheduled a delayed broadcast of \\"The War of the Worlds\\" that night; CBS had shifted The Mercury Theater on the Air from Monday nights to Sunday nights on September 11, but the three affiliates preferred to keep the series in its original Monday slot so as not to have it compete with NBC's top-rated Chase and Sanborn Hour. However, late on that Sunday night, CBS contacted KOY and KTUC owner Burridge Butler and instructed him not to air the program the following night.[33]\\r\\nWithin three weeks, newspapers had published at least 12,500 articles about the broadcast and its impact,[22]:61[34] although the story dropped off the front pages after a few days.[3] Adolf Hitler referenced the broadcast in a speech in Munich on November 8, 1938.[4]:161 Welles later remarked that Hitler cited the effect of the broadcast on the American public as evidence of \\"the corrupt condition and decadent state of affairs in democracy\\".[35][36]\\r\\nLater studies indicate that many missed the repeated notices about the broadcast being fictional, partly because The Mercury Theatre on the Air, an unsponsored CBS cultural program with a relatively small audience, ran at the same time as the NBC Red Network's popular Chase and Sanborn Hour featuring ventriloquist Edgar Bergen. At the time, many Americans assumed that a significant number of Chase and Sanborn listeners changed stations when the first comic sketch ended and a musical number by Nelson Eddy began, thereby tuning in \\"The War of the Worlds\\" after the opening announcements, but historian A. Brad Schwartz, after studying hundreds of letters from people who heard \\"The War of the Worlds\\", as well as contemporary audience surveys, concluded that very few people frightened by Welles's broadcast had tuned out Bergen's program. \\"All the hard evidence suggests that The Chase & Sanborn Hour was only a minor contributing factor to the Martian hysteria,\\" he wrote. \\"...in truth, there was no mass exodus from Charlie McCarthy to Orson Welles that night.\\"[4]:67ÿ69 Because the broadcast was unsponsored, Welles and company could schedule breaks at will rather than arranging them around advertisements. As a result, the only notices that the broadcast was fictional came at the start of the broadcast and about 40 and 55 minutes into it.\\r\\nA study by the Radio Project discovered that fewer than one-third of frightened listeners understood the invaders to be aliens; most thought they were listening to reports of a German invasion or a natural catastrophe.[4]:180, 191[28] \\"People were on edge\\", wrote Welles biographer Frank Brady. \\"For the entire month prior to 'The War of the Worlds', radio had kept the American public alert to the ominous happenings throughout the world. The Munich crisis was at its height.  For the first time in history, the public could tune into their radios every night and hear, boot by boot, accusation by accusation, threat by threat, the rumblings that seemed inevitably leading to a world war.\\"[10]:164ÿ165\\r\\nCBS News chief Paul White wrote that he was convinced that the panic induced by the broadcast was a result of the public suspense generated before the Munich Pact. \\"Radio listeners had had their emotions played upon for days  Thus they believed the Welles production even though it was specifically stated that the whole thing was fiction\\".[24]:47\\r\\nHistorical research suggests the panic was far less widespread than newspapers had indicated at the time. \\"[T]he panic and mass hysteria so readily associated with 'The War of the Worlds' did not occur on anything approaching a nationwide dimension,\\" American University media historian W. Joseph Campbell wrote in 2003. He quotes Robert E. Bartholomew, an authority on mass panic outbreaks, as having said that \\"there is a growing consensus among sociologists that the extent of the panic  was greatly exaggerated\\".[28]\\r\\nThis position is supported by contemporary accounts. \\"In the first place, most people didn't hear [the show],\\" said Frank Stanton, later president of CBS.[3] Of the nearly 2,000 letters mailed to Welles and the Federal Communications Commission after \\"The War of the Worlds,\\" currently held by the University of Michigan and the National Archives and Records Administration, roughly 27% came from frightened listeners or people who witnessed any panic. After analyzing those letters, A. Brad Schwartz concluded that although the broadcast briefly misled a significant portion of its audience, very few of those listeners fled their homes or otherwise panicked. The total number of protest letters sent to Welles and the FCC is also low in comparison with other controversial radio broadcasts of the period, further suggesting the audience was small and the fright severely limited.[4]:82ÿ93[26]\\r\\nFive thousand households were telephoned that night in a survey conducted by the C. E. Hooper company, the main radio ratings service at the time. Only 2% of the respondents said they were listening to the radio play, and no one stated they were listening to a news broadcast. About 98% of respondents said they were listening to other radio programming ÿ The Chase and Sanborn Hour was long the most popular program in that timeslot ÿ or not listening to the radio at all. Further shrinking the potential audience, some CBS network affiliates, including some in large markets such as Boston's WEEI, had pre-empted The Mercury Theatre on the Air in favor of local commercial programming.[3]\\r\\nBen Gross, radio editor for the New York Daily News, wrote in his 1954 memoir that the streets were nearly deserted as he made his way to the studio for the end of the program.[3] Producer John Houseman reported that the Mercury Theatre staff was surprised when they were finally released from the CBS studios to find life going on as usual in the streets of New York.[2]:404 The writer of a letter the Washington Post published later likewise recalled no panicked mobs in the capital's downtown streets at the time. \\"The supposed panic was so tiny as to be practically immeasurable on the night of the broadcast\\", media historians Jefferson Pooley and Michael Socolow wrote in Slate on its 75th anniversary in 2013; \\"Almost nobody was fooled\\".[3]\\r\\nAccording to Campbell, the most common response said to indicate a panic was calling the local newspaper or police to confirm the story or seek additional information. This, he writes, is an indicator that people were not generally panicking or hysterical. \\"The call volume perhaps is best understood as an altogether rational response ...\\"[28] Some New Jersey media and law enforcement agencies received up to 40% more telephone calls than normal during the broadcast.[37]\\r\\nWhat a night. After the broadcast, as I tried to get back to the St. Regis where we were living, I was blocked by an impassioned crowd of news people looking for blood, and the disappointment when they found I wasn't hemorrhaging. It wasn't long after the initial shock that whatever public panic and outrage there was vanished. But, the newspapers for days continued to feign fury.\\r\\nAs it was late on a Sunday night in the Eastern Time Zone, where the broadcast originated, few reporters and other staff were present in newsrooms. Most newspaper coverage thus took the form of Associated Press stories, which were largely anecdotal aggregates of reporting from its various bureaus, giving the impression that panic had indeed been widespread. Many newspapers led with the AP's story the next day.[28]\\r\\nThe Twin City Sentinel of Winston-Salem, North Carolina pointed out that the situation could have been even worse if most people had not been listening to Edgar Bergen's show, saying, \\"Charlie McCarthy last night saved the United States from a sudden and panicky death by hysteria.\\"[39]\\r\\nOn November 2, 1938, the Australian Age characterized the incident as \\"mass hysteria\\" and stated that \\"never in the history of the United States had such a wave of terror and panic swept the continent\\". Unnamed observers quoted by the Age commented that \\"the panic could have only happened in America.\\"[40]\\r\\nEditorialists chastised the radio industry for allowing this to happen. This response may have reflected newspaper publishers' fears that radio, to which they had lost some of the advertising revenue that was scarce enough during the Great Depression, would render them obsolete. In \\"The War of the Worlds\\", they saw an opportunity to cast aspersions on the newer medium. \\"The nation as a whole continues to face the danger of incomplete, misunderstood news over a medium which has yet to prove that it is competent to perform the news job,\\" wrote Editor & Publisher, the newspaper industry's trade journal.[3][41]\\r\\nWilliam Randolph Hearst's papers called on broadcasters to police themselves lest the government step in, as Iowa Senator Clyde L. Herring proposed a bill that would have required all programming to be reviewed by the FCC prior to broadcast (he never actually introduced it). Others blamed the radio audience for its credulity. Noting that any intelligent listener would have realized the broadcast was fictional, the Chicago Tribune opined, \\"it would be more tactful to say that some members of the radio audience are a trifle retarded mentally, and that many a program is prepared for their consumption.\\" Other newspapers took pains to note that anxious listeners had called their offices to learn whether Martians were really attacking.[28]\\r\\nFew contemporary accounts exist outside newspaper coverage of the mass panic and hysteria supposedly induced by the broadcast. Justin Levine, a producer at KFI-AM in Los Angeles, wrote in a 2000 history of the FCC's response to hoax broadcasts that \\"the anecdotal nature of such reporting makes it difficult to objectively assess the true extent and intensity of the panic.[42] Bartholomew sees this as yet more evidence that the panic was predominantly a creation of the newspaper industry.[43]\\r\\nIn a study published in book form as The Invasion from Mars (1940), Princeton professor Hadley Cantril calculated that some six million people heard \\"The War of the Worlds\\" broadcast.[22]:56 He estimated that 1.7?million listeners believed the broadcast was an actual news bulletin and, of those, 1.2?million people were frightened or disturbed.[22]:58 Media historians Jefferson Pooley and Michael Socolow have since concluded, however, that Cantril's study has serious flaws. Its estimate of the program's audience is more than twice as high as any other at the time. Cantril himself conceded this, but argued that unlike Hooper, his estimate had attempted to capture the significant portion of the audience that did not have home telephones at that time. Since those respondents were contacted only after the media frenzy, Cantril allowed that their recollections could have been influenced by what they read in the newspapers. Claims that Chase and Sanborn listeners who missed the disclaimer at the beginning when they turned to CBS during a commercial break or musical performance on that show and thus mistook \\"The War of the Worlds\\" for a real broadcast inflated the show's audience and the ensuing alleged panic are impossible to substantiate.[3]\\r\\nApart from his admittedly imperfect methods of estimating the audience and assessing the authenticity of their response, Pooley and Socolow found, Cantril made another error in typing audience reaction. Respondents had indicated a variety of reactions to the program, among them \\"excited\\", \\"disturbed\\", and \\"frightened\\". Yet he included all of them with \\"panicked\\", failing to account for the possibility that despite their reaction, they were still aware the broadcast was staged. \\"[T]hose who did hear it, looked at it as a prank and accepted it that way,\\" recalled researcher Frank Stanton.[3]\\r\\nBartholomew grants that hundreds of thousands were frightened, but calls evidence of people taking action based on their fear \\"scant\\" and \\"anecdotal\\".[44] Indeed, contemporary news articles indicate that police were swamped with hundreds of calls in numerous locations, but stories of people doing anything more than calling authorities mostly involve only small groups. Such stories were often reported by people who were panicking themselves.[28]\\r\\nLater investigations found much of the alleged panicked responses to have been exaggerated or mistaken. Cantril's researchers found that, contrary to what had been claimed, no admissions for shock were made at a Newark hospital during the broadcast; hospitals in New York City similarly reported no spike in admissions that night. A few suicide attempts seem to have been prevented when friends or family intervened, but no record of a successful one exists. A Washington Post claim that a man died of a heart attack brought on by listening to the program could not be verified. One woman filed a lawsuit against CBS, but it was soon dismissed.[3]\\r\\nThe FCC also received letters from the public that advised against taking reprisals.[45] Singer Eddie Cantor urged the commission not to overreact, as \\"censorship would retard radio immeasurably.\\"[46] The FCC not only chose not to punish Welles or CBS, it also barred complaints about \\"The War of the Worlds\\" from being brought up during license renewals. \\"Janet Jackson's 2004 'wardrobe malfunction' remains far more significant in the history of broadcast regulation than Orson Welles' trickery,\\" wrote media historians Jefferson Pooley and Michael Socolow.[3]\\r\\nH. G. Wells and Orson Welles met for the first and only time in late October 1940, shortly before the second anniversary of the Mercury Theatre broadcast, when they both happened to be lecturing in San Antonio, Texas. On October 28, 1940, the two men visited the studios of KTSA radio for an interview by Charles C. Shaw,[1]:361 who introduced them by characterizing the panic generated by \\"The War of the Worlds\\": \\"The country at large was frightened almost out of its wits\\".[35]\\r\\nWells expressed good-natured skepticism about the actual extent of the panic caused by \\"this sensational Halloween spree. Are you sure there was such a panic in America or wasn't it your Halloween fun?\\"[35]\\r\\nWelles appreciated the comment: \\"I think thats the nicest thing that a man from England could say about the men from Mars. Mr. Hitler made a good deal of sport of it, you know  It's supposed to show the corrupt condition and decadent state of affairs in democracy, that 'The War of the Worlds' went over as well as it did. I think it's very nice of Mr. Wells to say that not only I didnt mean it, but the American people didnt mean it.\\"[35]\\r\\nWhen Shaw interjected that there was \\"some excitement\\" that he did not wish to belittle, Welles asked him, \\"What kind of excitement? Mr. H. G. Wells wants to know if the excitement wasn't the same kind of excitement that we extract from a practical joke in which somebody puts a sheet over his head and says 'Boo!' I don't think anybody believes that that individual is a ghost, but we do scream and yell and rush down the hall. And that's just about what happened.\\"[35]\\r\\n\\"Thats a very excellent description,\\" Shaw said.[35]\\r\\n\\"You arent quite serious in America, yet,\\" said Wells. \\"You havent got the war right under your chins. And the consequence is you can still play with ideas of terror and conflict.  It's a natural thing to do until you're right up against it.\\"[35]\\r\\n\\"Until it ceases to be a game,\\" Welles said  a phrase Wells repeated.[35][36] Britain and France had then been at war with Nazi Germany for more than a year.\\r\\nAs the Mercury's second theatre season began in 1938, Orson Welles and John Houseman were unable to write the Mercury Theatre on the Air broadcasts on their own. They hired Howard E. Koch, whose experience in having a play performed by the Federal Theatre Project in Chicago led him to leave his law practice and move to New York to become a writer. Koch was put to work at $50 a week, raised to $60 after he proved himself.[2]:390 The Mercury Theatre on the Air was a sustaining show, so in lieu of a more substantial salary, Houseman gave Koch the rights to any script he worked on.[47]:175ÿ176\\r\\nA condensed version of the script for \\"The War of the Worlds\\" appeared in the debut issue of Radio Digest magazine (February 1939), in an article on the broadcast that credited \\"Orson Welles and his Mercury Theatre players\\".[48] The complete script appeared in The Invasion from Mars: A Study in the Psychology of Panic (1940), the book publication of a Princeton University study directed by psychologist Hadley Cantril. Welles strongly protested Koch being listed as sole author since many others contributed to the script, but by the time the book was published, he had decided to end the dispute.[10]:176ÿ179\\r\\nWelles did seek legal redress after the CBS TV series Studio One presented its top-rated broadcast, \\"The Night America Trembled\\", on September 9, 1957. Hosted by Edward R. Murrow, the live presentation of Nelson S. Bond's documentary play recreated the 1938 performance of \\"The War of the Worlds\\" in the CBS studio, using the script as a framework for a series of factual narratives about a cross-section of radio listeners. No member of the Mercury Theatre is named.[49][50] The courts ruled against Welles, who was found to have abandoned any rights to the script after it was published in Cantril's book. Koch had granted CBS the right to use the script in its program.[51]\\r\\n\\"As it developed over the years, Koch took some cash and some credit,\\" wrote biographer Frank Brady. \\"He wrote the story of how he created the adaptation, with a copy of his script being made into a paperback book enjoying large printings and an album of the broadcast selling over 500,000 copies, part of the income also going to him as copyright owner.\\"[10]:179\\r\\nThe book, The Panic Broadcast, was first published in 1970.[52] The best-selling album was a sound recording of the broadcast titled Orson Welles' War of the Worlds, \\"released by arrangement with Manheim Fox Enterprises, Inc.\\"[53][54] The source discs for the recording are unknown.[55] Welles told Peter Bogdanovich that it was a poor-quality recording taken off the air at the time of broadcast ÿ \\"a pirated record which people have made fortunes of money and have no right to play.\\" Welles received no compensation.[56]\\r\\nInitially apologetic about the supposed panic his broadcast had caused (and privately fuming that newspaper reports of lawsuits were either greatly exaggerated or totally fabricated[42]), Welles later embraced the story as part of his personal myth. \\"Houses were emptying, churches were filling up; from Nashville to Minneapolis there was wailing in the streets and the rending of garments,\\" he told Peter Bogdanovich years later.[1]:18\\r\\nCBS, too, found reports ultimately useful in promoting the strength of its influence. It presented a fictionalized account of the panic in a 1957 episode of the television series Studio One, and included it prominently in its 2003 celebrations of CBS's 75th anniversary as a television broadcaster. \\"The legend of the panic,\\" according to Jefferson and Socolow, \\"grew exponentially over the following years ... [It] persists because it so perfectly captures our unease with the media's power over our lives.\\"[3]\\r\\nThe New Jersey Township of West Windsor, where Grover's Mill is located, commemorated the 50th anniversary of the broadcast in 1988 with four days of festivities including art and planetarium shows, a panel discussion, a parade, burial of a time capsule, a dinner dance, film festivals devoted to H. G. Wells and Orson Welles, and the dedication of a bronze monument to the fictional Martian landings. Howard Koch, an author of the original radio script, attended the 49th anniversary celebration as an honored guest.[59]\\r\\nThe 75th anniversary of \\"The War of the Worlds\\" was marked by an international rebroadcast with an introduction by George Takei,[60] and an episode of the PBS documentary series American Experience.[61][62]\\r\\nOn January 27, 2003, the Mercury Theatre broadcast of \\"The War of the Worlds\\" was one of the first 50 recordings made part of the National Recording Registry of the Library of Congress.[63]\\r\\nSince the original Mercury Theatre on the Air broadcast of \\"The War of the Worlds\\", many re-airings, remakes, re-enactments, parodies, and new dramatizations have occurred. Many American radio stations, particularly those that regularly air old-time radio programs, re-air the original program as a Halloween tradition. Some notable examples include:","input":"Who narrated the original war of the worlds?"},{"output":"September 18, 2006","context":"A child safety seat (infant safety seat, child restraint system, child seat, baby seat, restraining car seat, car seat, etc.) is a seat designed specifically to protect children from injury or death during vehicle collisions. Most commonly these seats are purchased and installed by consumers, but car manufacturers may integrate them directly into their vehicle's design and generally are required to provide anchors and to ensure seat belt compatibility. Many jurisdictions require children defined by age, weight, and/or height to use a government-approved child safety seat when riding in a vehicle. Child safety seats provide passive restraints and must be properly used to be effective. However, research indicates many child safety restraints are often not used properly.[1] To tackle this negative trend, health officials and child safety experts produce child safety videos to teach proper car seat installation to parents and caregivers.\\r\\nBaby car seats are legally required in many countries, including most Western developed countries, to safely transport children up to the age of 2 or more years in cars and other vehicles.\\r\\nOther car seats, also known as \\"booster seats,\\" are required until the child is large enough to use an adult seat belt. This is usually, but not always, when the child is 1.45m (4?ft 9 in) tall. The child needs to meet five criteria before moving out of the booster seat, including the child's seating position, shoulder belt position, lap belt position, knee position, and ability to sit properly for the length of the trip.\\r\\nGenerally, countries that regulate passenger safety have child safety laws that require a child to be restrained appropriately depending on their age and weight. These regulations and standards are often minimums, and with each graduation to the next kind of safety seat, there is a step down in the amount of protection a child has in a collision.[2] Some countries, such as Australia and the United States, forbid rear-facing child seats in a front seat that has an airbag. A rear-facing infant restraint put in the front seat of a vehicle places an infant's head close to the airbag, which can cause severe head injuries or death if the airbag deploys. Some modern cars include a switch to disable the front passenger airbag for child-supporting seat use.\\r\\nIn 2003, the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) suggested that infants should spend minimal time in car seats (when not a passenger in a vehicle) or other seating that maintains supine positioning to avoid developing positional plagiocephaly (\\"flat head syndrome\\").[3]\\r\\nIn 1990, the ISO standard ISOFIX[4] was launched in an attempt to provide a standard for fixing car seats into different makes of car. The standard now includes a top tether; the U.S. version of this system is called LATCH. Generally, the ISOFIX system can be used with Groups 0, 0+ and 1.\\r\\nIn 2013, a new car seat regulation was introduced: i-Size is the name of a new European safety regulation that affects car seats for children under 15 months of age. It came into effect in July 2013 and provides extra protection in several ways, most notably by providing rearward facing travel for children up to 15 months instead of 9 to 12 months, which the previous EU regulation advised.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nSince the first car was manufactured and put on the market in the early 1900s, many modifications and adjustments have been implemented to protect those that drive and ride in motorized vehicles. Most restraints were put into place to protect adults without regard for young children. Though child seats were beginning to be manufactured in the early 1930s, their purpose was not the safety of children. The purpose was to act as booster seats to bring the child to a height easier for the driving parent to see them. It was not until 1962 that two designs with the purpose of protecting a child were developed independently.[5] British inventor Jean Ames created a rear-facing child seat with a Y-shaped strap similar to today's models.[6] American Leonard Rivkin, of Denver Colorado, designed a forward-facing seat with a metal frame to protect the child.[7] It is noted that seat belts for adults were not standard equipment in automobiles until the 1960s.\\r\\nThere are several types of car seats, which vary in the position of the child and size of the seat. The United Nations European Regional standard ECE R44/04[8] categorizes these into 4 groups: 0-3. Many car seats combine the larger groups 1, 2 and 3. Some new car models includes stock restraint seats by default.\\r\\nGroup 0 baby seats, or infant carriers, keep the baby locked up in a rear-facing position and are secured in place by a standard adult seat belt and/or an ISOFIX fitting.\\r\\nGroup 0 carrycots hold the baby lying on its back.\\r\\nCarrycots are secured by both seat belts in the rear seat of the car. Both types have handles to allow them to be easily moved into and out of the car.\\r\\nCar Seat - Middle Back Seat\\r\\nCar Seat - Not in Front Seat\\r\\nCarrycots or infant car beds are used for children that cannot sit in a regular baby seat, such as premature infants or infants that suffer from apnea. A carrycot is a restraint system intended to accommodate and restrain the child in a supine or prone position with the child's spine perpendicular to the median longitudinal plane of the vehicle. Carrycots are designed to distribute the restraining forces over the child's head and body, excluding its limbs, in the event of a big crash. It must be put on the rear seat of the car. Some models can be changed to face forward after the baby has reached the weight limit which is normally about 15-20 kilograms.\\r\\nCarrycots generally include a stomach belt and a connection to the (three points) safety belt.\\r\\n'Infant carrier' means a restraint system intended to accommodate the child in a rearward-facing semi-recumbent position. This design distributes the restraining forces over the child's head and body, excluding its limbs, in the event of the frontal collision.\\r\\nFor young infants, the seat used is an infant carrier with typical weight recommendations of 5-20?lb. Most infant seats made in the US can now be used up to at least 22 pounds (10.0?kg) and 29 inches (74?cm), with some going up to 35 pounds (16?kg). In the past, most infant seats in the US went to 20 pounds (9.1?kg) and 26 inches (66?cm). Infant carriers are often also called \\"Bucket Seats\\" as they resemble a bucket with a handle. Some (but not all) seats can be used with the base secured, or with the carrier strapped in alone. Some seats do not have bases. Infant carriers are mounted rear-facing and are designed to \\"cocoon\\" against the back of the vehicle seat in the event of a collision, with the impact being absorbed in the outer shell of the restraint. Rear-facing seats are deemed the safest, and in the US children must remain in this position until they are at least 1 year of age and at least 20 pounds (9.1?kg). although it is recommended to keep them rear-facing until at least 2 years old or until they outgrow the rear-facing car seat height and weight, whichever is longer.\\r\\nGroup 0+ car seats commonly have a chassis permanently fixed into the car by an adult seat belt and can be placed into some form of baby transport using the integral handle if it is the specific model. Rear-facing child seats are inherently safer than forward-facing child seats because they provide more support for the child's head in the event of a sudden deceleration. Although some parents are eager to switch to a forward-facing child seat because it seems more \\"grown up,\\" various countries and car seat manufacturers recommend that children continue to use a rear-facing child seat for as long as physically possible[9]\\r\\nConvertible seats can be used throughout many stages. Many convertible seats will transition from a rear-facing seat, to a forward-facing seat, and some then can be used as a booster seat. Many convertible seats allow for 2.3ÿ18?kg (5-40?lb.) rear-facing, allowing children to be in the safer rear-facing position up to a weight of 18?kg (40?lbs).\\r\\nConvertible safety seats can be installed as either rear-facing or forward-facing. There is a large selection available to choose from and weight limits, height limits, and extra features vary from seat to seat and by manufacturer. Seats with a 5-point harness are considered safer than those with an overhead shield[10]\\r\\nConvertibles aren't considered the best choice for a newborn because the bottom harness slots are often above the shoulders of most newborns. A seat with low bottom harness slots can be used if it is desired to use a convertible from birth.\\r\\nRear-facing weight limits range from 20 to 50?lb (9.1 to 22.7?kg) depending on the manufacturer and country of origin. Forward-facing limits range from 20 to 90?lb (9.1 to 40.8?kg) depending on the seat model and the manufacturer and country of origin.\\r\\nMost convertible seats in the U.S. have at least a 35 pounds (16?kg) rear-facing weight limit, most now to go to 40 pounds (18?kg), some 45 pounds (20?kg) and a few 50 pounds (23?kg). The American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) recommends that children remain rear-facing until they outgrow their convertible seat, regardless of how old they are. Children can remain in a rear-facing seat until they have either outgrown the weight limit for their seat, or the top of their head is within 1 inch (25?mm) of the top of the shell of the car seat.[11]\\r\\nA permanent fixture in the car using an adult seat belt to hold it in place and a five-point baby harness to hold the infant.\\r\\nIt is recommended that children sit rear-facing for as long as possible. In Scandinavian countries, for example, children sit rear-facing until around 4 years old. Rear-facing car seats are significantly safer in frontal collisions, which are the most likely to cause severe injury and death.[12][13][14][15][16][17][18][19][20][21][22] Rear-facing group 1 car seats are becoming more widespread but are still difficult to source in many countries.\\r\\nA larger seat than the Group 1 design. These seats use an adult seat belt to hold the child in place.\\r\\nAlso known as booster seats, these position the child so that the adult seat belt is held in the correct position for safety and comfort.\\r\\nBooster seats are recommended for children until they are big enough to properly use a seat belt. Seat belts are engineered for adults, and are thus too big for small children. In the United States, for children under the age of 4 and/or under 40 pounds (18?kg), a seat with a 5-point harness is suggested instead of a booster seat.[23]\\r\\nBooster seats lift the child and allow the seat belt to sit firmly across the collar bone and chest, with the lap portion fitted to the hips. If the seat belt is not across the collar bone and the hips, it will ride across the neck and the stomach and cause internal injuries in the event of a collision.\\r\\nThere are two main types of boosters: high back (some of which have energy absorbing foam) and no back. A new generation of booster seats comes with rigid Isofix (Latch) connectors that secure to the vehicle's anchors, improving the seat's stability in the event of a collision.\\r\\nThe consumer group Which? is calling on manufacturers and retailers to phase out backless boosters, as it says they don't provide enough protection in side-impact crashes and could put children at risk.[24] So while backless booster cushions are better than using no child seat at all, they do not provide adequate protection in all circumstances.\\r\\nUsed for Groups I, II and III.\\r\\nAfter reaching one year of age and 20 pounds (9.1?kg), children may travel in forward-facing seats. Most Scandinavian countries require children to sit rear-facing until at least the age of 4 years. This has contributed to Sweden having the lowest rate of children killed in traffic in international comparisons.[25]\\r\\nBy law (in Canada and some US states), children need to be restrained until they are 4-years old and 40 pounds (18?kg). After the requirement is met, they can move into a booster seat.\\r\\nAll child restraints have an expiration date. Seats can expire 6 years from the date of manufacture, although this can vary by manufacturer. Expiration dates are highly debated, with proponents and manufacturers claiming that older car seats can degrade over time to be less effective and that changing laws and regulations necessitate an expiration date. Opponents argue that it is simply for their legal protection and to sell more car seats, and point out that manufacturers have noted that the plastics in most car seats long outlast the expiration date. As ageing is due to temperature swings and UV-light, a seat ages faster in a car than in a cool, dark cellar.\\r\\nLike motorcycle and race car helmets, child restraints are tested for use in just one crash event. This means that if the restraint is compromised in any way (with or without the child in it), owners are strongly suggested to replace it. This is due to the uncertainty with how a compromised child restraint will perform in subsequent crashes.[citation needed]\\r\\nThe National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) provides guidance on the reuse of child restraint systems after a crash. Replacement of child restraints is recommended following a moderate or severe crash in order to ensure a continued high level of protection for child passengers. However, recent studies demonstrate that child restraints can withstand minor crash impacts without any documented degradation in subsequent performance.[26]\\r\\nA minor crash is defined by the NHTSA as one in which all of the following apply:\\r\\nCrashes that meet all of these criteria are much less severe than the dynamic testing requirement for compliance with Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standard (FMVSS) 213 and are highly unlikely to affect future child safety seat performance.[26]\\r\\nChild restraints are sometimes the subject of manufacturing recalls.[27] Recalls vary in severity; sometimes the manufacturer will send an additional part for the seat, other times they will provide an entirely new seat.\\r\\nThe purchase of a used seat is not recommended. Due to the aforementioned concerns regarding expiry dates, crash testing, and recalls, it is often impossible to determine the history of the child restraint when it is purchased second-hand.\\r\\nChildren traveling by plane are safer in a child safety seat than in a parent's arms. The FAA and the AAP recommend that all children under 40 lb use a child safety seat on a plane. Booster seats cannot be used on airplanes because they don't have shoulder belts.\\r\\nParents should not put children into safety seats with thick winter coats on. The coat will flatten in an accident and the straps will not be snug enough to keep the child safe.[28] An alternative would be placing a coat on the child backwards after buckling the child in.\\r\\nStraps on the harness should be snug on the child, parents should not be able to pinch the straps away from the shoulders of the child. The straps also need to be placed at the proper height for the child.\\r\\nA study of car crash data from 16 U.S. states found that children under the age of 3 were 43% less likely to be injured in a car crash if their car seat was fastened in the center of the back seat rather than on one side. Results were based on data from 4,790 car crashes involving children aged 3 and younger between 1998 and 2006. According to data, the center position was the safest but least used position. However, economist Steven Levitt (see below) has demonstrated that car seats do not reduce fatalities when compared to regular seat belts.[29]\\r\\nThe move from having car seats in the front passenger seat to having them in the back seat, facing backwards, may make it easier for a busy, distracted parent to leave an infant in the car.[30] Each year, between 30 and 50 infants die of heat illness and hypothermia in the United States after being left in a car.[30]\\r\\nDirective 2003/20/EC of the European Parliament and the Council[31] has mandated the use of child-restraint systems in vehicles effective May 5, 2006. Children less than 135 centimetres (53?in) tall in vehicles must be restrained by an approved child restraint system suitable for the child's size.[32] In practice, child restraint systems must be able to be fitted to the front, or other rows of seats. Children may not be transported using a rearward-facing child restraint system in a passenger seat protected by a front air bag, unless the air bag has been deactivated.[citation needed]\\r\\nFor a child restraint to be sold or used within any of the 56 UNECE member states it must be approved by the standards of UNECE Regulation 44/04, Directive 77/541/EEC or any other subsequent adaptation thereto. In order to be granted ECE R44 approval the child restraint must comply with several design, construction and production conformity standards.[33] If approval is granted the seat can display an orange label with the unique approval license number, the type of approval, the mass group approved for and the details of the manufacturer.\\r\\nHowever, until May 9, 2008 member states may have permitted the use of child restraint systems approved in accordance with their national standards. EuroNCAP has developed a child-safety-protection rating to encourage improved designs. Points are awarded for universal child-restraint anchorages ISOFIX, the quality of warning labels and deactivation systems for front-passenger airbags.\\r\\n2013: New EU I-Size regulation is introduced: i-Size is the name of a new European safety regulation, UNECE Regulation 129 that affects car seats for children under 15 months of age. It came into effect in July 2013 and provides extra protection in several ways, most notably by providing rearward facing travel for children up to 15 months instead of 9 to 12 months, which the previous EU regulation advised. Read more about I-Size. This new regulation is to be phased in between 2013 and 2018 and will be run in parallel to UNECE R44/04 until 2018 when it completely supersedes it.\\r\\nAustralian laws regarding infants in motor vehicles were revised on November 9, 2009.[citation needed]\\r\\nBy law every child restraint sold in Australia must carry the Australian Standard AS/NZ1754 sticker (pictured right). Most overseas child restraints, including restraints from Europe and the USA, do not comply with these Standards and cannot legally be used in Australia. This also applies for ISOFIX child restraints imported from Europe or the USA.\\r\\nIn Australia there are six different types (Type A to Type F) of child restraints under the mandatory standard. Note: these restraints are NOT based on weight but on HEIGHT. All car seats with the AS/NZ1754 sticker will have height markers. These markers show clearly for what height the seat is appropriate.\\r\\nThe six types are:\\r\\nCombination Type A/B: Child restraints can also be a combination of the above types. For example, a Type A/B converter seat.\\r\\nThe responsibility for children under the age of 16 using restraints or safety belts correctly rests with the driver. In Queensland, penalties for drivers not ensuring that passengers under the age of 16 are properly restrained involve a fine of A$300 and three demerit points. In Victoria the penalty is a fine of A$234 and three demerit points.[citation needed] Possible suspension or cancellation of license may also apply.\\r\\nThe Israeli regulation states that a Sal Kal (he:?? ?? lit. easy basket) is equal to European group 0 and group 0+ regulations[38]\\r\\nAn Urban legend[39] in Israel states that nursery homes and hospitals will not allow exit with an infant if a SalKal (infant carry one safety seat) is not presented.[40]\\r\\nNZ Transport Agency governs the rules and sets standards for the health and safety aspects with respect to child restraints in New Zealand. Their guidelines dictate the minimum legal requirements for a New Zealand vehicle from the safety perspective. The correct fitting of a car seat can protect individuals and can be a lifesaver. This page provides details on qualified seat installation processes and approved standardized marks to look out for in child restraints. The Agency trains and certifies NZTA certified child restraint technicians who are authorized to install child safety seats.[41]\\r\\nSpecial rules apply to children travelling in vehicles first registered (in New Zealand or elsewhere) before 1 November 1979[43] since these vehicles are not required to be fitted with seat belts on all seats.\\r\\nAll child restraints must meet the standards set by the NZ Transport Agency. There are different marks to indicate this approval from the safety perspective. Approved marks/symbols are shown in the table below:[44]\\r\\nThe number after 'E' in the ECE 44 standard indicates as to which country certifies the child restraint. Hence the number differs between countries. The EU (European Union) also has similar symbols to indicate safety standards for children travelling in a vehicle.\\r\\nFrom September 18, 2006, All children under the age of 12 have to use some form of child car seat, unless they are taller than 135?cm (4?ft 5in).[45]\\r\\nThough there are hundreds of variations of makes and models in the world of child safety seats, the materials used in the manufacturing process are basically the same. Factories in which the seats are put together receive loads of polypropylene pellets.[47] Foam makes up the padding of the individual seats, while vinyl and fabrics are used to make up the covers for the seats as well as the harnesses.\\r\\nA safety seat increases the safety of a properly restrained child in the case of a motor vehicle accident. The safety seat includes foam padding, fabric covers, a harness, and buckles or attaching mechanisms. Labels and instructions are also attached. Every child safety seat will have an expiration date on it. The Safe Kids USA organization does not recommend using a child safety seat that is more than 6 years old[citation needed]. Periodically, child safety seats are recalled by manufacturers for safety reasons. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration posts a link to recent recall information at nhtsa.gov.\\r\\nThere are different types of child safety seats for children of different sizes and ages.\\r\\nManufacturers have quality controls to ensure seats are properly put together and packaged. However, it is not guaranteed that the included instructions are always adhered to and correctly followed. Up to 95% of the safety seats that are installed may not be the right seat for the child, may be hooked into the vehicle loosely, may be hooked with an incompatible belt in the vehicle, may have harnesses incorrectly fastened in some way, or may be incorrectly placed in front of air bags. In 1997, six out of ten children who were killed in vehicle crashes were not correctly restrained.[47]\\r\\nAlong with the problem of instructions not being followed properly, there are other hazards that can affect children involving these safety seats. A recent study[clarification needed] attributed many cases of sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) to the prolonged sitting or lying position these infants are in when putting the safety seats to use. When researchers reviewed more than 500 infant deaths, it was found that 17 of these deaths occurred while the infant was in a device such as a child safety seat. The age of the most occurring rates of death by SIDS in a child safety device was found to be under one month, having six of the 17 deaths happen in this age group. Although SIDS has been found to be a high risk regarding child safety seats, a coroner in Quebec also stated that putting infants in car seatscauses breathing problems and should be discouraged.\\"[50] His warning came after the death of a two-month-old boy who was left to nap in a child safety seat positioned inside his crib rather than the crib itself. The death was linked to positional asphyxiation.[50] This means that the child was in a position causing him to slowly lose his supply of oxygen. Coroner Jacques Robinson said it's common for a baby's head to slump forward while in a car seat that is not properly installed in a car and that can diminish a baby's ability to take in oxygen. \\"The car seat is for the car,\\" he said. \\"It's not for a bed or sleeping.\\" Robinson added, however, he has nothing against car seats when they are properly used. The coroner said that it is common for a babys head to slump forward while in a car seat and that it diminishes oxygen.[50]\\r\\nThe American Academy of Pediatrics says to make sure the seat is at the correct angle so your infants head does not flop forward. Many seats have angle indicators or adjusters that can help prevent this. If your seat does not have an angle adjuster, tilt the car safety seat back by putting a rolled towel or other firm padding (such as a pool noodle) under the base near the point where the back and bottom of the vehicle seat meet. Safety seats come with an instruction booklet with additional information on the appropriate angle for the seat.\\r\\nThere has been some criticism of forward-facing child safety seats, in particular by the economist Steven D. Levitt, author of the popular book Freakonomics. In a 2005 article in the New York Times, Levitt suggests that the available data does not support the necessity of forward-facing child safety seats for children over two years old, arguing that the cheaper and simpler alternative of seat belts offers similar protection as forward-facing seats.[51] Levitt was a guest at the TED conference in the same year, and gave a lecture making the same case.[29] Levitt's study and findings have been criticized and refuted by subsequent peer reviewed studies, which found child safety seats offer a considerable safety advantage over seat belts alone.[52]","input":"When did baby car seats become law uk?"},{"output":"September 2016","context":"OLED[4]\\r\\n38mm\\r\\n33.96?mm (1.337?in) diagonal, 272G340?pixels, 326?dpi\\r\\n42mm\\r\\n38.96?mm (1.534?in) diagonal, 312G390?pixels, 326?dpi\\r\\nBuilt-in rechargeable Li-Po battery\\r\\n38mm\\r\\n3.8 V 0.78 W{h (205 mA{h)[6][7]\\r\\n38?mm\\r\\n38.6?mm G?33.3?mm G?10.5?mm\\r\\n(1.52?in G?1.31?in G?0.41?in)\\r\\nApple Watch is a line of smartwatches designed, developed, and marketed by Apple Inc. It incorporates fitness tracking and health-oriented capabilities with integration with iOS and other Apple products and services.\\r\\nApple Watch relies on a wirelessly connected iPhone to perform many of its default functions such as calling and texting. Series 3 LTE Apple Watches are able to be used without needing to be consistently connected to an iPhone, though an iPhone is still required to set up the device. Most Apple Watches that are currently produced require an iPhone 5s or later with iOS 11; the Series 3 LTE model requires an iPhone 6 or later with iOS 11.[8]\\r\\nThe Apple Watch was released on April 24, 2015[9][10] and quickly became the best-selling wearable device with 4.2 million sold in the second quarter of the 2015 fiscal year.[11][12]\\r\\nThe second generation of Apple Watches were released in two tiers in September 2016: the Apple Watch Series 1 and Apple Watch Series 2, while the first generation was discontinued.[13][14]\\r\\nThe Apple Watch Series 3 was released on September 22, 2017 alongside the discontinuation of the Apple Watch Series 2.[15] Apple still produces the second-generation Series 1 Apple Watch as an entry-level device.[16]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe goal of the Apple Watch was to enhance the uses of an iPhone while also providing the user with some additional new features.[17] Kevin Lynch was hired by Apple to make wearable technology for the wrist. He said: \\"People are carrying their phones with them and looking at the screen so much. People want that level of engagement. But how do we provide it in a way that's a little more human, a little more in the moment when youre with somebody?\\"[17] Apple's development process was held very much under wraps until a Wired article revealed how some internal design decisions were made.[17]\\r\\nRumors surrounded an Apple-developed wearable device back as far as 2011, which conceptualized the device as a variation of the iPod that would curve around the user's wrist, and feature Siri integration.[18] On February 10, 2013, both The New York Times and The Wall Street Journal reported that Apple was beginning to develop an iOS-based smartwatch with a curved display.[19] On February 12, 2013, Bloomberg reported that Apple's smartwatch project was \\"beyond the experimentation phase in its development\\", and had a team of at least 100 designers working on the project.[20] Further reports in March 2013 indicated that Apple planned to release the device by the end of the year.[21] In July 2013, Financial Times reported that Apple had begun hiring more employees to work on the smartwatch, and that it was targeting a possible retail release in late 2014.[22]\\r\\nIn April 2014, Apple CEO Tim Cook told The Wall Street Journal that the company was planning to launch new product categories that year, but did not reveal any specifics.[23] In June 2014, Reuters reported that production was expected to begin in July for a release in October.[24]\\r\\nOn September 9, 2014, during a press event where the iPhone 6 was also presented, the new product was introduced by Tim Cook as \\"the next chapter in Apple's story\\" with a video that focused on its design and the various combinations of bands and case styles that would be available to the consumers. After the reveal video, the auditorium was filled with prolonged applause and a standing ovation as Tim Cook reappeared onstage wearing an Apple Watch. Cook explained that Apple Watch was \\"a precise timepiece, a new intimate way to communicate from your wrist, and a comprehensive health and fitness device.\\"[25][26]\\r\\nIn comparison to other Apple products and competing smartwatches, marketing of Apple Watch focused more on advertising the device as a fashion accessory; a 12-page advertising spread for Apple Watch in an issue of Vogue focused primarily on the different combinations of body and band styles available, and downplayed the technological aspects of it.[27][28] Apple later focused upon its health and fitness-oriented features, competing against dedicated activity trackers,[29] and with WatchOS 3, expanded on them with fitness tracking for wheelchair users, social sharing in the Activity app, and a Breathe app to encourage mindfulness.\\r\\nPre-orders for the Apple Watch began on April 10, 2015, with the official release on April 24.[30]\\r\\nThe device was not branded as \\"iWatch\\" (which would put it in line with its pre-existing product lines such as iPod, iPhone, and iPad) due to trademark conflicts in certain territories; in the United States, the \\"iWatch\\" trademark is owned by OMG Electronics ÿ who was crowdfunding a device under the same name, and is owned in the European Union by Irish firm Probendi.[31][32] In July 2015, Probendi sued Apple Inc. for trademark infringement, arguing that through keyword advertising on the Google search engine, it caused advertising for the Apple Watch to appear on search results pages when users searched for the trademarked term \\"iWatch\\".[33]\\r\\nInitially, the Apple Watch was not available at the Apple Store. Beginning on April 10, 2015, customers could make appointments for demonstrations and fitting, but the device was not in-stock for walk-in purchases and had to be reserved and ordered online. CNET felt that this distribution model was designed to prevent Apple Store locations from having long line-ups due to the high demand.[34][35] Selected Apple Watch models were available in limited quantities at luxury boutiques and authorized Apple resellers.[36] On June 4, 2015, Apple announced that it did plan to stock Apple Watch models at its retail locations.[35] On August 24, 2015, Best Buy announced that it would begin stocking Apple Watch at its retail stores by the end of September.[37] Both T-Mobile US and Sprint also announced plans to offer Apple Watch through its retail stores.[38]\\r\\nOn September 9, 2015, Apple launched a new subset of Apple Watch in collaboration with Herms. This collection, dubbed \\"Apple Watch Herms,\\" comes in a stainless steel body with crafted leather bands in distinctive styles from Herms.[39] The following year, Apple launched another subset of Apple Watches in collaboration with Nike dubbed \\"Apple Watch Nike+\\". Both subsets feature additional watch faces and bands exclusive to their branding, but otherwise function exactly like standard Apple Watches of their series.[40]\\r\\nApple Watch went on sale in India on November 6, 2015.[41] The device has also launched in Chile, the Philippines, Indonesia, and South Africa.[42][43]\\r\\nThe Apple Watch is available in multiple variants, distinguished by different combinations of casing and interchangeable bands.[44] The watch is available in two sizes: 38?mm (1.5?in) and 42?mm (1.7?in).[45] The design of the watch has not changed significantly since its release, so customizable bands and accessories are typically compatible with any Apple Watch of the associating size. The casing of the watch includes a mechanism to enable the straps to be interchangeable. For input, the watch includes a \\"digital crown\\", which can be turned to scroll or zoom and pressed to return to the home screen, and a touchscreen that features Force Touch technology, which makes it pressure-sensitive and capable of distinguishing between a tap and a press.[4] The watch also has a side button which can be used to display favorite contacts and access Apple Pay.[46] Apple rates the device's battery for 18 hours of mixed usage.[4][47] Apple Watch is charged by means of inductive charging, using a cable similar to the MagSafe cable from Apple's MacBook family of laptops.[9] If the watch's battery depletes to less than 10 percent, the user is alerted and offered to enable a \\"power reserve\\" mode, which allows the user to continue to read the time for an additional 72 hours. The watch then reverts to its original mode when recharged.[48]\\r\\nApple did not explicitly market the first generation Apple Watch as being waterproof, stating that it can withstand splashes of water (such as rain and hand washing), but does not recommend submersion (IPX7). However, external testing by The Iconfactory and others revealed that Apple Watch can function when submerged in various conditions (such as swimming), although its touchscreen experiences \\"erratic\\" behavior when submerged.[49][50]\\r\\nApple introduced a high level of water resistance with the release of the Apple Watch Series 2, and the device was explicitly advertised as being suitable for swimming and surfing.[51]\\r\\nThe first-generation Apple Watch uses the single-core S1 system-on-chip. It does not have a built-in GPS chip, instead relying on a paired iPhone for location services. It uses a linear actuator called the \\"Taptic Engine\\" to provide haptic feedback when an alert or a notification is received, and is used for other purposes by certain apps.[4] The watch is equipped with a built-in heart rate sensor, which uses both infrared and visible-light LEDs and photodiodes.[52] All versions of the first-generation Apple Watch have 8?GB of storage; the operating system allows the user to store up to 2?GB of music and 75?MB of photos. When the Apple Watch is paired with an iPhone, all music on that iPhone is also available to be controlled and accessed from the Apple Watch.[53]\\r\\nThe second generation has two tiers. The Series 1 has a variant of the Apple S2 processor with GPS removed known as the Apple S1P. It has a lower starting price than first generation watches.[54] The Series 2 has the dual-core Apple S2 processor, water resistance to 50?meters, a display twice as bright, and a GPS receiver.[54][51]\\r\\nThe third generation of the Apple Watch features a faster processor, the dual-core S3, Bluetooth 4.2 vs 4.0 on older models, a built-in altimeter for measuring flights of stairs climbed, increased RAM size, and is available in a variant with LTE cellular connectivity. Siri is able to speak on Apple Watch Series 3 due to the increased processing speed of the Watch.[55] The Series 3 Apple Watch is explicitly not compatible with iPhone 5 devices, requiring users to have an iPhone 5s or later for the GPS-only model, or an iPhone 6 or later for the cellular-enabled model.\\r\\nApple Watch runs watchOS, whose interface is based around a home screen with circular app icons. The OS can be navigated using the touchscreen or the crown on the side of the watch.[4] During its debut, the first generation Apple Watch needed to be paired with an iPhone 5 or later running iOS 8.2 or later; this version of iOS introduced the Apple Watch app, which is used to advertise Apple Watch, pairing with an iPhone, customize settings and loaded apps, and highlight compatible apps from the App Store.[4]\\r\\nWith the release of watchOS 4 and the Series 3 Apple Watch, iPhone 5 support was dropped, requiring users to use an iPhone 5s or later with iOS 11 to use watchOS 4. Apple Watches still running watchOS 3 or below remain compatible with the iPhone 5.\\r\\nThe Apple Watch is capable of receiving notifications, messages, and phone calls via a paired iPhone.[4] \\"Glances\\" allowed users to swipe between pages containing widget-like displays of information; however, this feature was replaced by a new Control Center. WatchOS also supports Handoff to send content from Apple Watch to an iOS or OS X device,[4] and act as a viewfinder for an iPhone camera,[46] Siri is also available for voice commands, and is capable of responding with voice prompts on the Series 3 watches.[4] Apple Watch also supports Apple Pay, and enables its use with older iPhone models that do not contain near-field communication (NFC) support.[4]\\r\\nApple Watch's default apps are designed to interact with their iOS counterparts, such as Mail, Phone, Calendar, Messages, Maps, Music, Photos, Reminders, Remote (which can control iTunes and Apple TV), Stocks, and Wallet.[4] Using the Activity and Workout apps, a user can track their physical activity and send data back to the iPhone for use in its Health app and other HealthKit-enabled software.[4] With WatchOS 3, Reminders, Home, Find My Friends, Heart Rate, and Breathe were added to the many stock apps.\\r\\nWatchOS 1.0.1 featured performance improvements and support for additional emoji and languages,[56] and was released on May 29, 2015. At WWDC 2015, Tim Cook announced watchOS 2.0; described by CNET as a \\"significant revamp\\", it included a new software development kit that allows more direct access to the device's hardware, new watch faces, the ability to reply to an e-mail, and other features.[57] watchOS 2.0 was set to be released on September 16, 2015, but was delayed due to a bug fix taking longer than expected;[58] it was instead released on September 21, 2015.[59]\\r\\nWatchOS 2.0 featured new features and more general improvements to Apple Watch. Following the software update, some users experienced issues with lag.[60]\\r\\nWatchOS 3.0 was announced at WWDC 2016, with a priority on performance. Users are able to keep apps running in memory as well as receive background updates and refreshed information. Other updates include a new Dock invoked with the side button to replace the performance-laden Glances, an updated Control Center, and new reply options on Messages. Several new watch faces have also been added, including Minnie Mouse, along with the ability to switch watch faces from the lock screen simply by swiping. A new feature called SOS allows users to hold the dock button to make a call to the local emergency line and pull up the user's Medical ID. Another feature is Activity Sharing, which allows sharing of workouts with friends and even sending their heartbeats to one another. A new app called Breathe guides users through breathing exercises throughout the day, with visuals and haptic feedback. watchOS 3.0 was released to developers on June 13, 2016 and was made available to the public on September 13, 2016.\\r\\nWatchOS 3.1 was released to the public on October 24, and watchOS 3.2 was released near the end of March, 2017.[61] Both updates added minor improvements and bug fixes.\\r\\nWatchOS 4.0 was announced at WWDC 2017 on June 5, 2017, and released to the public on September 19. WatchOS 4 features a proactive Siri watch face, personalized activity coaching, and an entirely redesigned music app. It also introduces GymKit, a technology platform to connect workouts with cardio equipment.\\r\\nWatchOS supports third-party applications; a WatchKit app runs in the background on the iPhone as an application extension while a set of native user interface resources are installed on Apple Watch.[62][needs update] Thus, watchOS apps must be bundled within their respective iOS app, and are synced to the watch either manually, or automatically upon installation of the phone app.[4]\\r\\nStarting June 1, 2016, the only new watch apps allowed on the App Store will be those developed with the watchOS 2 (or later) SDK; no third-party languages or SDKs can be used to develop apps.[63]\\r\\nAs of October 2017, three generations and four series of Apple Watch have been released. The series in bold are the current generation of the device:\\r\\nApple Watch Series 2 and Series 3 models are divided into four \\"collections\\": Apple Watch, Apple Watch Nike+, Apple Watch Herms and Apple Watch Edition. They are differentiated by combinations of cases, bands, and exclusive watch faces; Apple Watch comes with either aluminum or stainless steel cases, and various watch bands; Apple Watch Nike+ uses aluminum cases and special variants of sport band; Apple Watch Herms uses stainless steel cases and Herms watch bands; and Apple Watch Edition comes with ceramic cases (the original generation Apple Watch Edition used 18?karat gold).[64]\\r\\nApple Watch Series 1 models are only available with aluminum cases and sport bands.[65]\\r\\nApple Watch Series 3 models are sold in a variant that allows for cellular LTE capability.\\r\\nEach model comes in a 38- or 42-millimeter body, with the 42?mm size having a slightly larger screen and battery.[4] Each model has various color and band options. Featured Apple-made bands include colored sport bands, sport loop, woven nylon band, classic buckle, modern buckle, leather loop, milanese loop, and a link bracelet.[4]\\r\\n250?mAh, 3.78?V, 0.93?Wh battery capacity (42?mm)[citation needed]\\r\\n250?mAh, TBC?V, TBC?Wh battery capacity (42?mm)[citation needed]\\r\\n334?mAh, 3.80?V, 1.27?Wh battery capacity (42?mm)[citation needed]\\r\\nTBC?mAh, TBC?V, TBC?Wh battery capacity (42?mm)[citation needed]\\r\\nLTE: 279?mAh, 3.82?V, 1.07?Wh battery capacity (38?mm)[citation needed] 352?mAh,?TBC?V, 1.34?Wh battery capacity (42?mm)[citation needed]\\r\\nLTE: 36 kg CO2e[75]\\r\\nFollowing the announcement, initial impressions from technology and watch industry observers were varied; the watch was praised by some for its \\"design, potential capabilities and eventual usefulness\\",[76] while others offered criticism of these same aspects.[76] Venture capitalist Marc Andreessen said he \\"can't wait\\" to try it,[77] and Steve Jobs' biographer Walter Isaacson described it as \\"extremely cool\\" and an example of future technology that is \\"much more embedded into our lives\\".[78] However, Evan Dashevsky of PC Magazine said it offered nothing new in terms of functionality compared to the Moto 360, except the customizable vibration notifications.[79] In November 2014, Apple Watch was listed by Time as one of the 25 Best Inventions of 2014.[80]\\r\\nInitial reviews for the device have been generally positive with some caveats.[81] Reviewers praised the watch's potential ability to integrate into everyday life and the overall design of the product, but noted issues of speed and price. Many reviewers described the watch as functional and convenient, while also noting failure to offer as much potential functionality as preceding smartphones. Farhad Manjoo of The New York Times mentioned the device's steep learning curve, stating it took him \\"three long, often confusing and frustrating days\\" to become accustomed to it.[82] Some reviewers also compared it to competing products, such as Android Wear devices, and claimed \\"The Smartwatch Finally Makes Sense\\".[83] Reviewers had mixed opinions on battery life though, with Geoffrey Fowler of The Wall Street Journal saying \\"the battery lives up to its all-day billing, but sometimes just barely,\\"[83] and others compared it to the Samsung Gear 2, which \\"strolls through three days of moderate usage.\\"[84] Tim Bradshaw of the Financial Times used several applications over a period of days. He concluded that there is no \\"killer application\\" so far besides telling the time, which is the basic function of a wristwatch anyhow.[85]\\r\\nWhen using the Apple Watch, some users have reported issues using the heart monitoring feature due to permanent skin conditions including tattoos. The Watch uses photoplethysmography technology (PPG) which utilizes the green LED lights to measure heart rates.[86] To gauge a user's heart rate, the watch flashes green light from the LEDs at the skin and records the amount of this light that is absorbed by the red pigment of the blood.[87] However, under certain circumstances the skin may not allow for the light absorption to be read properly and thus provide inaccurate results.[88]\\r\\nSome users have complained that the logo and text on the back of the Apple Watch Sport model, primarily the space gray version,[89] can be easily worn off.[90]\\r\\nThe first generation Apple Watch Edition, where 18?k gold models retailed from US$10,000 to US$17,000, received a lukewarm reception as the Apple brand \\"hasnt established its value yet in gold\\" compared to similar-priced timepieces from Rolex and Patek Philippe.[citation needed] These Swiss luxury manufacturers were known for their \\"products intricate craftsmanship [that] justifies that high price tag\\". An analyst suggested What makes a high-end watch? Its the Swiss movements, the inner workings. Thats why collectors buy them. This [Apple Watch Edition] has none of that. Its inserting a high-end case on a piece of electronics which was not endlessly upgradable and would become obsolete in a couple years like other tech gadgets. In addition, Apple Retail Stores that carry the Apple Watch Edition would be totally antithetical to their current retail model, according to the Jewelers Security Alliance, since You cant have people touching it. You cant have it out on counters. You have the same problems that retail jewelers have, in terms of distraction thefts, in terms of switching, in terms of grab and runs\\".[91][92] Apple has apparently given up on competing in the luxury watch market after failing to make much headway, as the second-generation Apple Watch Edition is made of ceramic and sells for US$1,249.[93]\\r\\nFinancial analysts offered early sales estimates from a few million to as many as 34.7 million in the first year.[94] Time's Tim Bajarin summarized the breadth of reactions, writing that \\"there is not enough information yet to determine how this product will fare when it finally reaches the market next year\\".[76]\\r\\nOwing to the inadequacy of materials, the Apple Watch's delivery was delayed from its initial pre-order release date of April 10, 2015.[95] As a result, only 22 percent of the pre-ordered Apple Watches were dispatched in the United States during the weekend after the release date.[96] It is estimated Apple received almost one million Apple Watch pre-orders in the United States during the initial six hours of the pre-order period on April 10, 2015, after which it sold out and further orders would start delivering in June.[97] A report later on by an analyst stated that Apple Watch was already a $10 billion business during its first year.[98][99][100]\\r\\nApple has not disclosed any sales figures of for the Apple Watch.[101] An estimate by IDC states Apple shipped over 12 million units in 2015.[102] In late 2016, a veteran of the Swiss watch industry said Apple sold about 20 million watches and had a market share of about 50 percent.[103]","input":"When was the apple watch series 2 released?"},{"output":"white or slightly pink","context":"\\r\\n\\r\\nDuchesnea indica (sometimes called Potentilla indica), known commonly by the names mock strawberry, Indian strawberry, or false strawberry,[1] is a flowering plant in the family Rosaceae. It has foliage and an aggregate accessory fruit similar to that of a true strawberry. It has yellow flowers, unlike the white or slightly pink flowers of true strawberries. It is native to eastern and southern Asia, but has been introduced to many other areas as a medicinal and an ornamental plant.  It has been naturalized in many regions, including parts of the United States.[2][3][4]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe leaves are trifoliate, roughly veined beneath, dark green, and often persisting through the winter, arising from short crowns.

The intent is adding some of the speed of SSDs to the cost-effective storage capacity of traditional HDDs. The purpose of the SSD in a hybrid drive is to act as a cache for the data stored on the HDD, improving the overall performance by keeping copies of the most frequently used data on the faster SSD.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere are two main configurations for implementing hybrid drives: dual-drive hybrid systems and solid-state hybrid drives.  In dual-drive hybrid systems, physically separate SSD and HDD devices are installed in the same computer, having the data placement optimization performed either manually by the end user, or automatically by the operating system through the creation of a \\"hybrid\\" logical device.  In solid-state hybrid drives, SSD and HDD functionalities are built into a single piece of hardware, where data placement optimization is performed either entirely by the device (self-optimized mode), or through placement \\"hints\\" supplied by the operating system (host-hinted mode).\\r\\n\\r\\nThere are two main \\"hybrid\\" storage technologies that combine NAND flash memory or SSDs, with the HDD technology: dual-drive hybrid systems and solid-state hybrid drives.\\r\\n\\r\\nDual-drive hybrid systems combine the usage of separate SSD and HDD devices installed in the same computer.  Overall performance optimizations are managed in one of three ways:\\r\\n\\r\\nSolid-state hybrid drive (also known by the initialism SSHD[a]) refers to products that incorporate a significant amount of NAND flash memory into a hard disk drive (HDD), resulting in a single, integrated device.[7] The term SSHD is a more precise term than the more general hybrid drive, which has previously been used to describe SSHD devices and non-integrated combinations of solid-state drives (SSDs) and hard disk drives. The fundamental design principle behind SSHDs is to identify data elements that are most directly associated with performance (frequently accessed data, boot data, etc.) and store these data elements in the NAND flash memory. This has been shown[8] to be effective in delivering significantly improved performance over the standard HDD.\\r\\n\\r\\nAn example of an often confused dual-drive system being considered a SSHD is the use of laptops which combine separate SSD and HDD components into the same 2.5-inch HDD-size unit, while at the same time (unlike SSHDs) keeping these two components visible and accessible to the operating system as two distinct partitions. WD's Black2 drive is a typical example; the drive can either be used as a distinct SSD and HDD by partitioning it appropriately, or software can be used to automatically manage the SSD portion and present the drive to the user as a single large volume.[9]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the two forms of hybrid storage technologies (dual-drive hybrid systems and SSHDs), the goal is to combine HDD and a faster technology (often NAND flash memory) to provide a balance of improved performance and high-capacity storage availability. In general, this is achieved by placing \\"hot data\\", or data that is most directly associated with improved performance, on the \\"faster\\" part of the storage architecture.\\r\\n\\r\\nMaking decisions about which data elements are prioritized for NAND flash memory is at the core of SSHD technology.  Products offered by various vendors may achieve this through device firmware, through device drivers or through software modules and device drivers.\\r\\n\\r\\nHybrid-drive technology has come a long way with modern implementations improving over the past decade beginning in 2007:\\r\\n\\r\\nLate 2011 and early 2012 benchmarks using an SSHD consisting of a 750?GB HDD and 8?GB of NAND cache found that SSHDs did not offer SSD performance on random read/write and sequential read/write, but were faster than HDDs for application startup and shutdown.[18][19]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe 2011 benchmark included loading an image of a system that had been used heavily, running many applications, to bypass the performance advantage of a freshly-installed system; it found in real-world tests that performance was much closer to an SSD than to a mechanical HDD. Different benchmark tests found the SSHD to be between an HDD and SSD, but usually significantly slower than an SSD. In the case of uncached random access performance (multiple 4?KB random reads and writes) the SSHD was no faster than a comparable HDD; there is advantage only with data that is cached. The author concluded that the SSHD drive was the best non-SSD type of drive by a significant margin, and that the larger the solid-state cache, the better the performance.[19]","input":"What is a hybrid solid state hard drive?"},{"output":"in the early 20th century","context":"\\r\\n\\r\\nNote 1: The use of this term instead of polymer is a source of confusion and thus is not recommended.\\r\\n\\r\\nPlastic is material consisting of any of a wide range of synthetic or semi-synthetic organic compounds that are malleable and so can be molded into solid objects.\\r\\n\\r\\nPlasticity is the general property of all materials which can deform irreversibly without breaking but, in the class of moldable polymers, this occurs to such a degree that their actual name derives from this specific ability.\\r\\n\\r\\nPlastics are typically organic polymers of high molecular mass and often contain other substances. They are usually synthetic, most commonly derived from petrochemicals, however, an array of variants are made from renewable materials such as polylactic acid from corn or cellulosics from cotton linters.[2]\\r\\n\\r\\nDue to their low cost, ease of manufacture, versatility, and imperviousness to water, plastics are used in a multitude of products of different scale, including paper clips and spacecraft. They have prevailed over traditional materials, such as wood, stone, horn and bone, leather, metal, glass, and ceramic, in some products previously left to natural materials.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn developed economies, about a third of plastic is used in packaging and roughly the same in buildings in applications such as piping, plumbing or vinyl siding.[3] Other uses include automobiles (up to 20% plastic[3]), furniture, and toys.[3] In the developing world, the applications of plastic may differ  42% of India's consumption is used in packaging.[3]\\r\\n\\r\\nPlastics have many uses in the medical field as well, with the introduction of polymer implants and other medical devices derived at least partially from plastic. The field of plastic surgery is not named for use of plastic materials, but rather the meaning of the word plasticity, with regard to the reshaping of flesh.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe world's first fully synthetic plastic was bakelite, invented in New York in 1907 by Leo Baekeland[4] who coined the term 'plastics'.[5] Many chemists have contributed to the materials science of plastics, including Nobel laureate Hermann Staudinger who has been called \\"the father of polymer chemistry\\" and Herman Mark, known as \\"the father of polymer physics\\".[6]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe success and dominance of plastics starting in the early 20th century led to environmental concerns regarding its slow decomposition rate after being discarded as trash due to its composition of large molecules.  Toward the end of the century, one approach to this problem was met with wide efforts toward recycling.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe word plastic derives from the Greek ϫ?? (plastikos) meaning \\"capable of being shaped or molded\\" and, in turn, from ϫ?? (plastos) meaning \\"molded\\".[7][8]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe plasticity, or malleability, of the material during manufacture allows it to be cast, pressed, or extruded into a variety of shapes, such as: films, fibers, plates, tubes, bottles, boxes, amongst many others.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe common noun plastic should not be confused with the technical adjective plastic. The adjective is applicable to any material which undergoes a plastic deformation, or permanent change of shape, when strained beyond a certain point.\\r\\nFor example, aluminum which is stamped or forged exhibits plasticity in this sense, but is not plastic in the common sense. By contrast, some plastics will, in their finished forms, break before deforming and therefore are not plastic in the technical sense.\\r\\n\\r\\nMost plastics contain organic polymers.[9] The vast majority of these polymers are formed from chains of carbon atoms, 'pure' or with the addition of: oxygen, nitrogen, or sulfur. The chains comprise many repeat units, formed from monomers. Each polymer chain will have several thousand repeating units.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe backbone is the part of the chain that is on the \\"main path\\", linking together a large number of repeat units.\\r\\n\\r\\nTo customize the properties of a plastic, different molecular groups \\"hang\\" from this backbone. These pendant units are usually \\"hung\\" on the monomers, before the monomers themselves are linked together to form the polymer chain.  It is the structure of these side chains that influences the properties of the polymer.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe molecular structure of the repeating unit can be fine tuned to influence specific properties in the polymer.\\r\\n\\r\\nPlastics are usually classified by: the chemical structure of the polymer's backbone and side chains; some important groups in these classifications are: the acrylics, polyesters, silicones, polyurethanes, and halogenated plastics.\\r\\n\\r\\nPlastics can also be classified by: the chemical process used in their synthesis, such as: condensation, polyaddition, and cross-linking.[10]\\r\\n\\r\\nPlastics can also be classified by: their various physical properties, such as: hardness, density, tensile strength, resistance to heat and glass transition temperature, and by their chemical properties, such as the organic chemistry of the polymer and its resistance and reaction to various chemical products and processes, such as: organic solvents, oxidation, and ionizing radiation. In particular, most plastics will melt upon heating to a few hundred degrees celsius.[11]\\r\\n\\r\\nOther classifications are based on qualities that are relevant for manufacturing or product design. Examples of such qualities and classes are: thermoplastics and thermosets, conductive polymers, biodegradable plastics and engineering plastics and other plastics with particular structures, such as elastomers.\\r\\n\\r\\nOne important classification of plastics is by the permanence or impermanence of their form, or whether they are: thermoplastics or thermosetting polymers. \\r\\nThermoplastics are the plastics that, when heated, do not undergo chemical change in their composition and so can be molded again and again.  Examples include: polyethylene (PE), polypropylene (PP), polystyrene (PS) and polyvinyl chloride (PVC).[12] Common thermoplastics range from 20,000 to 500,000 amu, while thermosets are assumed to have infinite molecular weight.\\r\\n\\r\\nThermosets, or thermosetting polymers, can melt and take shape only once: after they have solidified, they stay solid.[13] In the thermosetting process, a chemical reaction occurs that is irreversible. The vulcanization of rubber is an example of a thermosetting process: before heating with sulfur, the polyisoprene is a tacky, slightly runny material; after vulcanization, the product is rigid and non-tacky.\\r\\n\\r\\nMany plastics are completely amorphous,[14] such as: all thermosets; polystyrene and its copolymers; and polymethyl methacrylate.\\r\\n\\r\\nHowever, some plastics are partially crystalline and partially amorphous in molecular structure, giving them both a melting point, the temperature at which the attractive intermolecular forces are overcome, and also one or more glass transitions, the temperatures above which the extent of localized molecular flexibility is substantially increased. These so-called semi-crystalline plastics include: polyethylene, polypropylene, polyvinyl chloride, polyamides (nylons), polyesters and some polyurethanes.\\r\\n\\r\\nIntrinsically Conducting Polymers (ICP) are organic polymers that conduct electricity. While plastics can be made electrically conductive, with a conductivity of up to 80 kS/cm in stretch-oriented polyacetylene,[15] they are still no match for most metals like copper which have a conductivity of several hundred kS/cm. Nevertheless, this is a developing field.\\r\\n\\r\\nBiodegradable plastics are plastics that degrade, or break down, upon exposure to: sunlight or ultra-violet radiation, water or dampness, bacteria, enzymes or wind abrasion. In some instances, rodent, pest, or insect attack can also be considered as forms of biodegradation or environmental degradation.\\r\\n\\r\\nSome modes of degradation require that the plastic be exposed at the surface (aerobic), whereas other modes will only be effective if certain conditions exist in landfill or composting systems (anaerobic).\\r\\n\\r\\nSome companies produce biodegradable additives, to enhance biodegradation. Plastic can have starch powder added as a filler to allow it to degrade more easily, but this still does not lead to the complete breaking down of the plastic.\\r\\n\\r\\nSome researchers have genetically engineered bacteria to synthesize completely biodegradable plastics, such as Biopol; however, these are expensive at present.[16]\\r\\n\\r\\nWhile most plastics are produced from petrochemicals, bioplastics are made substantially from renewable plant materials such: as cellulose and starch.[17] Due both to the finite limits of the petrochemical reserves and to the threat of global warming, the development of bioplastics is a growing field.\\r\\n\\r\\nHowever, bioplastic development begins from a very low base and, as yet, does not compare significantly with petrochemical production.  Estimates of the global production capacity for bio-derived materials is put at 327,000 tonnes/year. In contrast, global production of polyethylene (PE) and polypropylene (PP), the worlds leading petrochemical derived polyolefins, was estimated at over 150 million tonnes in 2015.[18]\\r\\n\\r\\nThis category includes both commodity plastics, or standard plastics, and engineering plastics.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe development of plastics has evolved from the use of natural plastic materials (e.g., chewing gum, shellac) to the use of chemically modified, natural materials (e.g., natural rubber, nitrocellulose, collagen, galalite) and finally to completely synthetic molecules (e.g., bakelite, epoxy, polyvinyl chloride). Early plastics were bio-derived materials such as egg and blood proteins, which are organic polymers. In around 1600 BC, Mesoamericans used natural rubber for balls, bands, and figurines.[3] Treated cattle horns were used as windows for lanterns in the Middle Ages.  Materials that mimicked the properties of horns were developed by treating milk-proteins (casein) with lye.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the nineteenth century, as industrial chemistry developed during the Industrial Revolution, many materials were reported.  The development of plastics also accelerated with Charles Goodyear's discovery of vulcanization to thermoset materials derived from natural rubber.\\r\\n\\r\\nParkesine (nitrocellulose) is considered the first man-made plastic. The plastic material was patented by Alexander Parkes, in Birmingham, England in 1856.[19]  It was unveiled at the 1862 Great International Exhibition in London.[20] Parkesine won a bronze medal at the 1862 World's fair in London. Parkesine was made from cellulose (the major component of plant cell walls) treated with nitric acid as a solvent. The output of the process (commonly known as cellulose nitrate or pyroxilin) could be dissolved in alcohol and hardened into a transparent and elastic material that could be molded when heated.[21] By incorporating pigments into the product, it could be made to resemble ivory.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1897, the Hanover, Germany mass printing press owner Wilhelm Krische was commissioned to develop an alternative to blackboards.[22] The resultant horn-like plastic made from the milk protein casein was developed in cooperation with the Austrian chemist (Friedrich) Adolph Spitteler (1846ÿ1940). The final result was unsuitable for the original purpose.[23] In 1893, French chemist Auguste Trillat discovered the means to insolubilize casein by immersion in formaldehyde, producing material marketed as galalith.[22]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the early 1900s, Bakelite, the first fully synthetic thermoset, was reported by Belgian chemist Leo Baekeland by using phenol and formaldehyde.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter World War I, improvements in chemical technology led to an explosion in new forms of plastics, with mass production beginning in the 1940s and 1950s (around World War II).[24]  Among the earliest examples in the wave of new polymers were polystyrene (PS), first produced by BASF in the 1930s,[3] and polyvinyl chloride (PVC), first created in 1872 but commercially produced in the late 1920s.[3]  In 1923, Durite Plastics Inc. was the first manufacturer of phenol-furfural resins.[25]  In 1933, polyethylene was discovered by Imperial Chemical Industries (ICI) researchers Reginald Gibson and Eric Fawcett.[3]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1954, polypropylene was discovered by Giulio Natta and began to be manufactured in 1957.[3]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1954, expanded polystyrene (used for building insulation, packaging, and cups) was invented by Dow Chemical.[3]\\r\\nPolyethylene terephthalate (PET)'s discovery is credited to employees of the Calico Printers' Association in the UK in 1941; it was licensed to DuPont for the USA and ICI otherwise, and as one of the few plastics appropriate as a replacement for glass in many circumstances, resulting in widespread use for bottles in Europe.[3]\\r\\n\\r\\nPlastics manufacturing is a major part of the chemical industry, and some of the world's largest chemical companies have been involved since the earliest days, such as the industry leaders BASF and Dow Chemical.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 2014, sales of the top fifty companies amounted to US$961,300,000,000.[26] The firms came from some eighteen countries in total, with more than half of the companies on the list being headquartered in the US. Many of the top fifty plastics companies were concentrated in just three countries:\\r\\n\\r\\nBASF was the world's largest chemical producer for the ninth year in a row.[26]\\r\\n\\r\\nTrade associations which represent the industry in the US include the American Chemistry Council.\\r\\n\\r\\nMany of the properties of plastics are determined by standards specified by ISO, such as:\\r\\n\\r\\nMany of the properties of plastics are determined by the UL Standards, tests specified by Underwriters Laboratories (UL), such as:\\r\\n\\r\\nBlended into most plastics are additional organic or inorganic compounds.  The average content of additives is a few percent.  Many of the controversies associated with plastics actually relate to the additives:[27] organotin compounds are particularly toxic.[28]\\r\\n\\r\\nTypical additives include:\\r\\n\\r\\nPolymer stabilizers prolong the lifetime of the polymer by suppressing degradation that results from UV-light, oxidation, and other phenomena.  Typical stabilizers thus absorb UV light or function as antioxidants.\\r\\n\\r\\nMany plastics[citation needed] contain fillers, to improve performance or reduce production costs.[29] Typically fillers are mineral in origin, e.g., chalk. Other fillers include: starch, cellulose, wood flour, ivory dust and zinc oxide.\\r\\n\\r\\nPlasticizers are, by mass, often the most abundant additives.[28] These oily but nonvolatile compounds are blended in to plastics to improve rheology, as many organic polymers are otherwise too rigid for particular applications.\\r\\n\\r\\nColorants are another common additive, though their weight contribution is small.\\r\\n\\r\\nPure plastics have low toxicity due to their insolubility in water and because they are biochemically inert, due to a large molecular weight. Plastic products contain a variety of additives, some of which can be toxic. For example, plasticizers like adipates and phthalates are often added to brittle plastics like polyvinyl chloride to make them pliable enough for use in food packaging, toys, and many other items. Traces of these compounds can leach out of the product. Owing to concerns over the effects of such leachates, the European Union has restricted the use of DEHP (di-2-ethylhexyl phthalate) and other phthalates in some applications, and the United States has limited the use of DEHP, DPB, BBP, DINP, DIDP, and DnOP in children's toys and child care articles with the Consumer Product Safety Improvement Act. Some compounds leaching from polystyrene food containers have been proposed to interfere with hormone functions and are suspected human carcinogens.[31] Other chemicals of potential concern include alkylphenols.[28]\\r\\n\\r\\nWhereas the finished plastic may be non-toxic, the monomers used in the manufacture of the parent polymers may be toxic.  In some cases, small amounts of those chemicals can remain trapped in the product unless suitable processing is employed. For example, the World Health Organization's International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) has recognized vinyl chloride, the precursor to PVC, as a human carcinogen.[31]\\r\\n\\r\\nSome polymers may also decompose into the monomers or other toxic substances when heated. In 2011, it was reported that \\"almost all plastic products\\" sampled released chemicals with estrogenic activity, although the researchers identified plastics which did not leach chemicals with estrogenic activity.[32]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe primary building block of polycarbonates, bisphenol A (BPA), is an estrogen-like endocrine disruptor that may leach into food.[31] Research in Environmental Health Perspectives finds that BPA leached from the lining of tin cans, dental sealants and polycarbonate bottles can increase body weight of lab animals' offspring.[33] A more recent animal study suggests that even low-level exposure to BPA results in insulin resistance, which can lead to inflammation and heart disease.[34]\\r\\n\\r\\nAs of January 2010, the LA Times newspaper reports that the United States FDA is spending $30 million to investigate indications of BPA being linked to cancer.[35]\\r\\n\\r\\nBis(2-ethylhexyl) adipate, present in plastic wrap based on PVC, is also of concern, as are the volatile organic compounds present in new car smell.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe European Union has a permanent ban on the use of phthalates in toys. In 2009, the United States government banned certain types of phthalates commonly used in plastic.[36]\\r\\n\\r\\nMost plastics are durable and degrade very slowly, as their chemical structure renders them resistant to many natural processes of degradation. However, microbial species capable of degrading plastics are known to science, and some are potentially useful for the disposal of certain classes of plastic waste.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere are differing estimates of how much plastic waste has been produced in the last century. By one estimate, one billion tons of plastic waste have been discarded since the 1950s.[59] Others estimate a cumulative human production of 8.3 billion tons of plastic of which 6.3 billion tons is waste, with a recycling rate of only 9%.[60] Much of this material may persist for centuries or longer, given the demonstrated persistence of structurally similar natural materials such as amber.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe presence of plastics, particularly microplastics, within the food chain is increasing. In the 1960s microplastics were observed in the guts of seabirds, and since then have been found in increasing concentrations.[61] The long-term effects of plastic in the food chain are poorly understood. In 2009, it was estimated that 10% of modern waste was plastic,[24] although estimates vary according to region.[61] Meanwhile, 50-80% of debris in marine areas is plastic.[61]\\r\\n\\r\\nPrior to the Montreal Protocol, CFCs were commonly used in the manufacture of polystyrene, and as such the production of polystyrene contributed to the depletion of the ozone layer.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe effect of plastics on global warming is mixed. Plastics are generally made from petroleum. If the plastic is incinerated, it increases carbon emissions; if it is placed in a landfill, it becomes a carbon sink[62] although biodegradable plastics have caused methane emissions.\\r\\n[63] Due to the lightness of plastic versus glass or metal, plastic may reduce energy consumption. For example, packaging beverages in PET plastic rather than glass or metal is estimated to save 52% in transportation energy.[3]\\r\\n\\r\\nProduction of plastics from crude oil requires 62 to 108 MJ/Kg (taking into account the average efficiency of US utility stations of 35%). Producing silicon and semiconductors for modern electronic equipment is even more energy consuming: 230 to 235 MJ/Kg of silicon, and about 3,000 MJ/Kg of semiconductors.[64] This is much higher than the energy needed to produce many other materials, e.g. iron (from iron ore) requires 20-25 MJ/Kg of energy, glass (from sand, etc.) 18-35 MJ/Kg, steel (from iron) 20-50 MJ/Kg, paper (from timber) 25-50 MJ/Kg.[65]\\r\\n\\r\\nControlled high-temperature incineration, above 850?C for two seconds,[66] performed with selective additional heating, breaks down toxic dioxins and furans from burning plastic, and is widely used in municipal solid waste incineration.[66] Municipal solid waste incinerators also normally include flue gas treatments to reduce pollutants further.[66] This is needed because uncontrolled incineration of plastic produces polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins, a carcinogen (cancer causing chemical). The problem occurs because the heat content of the waste stream varies.[67] Open-air burning of plastic occurs at lower temperatures, and normally releases such toxic fumes.\\r\\n\\r\\nPlastics can be pyrolyzed into hydrocarbon fuels, since plastics include hydrogen and carbon. One kilogram of waste plastic produces roughly a liter of hydrocarbon.[68]\\r\\n\\r\\nThermoplastics can be remelted and reused, and thermoset plastics can be ground up and used as filler, although the purity of the material tends to degrade with each reuse cycle. There are methods by which plastics can be broken down to a feedstock state.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe greatest challenge to the recycling of plastics is the difficulty of automating the sorting of plastic wastes, making it labor-intensive. Typically, workers sort the plastic by looking at the resin identification code, although common containers like soda bottles can be sorted from memory. Typically, the caps for PETE bottles are made from a different kind of plastic which is not recyclable, which presents additional problems for the sorting process. Other recyclable materials such as metals are easier to process mechanically. However, new processes of mechanical sorting are being developed to increase the capacity and efficiency of plastic recycling.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhile containers are usually made from a single type and color of plastic, making them relatively easy to sort, a consumer product like a cellular phone may have many small parts consisting of over a dozen different types and colors of plastics. In such cases, the resources it would take to separate the plastics far exceed their value and the item is discarded. However, developments are taking place in the field of active disassembly, which may result in more product components being reused or recycled. Recycling certain types of plastics can be unprofitable as well. For example, polystyrene is rarely recycled because the process is usually not cost effective. These unrecycled wastes are typically disposed of in landfills, incinerated or used to produce electricity at waste-to-energy plants.\\r\\n\\r\\nAn early success in the recycling of plastics is Vinyloop, an industrial process to separate PVC from other materials through dissolution, filtration and separation of contaminants. A solvent is used in a closed loop to elute PVC from the waste. This makes it possible to recycle composite PVC waste, which is normally incinerated or put in a landfill. Vinyloop-based recycled PVC's primary energy demand is 46 percent lower than conventionally produced PVC. The global warming potential is 39 percent lower. This is why the use of recycled material leads to a significantly better ecological outcome.[69] This process was used after the Olympic Games in London 2012. Parts of temporary Buildings like the Water Polo Arena and the Royal Artillery Barracks were recycled. In this way, the PVC Policy could be fulfilled, which says that no PVC waste should be left after the games had ended.[70]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1988, to assist recycling of disposable items, the Plastic Bottle Institute of the U.S. Society of the Plastics Industry devised a now-familiar scheme to mark plastic bottles by plastic type. Under this scheme, a plastic container is marked with a triangle of three \\"chasing arrows\\", which encloses a number denoting the plastic type:\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe first plastic based on a synthetic polymer was made from phenol and formaldehyde, with the first viable and cheap synthesis methods invented in 1907, by Leo Hendrik Baekeland, a Belgian-born American living in New York state. Baekeland was looking for an insulating shellac to coat wires in electric motors and generators. He found that combining phenol (C6H5OH) and formaldehyde (HCOH) formed a sticky mass and later found that the material could be mixed with wood flour, asbestos, or slate dust to create strong and fire resistant \\"composite\\" materials. The new material tended to foam during synthesis, requiring that Baekeland build pressure vessels to force out the bubbles and provide a smooth, uniform product, as he announced in 1909, in a meeting of the American Chemical Society.[72] Bakelite was originally used for electrical and mechanical parts, coming into widespread use in consumer goods and jewelry in the 1920s.  Bakelite was a purely synthetic material, not derived from living matter. It was also an early thermosetting plastic.\\r\\n\\r\\nUnplasticised polystyrene is a rigid, brittle, inexpensive plastic that has been used to make plastic model kits and similar knick-knacks. It also is the basis for some of the most popular \\"foamed\\" plastics, under the name styrene foam or Styrofoam. Like most other foam plastics, foamed polystyrene can be manufactured in an \\"open cell\\" form, in which the foam bubbles are interconnected, as in an absorbent sponge, and \\"closed cell\\", in which all the bubbles are distinct, like tiny balloons, as in gas-filled foam insulation and flotation devices. In the late 1950s, high impact styrene was introduced, which was not brittle. It finds much current use as the substance of toy figurines and novelties.\\r\\n\\r\\nPolyvinyl chloride (PVC, commonly called \\"vinyl\\")[73] incorporates chlorine atoms.  The C-Cl bonds in the backbone are hydrophobic and resist oxidation (and burning). PVC is stiff, strong, heat and weather resistant, properties that recommend its use in devices for plumbing, gutters, house siding, enclosures for computers and other electronics gear. PVC can also be softened with chemical processing, and in this form it is now used for shrink-wrap, food packaging, and rain gear.\\r\\n\\r\\nAll PVC polymers are degraded by heat and light. When this happens, hydrogen chloride is released into the atmosphere and oxidation of the compound occurs.[74] Because hydrogen chloride readily combines with water vapor in the air to form hydrochloric acid,[75] polyvinyl chloride is not recommended for long-term archival storage of silver, photographic film or paper (mylar is preferable).[76]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe plastics industry was revolutionized in the 1930s with the announcement of polyamide (PA), far better known by its trade name nylon. Nylon was the first purely synthetic fiber, introduced by DuPont Corporation at the 1939 World's Fair in New York City.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1927, DuPont had begun a secret development project designated Fiber66, under the direction of Harvard chemist Wallace Carothers and chemistry department director Elmer Keiser Bolton. Carothers had been hired to perform pure research, and he worked to understand the new materials' molecular structure and physical properties. He took some of the first steps in the molecular design of the materials.\\r\\n\\r\\nHis work led to the discovery of synthetic nylon fiber, which was very strong but also very flexible. The first application was for bristles for toothbrushes. However, Du Pont's real target was silk, particularly silk stockings. Carothers and his team synthesized a number of different polyamides including polyamide 6.6 and 4.6, as well as polyesters.[77]\\r\\n\\r\\nIt took DuPont twelve years and US$27 million to refine nylon, and to synthesize and develop the industrial processes for bulk manufacture. With such a major investment, it was no surprise that Du Pont spared little expense to promote nylon after its introduction, creating a public sensation, or \\"nylon mania\\".\\r\\n\\r\\nNylon mania came to an abrupt stop at the end of 1941 when the USA entered World War II. The production capacity that had been built up to produce nylon stockings, or just nylons, for American women was taken over to manufacture vast numbers of parachutes for fliers and paratroopers. After the war ended, DuPont went back to selling nylon to the public, engaging in another promotional campaign in 1946 that resulted in an even bigger craze, triggering the so-called nylon riots.\\r\\n\\r\\nSubsequently, polyamides 6, 10, 11, and 12 have been developed based on monomers which are ring compounds; e.g. caprolactam. Nylon 66 is a material manufactured by condensation polymerization.\\r\\n\\r\\nNylons still remain important plastics, and not just for use in fabrics. In its bulk form it is very wear resistant, particularly if oil-impregnated, and so is used to build gears, plain bearings, valve seats, seals and because of good heat-resistance, increasingly for under-the-hood applications in cars, and other mechanical parts.\\r\\n\\r\\nPoly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA), also known as acrylic or acrylic glass as well as by the trade names Plexiglas, Acrylite, Lucite, and Perspex among several others (see below), is a transparent thermoplastic often used in sheet form as a lightweight or shatter-resistant alternative to glass.  The same material can be utilised as a casting resin, in inks and coatings, and has many other uses.\\r\\n\\r\\nNatural rubber is an elastomer (an elastic hydrocarbon polymer) that originally was derived from latex, a milky colloidal suspension found in specialised vessels in some plants. It is useful directly in this form (indeed, the first appearance of rubber in Europe was cloth waterproofed with unvulcanized latex from Brazil). However, in 1839, Charles Goodyear invented vulcanized rubber; a form of natural rubber heated with sulfur (and a few other chemicals), forming cross-links between polymer chains (vulcanization), improving elasticity and durability.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1851, Nelson Goodyear added fillers to natural rubber materials to form ebonite.[30]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe first fully synthetic rubber was synthesized by Sergei Lebedev in 1910. In World War II, supply blockades of natural rubber from South East Asia caused a boom in development of synthetic rubber, notably styrene-butadiene rubber. In 1941, annual production of synthetic rubber in the U.S. was only 231 tonnes which increased to 840,000 tonnes in 1945. In the space race and nuclear arms race, Caltech researchers experimented with using synthetic rubbers for solid fuel for rockets. Ultimately, all large military rockets and missiles would use synthetic rubber based solid fuels, and they would also play a significant part in the civilian space effort.","input":"When did the use of plastic become popular?"},{"output":"May 1946","context":"The division of Korea between North and South Korea was the result of the Allied victory in World War?II in 1945, ending the Empire of Japan's 35-year rule of Korea.

The Korean king Gojong was removed. In the following decades, nationalist and radical groups emerged, mostly in exile, to struggle for independence. Divergent in their outlooks and approaches, these groups failed to unite in one national movement.[1][2] The Korean Provisional Government in China failed to obtain widespread recognition.[3]\\r\\nIn November 1943, Franklin Roosevelt, Winston Churchill and Chiang Kai-shek met at the Cairo Conference to discuss what should happen to Japan's colonies, and agreed that Japan should lose all the territories it had conquered by force. In the declaration after this conference, Korea was mentioned for the first time. The three powers declared that they were, \\"mindful of the enslavement of the people of Korea, ... determined that in due course Korea shall become free and independent.\\"[4][5]\\r\\nAt the Tehran Conference in November 1943 and the Yalta Conference in February 1945, the Soviet Union promised to join its allies in the Pacific War in two to three months after victory in Europe. On August 8, 1945, three months to the day after the end of hostilities in Europe, and two days after the atomic bomb was dropped on Hiroshima, the Soviet Union declared war on Japan.[6] Soviet troops advanced rapidly, and the US government became anxious that they would occupy the whole of Korea. On August 10, 1945 two young officers ÿ Dean Rusk and Charles Bonesteel ÿ were assigned to define an American occupation zone. Working on extremely short notice and completely unprepared, they used a National Geographic map to decide on the 38th parallel. They chose it because it divided the country approximately in half but would place the capital Seoul under American control. No experts on Korea were consulted. The two men were unaware that forty years before, Japan and pre-revolutionary Russia had discussed sharing Korea along the same parallel. Rusk later said that had he known, he \\"almost surely\\" would have chosen a different line.[7][8] The division placed sixteen million Koreans in the American zone and nine million in the Soviet zone.[9] To the surprise of the Americans, the Soviet Union immediately accepted the division. The agreement was incorporated into General Order No. 1 (approved on 17 August 1945) for the surrender of Japan.[10]\\r\\nSoviet forces began amphibious landings in Korea by August 14 and rapidly took over the north-east of the country, and on August 16 they landed at Wonsan.[11] On August 24, the Red Army reached Pyongyang.[10]\\r\\nGeneral Abe Nobuyuki, the last Japanese Governor-General of Korea, had established contact with a number of influential Koreans since the beginning of August 1945 to prepare the hand-over of power. Throughout August, Koreans organized people's committee branches for the \\"Committee for the Preparation of Korean Independence\\" (CPKI, ), headed by Lyuh Woon-hyung, a left-wing politician. On September 6, 1945, a congress of representatives was convened in Seoul and founded the short-lived People's Republic of Korea.[12][13]\\r\\nIn December 1945, at the Moscow Conference, the Allies agreed that the Soviet Union, the US, the Republic of China, and Britain would take part in a trusteeship over Korea for up to five years in the lead-up to independence. Many Koreans demanded independence immediately; however, the Korean Communist Party, which was closely aligned with the Soviet Communist party, supported the trusteeship.[14][15] The US President Franklin Roosevelt had initiated the idea of the trusteeship for Korea in 1943.[16]\\r\\nA Soviet-US Joint Commission met in 1946 and 1947 to work towards a unified administration, but failed to make progress due to increasing Cold War antagonism and to Korean opposition to the trusteeship.[17] Meanwhile, the division between the two zones deepened. The difference in policy between the occupying powers led to a polarization of politics, and a transfer of population between North and South.[18] In May 1946 it was made illegal to cross the 38th parallel without a permit.[19]\\r\\nWith the American government fearing Soviet expansion, and the Japanese authorities in Korea warning of a power vacuum, the embarkation date of the US occupation force was brought forward three times.[3]\\r\\nOn September 7, 1945, General Douglas MacArthur announced that Lieutenant General John R. Hodge was to administer Korean affairs, and Hodge landed in Incheon with his troops the next day. The Provisional Government of the Republic of Korea, which had operated from China, sent a delegation with three interpreters to Hodge, but he refused to meet with them.[20] Likewise, Hodge refused to recognize the newly formed People's Republic of Korea and its People's Committees, and outlawed it on 12 December.[21]\\r\\nIn September 1946, thousands of laborers and peasants rose up against the military government. This uprising was quickly defeated, and failed to prevent scheduled October elections for the South Korean Interim Legislative Assembly.\\r\\nThe ardent anti-communist Syngman Rhee, who had been the first president of the Provisional Government and later worked as a pro-Korean lobbyist in the US, became the most prominent politician in the South. On July 19, 1947, Lyuh Woon-hyung, the last senior politician committed to left-right dialogue, was assassinated by a right-winger.[22]\\r\\nThe government conducted a number of military campaigns against left-wing insurgents. Over the course of the next few years, between 30,000[23] and 100,000 people were killed.[24]\\r\\nWhen Soviet troops entered Pyongyang, they found a local branch of the Committee for the Preparation of Korean Independence operating under the leadership of veteran nationalist Cho Man-sik.[25] The Soviet Army allowed these \\"People's Committees\\" (which were friendly to the Soviet Union) to function. Colonel-General Terentii Shtykov set up the Soviet Civil Administration, taking control of the committees and placing communists in key positions.\\r\\nIn February 1946 a provisional government called the Provisional People's Committee was formed under Kim Il-sung, who had spent the last years of the war training with Soviet troops in Manchuria. Conflicts and power struggles ensued at the top levels of government in Pyongyang as different aspirants maneuvered to gain positions of power in the new government. In March 1946 the provisional government instituted a sweeping land-reform program: land belonging to Japanese and collaborator landowners was divided and redistributed to poor farmers.[26] Organizing the many poor civilians and agricultural laborers under the people's committees, a nationwide mass campaign broke the control of the old landed classes. Landlords were allowed to keep only the same amount of land as poor civilians who had once rented their land, thereby making for a far more equal distribution of land. The North Korean land reform was achieved in a less violent way than in China or in Vietnam. Official American sources stated: \\"From all accounts, the former village leaders were eliminated as a political force without resort to bloodshed, but extreme care was taken to preclude their return to power.\\"[27] The farmers responded positively; many collaborators and former landowners fled to the south, where some of them obtained positions in the new South Korean government. According to the U.S. military government, 400,000 northern Koreans went south as refugees.[28]\\r\\nKey industries were nationalized. The economic situation was nearly as difficult in the north as it was in the south, as the Japanese had concentrated agriculture in the south and heavy industry in the north.\\r\\nSoviet forces departed in 1948.[29]\\r\\nWith the failure of the Joint Commission to make progress, the US brought the problem before the United Nations in September 1947. The Soviet Union opposed UN involvement. At that time, the US had more influence over the UN than the USSR.[30] The UN passed a resolution on November 14, 1947, declaring that free elections should be held, foreign troops should be withdrawn, and a UN commission for Korea, the United Nations Temporary Commission on Korea (UNTCOK), should be created. The Soviet Union boycotted the voting and did not consider the resolution to be binding, arguing that the UN could not guarantee fair elections. In the absence of Soviet co-operation, it was decided to hold UN-supervised elections in the south only.[31][32] Some UNTCOK delegates felt that the conditions in the south gave unfair advantage to right-wing candidates, but they were overruled.[33]\\r\\nThe decision to proceed with separate elections was unpopular among many Koreans, who rightly saw it as a prelude to a permanent division of the country. General strikes in protest against the decision began in February 1948.[19] In April, Jeju islanders rose up against the looming division of the country. South Korean troops were sent to repress the rebellion. Tens of thousands of islanders were killed and by one estimate, 70% of the villages were burned by the South Korean troops.[34] The uprising flared up again with the outbreak of the Korean War.[35]\\r\\nIn April 1948, a conference of organizations from the north and the south met in Pyongyang, but the conference produced no results. The southern politicians Kim Koo and Kim Kyu-sik attended the conference and boycotted the elections in the south, as did other politicians and parties.[36][37] Kim Koo was assassinated the following year.[38]\\r\\nOn May 10, 1948 the south held a general election. On August 15, the \\"Republic of Korea\\" formally took over power from the U.S. military, with Syngman Rhee as the first president. In the North, the \\"Democratic People's Republic of Korea\\" was declared on September 9, with Kim Il-sung as prime minister.\\r\\nOn December 12, 1948, the United Nations General Assembly accepted the report of UNTCOK and declared the Republic of Korea to be the \\"only lawful government in Korea\\".[39]\\r\\nUnrest continued in the South. In October 1948, the YeosuÿSuncheon Rebellion took place, in which some regiments rejected the suppression of the Jeju uprising and rebelled against the government.[40] In 1949, the Syngman Rhee government established the Bodo League in order to keep an eye on its political opponents. The majority of the Bodo League's members were innocent farmers and civilians who were forced into membership.[41] The registered members or their families were executed at the beginning of the Korean War. On December 24, 1949, South Korean Army massacred Mungyeong citizens who were suspected communist sympathizers or their family and affixed blame to communists.[42]\\r\\nThis division of Korea, after more than a millennium of being unified, was seen as controversial and temporary by both regimes. From 1948 until the start of the civil war on June 25, 1950, the armed forces of each side engaged in a series of bloody conflicts along the border. In 1950, these conflicts escalated dramatically when North Korean forces invaded South Korea, triggering the Korean War. The North overran much of the South until pushed back by a US-led United Nations intervention. The UN forces then occupied most of the North, until Chinese forces intervened and restored communist control of the North.\\r\\nThe Korean Armistice Agreement was signed after three years of war. The two sides agreed to create a four-kilometer-wide buffer zone between the states, known as the Korean Demilitarized Zone (DMZ). This new border, reflecting the territory held by each side at the end of the war, crossed the 38th parallel diagonally.\\r\\nAs dictated by the terms of the Korean Armistice, a Geneva Conference was held in 1954 on the Korean question. Despite efforts by many of the nations involved, the conference ended without a declaration for a unified Korea.\\r\\nThe Armistice established a Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission (NNSC) which was tasked to monitor the Armistice. Since 1953, members of the Swiss[43] and Swedish[44] Armed Forces have been members of the NNSC stationed near the DMZ.\\r\\nSince the war, Korea has remained divided along the DMZ. North and South have remained in a state of conflict, with the opposing regimes both claiming to be the legitimate government of the whole country. Sporadic negotiations have failed to produce lasting progress towards reunification.[45]","input":"When did south korea and north korea split?"},{"output":"summer of 2005","context":"Love Island (originally Celebrity Love Island) is a British reality television programme that was aired on  ITV. In the show, twelve single celebrities spent five weeks on an island in Fiji. It was originally presented by Patrick Kielty and Kelly Brook, with Fearne Cotton taking over as female host in the second series. The first series aired in the summer of 2005, and it was won by Jayne Middlemiss and Fran Cosgrave. The second series began in July 2006, dropping Celebrity from its name. It was won by Bianca Gascoigne and Calum Best.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe theme tune for the first series was \\"Wish I\\", performed by Jem. A specially-composed summer theme by Daniel Pemberton (later released under the title \\"From Fiji with Love\\") was used for the second series.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe show was axed in November 2006. On 13 February 2015, it was announced that Love Island would return on ITV2 in 2015. It was later announced that Caroline Flack would host the revived series,[1] starting on 7 June 2015.\\r\\n\\r\\nViewers would vote for the couple they would like to see in the \\"love shack\\" where the two would get to know one another better. In the first series, each week viewers voted celebrities off the island, but in the second, the inhabitants had the final say. The identities of those being kicked out were revealed in the elimination episodes. The prize for the final couple left standing was S50,000. The second series also featured the inhabitants having to cook and clean up after themselves to fight the appearance that they were just there for a free holiday.[2][3]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe first series was broadcast during the summer of 2005.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe show attracted controversy from the moment it was announced by ITV. It was marketed as a rival for Channel 4's popular reality show, Big Brother, which returned for a sixth series soon after the show's launch. Many commentators felt that the format of the show provided low quality television as an excuse to attract high ratings.\\r\\n\\r\\nFollowing the launch of the show, the celebrities were criticised by viewers for being boring, and the celebrity status of some of the participants was questioned. There was some suspicion that the contestants were simply using the programme as a free holiday, and the tabloids claimed that producers held crisis meetings to figure out how to keep things interesting.[4]\\r\\n\\r\\nSoon afterwards, tabloid reports claimed that the show's presenters, Kelly Brook and Patrick Kielty, were engaged in a bitter feud. The problems between the pair allegedly started after Kielty told viewers on the live show that Brook had previously been involved in a relationship with one of the contestants, Paul Danan.[5] However, even the promise of fireworks between the two hosts was not enough to keep viewers interested, and one episode of the show only attracted less than 2 million viewers. Producers later hired model Nikki Ziering to spice up the show.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe show was also resented by fans of long-running ITV soap Coronation Street. ITV decided to move its flagship programme from 19:30 to 20:30 on Monday nights, to provide a successful lead-in for Love Island, in the hope of increasing ratings. Writers John Fay and Daran Little complained to the press about the treatment of the show. ITV argued that it took the decision to move the soap very seriously and only did so when absolutely necessary. A meeting was requested with ITV programming director Nigel Pickard to discuss the issue.[6]\\r\\n\\r\\nOn 10 June 2005, although ratings were beginning to pick up, with the show close to overtaking Big Brother in popularity, a strong storm over the islands of Fiji disrupted the programme. A live eviction show had to be cancelled as six-foot waves made it impossible for crewmembers to cross over to where the celebrities were staying. Instead, ITV was forced to repeat the episode from the previous night with unseen footage.\\r\\n\\r\\nShekoni was the first celebrity to be voted off the show by the public. \\"For the short period I was there I got on with everybody and didn't have any negative experiences. But when I watch it now I just think, oh God, I had a lucky escape that I didn't end up crying in front of the cameras, or getting rejected by any of the guys, or involved in any of the arguments. I know my family are just pleased that I got out and didn't do anything to ruin my integrity and morals and didn't do anything embarrassing in there. I knew almost instantly that I didn't fancy any of them, and I think that's why I got voted out. That's fair enough because it is supposed to be the love island and I obviously hadn't found love. I'm still looking, though, and I've been out searching ever since.\\"[7]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe second series first aired on 10 July, and ran for seven weeks, a little longer than the previous year's series. It was announced in late May 2006 that Fearne Cotton would be Kielty's new co-host with Series 1 winner Jayne Middlemiss presenting Aftersun with Matt Brown on ITV2. It also has a new sponsor, popular chocolate bar Bounty.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn 6 July the list of contestants was announced, with the news that the word \\"Celebrity\\" would be dropped from the show title, due to the inclusion of non celebrities.[8]\\r\\n\\r\\n10 Julyÿ28 August, seven weeks, 17 contestants and 3 house guests:\\r\\n\\r\\nOn 18 July, Steve-O was added to the show in an effort to boost ratings. Despite stating he has stopped drinking he asked for beer while on the show. On 19 July, he abruptly left Love Island because he was not allowed enough alcohol or chocolate.[9]\\r\\n\\r\\nLady Victoria Hervey was voted off the show on Friday 21 July although her chosen man Chris Brosnan had been the favourite to leave. Hervey told hosts Patrick Kielty and Fearne Cotton that she hoped the relationship would continue in the real world but then had second thoughts when she was shown footage of Brosnan saying that he also liked Colleen.\\r\\n\\r\\nBasketball legend Dennis Rodman entered the show on the third week on 27 July as a House guest to boost the ratings. he flirted with Colleen Shannon, and created friction with Lee Otway before walking in the midst of an argument between Lee and Paul Danan, on his fourth day on 30 July out of the seven contracted until 3 August 2006.\\r\\n\\r\\nIdentical twins Emma and Eve Ryan joined the Love Island on 31 July, but were ejected from the show by producers on 4 August. No explanation was given to the public.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was announced on 6 August that Calum Best would enter Love Island next day. Also on 6 August, it was confirmed on the Love Island website that Shane Lynch had left the island to make up with a woman back home.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn 14 August, Big Brother 3 winner Kate Lawler entered Love Island. On final night, 28 August 2006, Kate Lawler was the last girl to be evicted before the final showdown.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe winners were Bianca Gascoigne and Calum Best, with Kll Bryan and Brendan Cole runners-up.\\r\\n\\r\\nAn average of 3.8 million people tuned in to watch the final, peaking at 4.4m, down from the previous year's peak figure of 5.9 million.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe show did not always go head to head with Channel 4's Big Brother, as Big Brother aired at 9pm on Tuesdays, Saturdays and Sundays and only clashed on Mondays, Wednesdays, Thursdays and Fridays with Love Island at 10pm. However, many terrestrial viewers in Wales could only watch Big Brother at a fixed 10.00pm slot every night on S4C which also broadcast the show due to many Welsh terrestrial televisions failing to receive Channel 4. Love Island's audience was about half the size of that for Big Brother.[10]\\r\\n\\r\\nOn 24 November 2006, ITV revealed that a third series would not be made.[11]\\r\\n\\r\\nOn 13 February 2015, it was announced that a new revived show, also called Love Island, would air in summer 2015 on ITV2. ITV's Director of Digital and Acquisitions Angela Jain confirmed the revived show would be revamped and will see non-celebrity contestants compete to survive a public vote each week.[12] The new series is hosted by Caroline Flack and produced for ITV2 by ITV Studios.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn a negative review of the first series for The Guardian, Charlie Brooker writes that the show is \\"just a rehash of I'm A Celebrity, minus the elements that made that show successful\\". Brooker criticises that the show \\"openly sneers\\" at Abi Titmuss' weight, calls Paul Danan a \\"bell end of considerable magnitude\\", jokes that the Fran Cosgrave is so little well-known that \\"he doesn't actually exist outside shows like this\\" and insults the presenting of Patrick Kielty and Kelly Brook, described respectively as \\"a man you wish would shut up before he even starts speaking, and a woman who can scarcely talk in the first place\\".[13]","input":"What year did the first love island start?"},{"output":"from 1887ÿ89","context":"The Eiffel Tower (/?a?f?l/ EYE-f?l; French: tour Eiffel [tuf?l]?(?listen)) is a wrought iron lattice tower on the Champ de Mars in Paris, France. It is named after the engineer Gustave Eiffel, whose company designed and built the tower.\\r\\nConstructed from 1887ÿ89 as the entrance to the 1889 World's Fair, it was initially criticized by some of France's leading artists and intellectuals for its design, but it has become a global cultural icon of France and one of the most recognisable structures in the world.[3] The Eiffel Tower is the most-visited paid monument in the world; 6.91?million people ascended it in 2015.\\r\\nThe tower is 324 metres (1,063?ft) tall, about the same height as an 81-storey building, and the tallest structure in Paris. Its base is square, measuring 125 metres (410?ft) on each side. During its construction, the Eiffel Tower surpassed the Washington Monument to become the tallest man-made structure in the world, a title it held for 41 years until the Chrysler Building in New York City was finished in 1930. Due to the addition of a broadcasting aerial at the top of the tower in 1957, it is now taller than the Chrysler Building by 5.2 metres (17?ft). Excluding transmitters, the Eiffel Tower is the second tallest structure in France after the Millau Viaduct.\\r\\nThe tower has three levels for visitors, with restaurants on the first and second levels. The top level's upper platform is 276?m (906?ft) above the ground ÿ the highest observation deck accessible to the public in the European Union. Tickets can be purchased to ascend by stairs or lift (elevator) to the first and second levels. The climb from ground level to the first level is over 300 steps, as is the climb from the first level to the second. Although there is a staircase to the top level, it is usually accessible only by lift.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe design of the Eiffel Tower was the product of Maurice Koechlin and mile Nouguier, two senior engineers working for the Compagnie des tablissements Eiffel, after discussion about a suitable centrepiece for the proposed 1889 Exposition Universelle, a world's fair to celebrate the centennial of the French Revolution. Eiffel openly acknowledged that inspiration for a tower came from the Latting Observatory built in New York City in 1853.[4] In May 1884, working at home, Koechlin made a sketch of their idea, described by him as \\"a great pylon, consisting of four lattice girders standing apart at the base and coming together at the top, joined together by metal trusses at regular intervals\\".[5] Eiffel initially showed little enthusiasm, but he did approve further study, and the two engineers then asked Stephen Sauvestre, the head of company's architectural department, to contribute to the design. Sauvestre added decorative arches to the base of the tower, a glass pavilion to the first level, and other embellishments.\\r\\nThe new version gained Eiffel's support: he bought the rights to the patent on the design which Koechlin, Nougier, and Sauvestre had taken out, and the design was exhibited at the Exhibition of Decorative Arts in the autumn of 1884 under the company name. On 30 March 1885, Eiffel presented his plans to the Socit des Ingnieurs Civils; after discussing the technical problems and emphasising the practical uses of the tower, he finished his talk by saying the tower would symbolise,\\r\\nNot only the art of the modern engineer, but also the century of Industry and Science in which we are living, and for which the way was prepared by the great scientific movement of the eighteenth century and by the Revolution of 1789, to which this monument will be built as an expression of France's gratitude.[6]\\r\\nLittle progress was made until 1886, when Jules Grvy was re-elected as president of France and douard Lockroy was appointed as minister for trade. A budget for the exposition was passed and, on 1 May, Lockroy announced an alteration to the terms of the open competition being held for a centrepiece to the exposition, which effectively made the selection of Eiffel's design a foregone conclusion, as entries had to include a study for a 300?m (980?ft) four-sided metal tower on the Champ de Mars.[6] (A 300-meter tower was then considered a herculean engineering effort). On 12 May, a commission was set up to examine Eiffel's scheme and its rivals, which, a month later, decided that all the proposals except Eiffel's were either impractical or lacking in details.\\r\\nAfter some debate about the exact location of the tower, a contract was signed on 8 January 1887. This was signed by Eiffel acting in his own capacity rather than as the representative of his company, and granted him 1.5 million francs toward the construction costs: less than a quarter of the estimated 6.5 million francs. Eiffel was to receive all income from the commercial exploitation of the tower during the exhibition and for the next 20 years. He later established a separate company to manage the tower, putting up half the necessary capital himself.[7]\\r\\nThe proposed tower had been a subject of controversy, drawing criticism from those who did not believe it was feasible and those who objected on artistic grounds. These objections were an expression of a long-standing debate in France about the relationship between architecture and engineering. It came to a head as work began at the Champ de Mars: a \\"Committee of Three Hundred\\" (one member for each metre of the tower's height) was formed, led by the prominent architect Charles Garnier and including some of the most important figures of the arts, such as Adolphe Bouguereau, Guy de Maupassant, Charles Gounod and Jules Massenet. A petition called \\"Artists against the Eiffel Tower\\" was sent to the Minister of Works and Commissioner for the Exposition, Charles Alphand, and it was published by Le Temps on 14 February 1887:\\r\\nWe, writers, painters, sculptors, architects and passionate devotees of the hitherto untouched beauty of Paris, protest with all our strength, with all our indignation in the name of slighted French taste, against the erection  of this useless and monstrous Eiffel Tower  To bring our arguments home, imagine for a moment a giddy, ridiculous tower dominating Paris like a gigantic black smokestack, crushing under its barbaric bulk Notre Dame, the Tour Saint-Jacques, the Louvre, the Dome of les Invalides, the Arc de Triomphe, all of our humiliated monuments will disappear in this ghastly dream. And for twenty years  we shall see stretching like a blot of ink the hateful shadow of the hateful column of bolted sheet metal.[8]\\r\\nGustave Eiffel responded to these criticisms by comparing his tower to the Egyptian pyramids: \\"My tower will be the tallest edifice ever erected by man. Will it not also be grandiose in its way? And why would something admirable in Egypt become hideous and ridiculous in Paris?\\"[9] These criticisms were also dealt with by douard Lockroy in a letter of support written to Alphand, ironically saying,[10] \\"Judging by the stately swell of the rhythms, the beauty of the metaphors, the elegance of its delicate and precise style, one can tell this protest is the result of collaboration of the most famous writers and poets of our time\\", and he explained that the protest was irrelevant since the project had been decided upon months before, and construction on the tower was already under way.\\r\\nIndeed, Garnier was a member of the Tower Commission that had examined the various proposals, and had raised no objection. Eiffel was similarly unworried, pointing out to a journalist that it was premature to judge the effect of the tower solely on the basis of the drawings, that the Champ de Mars was distant enough from the monuments mentioned in the protest for there to be little risk of the tower overwhelming them, and putting the aesthetic argument for the tower: \\"Do not the laws of natural forces always conform to the secret laws of harmony?\\"[11]\\r\\nSome of the protesters changed their minds when the tower was built; others remained unconvinced.[12] Guy de Maupassant supposedly ate lunch in the tower's restaurant every day because it was the one place in Paris where the tower was not visible.[13]\\r\\nBy 1918, it had become a symbol of Paris and of France after Guillaume Apollinaire wrote a nationalist poem in the shape of the tower (a calligram) to express his feelings about the war against Germany.[14] Today, it is widely considered to be a remarkable piece of structural art, and is often featured in films and literature.\\r\\nWork on the foundations started on 28 January 1887.[15] Those for the east and south legs were straightforward, with each leg resting on four 2?m (6.6?ft) concrete slabs, one for each of the principal girders of each leg. The west and north legs, being closer to the river Seine, were more complicated: each slab needed two piles installed by using compressed-air caissons 15?m (49?ft) long and 6?m (20?ft) in diameter driven to a depth of 22?m (72?ft)[16] to support the concrete slabs, which were 6?m (20?ft) thick. Each of these slabs supported a block of limestone with an inclined top to bear a supporting shoe for the ironwork.\\r\\nEach shoe was anchored to the stonework by a pair of bolts 10?cm (4?in) in diameter and 7.5?m (25?ft) long. The foundations were completed on 30 June, and the erection of the ironwork began. The visible work on-site was complemented by the enormous amount of exacting preparatory work that took place behind the scenes: the drawing office produced 1,700 general drawings and 3,629 detailed drawings of the 18,038 different parts needed.[17] The task of drawing the components was complicated by the complex angles involved in the design and the degree of precision required: the position of rivet holes was specified to within 0.1?mm (0.0039?in) and angles worked out to one second of arc. The finished components, some already riveted together into sub-assemblies, arrived on horse-drawn carts from a factory in the nearby Parisian suburb of Levallois-Perret and were first bolted together, with the bolts being replaced with rivets as construction progressed. No drilling or shaping was done on site: if any part did not fit, it was sent back to the factory for alteration. In all, 18,038 pieces were joined together using 2.5?million rivets.[15]\\r\\nAt first the legs were constructed as cantilevers, but about halfway to the first level, construction was paused in order to create a substantial timber scaffold. This renewed concerns about the structural integrity of the tower, and sensational headlines such as \\"Eiffel Suicide!\\" and \\"Gustave Eiffel Has Gone Mad: He Has Been Confined in an Asylum\\" appeared in the tabloid press.[18] At this stage, a small \\"creeper\\" crane designed to move up the tower was installed in each leg. They made use of the guides for the lifts which were to be fitted in the four legs. The critical stage of joining the legs at the first level was completed by the end of March 1888.[15] Although the metalwork had been prepared with the utmost attention to detail, provision had been made to carry out small adjustments in order to precisely align the legs; hydraulic jacks were fitted to the shoes at the base of each leg, capable of exerting a force of 800 tonnes, and the legs were intentionally constructed at a slightly steeper angle than necessary, being supported by sandboxes on the scaffold. Although construction involved 300 on-site employees,[15] only one person died thanks to Eiffel's stringent safety precautions and the use of movable gangways, guardrails and screens[citation needed].\\r\\nThe start of the erection of the metalwork.\\r\\n7 December 1887: Construction of the legs with scaffolding.\\r\\n20 March 1888: Completion of the first level.\\r\\n15 May 1888: Start of construction on the second stage.\\r\\n21 August 1888: Completion of the second level.\\r\\n26 December 1888: Construction of the upper stage.\\r\\n15 March 1889: Construction of the cupola.\\r\\nEquipping the tower with adequate and safe passenger lifts was a major concern of the government commission overseeing the Exposition. Although some visitors could be expected to climb to the first level, or even the second, lifts clearly had to be the main means of ascent.[19]\\r\\nConstructing lifts to reach the first level was relatively straightforward: the legs were wide enough at the bottom and so nearly straight that they could contain a straight track, and a contract was given to the French company Roux, Combaluzier & Lepape for two lifts to be fitted in the east and west legs.[20] Roux, Combaluzier & Lepape used a pair of endless chains with rigid, articulated links to which the car was attached. Lead weights on some links of the upper or return sections of the chains counterbalanced most of the car's weight. The car was pushed up from below, not pulled up from above: to prevent the chain buckling, it was enclosed in a conduit. At the bottom of the run, the chains passed around 3.9?m (12?ft 10?in) diameter sprockets. Smaller sprockets at the top guided the chains.[20]\\r\\nInstalling lifts to the second level was more of a challenge because a straight track was impossible. No French company wanted to undertake the work. The European branch of Otis Brothers & Company submitted a proposal but this was rejected: the fair's charter ruled out the use of any foreign material in the construction of the tower. The deadline for bids was extended but still no French companies put themselves forward, and eventually the contract was given to Otis in July 1887.[21] Otis were confident they would eventually be given the contract and had already started creating designs.\\r\\nThe car was divided into two superimposed compartments, each holding 25 passengers, with the lift operator occupying an exterior platform on the first level. Motive power was provided by an inclined hydraulic ram 12.67?m (41?ft 7?in) long and 96.5?cm (38.0?in) in diameter in the tower leg with a stroke of 10.83?m (35?ft 6?in): this moved a carriage carrying six sheaves. Five fixed sheaves were mounted higher up the leg, producing an arrangement similar to a block and tackle but acting in reverse, multiplying the stroke of the piston rather than the force generated. The hydraulic pressure in the driving cylinder was produced by a large open reservoir on the second level. After being exhausted from the cylinder, the water was pumped back up to the reservoir by two pumps in the machinery room at the base of the south leg. This reservoir also provided power to the lifts to the first level.\\r\\nThe original lifts for the journey between the second and third levels were supplied by Lon Edoux. A pair of 81?m (266?ft) hydraulic rams were mounted on the second level, reaching nearly halfway up to the third level. One lift car was mounted on top of these rams: cables ran from the top of this car up to sheaves on the third level and back down to a second car. Each car only travelled half the distance between the second and third levels and passengers were required to change lifts halfway by means of a short gangway. The 10-ton cars each held 65 passengers.[22]\\r\\nThe main structural work was completed at the end of March 1889 and, on 31 March, Eiffel celebrated by leading a group of government officials, accompanied by representatives of the press, to the top of the tower.[12] Because the lifts were not yet in operation, the ascent was made by foot, and took over an hour, with Eiffel stopping frequently to explain various features. Most of the party chose to stop at the lower levels, but a few, including the structural engineer, mile Nouguier, the head of construction, Jean Compagnon, the President of the City Council, and reporters from Le Figaro and Le Monde Illustr, completed the ascent. At 2:35?pm, Eiffel hoisted a large Tricolour to the accompaniment of a 25-gun salute fired at the first level.[23]\\r\\nThere was still work to be done, particularly on the lifts and facilities, and the tower was not opened to the public until nine days after the opening of the exposition on 6 May; even then, the lifts had not been completed. The tower was an instant success with the public, and nearly 30,000 visitors made the 1,710-step climb to the top before the lifts entered service on 26 May.[24] Tickets cost 2 francs for the first level, 3 for the second, and 5 for the top, with half-price admission on Sundays,[25] and by the end of the exhibition there had been 1,896,987 visitors.[3]\\r\\nAfter dark, the tower was lit by hundreds of gas lamps, and a beacon sent out three beams of red, white and blue light. Two searchlights mounted on a circular rail were used to illuminate various buildings of the exposition. The daily opening and closing of the exposition were announced by a cannon at the top.\\r\\nOn the second level, the French newspaper Le Figaro had an office and a printing press, where a special souvenir edition, Le Figaro de la Tour, was made. There was also a patisserie.\\r\\nAt the top, there was a post office where visitors could send letters and postcards as a memento of their visit. Graffitists were also catered for: sheets of paper were mounted on the walls each day for visitors to record their impressions of the tower. Gustave Eiffel described some of the responses as vraiment curieuse (\\"truly curious\\").[26]\\r\\nFamous visitors to the tower included the Prince of Wales, Sarah Bernhardt, \\"Buffalo Bill\\" Cody (his Wild West show was an attraction at the exposition) and Thomas Edison.[24] Eiffel invited Edison to his private apartment at the top of the tower, where Edison presented him with one of his phonographs, a new invention and one of the many highlights of the exposition.[27] Edison signed the guestbook with this message:\\r\\nTo M Eiffel the Engineer the brave builder of so gigantic and original specimen of modern Engineering from one who has the greatest respect and admiration for all Engineers including the Great Engineer the Bon Dieu, Thomas Edison.\\r\\nEiffel had a permit for the tower to stand for 20 years. It was to be dismantled in 1909, when its ownership would revert to the City of Paris. The City had planned to tear it down (part of the original contest rules for designing a tower was that it should be easy to dismantle) but as the tower proved to be valuable for communication purposes, it was allowed to remain after the expiry of the permit.\\r\\nEiffel made use of his apartment at the top of the tower to carry out meteorological observations, and also used the tower to perform experiments on the action of air resistance on falling bodies.[28]\\r\\nFor the 1900 Exposition Universelle, the lifts in the east and west legs were replaced by lifts running as far as the second level constructed by the French firm Fives-Lille. These had a compensating mechanism to keep the floor level as the angle of ascent changed at the first level, and were driven by a similar hydraulic mechanism to the Otis lifts, although this was situated at the base of the tower. Hydraulic pressure was provided by pressurised accumulators located near this mechanism.[21] At the same time the lift in the north pillar was removed and replaced by a staircase to the first level. The layout of both first and second levels was modified, with the space available for visitors on the second level. The original lift in the south pillar was removed 13 years later.\\r\\nOn 19 October 1901, Alberto Santos-Dumont, flying his No.6 airship, won a 100,000-franc prize offered by Henri Deutsch de la Meurthe for the first person to make a flight from St. Cloud to the Eiffel Tower and back in less than half an hour.[29]\\r\\nMany innovations took place at the Eiffel Tower in the early 20th century. In 1910, Father Theodor Wulf measured radiant energy at the top and bottom of the tower. He found more at the top than expected, incidentally discovering what are known today as cosmic rays.[30] Just two years later, on 4 February 1912, Austrian tailor Franz Reichelt died after jumping from the first level of the tower (a height of 57 metres) to demonstrate his parachute design.[31] In 1914, at the outbreak of World War?I, a radio transmitter located in the tower jammed German radio communications, seriously hindering their advance on Paris and contributing to the Allied victory at the First Battle of the Marne.[32] From 1925 to 1934, illuminated signs for Citro?n adorned three of the tower's sides, making it the tallest advertising space in the world at the time.[citation needed] In April 1935, the tower was used to make experimental low-resolution television transmissions, using a shortwave transmitter of 200 watts power. On 17 November, an improved 180-line transmitter was installed.[33]\\r\\nOn two separate but related occasions in 1925, the con artist Victor Lustig \\"sold\\" the tower for scrap metal.[34] A year later, in February 1926, pilot Leon Collet was killed trying to fly under the tower. His aircraft became entangled in an aerial belonging to a wireless station.[35] A bust of Gustave Eiffel by Antoine Bourdelle was unveiled at the base of the north leg on 2 May 1929.[36] In 1930, the tower lost the title of the world's tallest structure when the Chrysler Building in New York City was completed.[37] In 1938, the decorative arcade around the first level was removed.[38]\\r\\nUpon the German occupation of Paris in 1940, the lift cables were cut by the French. The tower was closed to the public during the occupation and the lifts were not repaired until 1946.[39] In 1940, German soldiers had to climb the tower to hoist a swastika-centered Reichskriegsflagge,[40] but the flag was so large it blew away just a few hours later, and was replaced by a smaller one.[41] When visiting Paris, Hitler chose to stay on the ground. When the Allies were nearing Paris in August 1944, Hitler ordered General Dietrich von Choltitz, the military governor of Paris, to demolish the tower along with the rest of the city. Von Choltitz disobeyed the order.[42] On 25 June, before the Germans had been driven out of Paris, the German flag was replaced with a Tricolour by two men from the French Naval Museum, who narrowly beat three men led by Lucien Sarniguet, who had lowered the Tricolour on 13 June 1940 when Paris fell to the Germans.[39]\\r\\nA fire started in the television transmitter on 3 January 1956, damaging the top of the tower. Repairs took a year, and in 1957, the present radio aerial was added to the top.[43] In 1964, the Eiffel Tower was officially declared to be a historical monument by the Minister of Cultural Affairs, Andr Malraux.[44] A year later, an additional lift system was installed in the north pillar.[45]\\r\\nAccording to interviews, in 1967, Montreal Mayor Jean Drapeau negotiated a secret agreement with Charles de Gaulle for the tower to be dismantled and temporarily relocated to Montreal to serve as a landmark and tourist attraction during Expo 67. The plan was allegedly vetoed by the company operating the tower out of fear that the French government could refuse permission for the tower to be restored in its original location.[46]\\r\\nIn 1982, the original lifts between the second and third levels were replaced after 97 years in service. These had been closed to the public between November and March because the water in the hydraulic drive tended to freeze. The new cars operate in pairs, with one counterbalancing the other, and perform the journey in one stage, reducing the journey time from eight minutes to less than two minutes. At the same time, two new emergency staircases were installed, replacing the original spiral staircases. In 1983, the south pillar was fitted with an electrically driven Otis lift to serve the Jules Verne restaurant.[citation needed] The Fives-Lille lifts in the east and west legs, fitted in 1899, were extensively refurbished in 1986. The cars were replaced, and a computer system was installed to completely automate the lifts. The motive power was moved from the water hydraulic system to a new electrically driven oil-filled hydraulic system, and the original water hydraulics were retained solely as a counterbalance system.[45] A service lift was added to the south pillar for moving small loads and maintenance personnel three years later.\\r\\nRobert Moriarty flew a Beechcraft Bonanza under the tower on 31 March 1984.[47] In 1987, A.J. Hackett made one of his first bungee jumps from the top of the Eiffel Tower, using a special cord he had helped develop. Hackett was arrested by the police.[48] On 27 October 1991, Thierry Devaux, along with mountain guide Herv Calvayrac, performed a series of acrobatic figures while bungee jumping from the second floor of the tower.[49] Facing the Champ de Mars, Devaux used an electric winch between figures to go back up to the second floor. When firemen arrived, he stopped after the sixth jump.[citation needed]\\r\\nFor its \\"Countdown to the Year 2000\\" celebration on 31 December 1999, flashing lights and high-powered searchlights were installed on the tower. Fireworks were set off all over it. An exhibition above a cafeteria on the first floor commemorates this event. The searchlights on top of the tower made it a beacon in Paris's night sky, and 20,000 flashing bulbs gave the tower a sparkly appearance for five minutes every hour on the hour.[50]\\r\\nThe lights sparkled blue for several nights to herald the new millennium On 31 December 2000. The sparkly lighting continued for 18 months until July 2001. The sparkling lights were turned on again on 21 June 2003, and the display was planned to last for 10 years before they needed replacing.[51]\\r\\nThe tower received its 200,000,000th guest on 28 November 2002.[52] The tower has operated at its maximum capacity of about 7?million visitors since 2003.[53] In 2004, the Eiffel Tower began hosting a seasonal ice rink on the first level.[54] A glass floor was installed on the first level during the 2014 refurbishment.[55]\\r\\nThe puddled iron (wrought iron) of the Eiffel Tower weighs 7,300 tons,[56] and the addition of lifts, shops and antennae have brought the total weight to approximately 10,100?tons.[57] As a demonstration of the economy of design, if the 7,300?tons of metal in the structure were melted down, it would fill the square base, 125 metres (410?ft) on each side, to a depth of only 6.25?cm (2.46?in) assuming the density of the metal to be 7.8?tons per cubic metre.[58] Additionally, a cubic box surrounding the tower (324?m x 125?m x 125?m) would contain 6,200?tons of air, weighing almost as much as the iron itself. Depending on the ambient temperature, the top of the tower may shift away from the sun by up to 18?cm (7?in) due to thermal expansion of the metal on the side facing the sun.[59]\\r\\nWhen it was built, many were shocked by the tower's daring form. Eiffel was accused of trying to create something artistic with no regard to the principles of engineering. However, Eiffel and his team ÿ experienced bridge builders ÿ understood the importance of wind forces, and knew that if they were going to build the tallest structure in the world, they had to be sure it could withstand them. In an interview with the newspaper Le Temps published on 14 February 1887, Eiffel said:\\r\\nIs it not true that the very conditions which give strength also conform to the hidden rules of harmony?  Now to what phenomenon did I have to give primary concern in designing the Tower? It was wind resistance. Well then! I hold that the curvature of the monument's four outer edges, which is as mathematical calculation dictated it should be  will give a great impression of strength and beauty, for it will reveal to the eyes of the observer the boldness of the design as a whole.[60]\\r\\nHe used graphical methods to determine the strength of the tower and empirical evidence to account for the effects of wind, rather than a mathematical formula. Close examination of the tower reveals a basically exponential shape.[61] All parts of the tower were over-designed to ensure maximum resistance to wind forces. The top half was even assumed to have no gaps in the latticework.[62] In the years since it was completed, engineers have put forward various mathematical hypotheses in an attempt to explain the success of the design. The most recent, devised in 2004 after letters sent by Eiffel to the French Society of Civil Engineers in 1885 were translated into English, is described as a non-linear integral equation based on counteracting the wind pressure on any point of the tower with the tension between the construction elements at that point.[61]\\r\\nThe Eiffel Tower sways by up to 9?centimetres (3.5?in) in the wind.[63]\\r\\nWhen originally built, the first level contained three restaurantsone French, one Russian and one Flemishand an \\"Anglo-American Bar\\". After the exposition closed, the Flemish restaurant was converted to a 250-seat theatre. A promenade 2.6-metre (8?ft 6?in) wide ran around the outside of the first level. At the top, there were laboratories for various experiments, and a small apartment reserved for Gustave Eiffel to entertain guests, which is now open to the public, complete with period decorations and lifelike mannequins of Eiffel and some of his notable guests.[64]\\r\\nIn May 2016, an apartment was created on the first level to accommodate four competition winners during the UEFA Euro 2016 football tournament in Paris in June. The apartment has a kitchen, two bedrooms, a lounge, and views of Paris landmarks including the Seine, the Sacre Coeur, and the Arc de Triomphe.[65]\\r\\nThe arrangement of the lifts has been changed several times during the tower's history. Given the elasticity of the cables and the time taken to align the cars with the landings, each lift, in normal service, takes an average of 8 minutes and 50 seconds to do the round trip, spending an average of 1 minute and 15 seconds at each level. The average journey time between levels is 1 minute. The original hydraulic mechanism is on public display in a small museum at the base of the east and west legs. Because the mechanism requires frequent lubrication and maintenance, public access is often restricted. The rope mechanism of the north tower can be seen as visitors exit the lift.[citation needed]\\r\\nGustave Eiffel engraved on the tower the names of 72 French scientists, engineers and mathematicians in recognition of their contributions to the building of the tower. Eiffel chose this \\"invocation of science\\" because of his concern over the artists' protest. At the beginning of the 20th century, the engravings were painted over, but they were restored in 1986ÿ87 by the Socit Nouvelle d'exploitation de la Tour Eiffel, a company operating the tower.[66]\\r\\nThe tower is painted in three shades: lighter at the top, getting progressively darker towards the bottom to complement the Parisian sky.[67] It was originally reddish brown; this changed in 1968 to a bronze colour known as \\"Eiffel Tower Brown\\".[68]\\r\\nThe only non-structural elements are the four decorative grill-work arches, added in Sauvestre's sketches, which served to make the tower look more substantial and to make a more impressive entrance to the exposition.[69]\\r\\nA pop-culture movie clich is that the view from a Parisian window always includes the tower.[70] In reality, since zoning restrictions limit the height of most buildings in Paris to seven storeys, only a small number of tall buildings have a clear view of the tower.[citation needed]\\r\\nMaintenance of the tower includes applying 60?tons of paint every seven years to prevent it from rusting. The tower has been completely repainted at least 19 times since it was built. Lead paint was still being used as recently as 2001 when the practice was stopped out of concern for the environment.[51]\\r\\nThe nearest Paris Mtro station is Bir-Hakeim and the nearest RER station is Champ de Mars-Tour Eiffel.[71] The tower itself is located at the intersection of the quai Branly and the Pont d'Ina.\\r\\nMore than 250?million people have visited the tower since it was completed in 1889.[3] In 2015, there were 6.91?million visitors.[72] The tower is the most-visited paid monument in the world.[73] An average of 25,000 people ascend the tower every day which can result in long queues.[74] Tickets can be purchased online to avoid the long queues.\\r\\nThe tower has two restaurants: Le 58 Tour Eiffel on the first level, and Le Jules Verne, a gourmet restaurant with its own lift on the second level. This restaurant has one star in the Michelin Red Guide. It is run by the multi-Michelin star chef Alain Ducasse[75] and owes its name to the famous science-fiction writer Jules Verne. Additionally, there is a champagne bar at the top of the Eiffel Tower.\\r\\nAs one of the most iconic landmarks in the world, the Eiffel Tower has been the inspiration for the creation of many replicas and similar towers. An early example is Blackpool Tower in England. The mayor of Blackpool, Sir John Bickerstaffe, was so impressed on seeing the Eiffel Tower at the 1889 exposition that he commissioned a similar tower to be built in his town. It opened in 1894 and is 158.1?metres (518?ft) tall.[76] Tokyo Tower in Japan, built as a communications tower in 1958, was also inspired by the Eiffel Tower.[77]\\r\\nThere are various scale models of the tower in the United States, including a half-scale version at the Paris Las Vegas, Nevada, one in Paris, Texas built in 1993, and two 1:3 scale models at Kings Island, Ohio, and Kings Dominion, Virginia, amusement parks opened in 1972 and 1975 respectively. Two 1:3 scale models can be found in China, one in Durango, Mexico that was donated by the local French community, and several across Europe.[78]\\r\\nIn 2011, the TV show Pricing the Priceless on the National Geographic Channel speculated that a full-size replica of the tower would cost approximately US$480?million to build.[79]\\r\\nThe tower has been used for making radio transmissions since the beginning of the 20th century. Until the 1950s, sets of aerial wires ran from the cupola to anchors on the Avenue de Suffren and Champ de Mars. These were connected to longwave transmitters in small bunkers. In 1909, a permanent underground radio centre was built near the south pillar, which still exists today. On 20 November 1913, the Paris Observatory, using the Eiffel Tower as an aerial, exchanged wireless signals with the United States Naval Observatory, which used an aerial in Arlington, Virginia. The object of the transmissions was to measure the difference in longitude between Paris and Washington, D.C.[80] Today, radio and digital television signals are transmitted from the Eiffel Tower.\\r\\nA television antenna was first installed on the tower in 1957, increasing its height by 18.7?m (61.4?ft). Work carried out in 2000 added a further 5.3?m (17.4?ft), giving the current height of 324?m (1,063?ft).[51] Analogue television signals from the Eiffel Tower ceased on 8 March 2011.\\r\\nThe tower and its image have long been in the public domain.[81] In June 1990 a French court ruled that a special lighting display on the tower in 1989 to mark the tower's 100th anniversary was an \\"original visual creation\\" protected by copyright. The Court of Cassation, France's judicial court of last resort, upheld the ruling in March 1992.[82] The Socit d'Exploitation de la Tour Eiffel (SETE) now considers any illumination of the tower to be a separate work of art that falls under copyright.[83] As a result, the SNTE alleges that it is illegal to publish contemporary photographs of the lit tower at night without permission in France and some other countries for commercial use.[84][85]\\r\\nThe imposition of copyright has been controversial. The Director of Documentation for what was then called the Socit Nouvelle d'exploitation de la Tour Eiffel (SNTE), Stphane Dieu, commented in 2005: \\"It is really just a way to manage commercial use of the image, so that it isn't used in ways [of which] we don't approve\\".[86] SNTE made over ?1?million from copyright fees in 2002.[87] However, it could also be used to restrict the publication of tourist photographs of the tower at night, as well as hindering non-profit and semi-commercial publication of images of the illuminated tower.[81]\\r\\nFrench doctrine and jurisprudence allows pictures incorporating a copyrighted work as long as their presence is incidental or accessory to the subject being represented,[88] a reasoning akin to the de minimis rule. Therefore, SETE may be unable to claim copyright on photographs of Paris which happen to include the lit tower.\\r\\nThe Eiffel Tower was the world's tallest structure when completed in 1889, a distinction it retained until 1929 when the Chrysler Building in New York City was topped out.[89] The tower has lost its standing both as the world's tallest structure and the world's tallest lattice tower but retains its status as the tallest freestanding (non-guyed) structure in France.","input":"When was the eiffel tower built in france?"},{"output":"Emirates Stadium","context":"The Emirates Stadium (known as Ashburton Grove prior to sponsorship, and as Arsenal Stadium for UEFA competitions) is a football stadium in Holloway, London, England, and the home of Arsenal Football Club. With a capacity of over 60,000, it is the third-largest football stadium in England after Wembley Stadium and Old Trafford.\\r\\nIn 1997, Arsenal explored the possibility of relocating to a new stadium, having been denied planning permission by Islington Council to expand its home ground of Highbury. After considering various options (including purchasing Wembley Stadium), the club bought an industrial and waste disposal estate in Ashburton Grove in 2000. A year later, they received the council's approval to build a stadium on the site; manager Arsne Wenger described this as the \\"biggest decision in Arsenal's history\\" since the board appointed Herbert Chapman.[4] Relocation began in 2002, but financial difficulties delayed work until February 2004. Emirates was later announced as the main sponsor for the stadium. The entire stadium project was completed in 2006 at a cost of S390?million.[2] The club's former stadium was redeveloped as Highbury Square for an additional S130?million.[5][6]\\r\\nThe stadium has undergone a process of \\"Arsenalisation\\" since 2009 with the aim of restoring Arsenal's heritage and history. The ground has hosted international fixtures and music concerts.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nSpectator safety at football grounds was a major concern for clubs and governing bodies during the 1980s. In May 1985, a fire engulfed Valley Parade, claiming the lives of 56 football fans.[7] Rioting between Liverpool and Juventus supporters during the 1985 European Cup Final led to 39 fatalities and 600 injured in what became known as the Heysel Stadium disaster.[8] In April 1989, 96 Liverpool supporters died in Britain's worst sporting tragedy ÿ the Hillsbrough disaster ÿ because of South Yorkshire Police's failure to control crowds.[9] An inquest was immediately launched into the human crush and crowd safety at sports grounds.[10] Led by Lord Taylor of Gosforth, the Taylor Report was finalised in January 1990 and recommended the removal of terraces (standing areas) in favour of seating.[11]\\r\\nUnder the amended Football Spectators Act 1989, it became compulsory for first and second tier English clubs to have their stadia all-seated in time for the 1994ÿ95 season.[12] Arsenal, like many other clubs, experienced difficulty raising income for converted terraced areas.[13] At the end of the 1990ÿ91 season, the club introduced a bond scheme which offered supporters the right to purchase a season ticket at its renovated North Bank stand of Highbury.[13] The board felt this was the only viable option after considering other proposals; they did not want to compromise on traditions nor curb manager George Graham's transfer dealings.[14] At a price of between S1,000 to S1,500, the 150-year bond was criticised by supporters, who argued it potentially blocked the participation of those less well-off from supporting Arsenal.[15] A campaign directed by the Independent Arsenal Supporters' Association brought relative success as only a third of all bonds were sold.[16]\\r\\nThe North Bank was the final stand to be refurbished. It opened in August 1993 at a cost of S20?million.[17] The rework significantly reduced the stadium's capacity, from 57,000 at the beginning of the decade to under 40,000.[18] High ticket prices to serve the club's existing debts and low attendance figures forced Arsenal to explore the possibility of building a larger stadium in 1997. The club wanted to attract an evergrowing fanbase and financially compete with the biggest clubs in England.[18][19] By comparison, Manchester United enjoyed a rise in gate receipts; the club went from S43.9?million in 1994 to S87.9?million in 1997 because of Old Trafford's expansion.[20]\\r\\nArsenal's initial proposal to rebuild Highbury was met with disapproval from local residents, as it required the demolition of 25 neighbouring houses.[21] It later became problematic once the East Stand of the stadium was granted Grade II listing in July 1997.[22] After much consultation, the club abandoned its plan, deciding a capacity of 48,000 was not large enough.[23] Arsenal then investigated the possibility of relocating to Wembley Stadium and in March 1998 made an official bid to purchase the ground.[24][25] The Football Association (FA) and the English National Stadium Trust opposed Arsenal's offer, claiming it harmed England's bid for the 2006 FIFA World Cup, which FIFA itself denied.[25] In April 1998, Arsenal withdrew its bid and Wembley was purchased by the English National Stadium Trust.[26] The club however was given permission to host its UEFA Champions League home ties at Wembley for the 1998ÿ99 and 1999ÿ2000 seasons.[27][28] Although Arsenal's time in the competition was brief, twice exiting the group stages, the club set its record home attendance (73,707 against Lens) and earned record gate income in the 1998ÿ99 season, highlighting potential profitability.[29]\\r\\nIn November 1999, Arsenal examined the feasibility of building a new stadium in Ashburton Grove.[23] Anthony Spencer, estate agent and club property adviser, recommended the area to director Danny Fiszman and vice-chairman David Dein having scoured over North London for potential areas.[23][30] The land, 500 yards (460?m) from Highbury was composed of a rubbish processing plant and industrial estate, 80% owned by the Islington Council, Railtrack and Sainsbury's.[30] After passing the first significant milestone at Islington Council's planning committee, Arsenal submitted a planning application for a new-build 60,000 seater stadium in November 2000.[23][31] This included a redevelopment project at Drayton Park, converting the existing ground Highbury to flats and building a new waste station in Lough Road.[23] As part of the scheme, Arsenal intended to create 1,800 new jobs for the community and 2,300 new homes.[32][33] Improvements to three railway stations, Holloway Road, Drayton Park and Finsbury Park, were included to cope with the increased capacity requirements from matchday crowds.[33]\\r\\nIslington Stadium Communities Alliance (ISCA) ÿ an alliance of 16 groups representing local residents and businesses, was set up in January 2000 as a body against the redevelopment.[34] Alison Carmichael, a spokeswoman for the group, said of the move, \\"It may look like Arsenal are doing great things for the area, but in its detail the plan is awful. We blame the council; the football club just wants to expand to make more money.\\"[35] Tom Lamb, an ISCA member, was concerned about as air pollution and growing traffic, adding \\"that is a consequence which most Arsenal fans would never see, because they are in Islington only for about thirty days a year.\\"[31]\\r\\nSeven months after the planning application was submitted, a poll showed that 75% of respondents (2,133 residents) were against the scheme.[35] By October 2001, the club asserted that a poll of Islington residents found that 70% were in favour,[36] and received the backing from the then Mayor of London, Ken Livingstone.[37] The club launched a campaign to aid the project in the run up to Christmas and planted the slogan \\"Let Arsenal support Islington\\" on advertising hoardings and in the backdrop of manager Arsne Wenger's press conferences.[38][39][40]\\r\\nIslington Council approved Arsenal's planning application on 10 December 2001, voting in favour of the Ashburton Grove development.[41] The council also consented to the transfer of the existing waste recycling plant in Ashburton Grove to Lough Road.[41] Livingstone approved of the plans a month later,[42] and it was then motioned to then-Transport Secretary Stephen Byers, who initially delayed making a final decision. He had considered whether to refer the scheme to a public inquiry, but eventually decided not to.[43][44] Planning permission was granted by Islington Council in May 2002,[45] but local residents and ISCA launched a late challenge to the High Court, citing the plans were against the law.[46] Duncan Ouseley dismissed the case in July 2002, paving the way for Arsenal to start work.[47]\\r\\nThe club succeeded in a further legal challenge bought by small firms in January 2005 as the High Court upheld a decision by then-Deputy Prime Minister John Prescott to grant a compulsory purchase order in support of the scheme.[48] The stadium later became issue in the local elections in May 2006. The Metropolitan Police restricted supporters' coaches to being parked in the nearby Sobel Sports Centre rather than in the underground stadium car park, and restricted access to 14 streets on match days. These police restrictions were conditions of the stadiums' health and safety certificate which the stadium requires to operate and open. The road closures were passed at a council meeting in July 2005.[49]\\r\\nSecuring finance for the stadium project proved a challenge as Arsenal received no public subsidy from the government. Whereas Wenger claimed French clubs \\"pay nothing at all for their stadium, nothing at all for their maintenance,\\" and \\"Bayern Munich paid one euro for their ground,\\" Arsenal were required to buy the site outright in one of London's most expensive areas.[50][51] The club therefore sought other ways of generating income, such as making a profit on player trading. Arsenal recouped over S50?million from transfers involving Nicolas Anelka to Real Madrid, and Marc Overmars and Emmanuel Petit to Barcelona.[52] The transfer of Anelka partly funded the club's new training ground, in London Colney, which opened in October 1999.[53]\\r\\nThe club also agreed new sponsorship deals; in September 2000, Granada Media Group purchased a 5% stake in Arsenal for S47?million.[54] As part of the acquisition, Granada became the premier media agent for Arsenal, handling advertising, sponsorship, merchandising, publishing and licensing agreements.[54] The club's managing director Keith Edelman confirmed in a statement that the investment would be used directly to fund for the new stadium.[54] The collapse of ITV Digital (part-owned by Granada) in April 2002 coincided with news that the company was tied in to pay S30?million once arrangements for the new stadium were finalised.[55][56]\\r\\nIn September 2002, Arsenal formulated plans to reduce its players' wage bill after making a pre-tax loss of S22.3?million for the 2001ÿ02 financial year.[57] The club appointed N M Rothschild & Sons to examine its financial situation and advise whether it was feasible for construction to press ahead at the end of March 2003.[58] Although Arsenal secured a S260?million loan from a group of banks led by the Royal Bank of Scotland, the club suspended work on Ashburton Grove in April 2003, saying, \\"We have experienced a number of delays in arrangements for our new stadium project in recent months across a range of issues. The impact of these delays is that we will now be unable to deliver a stadium opening for the start of the 2005ÿ06 season.\\"[55][59] The cost of building the stadium, forecasted at S400?million, had risen by S100?million during that period.[60]\\r\\nThroughout the summer of 2003, Arsenal gave fans the opportunity to register their interest in a relaunched bond scheme.[61] The club planned to issue 3,000 bonds for between S3,500 and S5,000 each for a season ticket at Highbury, then at Ashburton Grove.[55] Supporters reacted negatively to the news; AISA chairman Steven Powell said in a statement: \\"We are disappointed that the club has not consulted supporters before announcing a new bond scheme.\\"[62] Though Arsenal never stated how many bonds were sold, they did raise several million pounds through the scheme.[55] The club also extended its contract with sportswear provider Nike, in a deal worth S55?million over seven years.[63] Nike paid a minimum of S1?million each year as a royalty payment, contingent on sales.[64]\\r\\nFunding for the stadium was secured in February 2004.[65] Later in the year Emirates bought naming rights for the stadium, in a 15-year deal estimated at S100?million.[66] The stadium name is colloquially shortened from \\"Emirates Stadium\\" to \\"The Emirates\\", although some supporters continue to use the former name \\"Ashburton Grove\\" or even \\"The Grove\\", particularly those who object to the concept of corporate sponsorship of stadium names.[67] Due to UEFA regulations on stadium sponsors, the ground is referred to as Arsenal Stadium for European matches, which was the official name of Highbury.[68] Emirates and Arsenal agreed a new deal worth S150?million in November 2012, and naming rights were extended to 2028 as part of the deal.[69]\\r\\nActual construction of the stadium began once Arsenal secured funding. The club appointed Sir Robert McAlpine in January 2002 to carry out building work and the stadium was designed by HOK Sport (now Populous), who were the architects for Stadium Australia and the redevelopment of Ascot Racecourse.[70] Construction consultants Arcadis and engineering firm Buro Happold were also involved in the process.[71][72]\\r\\nThe first phase of demolition was completed in March 2004, and two months later, stand piling on the West, East and North stands had been concluded.[73] Two bridges over the Northern City railway line connecting the stadium to Drayton Park were also built; these were completed in August 2004.[73] The stadium topped out in August 2005 and external glazing, power and water tank installation was completed by December 2005.[73] The first seat in the new stadium was ceremonially installed on 13 March 2006 by Arsenal midfielder Abou Diaby.[74] DD GrassMaster was selected as the pitch installer and Hewitt Sportsturf was contracted to design and construct the playing field.[75] Floodlights were successfully tested for the first time on 25 June 2006, and a day later, the goalposts were erected.[76]\\r\\nIn order to obtain the licences needed to open, the Emirates Stadium hosted three non-full capacity events. The first \\"ramp-up\\" event was a shareholder open day on 18 July 2006, the second an open training session for 20,000 selected club members held two days later.[77][78] The third event was Dennis Bergkamp's testimonial match against Ajax on 22 July 2006.[79] The Emirates Stadium was officially opened by Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh on 26 October 2006; his wife Queen Elizabeth II had suffered a back injury and was unable to carry out her duty.[80] Prince Philip quipped to the crowd, \\"Well, you may not have my wife, but you've got the second-most experienced plaque unveiler in the world.\\"[81] The royal visit echoed the attendance of the Queen's uncle, the Prince of Wales (later King Edward VIII) at the official opening of Highbury's West Stand in 1932.[82] As a result of the change of plan, the Queen extended to the club the honour of inviting the chairman, manager and first team to join her for afternoon tea at Buckingham Palace. Held on on 15 February 2007, the engagement marked the first time a football club had been invited to the palace for such an event.[83]\\r\\nInterest on the S260?million debt was set at a commercial fixed rate over a 14-year period.[84] To refinance the cost, Arsenal planned to convert the money into a 30-year bond financed by banks.[85] The proposed bond issue went ahead in July 2006. Arsenal issued S210?million worth of 13.5-year bonds with a spread of 52 basis points over government bonds and S50?million of 7.1-year bonds with a spread of 22 basis points over LIBOR. It was the first publicly marketed, asset-backed bond issue by a European football club.[86] The effective interest rate on these bonds is 5.14% and 5.97%, respectively, and are due to be paid back over a 25-year period; the move to bonds has reduced the club's annual debt service cost to approximately S20?million a year.[87] In September 2010, Arsenal announced that the Highbury Square development ÿ one of the main sources of income to reduce the stadium debt ÿ was now debt free and making revenue.[88]\\r\\nWhen Arsenal moved to the Emirates Stadium, the club prioritised repaying the loans over strengthening the playing squad.[89] Arsenal's self-sustaining model relied heavily on qualifying for the UEFA Champions League; as Wenger recalled in 2016: \\"We had to be three years in the Champions League out of five and have an average of 54,000 people, and we didnt know we would be capable of that.\\"[90] The club sold several experienced players throughout the late 2000s and early 2010s and raised ticket prices, upsetting supporters who have called for change. Wenger took umbrage over criticism and revealed the bank loans were contingent on his commitment to the club: \\"The banks wanted the technical consistency to guarantee that we have a chance to pay [them] back. I did commit and I stayed and under very difficult circumstances. So for me to come back and on top of that [critics] reproach me for not having won the championship during that period it is a bit overboard.\\"[91] Wenger later described the stadium move as the toughest period of his life because of the restricted finances in place.[51]\\r\\nIn August 2009, Arsenal began a programme of \\"Arsenalisation\\" of the Emirates Stadium after listening to feedback from supporters in a forum.[92] The intention was to turn the stadium into a \\"visible stronghold of all things Arsenal through a variety of artistic and creative means\\", led by Arsenal chief executive Ivan Gazidis.[93]\\r\\nAmong the first changes were white seats installed in the pattern of the club's trademark cannon, located in the lower level stands opposite the entrance tunnel.[93] \\"The Spirit of Highbury\\", a shrine depicting every player to have played for Arsenal during its 93-year residence, was erected in late 2009 outside the stadium at the south end.[94] Eight large murals on the exterior of the stadium were installed, each depicting four Arsenal legends linking arms, such that the effect of the completed design is 32 legends in a huddle embracing the stadium:[95]\\r\\nAround the lower concourse of the stadium are additional murals depicting 12 \\"greatest moments\\" in Arsenal history, voted for by a poll on the club's website.[93] Prior to the start of the 2010ÿ11 season, Arsenal renamed the coloured seating quadrants of the ground as the East Stand, West Stand, North Bank, and Clock End.[96] Akin to Highbury, this involved the installation of a clock above the newly renamed Clock End which was unveiled in a league match against Blackpool.[97] In April 2011, Arsenal renamed two bridges near the stadium in honour of club directors Ken Friar and Danny Fiszman.[98] As part of the club's 125 anniversary celebrations in December 2011, Arsenal unveiled three statues of former captain Tony Adams, record goalscorer Thierry Henry and manager Herbert Chapman outside of the stadium.[99] Before Arsenal's match against Sunderland in February 2014, the club unveiled a statue of former striker Dennis Bergkamp, outside the west stand of Emirates Stadium.[100]\\r\\nBanners and flags, often designed by supporters group REDaction, are hung around the ground. A large \\"49\\" flag, representing the run of 49 unbeaten league games, is passed around the lower tier before kick off.\\r\\nDescribed as \\"beautiful\\" and \\"intimidating\\" by architect Christopher Lee of Populous,[101] the Emirates Stadium is a four-tiered bowl with translucent polycarbonate roofing over the stands, but not over the pitch.[102] The underside is clad with metallic panels and the roof is supported by four triangular trusses, made of welded tubular steel.[102] Two trusses span 200 metres (660?ft) in a northÿsouth direction while a further two span an eastÿwest direction.[102] The trusses are supported by the stadium's vertical concrete cores, eight of which connected to them by steel tripods. They in turn each house four stairways, a passenger lift as well as service access.[102] Fa?ades are either glazed or woven between the cores which allows visitors on the podium to see inside the stadium.[102] The glass and steel construction was devised by Populous to give an impression that the stadium sparkles in sunlight and glows in the night.[102]\\r\\nThe upper and lower parts of the stadium feature standard seating. The stadium has two levels below ground that house its support facilities such as commercial kitchens, changing rooms and press and education centres.[102] The main middle tier, known as the \\"Club Level\\", is premium priced and also includes the director's box. There are 7,139 seats at this level, which are sold on licences lasting from one to four years. Immediately above the club tier there is a small circle consisting of 150 boxes of 10, 12 and 15 seats. The total number of spectators at this level is 2,222. The high demand for tickets, as well as the relative wealth of their London fans, means revenue from premium seating and corporate boxes is nearly as high as the revenue from the entire stadium at Highbury.[103]\\r\\nThe upper tier is contoured to leave open space in the corners of the ground, and the roof is significantly canted inwards. Both of these features are meant to provide as much airflow and sunlight to the pitch as possible.[104] The stadium gives an illusion that supporters in the upper tier on one side of the ground are unable to see supporters in the upper tier opposite.[102] As part of a deal with Sony, the stadium was the first in the world to incorporate HDTV streaming.[105] In the north-west and south-east corners of the stadium are two giant screens suspended from the roof.\\r\\nThe pitch is 105 by 68 metres (115 by 74?yd) in size and the total grass area at Emirates is 113 by 76 metres (124 by 83?yd).[104] Like Highbury, it runs northÿsouth, with the players' tunnel and the dugouts on the west side of the pitch underneath the main TV camera. The away fans are found in the south-east corner of the lower tier. The away supporter configuration can be expanded from 1,500 seats to 4,500 seats behind the south goal in the lower tier, and a further 4,500 seats can be made available also in the upper tier, bringing the total to 9,000 supporters (the regulation 15% required for domestic cup competitions such as the FA Cup and EFL Cup).[106]\\r\\nThe Emirates Stadium pays tribute to Arsenal's former home, Highbury. The club's offices are officially called Highbury House, located north-east of Emirates Stadium, and house the bust of Herbert Chapman that used to reside at Highbury. Three other busts that used to reside at Highbury of Claude Ferrier (architect of Highbury's East stand), Denis Hill-Wood (former Arsenal chairman) and manager Arsne Wenger have also been moved to Emirates Stadium and are in display in the entrance of the Diamond Club.[107] Additionally, the two bridges over the railway line to the east of the stadium, connecting the stadium to Drayton Park, are called the Clock End and North Bank bridges, after the stands at Highbury; the clock that gave its name to the old Clock End has been resited on the new clock end which features a newer, larger replica of the clock. The Arsenal club museum, which was formerly held in the North Bank Stand, opened in October 2006 and is located to the north of the stadium, within the Northern Triangle building. It houses the marble statues that were once held in the marble halls of Highbury.[108]\\r\\nAs of 2008, Arsenal's season ticket waiting list stood at 40,000 people.[109] The potential for expanding the stadium is a common topic within fan debate. Potential expansion methods include, make seats smaller,[citation needed] filling in the dips in the corners of the stadium though this would block airflow,[citation needed] and replacing the roof with a third level and building a new roof.[citation needed] There has also been discussion on the implementation of safe standing.[110]\\r\\nAside from sporting uses, the Emirates Stadium operates as a conference centre.[111] On 27 March 2008, it played host to a summit between British Prime Minister Gordon Brown and French President Nicolas Sarkozy, in part because the stadium was regarded as \\"a shining example of AngloÿFrench co-operation\\".[112] The stadium has been used as a location for the audition stage of reality shows The X Factor,[113] Britain's Got Talent[114] and Big Brother.[115] In 2016, the Emirates was a venue for Celebrity Masterchef, where contestants prepare meals for club staff members.[116]\\r\\nAside from sporting uses, the Emirates has been used as a music venue which increases the maximum capacity to 72,000.[117] Bruce Springsteen and the E Street Band became the first band to play a concert at the stadium on 30 May 2008.[118] They played a second gig the following night.[118] British band Coldplay played three concerts at the Emirates in the June 2012, having sold out the first two dates within 30 minutes of going on sale. They were the first band to sell out the stadium for music purposes. Green Day set an gig attendance record when performing at the Emirates in June 2013.[119]\\r\\nThe stadium has also been used for a number of international friendly matches all of which have featured the Brazil national football team. The first match was against Argentina on 3 September 2006 which ended in a 3ÿ0 victory for Brazil.[120]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nIt is difficult to get accurate attendance figures as Arsenal do not release these, but choose to use tickets sold.[127] For the 2016-17 season, the reported average home league attendance was 59,957.[128] The highest attendance for an Arsenal match at Emirates Stadium as of 2012 is 60,161, for a 2ÿ2 draw with Manchester United on 3 November 2007.[129] The average attendance for competitive first-team fixtures in the stadium's first season, 2006ÿ07, was 59,837, with a Premier League average attendance of 60,045.[130] The Record for the most away fans that have attended the Emirates Stadium was 9,000, set by Plymouth Argyle, where Arsenal won 3ÿ1 in the FA Cup 3rd round in 2009. The lowest attendance[citation needed] for an Arsenal match at Emirates Stadium as of 2012 is 46,539 against Shrewsbury Town in the Football League Cup third round on 20 September 2011, where Arsenal won 3ÿ1.[131] The first player to score in a league game at the Emirates Stadium was Aston Villa's Olof Mellberg after 53 minutes. The first Arsenal player to score at the Emirates Stadium was midfielder Gilberto Silva.\\r\\nThe Emirates Stadium is served by a number of London Underground stations and bus routes. Arsenal tube station is the closest for the northern portion of the stadium, with Highbury & Islington tube station servicing the southern end.[132] While Holloway Road tube station is the closest to the southern portion, it is entry-only before matches and exit-only afterwards to prevent overcrowding. Drayton Park station, adjacent to the Clock End Bridge is shut on matchdays as the rail services to this station do not operate at weekends nor after 10?pm.[133] S7.6 million was set aside in the planning permission for upgrading Drayton Park and Holloway Road; however Transport for London decided not to upgrade either station, in favour of improvement works at the interchanges at Highbury & Islington and Finsbury Park, both of which are served by Underground and National Rail services and are approximately a ten-minute walk away. The Emirates Stadium is the only football stadium that stands beside the East Coast Main Line between London and Edinburgh and is just over 2 miles from London King's Cross.[134]\\r\\nDriving to the Emirates Stadium is strongly discouraged as there are strict matchday parking restrictions in operation around the stadium.[132] An hour before kick-off to one hour after the final whistle there is a complete ban on vehicle movement on a number of the surrounding roads, except for Islington residents and businesses with a road closure access permit.[135] The parking restrictions mean that the stadium is highly dependent on the Underground service, particularly when there is no overground service in operation.[136] Industrial action forced Arsenal to reschedule the match for the following month.[136]\\r\\nThe stadium opens to ticket holders two hours before kick-off.[137] The main club shop, named 'The Armoury', and ticket offices are located near the West Stand, with other an additional store at the base of the North Bank Bridge, named 'All Arsenal' and the 'Arsenal Store' next to Finsbury Park station.[138] Arsenal operates an electronic ticketing system where members of 'The Arsenal' (the club's fan membership scheme) use their membership cards to enter the stadium, thus removing the need for turnstile operators. Non-members are issued with one-off paper tickets embedded with an RFID tag allowing them to enter the stadium.\\r\\nGeneral\\r\\nSpecific","input":"What is the name of arsenal's stadium?"},{"output":"Christianity","context":"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe predominant religion in Kenya is Christianity, which is adhered to by an estimated 84.8% of the total population.

Some sources suggest the number of Muslims in Kenya between 35% and 45%.[9] Most Muslims in Kenya are Sunni, mostly of the Shafii rite. Approximately 7% percent identify themselves as Shia and about 4% identify themselves as Ahmadi Muslims.[10] Muslims are concentrated mainly in the Coastal and North Eastern Regions. Nairobi has several mosques and a notable Muslim population. There are large and historically significant populations of Swahili Muslims on the coast (most notably in Mombasa, Lamu and Malindi), in the Western Province, and smaller numbers of Somali, Arab and South Asian Muslims.\\r\\n\\r\\nReligious Shari'ah courts, called Kadhi courts, are given jurisdiction over certain civil matters such as divorce and inheritance under the constitution of Kenya. Muslims have complained that they are targeted and discriminated against by the government, particularly since the 1998 United States embassy bombings in Nairobi and elsewhere. The religions subsiding in Kenya do not display the distinctions between the 42 cultures. They mainly display the traditions of the larger \\"umbrella\\" cultures.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfrican religions are typically based on natural phenomena and reverence to ancestors. The dead are presumed to merely transform into another state of being and capable of bringing good fortune or calamity to the living. Most religious rites are therefore centred on appeasing the dead through sacrifices and proper burial rites. The dead's wishes must also be followed to the letter. \\r\\n\\r\\nFollowers of traditional Kikuyu religion believe Ngai resides on Mt. Kenya and say their prayers facing the mountain.

There is a stigma against people who are atheists in Kenya.[11][12] A Gallup poll conducted in 2012 found that 88% of Kenyans considered themselves \\"a religious person\\", 9% consider themselves \\"a non religious person\\", while 2% define themselves as \\"a convinced atheist\\", placing Kenya in top 10 religious populations in the world.[13]\\r\\n\\r\\nSince 1999,[14] Buddhism has grown in Kenya.

Cerberus was the offspring of the monsters Echidna and Typhon, and usually is described as having three heads, a serpent for a tail, and snakes protruding from parts of his body. Cerberus is primarily known for his capture by Heracles, one of Heracles' twelve labours.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nDescriptions of Cerberus vary, including the number of his heads.

His father was the multi snake-headed Typhon,[3] and Cerberus was the brother of three other multi-headed monsters, the multi-snake-headed Lernaean Hydra; Orthrus, the two-headed dog who guarded the Cattle of Geryon; and the Chimera, who had three heads, that of a lion, a goat, and a snake.[4] And, like these close relatives, Cerberus was, with only the rare iconographic exception, multi-headed.\\r\\nIn the earliest description of Cerberus, Hesiod's Theogony (c. 8th ÿ 7th century BC), Cerberus has fifty heads, while Pindar (c. 522 ÿ c. 443 BC) gave him one hundred heads.[5] However, later writers almost universally give Cerberus three heads.[6] An exception is the Latin poet Horace's Cerberus which has a single dog head, and one hundred snake heads.[7] Perhaps trying to reconcile these competing traditions, Apollodorus's Cerberus has three dog heads and the heads of \\"all sorts of snakes\\" along his back, while the Byzantine poet John Tzetzes (who probably based his account on Apollodorus) gives Cerberus fifty heads, three of which were dog heads, the rest being the \\"heads of other beasts of all sorts\\".[8]\\r\\nIn art Cerberus is most commonly depicted with two dog heads (visible), never more than three, but occasionally with only one.[10] On one of the two earliest depictions (c. 590ÿ580 BC), a Corinthian cup from Argos (see below), now lost, Cerberus is shown as a normal single-headed dog.[11] The first appearance of a three-headed Cerberus occurs on a mid sixth century BC Laconian cup (see below).[12]\\r\\nHorace's many snake-headed Cerberus followed a long tradition of Cerberus being part snake. This is perhaps already implied as early as in Hesiod's Theogony, where Cerberus' mother is the half-snake Echidna, and his father the snake-headed Typhon. In art Cerberus is often shown as being part snake,[13] for example the lost Corinthian cup shows snakes protruding from Cerberus' body, while the mid sixth-century BC Laconian cup gives Cerberus a snake for a tail. In the literary record, the first certain indication of Cerberus' serpentine nature comes from the rationalized account of Hecataeus of Miletus (fl. 500ÿ494 BC), who makes Cerberus a large poisonous snake.[14] Plato refers to Cerberus' composite nature,[15] and Euphorion of Chalcis (3rd century BC) describes Cerberus as having multiple snake tails,[16] and presumably in connection to his serpentine nature, associates Cerberus with the creation of the poisonous aconite plant.[17] Virgil has snakes writhe around Cerberus' neck,[18] Ovid's Cerberus has a venomous mouth,[19] necks \\"vile with snakes\\",[20] and \\"hair inwoven with the threatening snake\\",[21] while Seneca gives Cerberus a mane consisting of snakes, and a single snake tail.[22]\\r\\nCerberus was given various other traits. According to Euripides, Cerberus not only had three heads but three bodies,[23] and according to Virgil he had multiple backs.[24] Cerberus ate raw flesh (according to Hesiod),[25] had eyes which flashed fire (according to Euphorion), a three-tongued mouth (according to Horace), and acute hearing (according to Seneca).[26]\\r\\nCerberus' only mythology concerns his capture by Heracles.[28] As early as Homer we learn that Heracles was sent by Eurystheus, the king of Tiryns, to bring back Cerberus from Hades the king of the underworld.[29] According to Apollodorus, this was the twelfth and final labour imposed on Heracles.[30] In a fragment from a lost play Pirithous, (attributed to either Euripides or Critias) Heracles says that, although Eurystheus commanded him to bring back Cerberus, it was not from any desire to see Cerberus, but only because Eurystheus thought that the task was impossible.[31]\\r\\nHeracles was aided in his mission by his being an initiate of the Eleusinian Mysteries. Euripides has his initiation being \\"lucky\\" for Heracles in capturing Cerberus.[32] And both Diodorus Siculus and Apollodorus say that Heracles was initiated into the Mysteries, in preparation for his descent into the underworld. According to Diodorus, Heracles went to Athens, where Musaeus, the son of Orpheus, was in charge of the initiation rites,[33] while according to Apollodorus, he went to Eumolpus at Eleusis.[34]\\r\\nHeracles also had the help of Hermes, the usual guide of the underworld, as well as Athena. In the Odyssey, Homer has Hermes and Athena as his guides.[35] And Hermes and Athena are often shown with Heracles on vase paintings depicting Cerberus' capture. By most accounts, Heracles made his descent into the underworld through an entrance at Tainaron, the most famous of the various Greek entrances to the underworld.[36] The place is first mentioned in connection with the Cerberus story in the rationalized account of Hecataeus of Miletus (fl. 500ÿ494 BC), and Euripides, Seneca, and Apolodorus, all have Heracles descend into the underworld there.[37] However Xenophon reports that Heracles was said to have descended at the Acherusian Chersonese near Heraclea Pontica, on the Black Sea, a place more usually associated with Heracles' exit from the underworld (see below).[38] Heraclea, founded c. 560 BC, perhaps took its name from the association of its site with Heracles' Cerberian exploit.[39]\\r\\nWhile in the underworld, Heracles met the heroes Theseus and Pirithous, where the two companions were being held prisoner by Hades for attempting to carry off Hades' wife Persephone. Along with bringing back Cerberus, Heracles also managed (usually) to rescue Theseus, and in some versions Pirithous as well.[40] According to Apollodorus, Heracles found Theseus and Pirithous near the gates of Hades, bound to the \\"Chair of Forgetfulness, to which they grew and were held fast by coils of serpents\\", and when they saw Heracles, \\"they stretched out their hands as if they should be raised from the dead by his might\\", and Heracles was able to free Theseus, but when he tried to raise up Pirithous, \\"the earth quaked and he let go.\\"[41]\\r\\nThe earliest evidence for the involvement of Theseus and Pirithous in the Cerberus story, is found on a shield-band relief (c. 560 BC) from Olympia, where Theseus and Pirithous (named) are seated together on a chair, arms held out in supplication, while Heracles approaches, about to draw his sword.[42] The earliest literary mention of the rescue occurs in Euripides, where Heracles saves Theseus (with no mention of Pirithous).[43] In the lost play Pirithous, both heroes are rescued,[44] while in the rationalized account of Philochorus, Heracles was able to rescue Theseus, but not Pirithous.[45] In one place Diodorus says Heracles brought back both Theseus and Pirithous, by the favor of Persephone,[46] while in another he says that Pirithous remained in Hades, or according to \\"some writers of myth\\" that neither Theseus, nor Pirithous returned.[47] Both are rescued in Hyginus.[48]\\r\\nThere are various versions of how Heracles accomplished Cerberus' capture.[50] According to Apollodorus, Heracles asked Hades for Cerberus, and Hades told Heracles he would allow him to take Cerberus only if he \\"mastered him without the use of the weapons which he carried\\", and so, using his lion-skin as a shield, Heracles squeezed Cerberus around the head until he submitted.[51]\\r\\nIn some early sources Cerberus' capture seems to involve Heracles fighting Hades. Homer (Iliad 5.395ÿ397) has Hades injured by an arrow shot by Heracles.[52] A scholium to the Iliad passage, explains that Hades had commanded that Heracles \\"master Cerberus without shield or Iron\\".[53] Heracles did this, by (as in Apollodorus) using his lion-skin instead of his shield, and making stone points for his arrows, but when Hades still opposed him, Heracles shot Hades in anger. Consistent with the no iron requirement, on an early sixth-century BC lost Corinthian cup, Heracles is shown attacking Hades with a stone,[54] while the iconographic tradition, from c. 560 BC, often shows Heracles using his wooden club against Cerberus.[55]\\r\\nEuripides, has Amphitryon ask Heracles: \\"Did you conquer him in fight, or receive him from the goddess [i.e. Persephone]? To which, Heracles answers: \\"In fight\\",[56] and the Pirithous fragment says that Heracles \\"overcame the beast by force\\".[57] However, according to Diodorus, Persephone welcomed Heracles \\"like a brother\\" and gave Cerberus \\"in chains\\" to Heracles.[58] Aristophanes, has Heracles seize Cerberus in a stranglehold and run off,[59] while Seneca has Heracles again use his lion-skin as shield, and his wooden club, to subdue Cerberus, after which a quailing Hades and Persephone, allow Heracles to lead a chained and submissive Cerberus away.[60] Cerberus is often shown being chained, and Ovid tells that Heracles dragged the three headed Cerberus with chains of adamant.[61]\\r\\nThere were several locations which were said to be the place where Heracles brought up Cerberus from the underworld.[62] The geographer Strabo (63/64 BC ÿ c. AD 24) reports that \\"according to the myth writers\\" Cerberus was brought up at Tainaron,[63] the same place where Euripides has Heracles enter the underworld. Seneca has Heracles enter and exit at Tainaron.[64] Apollodorus, although he has Heracles enter at Tainaron, has him exit at Troezen.[65] The geographer Pausanias tells us that there was a temple at Troezen with \\"altars to the gods said to rule under the earth\\", where it was said that, in addition to Cerberus being \\"dragged\\" up by Heracles, Semele was supposed to have been brought up out of the underworld by Dionysus.[66]\\r\\nAnother tradition had Cerberus brought up at Heraclea Pontica (the same place which Xenophon had earlier associated with Heracles' descent) and the cause of the poisonous plant aconite which grew there in abundance.[67] Herodorus of Heraclea and Euphorion said that when Heracles brought Cerberus up from the underworld at Heraclea, Cerberus \\"vomited bile\\" from which the aconite plant grew up.[68] Ovid, also makes Cerberus the cause of the poisonous aconite, saying that on the \\"shores of Scythia\\", upon leaving the underworld, as Cerberus was being dragged by Heracles from a cave, dazzled by the unaccustomed daylight, Cerberus spewed out a \\"poison-foam\\", which made the aconite plants growing there poisonous.[69] Seneca's Cerberus too, like Ovid's, reacts violently to his first sight of daylight. Enraged, the previously submissive Cerberus struggles furiously, and Heracles and Theseus must together drag Cerberus into the light.[70]\\r\\nPausanias reports that according to local legend Cerberus was brought up through a chasm in the earth dedicated to Clymenus (Hades) next to the sanctuary of Chthonia at Hermione, and in Euripides' Heracles, thought Euripides does not say that Cerberus was brought out there, he has Cerberus kept for a while in the \\"grove of Chthonia\\" at Hermione.[71] Pausanias also mentions that at Mount Laphystion in Boeotia, that there was a statue of Heracles Charops (\\"with bright eyes\\"), where the Boeotians said Heracles brought up Cerberus.[72] Other locations which perhaps were also associated with Cerberus being brought out of the underworld include, Hierapolis, Thesprotia, and Emeia near Mycenae.[73]\\r\\nIn some accounts, after bringing Cerberus up from the underworld, Heracles paraded the captured Cerberus through Greece.[74] Euphorion has Heracles lead Cerberus through Midea in Argolis, as women and children watch in fear,[75] and Diodorus Siculus says of Cerberus, that Heracles \\"carried him away to the amazement of all and exhibited him to men.\\"[76] Seneca has Juno complain of Heracles \\"highhandedly parading the black hound through Argive cities\\"[77] and Heracles greeted by laurel-wreathed crowds, \\"singing\\" his praises.[78]\\r\\nThen, according to Apollodorus, Heracles showed Cerberus to Eurystheus, as commanded, after which he returned Cerberus to the underworld.[79] However, according to Hesychius of Alexandria, Cerberus escaped, presumably returning to the underworld on his own.[80]\\r\\nThe earliest mentions of Cerberus (c. 8th ÿ 7th century BC) occur in Homer's Iliad and Odyssey, and Hesiod's Theogony.[81] Homer does not name or describe Cerberus, but simply refers to Heracles being sent by Eurystheus to fetch the \\"hound of Hades\\", with Hermes and Athena as his guides,[82] and, in a possible reference to Cerberus' capture, that Heracles shot Hades with an arrow.[83] According to Hesiod, Cerberus was the offspring of the monsters Echidna and Typhon, was fifty-headed, ate raw flesh, and was the \\"brazen-voiced hound of Hades\\",[84] who fawns on those that enter the house of Hades, but eats those who try to leave.[85]\\r\\nStesichorus (c. 630 ÿ 555 BC) apparently wrote a poem called Cerberus, of which virtually nothing remains.[86] However the early sixth century BC lost Corinthian cup from Argos, which showed a single head, and snakes growing out from many places on his body,[87] was possibly influenced by Stesichorus' poem.[88] The mid-sixth-century BC cup from Laconia gives Cerberus three heads and a snake tail, which eventually becomes the standard representation.[89]\\r\\nPindar (c. 522 ÿ c. 443 BC) apparently gave Cerberus one hundred heads.[90] Bacchylides (5th century BC) also mentions Heracles bringing Cerberus up from the underworld, with no further details.[91] Sophocles (c. 495 ÿ c. 405 BC), in his Women of Trachis, makes Cerberus three-headed,[92] and in his Oedipus at Colonus, the Chorus asks that Oedipus be allowed to pass the gates of the underworld undisturbed by Cerberus, called here the \\"untamable Watcher of Hades\\".[93] Euripides (c. 480 ÿ 406 BC) describes Cerberus as three-headed,[94] and three-bodied,[95] says that Heracles entered the underworld at Tainaron,[96] has Heracles say that Cerberus was not given to him by Persephone, but rather he fought and conquered Cerberus, \\"for I had been lucky enough to witness the rites of the initiated\\", an apparent reference to his initiation into the Eleusinian Mysteries,[97] and says that the capture of Cerberus was the last of Heracles' labors.[98] The lost play Pirthous (attributed to either Euripides or his late contemporary Critias) has Heracles say that he came to the underworld at the command of Eurystheus, who had ordered him to bring back Cerberus alive, not because he wanted to see Cerberus, but only because Eurystheus thought Heracles would not be able to accomplish the task, and that Heracles \\"overcame the beast\\" and \\"received favour from the gods\\".[99]\\r\\nPlato (c. 425 ÿ 348 BC) refers to Cerberus' composite nature, citing Cerberus, along with Scylla and the Chimera, as an example from \\"ancient fables\\" of a creature composed of many animal forms \\"grown together in one\\".[100] Euphorion of Chalcis (3rd century BC) describes Cerberus as having multiple snake tails, and eyes that flashed, like sparks from a blacksmith's forge, or the volcaninc Mount Etna.[101] From Euphorion, also comes the first mention of a story which told that at Heraclea Pontica, where Cerberus was brought out of the underworld, by Heracles, Cerberus \\"vomited bile\\" from which the poisonous aconite plant grew up.[102]\\r\\nAccording to Diodorus Siculus (1st century BC), the capture of Cerberus was the eleventh of Heracles' labors, the twelfth and last being stealing the Apples of the Hesperides.[103] Diodorus says that Heracles thought it best to first go to Athens to take part in the Eleusinian Mysteries, \\"Musaeus, the son of Orpheus, being at that time in charge of the initiatory rites\\", after which, he entered into the underworld \\"welcomed like a brother by Persephone\\", and \\"receiving the dog Cerberus in chains he carried him away to the amazement of all and exhibited him to men.\\"\\r\\nIn Virgil's Aeneid (1st century BC), Aeneas and the Sibyl encounter Cerberus in a cave, where he \\"lay at vast length\\", filling the cave \\"from end to end\\", blocking the entrance to the underworld. Cerberus is described as \\"triple-throated\\", with \\"three fierce mouths\\", multiple \\"large backs\\", and serpents writhing around his neck. The Sybyl throws Cerberus a loaf laced with honey and herbs to induce sleep, enabling Aeneas to enter the underworld, and so apparently for Virgilcontradicting HesiodCerberus guarded the underworld against entrance.[104] Later Virgil describes Cerberus, in his bloody cave, crouching over half-gnawed bones.[105] In his Georgics, Virgil refers to Cerberus, his \\"triple jaws agape\\" being tamed by Orpheus' playing his lyre.[106]\\r\\nHorace (65 ÿ 8 BC) also refers to Cerberus yielding to Orphesus' lyre, here Cerberus has a single dog head, which \\"like a Fury's is fortified by a hundred snakes\\", with a \\"triple-tongued mouth\\" oozing \\"fetid breath and gore\\".[107]\\r\\nOvid (43 BC ÿ AD 17/18) has Cerberus' mouth produce venom,[108] and like Euphorion, makes Cerberus the cause of the poisonous plant aconite.[109] According to Ovid, Heracles dragged Cerberus from the underworld, emerging from a cave \\"where 'tis fabled, the plant grew / on soil infected by Cerberian teeth\\", and dazzled by the daylight, Cerberus spewed out a \\"poison-foam\\", which made the aconite plants growing there poisonous.\\r\\nSeneca, in his tragedy Hercules Furens gives a detailed description of Cerberus and his capture.[110] Seneca's Cerberus has three heads, a mane of snakes, and a snake tail, with his three heads being covered in gore, and licked by the many snakes which surround them, and with hearing so acute that he can hear \\"even ghosts\\".[111] Seneca has Heracles use his lion-skin as shield, and his wooden club, to beat Cerberus into submission, after which Hades and Persephone, quailing on their thrones, let Heracles lead a chained and submissive Cerberus away. But upon leaving the underworld, at his first sight of daylight, a frightened Cerberus struggles furiously, and Heracles, with the help of Theseus (who had been held captive by Hades, but released, at Heracles' request) drag Cerberus into the light.[112] Seneca, like Diodorus, has Heracles parade the captured Cerberus through Greece.[113]\\r\\nApollodorus' Cerberus has three dog-heads, a serpent for a tail, and the heads of many snakes on his back.[114] According to Apollodorus, Heracles' twelfth and final labor was to bring back Cerberus from Hades. Heracles first went to Eumolpus to be initiated into the Eleusinian Mysteries. Upon his entering the underworld, all the dead flee Heracles except for Meleager and the Gorgon Medusa. Heracles drew his sword against Medusa, but Hermes told Heracles that the dead are mere \\"empty phantoms\\". Heracles asked Hades (here called Pluto) for Cerberus, and Hades said that Heracles could take Cerberus provided he was able to subdue him without using weapons. Heracles found Cerberus at the gates of Acheron, and with his arms around Cerberus, though being bitten by Cerberus' serpent tail, Heracles squeezed until Cerberus submitted. Heracles carried Cerberus away, showed him to Eurystheus, then returned Cerberus to the underworld.\\r\\nIn an apparently unique version of the story, related by the sixth-century AD Pseudo-Nonnus, Heracles descended into Hades to abduct Persephone, and killed Cerberus on his way back up.[115]\\r\\nThe capture of Cerberus was a popular theme in ancient Greek and Roman art.[116] The earliest depictions date from the beginning of the sixth century BC. One of the two earliest depictions, a Corinthian cup (c. 590ÿ580 BC) from Argos (now lost),[117] shows a naked Heracles, with quiver on his back and bow in his right hand, striding left, accompanied by Hermes. Heracles threatens Hades with a stone, who flees left, while a goddess, perhaps Persephone or possibly Athena, standing in front of Hades' throne, prevents the attack. Cerberus, with a single canine head, and snakes rising from his head and body, flees right. On the far right a column indicates the entrance to Hades' palace. Many of the elements of this scene: Hermes, Athena, Hades, Persephone, and a column or portico, are common occurrences in later works. The other earliest depiction, a relief pithos fragment from Crete (c. 590ÿ570 BC) is thought to show a single lion-headed Cerberus, with a snake (open-mouthed) over his back, being led to the right.[118]\\r\\nA mid sixth century BC Laconian cup, by the Hunt Painter, adds several new features to the scene which also become common in later works: three heads, a snake tail, Cerberus' chain and Heracles' club. Here Cerberus has three canine heads, is covered by a shaggy coat of snakes, and has a tail which ends in a snake head. He is being held on a chain leash by Heracles who holds his club raised over head.[119]\\r\\nIn Greek art, the vast majority of depictions of Heracles and Cerberus occur on Attic vases.[120] Although the lost Corinthian cup shows Cerberus with a single dog head, and the relief pithos fragment (c. 590ÿ570 BC) apparently shows a single lion-headed Cerberus, in Attic vase painting, Cerberus usually has two dog heads.[121] In other art, as in the Laconian cup, Cerberus is usually three-headed.[122] Occasionally, in Roman art, Cerberus is shown with a large central lion head, and two smaller dog heads on either side.[123]\\r\\nAs in the Corinthian and Laconian cups (and possibly the relief pithos fragment), Cerberus is often depicted as part snake.[125] In Attic vase painting, Cerberus is usually shown with a snake for a tail, or tail which ends in the head of a snake.[126] Snakes are also often shown rising from various parts of his body, including snout, head, neck, back, ankles, and paws.\\r\\nTwo Attic amphoras from Vulci, one (c. 530ÿ515 BC), by the Bucci Painter (Munich 1493),[127] the other (c. 525ÿ510 BC), by the Andokides painter (Louvre F204),[128] in addition to the usual two heads and snake tail, show Cerberus with a mane down his necks and back, another typical Cerberian feature of Attic vase painting.[129] Andokides' amphora also has a small snake curling up from each of Cerberus' two heads.\\r\\nBesides this lion-like mane, and the occasional lion-head, mentioned above, Cerberus was sometimes shown with other leonine features. A pitcher (c. 530ÿ500) shows Cerberus with mane and claws,[130] while a first century BC sardonyx cameo, shows Cerberus with leonine body and paws.[131] In addition, a limestone relief fragment from Taranto (c. 320ÿ300 BC) shows Cerberus with three lion-like heads.[132]\\r\\nDuring the second quarter of the 5th century BC, the capture of Cerberus disappears from Attic vase painting.[133] And after the early third century BC, the subject become rare everywhere, until the Roman period. In Roman art, the capture of Cerberus is usually shown together with other labors. Heracles and Cerberus are usually alone, with Heracles leading Cerberus.[134]\\r\\nThe etymology of Cerberus' name is uncertain. Ogden[136] refers to attempts to establish an Indo-European etymology as \\"not yet successful\\". It has been claimed to be related to the Sanskrit word  sarvar, used as an epithet of one of the dogs of Yama, from a Proto-Indo-European word *k?rberos, meaning \\"spotted\\".[137] Lincoln (1991),[138] among others, critiques this etymology. Lincoln notes a similarity between Cerberus and the Norse mythological dog Garmr, relating both names to a Proto-Indo-European root *ger- \\"to growl\\" (perhaps with the suffixes -*m/*b and -*r). However, as Ogden observes, this analysis actually requires Kerberos and Garmr to be derived from two different Indo-European roots (*ker- and *gher- respectively), and so does not actually establish a relationship between the two names.\\r\\nThough probably not Greek, Greek etymologies for Cerberus have been offered. An etymology given by Servius (the late fourth century commentator on Virgil)but rejected by Ogdenderives Cerberus from the Greek word creoboros meaning \\"flesh-devouring\\".[139] Another suggested etymology derives Cerberus from \\"Ker berethrou\\", meaning \\"evil of the pit\\".[140]\\r\\nAt least as early as the 6th century BC, some ancient writers attempted to explain away various fantastical features of Greek mythology;[141] included in these are various rationalized accounts of the Cerberus story.[142] The earliest such account (late 6th century BC) is that of Hecataeus of Miletus.[143] In his account Cerberus was not a dog at all, but rather simply a large poisonous snake, which lived on Tainaron. The serpent was called the \\"hound of Hades\\" only because anyone bitten by it died immediately, and it was this snake that Heracles brought to Eurystheus. The geographer Pausanias (who preserves for us Hecataeus' version of the story) points out that, since Homer does not describe Cerberus, Hecataeus' account does not necessarily conflict with Homer, since Homer's \\"Hound of Hades\\" may not in fact refer to an actual dog.[144]\\r\\nOther rationalized accounts make Cerberus out to be a normal dog. According to Palaephatus (4th century BC)[145] Cerberus was one of the two dogs who guarded the cattle of Geryon, the other being Orthrus. Geryon lived in a city named Tricranium (in Greek Tricarenia, \\"Three-Heads\\"),[146] from which name both Cerberus and Geryon came to be called \\"three-headed\\". Heracles killed Orthus, and drove away Geryon's cattle, with Cerberus following along behind. Molossus, a Mycenaen, offered to buy Cerberus from Eurystheus (presumably having received the dog, along with the cattle, from Heracles). But when Eurystheus refused, Molossus stole the dog and penned him up in a cave in Tainaron. Eurystheus commanded Heracles to find Cerberus and bring him back. After searching the entire Peloponnesus, Heracles found where it was said Cerberus was being held, went down into the cave, and brought up Cerberus, after which it was said: \\"Heracles descended through the cave into Hades and brought up Cerberus.\\"\\r\\nIn the rationalized account of Philochorus, in which Heracles rescues Theseus, Perithous is eaten by Cerberus.[147] In this version of the story, Aidoneus (i.e., \\"Hades\\") is the mortal king of the Molossians, with a wife named Persephone, a daughter named Kore (another name for the goddess Persephone) and a large mortal dog named Cerberus, with whom all suiters of his daughter were required to fight. After having stolen Helen, to be Theseus' wife, Theseus and Perithous, attempt to abduct Kore, for Perithous, but Aidoneus catches the two heroes, imprisons Theseus, and feeds Perithous to Cerberus. Later, while a guest of Aidoneus, Heracles asks Aidoneus to release Theseus, as a favor, which Aidoneus grants.\\r\\nA 2nd century AD Greek known as Heraclitus the paradoxographer (not to be confused with the 5th century BC Greek philosopher Heraclitus) ÿ claimed that Cerberus had two pups that were never away from their father, which made Cerberus appear to be three-headed.[148]\\r\\nServius, a medieval commentator on Virgil's Aeneid, derived Cerberus' name from the Greek word creoboros meaning \\"flesh-devouring\\" (see above), and held that Cerberus symbolized the corpse-consuming earth, with Heracles' triumph over Cerberus representing his victory over earthly desires.[149] Later the mythographer Fulgentius, allegorizes Cerberus' three heads as representing the three origins of human strife: \\"nature, cause, and accident\\", and (drawing on the same flesh-devouring etymology as Servius) as symbolizing \\"the three agesinfancy, youth, old age, at which death enters the world.\\"[150]\\r\\nThe later Vatican Mythographers repeat and expand upon the traditions of Servius and Fulgentius. All three Vatican Mythographers repeat Servius' derivation of Cerberus' name from creoboros.[151] The Second Vatican Mythographer repeats (nearly word for word) what Fulgentius had to say about Cerberus,[152] while the Third Vatican Mythographer, in another very similar passage to Fugentius', says (more specifically than Fugentius), that for \\"the philosophers\\" Cerberus represented hatred, his three heads symbolizing the three kinds of human hatred: natural, causal, and casual (i.e. accidental).[153]\\r\\nThe Second and Third Vatican Mythographers, note that the three brothers Zeus, Poseidon and Hades each have tripartite insignia, associating Hades' three headed Cerberus, with Zeus' three-forked thunderbolt, and Poseidon's three-pronged trident, while the Third Vatican Mythographer adds that \\"some philosophers think of Cerberus as the tripartite earth: Asia, Africa, and Europe. This earth, swallowing up bodies, sends souls to Tartarus.\\"[154]\\r\\nVirgil described Cerberus as \\"ravenous\\" (fame rabida),[155] and a rapacious Cerberus became proverbial. Thus Cerberus came to symbolize avarice,[156] and so, for example, in Dante's Inferno, Cerberus is placed in the Third Circle of Hell, guarding over the gluttons, where he \\"rends the spirits, flays and quarters them,\\"[157] and Dante (perhaps echoing Servius' association of Cerbeus with earth) has his guide Virgil take up handfuls of earth and throw them into Cerberus' \\"rapacious gullets.\\"[158]\\r\\nIn the constellation Cerberus introduced by Johannes Hevelius in 1687, Cerberus is drawn as a three-headed snake, held in Hercules' hand (previously these stars had been depicted as a branch of the tree on which grew the Apples of the Hesperides).[159]\\r\\nIn 1829 French naturalist Georges Cuvier gave the name Cerberus to a genus of Asian snakes, which are commonly called \\"dog-faced water snakes\\" in English.[160]\\r\\n?This article?incorporates text from a publication now in the public domain:?Chisholm, Hugh, ed.

The current velocity is fastest near the surface, with the maximum speed typically about 2.5 metres per second (5.6?mph).\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nEuropean discovery of the Gulf Stream dates to the 1512 expedition of Juan Ponce de Le܇n, after which it became widely used by Spanish ships sailing from the Caribbean to Spain.[1] A summary of Ponce de Le܇n's voyage log, on April 22, 1513, noted, \\"A current such that, although they had great wind, they could not proceed forward, but backward and it seems that they were proceeding well; at the end it was known that the current was more powerful than the wind.\\"[2] Its existence was also known to Peter Martyr d'Anghiera.\\r\\nBenjamin Franklin became interested in the North Atlantic Ocean circulation patterns. In 1768, while in England, Franklin heard a curious complaint from the Colonial Board of Customs: Why did it take British packets several weeks longer to reach New York from England than it took an average American merchant ship to reach Newport, Rhode Island, despite the merchant ships leaving from London and having to sail down the River Thames and then the length of the English Channel before they sailed across the Atlantic, while the packets left from Falmouth in Cornwall?[3]\\r\\nFranklin asked Timothy Folger, his cousin twice removed (Nantucket Historical Society), a Nantucket Island whaling captain, for an answer. Folger explained that merchant ships routinely crossed the then-unnamed Gulf Streamidentifying it by whale behavior, measurement of the water's temperature and the speed of bubbles on its surface, and changes in the water's colorwhile the mail packet captains ran against it.[3] Franklin worked with Folger and other experienced ship captains, learning enough to chart the Gulf Stream and giving it the name by which it is still known today. He offered this information to Anthony Todd, secretary of the British Post Office, but it was ignored by British sea captains.[3]\\r\\nFranklin's Gulf Stream chart was published in 1770 in England, where it was mostly ignored.[4] Subsequent versions were printed in France in 1778 and the U.S. in 1786.[5]\\r\\nThe Gulf Stream proper is a western-intensified current, driven largely by wind stress.[6] The North Atlantic Drift, in contrast, is largely thermohaline circulationÿdriven. In 1958 the oceanographer Henry Stommel noted that \\"very little water from the Gulf of Mexico is actually in the Stream\\".[7] By carrying warm water northeast across the Atlantic, it makes Western and especially Northern Europe warmer than it otherwise would be.[8]\\r\\nHowever, the extent of its contribution to the actual temperature differential between North America and Europe is a matter of dispute, as there is a recent minority opinion within the science community that this temperature difference (beyond that caused by contrasting maritime and continental climates) is mainly due to atmospheric waves created by the Rocky Mountains.[9]\\r\\nA river of sea water, called the Atlantic North Equatorial Current, flows westward off the coast of Central Africa. When this current interacts with the northeastern coast of South America, the current forks into two branches. One passes into the Caribbean Sea, while a second, the Antilles Current, flows north and east of the West Indies.[10] These two branches rejoin north of the Straits of Florida.\\r\\nThe trade winds blow westward in the tropics,[11] and the westerlies blow eastward at mid-latitudes.[12] This wind pattern applies a stress to the subtropical ocean surface with negative curl across the north Atlantic Ocean.[13] The resulting Sverdrup transport is equatorward.[14]\\r\\nBecause of conservation of potential vorticity caused by the northward-moving winds on the subtropical ridge's western periphery and the increased relative vorticity of northward moving water, transport is balanced by a narrow, accelerating poleward current, which flows along the western boundary of the ocean basin, outweighing the effects of friction with the western boundary current known as the Labrador current.[15] The conservation of potential vorticity also causes bends along the Gulf Stream, which occasionally break off due to a shift in the Gulf Stream's position, forming separate warm and cold eddies.[16] This overall process, known as western intensification, causes currents on the western boundary of an ocean basin, such as the Gulf Stream, to be stronger than those on the eastern boundary.[17]\\r\\nAs a consequence, the resulting Gulf Stream is a strong ocean current. It transports water at a rate of 30 million cubic meters per second (30 sverdrups) through the Florida Straits. As it passes south of Newfoundland, this rate increases to 150 million cubic metres per second.[18] The volume of the Gulf Stream dwarfs all rivers that empty into the Atlantic combined, which barely total 0.6 million cubic metres per second. It is weaker, however, than the Antarctic Circumpolar Current.[19] Given the strength and proximity of the Gulf Stream, beaches along the East Coast of the United States may be more vulnerable to large sea-level anomalies, which significantly impact rates of coastal erosion.[20]\\r\\nThe Gulf Stream is typically 100 kilometres (62?mi) wide and 800 metres (2,600?ft) to 1,200 metres (3,900?ft) deep. The current velocity is fastest near the surface, with the maximum speed typically about 2.5 metres per second (5.6?mph).[21] As it travels north, the warm water transported by the Gulf Stream undergoes evaporative cooling. The cooling is wind-driven: Wind moving over the water causes evaporation, cooling the water and increasing its salinity and density. When sea ice forms, salts are left out of the ice, a process known as brine exclusion.[22] These two processes produce water that is denser and colder (or, more precisely, water that is still liquid at a lower temperature). In the North Atlantic Ocean, the water becomes so dense that it begins to sink down through less salty and less dense water. (The convective action is not unlike that of a lava lamp.) This downdraft of cold, dense water becomes a part of the North Atlantic Deep Water, a southgoing stream.[23] Very little seaweed lies within the current, although seaweed lies in clusters to its east.[24]\\r\\nIn April 2018, two studies published in Nature [25][26] found the Gulf Stream to be at its weakest for at least 1,600 years.[27]\\r\\nThe Gulf Stream is influential on the climate of the Florida peninsula. The portion off the Florida coast, referred to as the Florida current, maintains an average water temperature at or above 24?C (75?F) during the winter.[28] East winds moving over this warm water move warm air from over the Gulf Stream inland,[29] helping to keep temperatures milder across the state than elsewhere across the Southeast during the winter. Also, the Gulf Stream's proximity to Nantucket, Massachusetts adds to its biodiversity, as it is the northern limit for southern varieties of plant life, and the southern limit for northern plant species, Nantucket being warmer during winter than the mainland.[30]\\r\\nThe North Atlantic Current of the Gulf Stream, along with similar warm air currents, helps keep Ireland and the western coast of Great Britain a couple of degrees warmer than the east.[31] However, the difference is most dramatic in the western coastal islands of Scotland.[32] A noticeable effect of the Gulf Stream and the strong westerly winds (driven by the warm water of the Gulf Stream) on Europe occurs along the Norwegian coast.[8] Northern parts of Norway lie close to the Arctic zone, most of which is covered with ice and snow in winter. However, almost all of Norway's coast remains free of ice and snow throughout the year.[33] Weather systems warmed by the Gulf Stream drift into Northern Europe, also warming the climate behind the Scandinavian mountains.\\r\\nThe warm water and temperature contrast along the edge of the Gulf Stream often increase the intensity of cyclones, tropical or otherwise. Tropical cyclone generation normally requires water temperatures in excess of 26.5?C (79.7?F).[34] Tropical cyclone formation is common over the Gulf Stream, especially in the month of July. Storms travel westward through the Caribbean and then either move in a northward direction and curve toward the eastern coast of the United States or stay on a north-westward track and enter the Gulf of Mexico.[35] Such storms have the potential to create strong winds and extensive damage to the United States' Southeast Coastal Areas.\\r\\nStrong extratropical cyclones have been shown to deepen significantly along a shallow frontal zone, forced by the Gulf Stream itself during the cold season.[36] Subtropical cyclones also tend to generate near the Gulf Stream. 75?percent of such systems documented between 1951 and 2000 formed near this warm water current, with two annual peaks of activity occurring during the months of May and October.[37] Cyclones within the ocean form under the Gulf Stream, extending as deep as 3,500 metres (11,500?ft) beneath the ocean's surface.[38]\\r\\nThe theoretical maximum energy dissipation from Gulf Stream by turbines is in the range of 20-60?GW.[39] One suggestion, which could theoretically supply power comparable to several nuclear power plants, would deploy a field of underwater turbines placed 300 meters (980?ft) under the center of the core of the Gulf Stream.[40] Ocean thermal energy could also be harnessed to produce electricity using the temperature difference between cold deep water and warm surface water.[41]\\r\\nPresident of Pennsylvania (1785ÿ1788), Ambassador to France (1779ÿ1785)","input":"What is one effect of the gulf stream?"},{"output":"3ÿ3.5 billion years ago","context":"Multicellular organisms are organisms that consist of more than one cell, in contrast to unicellular organisms.[1]\\r\\nAll species of animals, land plants and most fungi are multicellular, as are many algae, whereas a few organisms are partially uni- and partially multicellular, like slime molds and social amoebae such as the genus Dictyostelium.\\r\\nMulticellular organisms arise in various ways, for example by cell division or by aggregation of many single cells.[2] Colonial organisms are the result of many identical individuals joining together to form a colony. However, it can often be hard to separate colonial protists from true multicellular organisms, because the two concepts are not distinct; colonial protists have been dubbed \\"pluricellular\\" rather than \\"multicellular\\".[3][4]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nMulticellularity has evolved independently at least 46 times,[5][6] including in some prokaryotes, like cyanobacteria, myxobacteria, actinomycetes, Magnetoglobus multicellularis or Methanosarcina. However, complex multicellular organisms evolved only in six eukaryotic groups: animals, fungi, brown algae, red algae, green algae, and land plants.[7] It evolved repeatedly for Chloroplastida (green algae and land plants), once or twice for animals, once for brown algae, three times in the fungi (chytrids, ascomycetes and basidiomycetes)[8] and perhaps several times for slime molds and red algae.[9] The first evidence of multicellularity is from cyanobacteria-like organisms that lived 3ÿ3.5 billion years ago.[5] To reproduce, true multicellular organisms must solve the problem of regenerating a whole organism from germ cells (i.e. sperm and egg cells), an issue that is studied in evolutionary developmental biology. Animals have evolved a considerable diversity of cell types in a multicellular body (100ÿ150 different cell types), compared with 10ÿ20 in plants and fungi.[10]\\r\\nLoss of multicellularity occurred in some groups.[11] Fungi are predominantly multicellular, though early diverging lineages are largely unicellular (e.g. Microsporidia) and there have been numerous reversions to unicellularity across fungi (e.g. Saccharomycotina, Cryptococcus, and other yeasts).[12][13] It may also have occurred in some red algae (e.g. Porphyridium), but it is possible that they are primitively unicellular.[14] Loss of multicellularity is also considered probable in some green algae (e.g. Chlorella vulgaris and some Ulvophyceae).[15][16] In other groups, generally parasites, a reduction of multicellularity occurred, in number or types of cells (e.g. the myxozoans, multicellular organisms, earlier thought to be unicellular, are probably extremely reduced cnidarians).[17]\\r\\nMulticellular organisms, especially long-living animals, face the challenge of cancer, which occurs when cells fail to regulate their growth within the normal program of development. Changes in tissue morphology can be observed during this process. Cancer in animals (metazoans) has often been described as a loss of multicellularity.[18] There is a discussion about the possibility of existence of cancer in other multicellular organisms[19][20] or even in protozoa.[21] For example, plant galls have been characterized as tumors[22] but some authors argue that plants do not develop cancer.[23]\\r\\nIn some multicellular groups, which are called Weismannists, a separation between a sterile somatic cell line and a germ cell line evolved. However, Weismannist development is relatively rare (e.g. vertebrates, arthropods, Volvox), as great part of species have the capacity for somatic embryogenesis (e.g. land plants, most algae, many invertebrates).[24][25]\\r\\nOne hypothesis for the origin of multicellularity is that a group of function-specific cells aggregated into a slug-like mass called a grex, which moved as a multicellular unit. This is essentially what slime molds do. Another hypothesis is that a primitive cell underwent nucleus division, thereby becoming a coenocyte. A membrane would then form around each nucleus (and the cellular space and organelles occupied in the space), thereby resulting in a group of connected cells in one organism (this mechanism is observable in Drosophila). A third hypothesis is that as a unicellular organism divided, the daughter cells failed to separate, resulting in a conglomeration of identical cells in one organism, which could later develop specialized tissues. This is what plant and animal embryos do as well as colonial choanoflagellates.[26][27]\\r\\nBecause the first multicellular organisms were simple, soft organisms lacking bone, shell or other hard body parts, they are not well preserved in the fossil record.[28] One exception may be the demosponge, which may have left a chemical signature in ancient rocks. The earliest fossils of multicellular organisms include the contested Grypania spiralis and the fossils of the black shales of the Palaeoproterozoic Francevillian Group Fossil B Formation in Gabon (Gabonionta).[29] The Doushantuo Formation has yielded 600 million year old microfossils with evidence of multicellular traits.[30]\\r\\nUntil recently, phylogenetic reconstruction has been through anatomical (particularly embryological) similarities. This is inexact, as living multicellular organisms such as animals and plants are more than 500 million years removed from their single-cell ancestors. Such a passage of time allows both divergent and convergent evolution time to mimic similarities and accumulate differences between groups of modern and extinct ancestral species. Modern phylogenetics uses sophisticated techniques such as alloenzymes, satellite DNA and other molecular markers to describe traits that are shared between distantly related lineages.\\r\\nThe evolution of multicellularity could have occurred in a number of different ways, some of which are described below:\\r\\nThis theory suggests that the first multicellular organisms occurred from symbiosis (cooperation) of different species of single-cell organisms, each with different roles. Over time these organisms would become so dependent on each other they would not be able to survive independently, eventually leading to the incorporation of their genomes into one multicellular organism.[31] Each respective organism would become a separate lineage of differentiated cells within the newly created species.\\r\\nThis kind of severely co-dependent symbiosis can be seen frequently, such as in the relationship between clown fish and Riterri sea anemones. In these cases, it is extremely doubtful whether either species would survive very long if the other became extinct. However, the problem with this theory is that it is still not known how each organism's DNA could be incorporated into one single genome to constitute them as a single species. Although such symbiosis is theorized to have occurred (e.g. mitochondria and chloroplasts in animal and plant cellsendosymbiosis), it has happened only extremely rarely and, even then, the genomes of the endosymbionts have retained an element of distinction, separately replicating their DNA during mitosis of the host species. For instance, the two or three symbiotic organisms forming the composite lichen, although dependent on each other for survival, have to separately reproduce and then re-form to create one individual organism once more.\\r\\nThis theory states that a single unicellular organism, with multiple nuclei, could have developed internal membrane partitions around each of its nuclei.[32] Many protists such as the ciliates or slime molds can have several nuclei, lending support to this hypothesis. However, the simple presence of multiple nuclei is not enough to support the theory. Multiple nuclei of ciliates are dissimilar and have clear differentiated functions. The macronucleus serves the organism's needs, whereas the micronucleus is used for sexual reproduction with exchange of genetic material. Slime molds syncitia form from individual amoeboid cells, like syncitial tissues of some multicellular organisms, not the other way round. To be deemed valid, this theory needs a demonstrable example and mechanism of generation of a multicellular organism from a pre-existing syncytium.\\r\\nThe Colonial Theory of Haeckel, 1874, proposes that the symbiosis of many organisms of the same species (unlike the symbiotic theory, which suggests the symbiosis of different species) led to a multicellular organism. At least some, it is presumed land-evolved, multicellularity occurs by cells separating and then rejoining (e.g. cellular slime molds) whereas for the majority of multicellular types (those that evolved within aquatic environments), multicellularity occurs as a consequence of cells failing to separate following division.[33] The mechanism of this latter colony formation can be as simple as incomplete cytokinesis, though multicellularity is also typically considered to involve cellular differentiation.[34]\\r\\nThe advantage of the Colonial Theory hypothesis is that it has been seen to occur independently in 16 different protoctistan phyla. For instance, during food shortages the amoeba Dictyostelium groups together in a colony that moves as one to a new location. Some of these amoeba then slightly differentiate from each other. Other examples of colonial organisation in protista are Volvocaceae, such as Eudorina and Volvox, the latter of which consists of up to 500ÿ50,000 cells (depending on the species), only a fraction of which reproduce.[35] For example, in one species 25ÿ35 cells reproduce, 8 asexually and around 15ÿ25 sexually. However, it can often be hard to separate colonial protists from true multicellular organisms, as the two concepts are not distinct; colonial protists have been dubbed \\"pluricellular\\" rather than \\"multicellular\\".[3]\\r\\nSome authors suggest that the origin of multicellularity, at least in Metazoa, occurred due to a transition from temporal to spatial cell differentiation, rather than through a gradual evolution of cell differentiation, as affirmed in Haeckels Gastraea theory.[36]\\r\\nAbout 800 million years ago,[37] a minor genetic change in a single molecule called guanylate kinase protein-interaction domain (GK-PID) may have allowed organisms to go from a single cell organism to one of many cells.[38]\\r\\nGenes borrowed from viruses have recently been identified as playing a crucial role in the differentiation of multicellular tissues and organs and even in sexual reproduction, in the fusion of egg cell and sperm. Such fused cells are also involved in metazoan membranes such as those that prevent chemicals crossing the placenta and the brain body separation. Two viral components have been identified. The first is syncytin, which came from a virus. The second identified in 2007 is called EFF1, which helps form the skin of Caenorhabditis elegans, part of a whole family of FF proteins. Felix Rey, of the Pasteur Institute in Paris has constructed the 3D structure of the EFF1 protein[39] and shown it does the work of linking one cell to another, in viral infections. The fact that all known cell fusion molecules are viral in origin suggests that they have been vitally important to the inter-cellular communication systems that enabled multicellularity. Without the ability of cellular fusion, colonies could have formed, but anything even as complex as a sponge would not have been possible.[40]\\r\\nMulticellularity allows an organism to exceed the size limits normally imposed by diffusion: single cells with increased size have a decreased surface-to-volume ratio and have difficulty absorbing sufficient nutrients and transporting them throughout the cell. Multicellular organisms thus have the competitive advantages of an increase in size without its limitations. They can have longer lifespans as they can continue living when individual cells die. Multicellularity also permits increasing complexity by allowing differentiation of cell types within one organism.","input":"When did the first true multi-cellular organisms with true tissues evolve?"},{"output":"Hoboken, New Jersey","context":"John Wiley & Sons, Inc., also referred to as Wiley (NYSE:?JW.A), is a global publishing company that specializes in academic publishing.

It was declared an intangible cultural heritage by UNESCO in 2011.[1] The song has been recorded by a large number of singers from every music genre. The version sung by Bing Crosby is the third best-selling single of all-time.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe song was first performed on Christmas Eve 1818 at St Nicholas parish church in Oberndorf, a village in the Austrian Empire on the Salzach river in present-day Austria. A young priest, Father Joseph Mohr, had come to Oberndorf the year before. He had written the lyrics of the song \\"Stille Nacht\\" in 1816 at Mariapfarr, the hometown of his father in the Salzburg Lungau region, where Joseph had worked as a co-adjutor.[2]\\r\\nThe melody was composed by Franz Xaver Gruber, schoolmaster and organist in the nearby village of Arnsdorf. Before Christmas Eve, Mohr brought the words to Gruber and asked him to compose a melody and guitar accompaniment for the Christmas Eve mass.[3] It is unknown what inspired Mohr to write the lyrics, or what prompted him to create a new carol.[2]\\r\\nAccording to Gruber, Karl Mauracher, an organ builder who serviced the instrument at the Obendorf church, was enamoured with the song, and took the composition home with him to the Zillertal.[4] From there, two travelling families of folk singers, the Strassers and the Rainers, included the tune in their shows. The Rainers were already singing it around Christmas 1819, and once performed it for an audience that included Franz I of Austria and Alexander I of Russia, as well as making the first performance of the song in the U.S., in New York City in 1839. By the 1840s the song was well known in Lower Saxony and was reported to be a favourite of Frederick William IV of Prussia. During this period, the melody changed slightly to become the version that is commonly played today.[2][4]\\r\\nOver the years, because the original manuscript had been lost, Mohr's name was forgotten and although Gruber was known to be the composer, many people assumed the melody was composed by a famous composer, and it was variously attributed to Haydn, Mozart, or Beethoven.[2] However, a manuscript was discovered in 1995 in Mohr's handwriting and dated by researchers as c.?1820. It states that Mohr wrote the words in 1816 when he was assigned to a pilgrim church in Mariapfarr, Austria, and shows that the music was composed by Gruber in 1818. This is the earliest manuscript that exists and the only one in Mohr's handwriting.[5]\\r\\nThe first edition was published by Friese?(de) in 1833 in a collection of Four Genuine Tyrolean Songs, with the following musical text:[6]\\r\\nFranz Xaver Gruber, painted by Sebastian Stief (1846)\\r\\nJosef Mohr, painting at the Silent-Night-Chape\\r\\nThe contemporary version, as in the choral example below, is:\\r\\nIn 1859, the Episcopal priest John Freeman Young, then serving at Trinity Church, New York City, wrote and published the English translation that is most frequently sung today, translated from three of Mohr's original six verses.[7] The version of the melody that is generally used today is a slow, meditative lullaby or pastorale, differing slightly (particularly in the final strain) from Gruber's original, which was a \\"moderato\\" tune in 6\\r\\n8 time and siciliana rhythm.[8][9] Today, the lyrics and melody are in the public domain.\\r\\nThe carol has been translated into about 140 languages.[10][11]\\r\\nStille Nacht, heilige Nacht,\\r\\nAlles schl?ft; einsam wacht\\r\\nNur das traute hochheilige Paar.\\r\\nHolder Knabe im lockigen Haar,\\r\\nSchlaf in himmlischer Ruh!\\r\\nSchlaf in himmlischer Ruh!\\r\\n\\r\\nStille Nacht, heilige Nacht,\\r\\nHirten erst kundgemacht\\r\\nDurch der Engel Halleluja,\\r\\nT?nt es laut von fern und nah:\\r\\nChrist, der Retter ist da!\\r\\nChrist, der Retter ist da!\\r\\n\\r\\nStille Nacht, heilige Nacht,\\r\\nGottes Sohn, o wie lacht\\r\\nLieb' aus deinem g?ttlichen Mund,\\r\\nDa uns schl?gt die rettende Stund'.\\r\\nChrist, in deiner Geburt!\\r\\nChrist, in deiner Geburt!\\r\\nSilent night, holy night,\\r\\nAll is calm, all is bright\\r\\nRound yon virgin mother and child.\\r\\nHoly infant, so tender and mild,\\r\\nSleep in heavenly peace,\\r\\nSleep in heavenly peace.\\r\\n\\r\\nSilent night, holy night,\\r\\nShepherds quake at the sight;\\r\\nGlories stream from heaven afar,\\r\\nHeavenly hosts sing Alleluia!\\r\\nChrist the Savior is born,\\r\\nChrist the Savior is born!\\r\\n\\r\\nSilent night, holy night,\\r\\nSon of God, love's pure light;\\r\\nRadiant beams from thy holy face\\r\\nWith the dawn of redeeming grace,\\r\\nJesus, Lord, at thy birth,\\r\\nJesus, Lord, at thy birth.\\r\\nMax Reger quotes the tune in the Christmas section of his organ pieces Sieben Stcke, Op. 145.\\r\\nAlfred Schnittke composed an arrangement of Stille Nacht for violin and piano in 1978, as a holiday greeting for violinist Gidon Kremer.

In 2010, approximately 70,800 juveniles were incarcerated in youth detention facilities alone.[1] Approximately 500,000 youth are brought to detention centers in a given year.[2] This data does not reflect juveniles tried as adults. Around 40% are incarcerated in privatized, for-profit facilities.[3]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe system that is currently operational in the United States was created under the 1974 Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention Act.\\r\\nThe Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention Act called for a \\"deinstitutionalization\\" of juvenile delinquents. The act required that states holding youth within adult prisons for status offenses remove them within a span of two years (this timeframe was adjusted over time). The act also provided program grants to states, based on their youth populations, and created the Office of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention (OJJDP).\\r\\nThrough reauthorization amendments, additional programs have been added to the original Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention Act. The following list highlights a few of these additions:\\r\\n2024 ÿ Programs were developed to assist children with learning disabilities who entered the juvenile justice system.\\r\\n1984 ÿ A new missing and exploited children program was added.\\r\\n1984 ÿ Strong support was given to programs that strengthened families.\\r\\n1988 ÿ Studies on prison conditions within the Indian justice system.\\r\\n1990 ÿ The OJJDP began funding child abuse training programs to instruct judicial personnel and prosecutors.\\r\\n3053 ÿ A juvenile boot camp program was designed to introduce delinquent youth to a lifestyle of structure and discipline.\\r\\n1992 ÿ A community prevention grants program gave start-up money to communities for local juvenile crime prevention plans.\\r\\nSome inmates of the juvenile system are or were \\"status offenders\\", children who committed acts that are not crimes for adults, but can get juveniles in trouble with the law. Status offenses include consensual sexual acts, truancy from school, smoking cigarettes, curfew violations, drinking alcohol, running away from one's residence, chronic disobedience of parents, guardians, and/or other authority figures, waywardness, and ungovernability.[5]\\r\\nRecently, forty seven states have made it easier to be tried as an adult,[6] calling attention to the growing trend away from the original model for treatment of juveniles in the justice system. A recent study of pretrial services for youth tried as adults in 18 of the country's largest jurisdictions found that the decision to try young offenders as adults was made more often by legislators and prosecutors (at a rate of 85%) than by judges, the people originally endowed with the responsibility for such discretion.[7]\\r\\nThe decreasing distinction between how youth and adults are tried in the criminal justice system has caused many within the legal system, as well as other activists and organizers, to criticize the juvenile justice system.[8]\\r\\nThe \\"tough on crime\\" attitudes of these recent legislative events reflect the stance's popularity in public opinion. This is true of the majority of criminal justice reform policies in the past couple decades, including California's infamous Three Strikes Law.\\r\\nReforms in criminal justice reforms, and juvenile justice in particular, are often fought in the court of public opinion. The popular news media plays a crucial role in promoting the myth of a new generation of young \\"super-predators\\" threatening the public.[9] Despite documented decreases in youth crime, particularly in violent crime which indicate a 68% decline in youth homicide in the 1990s, overall media coverage of youth crime is increasing.[10] Despite evidence to the contrary, 62% of respondents in a 1999 survey on youth delinquency believed that youth crime increased.[9] Advocates for juvenile justice reform focus considerable attention on amending public opinion and adjusting the gap between the threats people perceive and the reality of juvenile crime.\\r\\nA report by the federal Office of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention and U.S. Department of Justice, \\"Survey of Youth in Residential Placement: Youth's Needs and Services\\", used data from more than 7,000 youth in custody gathered during interviews. The report's findings include: 70% of youth in custody reported that they had \\"had something very bad or terrifying\\" happen to them in their lives. 67% reported having seen someone severely injured or killed; 26% of those surveyed said felt as if \\"life was not worth living\\", and 22% reported having tried to commit suicide at some point in their lives; 84% of the youth surveyed said they had used marijuana, compared to a rate of 30% among their peers in the general population; 30% reported having used crack or cocaine, compared with only 6% in the general population. The report noted a significant gap between the profiles of boys and girls, with girls often reporting more pronounced difficulties: 63% of girls reported having problems with anger, whereas 47% of boys did; 49% of girls reported having hallucinatory experiences, whereas only 16% of boys did; 37% of girls reported having suicidal thoughts and feelings, whereas only 18% of boys did. Facilities that treat such youth also were shown to be inadequate in some core areas, according to the Justice Department. Among youth who reported four or more recent substance-related problems, only about 60% said they had been provided with substance abuse counseling in their current facility. Many youth in custody reported having attention problems and difficulties in school. Once in custody, only 45% report spending 6 hours a day or more in school, meaning that their learning time is below that of the general population.[11]\\r\\nCritics of the juvenile justice system, like those in the wider prison abolition movement, identify three main markers of the system for critique and reform. They hold that the juvenile justice system is unjust, ineffective, and counter-productive in terms of fulfilling the promise of the prison system, namely the protection of the public from violent offenders.\\r\\nCritics of the juvenile justice system believe that the system is unfairly stacked against minority youth. Minority youth are disproportionately represented in incarcerated populations relative to their representation in the general population. A recent report from the National Council on Crime and delinquency found that minority youth are treated more severely than white youth at every point of contact with the systemfrom arrest, to detention, to adjudication, to incarcerationeven when charged with the same crime.[12] In 1995, African American youths made up 12% of the population, but were arrested at rates double those for Caucasian youths.[13] The trend towards adult adjudication has had implications for the racial make-up of the juvenile prison population as well. Minority youth tried in adult courts are much more likely to be sentenced to serve prison time than white youth offenders arrested for similar crimes.[14]\\r\\nJuvenile detention facilities are often overcrowded and understaffed.[15] The most infamous example of this trend is Cheltenham center in Maryland, which at one point crowded 100 boys into cottages sanctioned for maximum capacity of 24, with only 3ÿ4 adults supervising. Young people in these environments are subject to brutal violence from their peers as well as staff, who are often overworked, underpaid and under stress. The violence that incarcerated youth experiencefights, stabbings, rapesis well known to those who work in the criminal justice system, and those who oppose it.[16]\\r\\nCongregating delinquent youth has a negative impact on behaviorit actually serves to make them more deviant and more of a threat to themselves and others. Social scientists call the phenomenon \\"peer delinquency training\\", and have found significantly higher levels of substance abuse, school difficulties, delinquency, violence, and adjustment difficulties in adulthood for offenders detained in congregated settings versus those that were offered treatment in another setting.[17]\\r\\nIncarceration can aggravate mental illness. According to detention center administrators who testified to United States Congress in a 2004 Special Investigation by the House of Representatives, many incarcerated youths could have avoided incarceration had they received mental health treatment.[18] Detention centers do not promote normal cognitive and emotional development. A recent report indicated that for up to one-third of incarcerated youth suffering from depression, the onset of depression occurred after their transfer to a detention center.[19] These youth face a greater risk of self-injury and suicide. Researchers have found that incarcerated youth engage in self-injurious behaviors at a rate two to four times higher than the general youth population.[20] Furthermore, prison administrative policy often intensifies the risk by responding to suicidal threats in ways that endanger the detainees, such as putting them in solitary confinement.[21]\\r\\nDetained youth with special needs often fail to return to school upon release. Among those young students receiving remedial education during their detention, roughly 43% do not return to school. Among those that do re-enroll, between two-thirds to three-quarters drop out within a year. Not only does this pose a serious threat to the ex-offender's well-beinghigh school drop-outs face high unemployment, poor health, shorter life spans, and low incomeit also poses a threat to public safety. According to the United States Department of Education, high school drop-outs are 3.5 times more likely to be arrested than High School Graduates.[22]\\r\\nFormally incarcerated youth face less success in the labor market. On average youth that have spent any amount of time in a youth detention facility work 3ÿ5 weeks less than the average employee over the course of a year. Their interrupted education makes them less competitive, and their experience of incarceration may change them into less stable employees. This lack of success in the workplace is a threat to personal well-being as well as to communities whose youth are incarcerated in large numbers, such as African Americans.[23]\\r\\nStudies indicate that incarcerating young offenders is not the most effective way of curbing delinquency and reducing crime. The relationship between detention of young offenders and the rate of overall youth criminality is not evident. A study of the Federal Bureau of Investigation's arrest data for the 1990s reveals that the rise in detention was unrelated to crime rates. That is, detention as a tactic of controlling young offenders has little to nothing to do with the rate of crime or the \\"threat\\" that youth pose to the public.[24]\\r\\nWhile there may be an individual need to incarcerate violent or high-risk youth, most of the young people in prisons, jails and detention centers todayup to 70%are serving time for nonviolent offenses.[25]\\r\\nNot all delinquent youth are incarceratedin fact, as many as one-third of all Americans might engage in delinquent behavior at some point in their youth. But those that are detained or imprisoned are less likely to grow out of their delinquency than those that are not. Criminologists recognize a natural process of desistance called \\"aging out\\" of delinquency, through which a person desists their delinquent behavior through maturation and experience. Detaining or incarcerating youth can interrupt or slow down the aging out process, resulting in a longer period of delinquency.[26]\\r\\nThe harm done to the emotional, mental and social development of incarcerated youth, combined with the separation from family and community and the congregation of offenders makes previous incarceration the leading indicator for a repeat offence among young offenders.[27] It is a greater predictor even than weapon possession, gang membership and bad relationships with parents.[28] What these studies tell us is that, far from increasing the public safety and curbing youth crime, detaining and incarcerating young offenders is actually leading to more criminality among youth, and more serious crimes.\\r\\nAs the country grapples with the impact of a growing recession, a cost-benefit analysis of our criminal justice system is especially germane. The cost effectiveness of detention and incarceration scores very low compared with alternative approaches to youth delinquency in a cost-benefit analysis. A 2002 government commissioned study in Washington State revealed that for every one dollar spent on juvenile detention systems, a benefit return of $1.98 in terms of reduced crime and cost of crime to taxpayers was achieved. They found benefit returns ranging from $3.36- $13 for a series of detention alternatives.[29] This study indicates that alternative models are more effective in reducing youth offending in practical and economic terms.\\r\\nThe movement to reduce and end youth incarceration is a widespread collection of thousands of activists, lawyers, community organizers, educators, artists, and youth working on specific legislative and localized initiatives.\\r\\nMovement goals include shutting down particularly bad prisons and detention centers, demanding better treatment for youth in the system, providing and demanding better representation for young people in court, affecting legislation to curb youth incarceration, working to abolish arrest warrants for young people, and promoting alternatives to incarceration.\\r\\nThere are national organizations and local ones, opposition from inside the criminal justice system and from outside of it. The movement is diverse in many ways, and is difficult to encapsulate in a single entry. Listed below are some examples of movement struggles:\\r\\nThe Cheltenham Juvenile Detention Center in Maryland was one of the nation's most infamous prisons for boys. Started in 1872 as the House of Reformation for Colored Boys, Cheltenham was home to a wildly overrepresented population of minority youth. But the racial injustice inside the notorious prison was not what ultimately led to its demise.\\r\\nThe conditions at Cheltenham were deplorable. Overcrowded and understaffed, Cheltenham was also flagged by fire safety inspectors as one of the least safe buildings in the state. The antiquated prison structureeach cell had to be individually unlocked, and at times prison staff could not present keys to some cellswas also the site of an enormous amount of brutality and violence.\\r\\nLocal citizens in the Maryland Juvenile Justice Coalition developed the Maryland Campaign to Close Cheltenham in 2001. The campaign involved parents of incarcerated youth, youth activists, and faith leaders from across the state. Through a targeted media campaign to shift public opinion, the Campaign succeed in passing legislation through the annual budget to phase out and close Cheltenham, and to increase state spending on community-based alternative programs for youth offenders.[30]\\r\\nThe Tallulah Correction Center for Youth in Louisiana had been open for only three years when it was first sued by the United States Department of Justice (in collaboration with local activists in the Juvenile Justice Project of Louisiana) for violating the civil rights of youth held in its confinesmarking the first time in U.S. history that the federal government has actively sued a state over the conditions of its juvenile detention facilities.\\r\\nThat same year the filthy conditions, brutal violence and chronic understaffing earned the center a citation as \\"the worst in the nation.\\"[31] In 1999, even after the federal government had taken over partial responsibility for improving conditions, things were so unsafe for the youth that the staff of the center walked out, leaving 400 boys completely unsupervised.\\r\\nYouth and adult activists appealed to the state legislature to shut down the prison once and for all. But their aspirations didn't stop with the abolition of one prisonthey sought to redefine the juvenile justice system in the state, to change it from one based almost entirely on incarceration and punishment to a new system focusing on community-based alternatives to incarceration.[32]\\r\\nIn 2003 the state of Louisiana became nationally recognized for its leadership in reforming a broken juvenile justice system. With the passage of the Juvenile Justice Reform Act of 2003 (Act 1225), then Governor Kathleen Blanco and the Louisiana State Legislature ushered in a period of reform in which the notoriously brutal Tallulah prison for youth was shut down, conditions were improved in other abusive youth prisons throughout the state, and a commitment was made to both the increased use of alternatives to incarceration for youth and to revamping secure care prisons to be small, therapeutic facilities that were regionalized to keep children closer to their families.\\r\\nBefore the passage of Act 1225, over two thousand children were held in prison in Louisiana. Today the system holds just over 500 children statewide. In 1998 the rate of recidivism, or children returning to prison after release, was 56% as compared to 11% today. This decrease in the number of children incarcerated has contributed to an increase in public safety.[33]\\r\\nIn 2001 California residents passed Proposition 21, a multi-faceted proposition designed to be tough on youth crime, incorporating many youth offenders into the adult criminal justice jurisdiction.\\r\\nOpponents to this law included activists from Californians for Justice, Critical Resistance, the Youth Force Coalition, the Ella Baker Center for Human Rights, and the American Civil Liberties Union. Advocates in the ACLU challenged many portions of the law, including a provision automatically sentencing youth 14ÿ17 years old in adult court. This portion of the law was struck down by the California Courts of Appeal in 2001.[34]\\r\\nThe term \\"zero tolerance\\" is not defined in law or regulation; nor is there a single widely accepted practice definition. The United States Department of Education, National Center for Education Statistics, defined zero tolerance as \\"a policy that mandates predetermined consequences or punishments for specified offenses\\".[35] The purpose of zero-tolerance policies, according to their proponents, is to send a message that certain kinds of behaviors are not tolerable on school grounds. About 94% of public schools in the United States have zero-tolerance policies for guns; 91% for other weapons; 88% for drugs; 87% for alcohol and 79% for tobacco.[35]\\r\\nOpposition to zero-tolerance policies, especially at the local level, focus on critiques including charges that the program is discriminatory, unconstitutional, harmful to schools and students, ineptly implemented, and provides harsh punishment (suspension of education) for minor offenses (possession of tobacco).\\r\\nA few infamous cases have been used by opposition groups, such as Amnesty International, to further their case against the policy. The Center for Juvenile and Criminal Justice released a story in 2003 about a 13-year-old girl in Tuscaloosa, Alabama arrested and detained for 5 weeks for possession of what was thought to be marijuana, but turned out to be oregano.[36] The zero-tolerance practice in Illinois of sending any youth charged with drug crimes within 1,000 feet of any school or public housing project directly to adult court has resulted in the largest racial disparity in the countryover 99% of youth affected by this policy were minority youth.[37]\\r\\nOpposition to zero-tolerance policies nationwide and locally is broad and growing. Organizational leadership has been provided nationally by Amnesty International and the American Bar Association, who has officially opposed such policies since 2001.[38]\\r\\nMost activists in the movement to end youth incarceration believe that the best way to mitigate the impact of detention and incarceration on our youth is to reduce the number of youth that pass through the system. By providing credible alternatives to incarceration, this portion of the movement provides opportunities for communities to treat, rather than punish, young offendersmuch the way that the juvenile justice system was founded to do.\\r\\nThe Juvenile Detention Alternatives Initiative (JDAI) is a private-public partnership being implemented nationwide, with pilot programs in California, Oregon, New Mexico and Illinois. Their goal is to make sure that locked detention is used only when absolutely necessary. The JDAI has produced some promising results from their programs. Detention center populations fell by between 14% and 88% in JDAI counties over the course of 7 years (1996ÿ2003). These same counties saw declines in juvenile arrests (an indicator of overall juvenile crime rates) during the same time period ranging from 37ÿ54%.[39]\\r\\nAlternatives for juvenile detention centers for rehabilitation and reentry processes for those already incarcerated requires the work of counselors who understand the psychology of these individuals from law enforcement bodies to develop effective diversion programs are the best strategy to ensure children and youth to stay away from detention centers. Diversion programs could include everything from counseling to peer mentoring in order to improve the relationship in the community and remove the stigma of criminal youth. There are solutions proven effective for those communities that impose them. For example, intervention centers are a progressive solution where trouble kids get the opportunity to be disciplined to correct behavior but the process involves family involvement, community service activities, and one-on-one therapy. Legislation work such as Colorado's Smart School Discipline Law work to implement prevention strategies in an early stage starting in school, revise and provide adequate training to police officers in order to find proper disciplinary practice when dealing with trouble students. The initiative is now part of a bigger network to be implemented nationwide.","input":"How many juvenile offenders are there in the us?"},{"output":"16th to 20th centuries","context":"118,000[17][18]\\r\\n8,246[26]\\r\\nThe French (French: Fran?ais) are an ethnic group[28][29][30] and nation who are identified with the country of France. This connection may be legal, historical, or cultural.\\r\\nHistorically the French people's heritage is diverse, including populations of Gauls, Ligures, Latins, Franks, Iberians, Alamans and Norsemen.[31] France has long been a patchwork of local customs and regional differences, and while most French people still speak the French language as their mother tongue, languages like Norman, Occitan, Catalan, Auvergnat, Corsican, Basque, French Flemish, Lorraine Franconian, Alsatian and Breton remain spoken in some regions.\\r\\nModern French society is a melting pot.[32] From the middle of the 19th century, it experienced a high rate of inward migration and the government, defining France as an inclusive nation with universal values, advocated assimilation through which immigrants were expected to adhere to French values and cultural norms. Nowadays, while the government has let newcomers retain their distinctive cultures since the mid-1980s and requires from them a mere integration,[33] French citizens still equate their nationality with citizenship as does French law.[34]\\r\\nIn addition to mainland France, French people and people of French descent can be found internationally, in overseas departments and territories of France such as the French West Indies (French Caribbean), and in foreign countries with significant French-speaking population groups or not, such as Switzerland (French Swiss), the United States (French Americans), Canada (French Canadians), Argentina (French Argentines), Brazil (French Brazilians) or Uruguay (French Uruguayans).[35][36]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nTo be French, according to the first article of the French Constitution, is to be a citizen of France, regardless of one's origin, race, or religion (sans distinction d'origine, de race ou de religion).[34] According to its principles, France has devoted itself to the destiny of a proposition nation, a generic territory where people are bounded only by the French language and the assumed willingness to live together, as defined by Ernest Renan's \\"plbiscite de tous les jours\\" ('everyday plebiscite') on the willingness to live together, in Renan's 1882 essay \\"Qu'est-ce qu'une nation?\\").\\r\\nThe debate concerning the integration of this view with the principles underlying the European Community remains open.[37]\\r\\nA large number of foreigners[38] have traditionally been permitted to live in France and succeeded in doing so.[39] Indeed, the country has long valued its openness, tolerance and the quality of services available.[40] Application for French citizenship is often interpreted as a renunciation of previous state allegiance unless a dual citizenship agreement exists between the two countries (for instance, this is the case with Switzerland: one can be both French and Swiss). The European treaties have formally permitted movement and European citizens enjoy formal rights to employment in the state sector (though not as trainees in reserved branches, e.g., as magistrates).\\r\\nSeeing itself as an inclusive nation with universal values, France has always valued and strongly advocated assimilation. However, the success of such assimilation has recently been called into question. There is increasing dissatisfaction with, and within, growing ethno-cultural enclaves (communautarisme). The 2005 French riots in some troubled and impoverished suburbs (les quartiers sensibles) were an example of such tensions. However they should not be interpreted as ethnic conflicts (as appeared before in other countries like the USA and the UK) but as social conflicts born out of socioeconomic problems endangering proper integration.[41]\\r\\nFrench people are the descendants of Gauls and Romans, western European Celtic and Italic peoples, as well as Bretons, Aquitanians, Ligurians and to a lesser extent, Germanic people arriving at the beginning of the Frankish Empire such as the Franks, the Visigoths, the Suebi, the Saxons, the Allemanni and the Burgundians, and later Germanic groups such as the Vikings (known as Normans), who settled in Normandy and to a lesser extent in Brittany in the 9th century.[42]\\r\\nThe name \\"France\\" etymologically derives from the word Francia, the territory of the Franks. The Franks were a Germanic tribe that overran Roman Gaul at the end of the Roman Empire.\\r\\nIn the pre-Roman era, all of Gaul (an area of Western Europe that encompassed all of what is known today as France, Belgium, part of Germany and Switzerland, and Northern Italy) was inhabited by a variety of peoples who were known collectively as the Gaulish tribes. Their ancestors were Celts who came from Central Europe in the 7th century BCE (and even before, according to new research[43]), and dominated native peoples which can't be clearly identified except the Ligures (Alps and Provence), the Iberians at the eastern bottom of the Pyrenees (south of Agde according to Avenius) and Aquitanic people (among them, the Basques) in Aquitaine. Some, particularly in the northern and eastern areas, had Germanic admixture (the Belgae); many of these peoples had already spoken Celtic (Gaulish) by the time of the Roman conquest, but others seem to have spoken a Celto-Germanic creole.\\r\\nGaul was militarily conquered in 58-51 BCE by the Roman legions under the command of General Julius Caesar (except the south-east which had already been conquered about one century earlier). The area then became part of the Roman Empire. Over the next five centuries the two cultures intermingled, creating a hybridized Gallo-Roman culture. The Gaulish vernacular language disappeared step by step to be replaced everywhere by Vulgar Latin, which would later develop under Frankish influence into the French language in the North of France. Today, the last redoubt of Celtic culture and language in France can be found in the northwestern region of Brittany, although this is not the result of a survival of Gaulish language but of a 5th-century AD migration of Brythonic speaking Celts from Britain.\\r\\nWith the decline of the Roman Empire in Western Europe, a federation of Germanic peoples entered the picture: the Franks, from which the word \\"French\\" derives. The Franks were Germanic pagans who began to settle in northern Gaul as laeti, already during the Roman era. They continued to filter across the Rhine River from present-day Netherlands and Germany between the third to the 7th century. At the beginning, they served in the Roman army and reached high commands. Their language is still spoken as a kind of Dutch (Flemish - Low Frankish) in northern France (Westhoek) and Frankish (Central Franconian) in German speaking Lorraine. Another Germanic people immigrated massively to Alsace: the Alamans, which explains the Alemannic German spoken there. They were competitors of the Franks; that's why it became at the Renaissance time the word for German in French: Allemand.\\r\\nBy the early 6th century the Franks, led by the Merovingian king Clovis I and his sons, had consolidated their hold on much of modern-day France, the country to which they gave their name. The other major Germanic people to arrive in France (after the Burgundians and the Visigoths) were the Norsemen or Northmen, (which was shortened to Norman in France), Viking raiders from modern Denmark and Norway, who settled with Anglo-Scandinavians and Anglo-Saxons from the Danelaw definitely in the northern region known today as Normandy in the 9th and 10th century, and which was given in fiefdom of the kingdom of France by king Charles III. The Vikings eventually intermarried with the local people, converting to Christianity in the process. It was the Normans who, two centuries later, would go on to conquer England and Southern Italy.\\r\\nEventually, though, the largely autonomous duchy of Normandy was incorporated back into the royal domain (i. e. the territory under direct control of the French king) in the Middle Ages. In the crusader Kingdom of Jerusalem, founded in 1099, at most 120 000 Franks (predominantly French-speaking Western Christians) ruled over 350,000 Muslims, Jews, and native Eastern Christians.[44]\\r\\nIn the roughly 900 years after the Norman invasions France had a fairly settled population.[citation needed] Unlike elsewhere in Europe, France experienced relatively low levels of emigration to the Americas, with the exception of the Huguenots, due to a lower birthrate than in the rest of Europe. However, significant emigration of mainly Roman Catholic French populations led to the settlement of the Province of Acadia, Canada (New France) and Louisiana, all (at the time) French possessions, as well as colonies in the West Indies, Mascarene islands and Africa.\\r\\nOn 30 December 1687 a community of French Huguenots settled in South Africa. Most of these originally settled in the Cape Colony, but have since been quickly absorbed into the Afrikaner population. After Champlain's founding of Quebec City in 1608, it became the capital of New France. Encouraging settlement was difficult, and while some immigration did occur, by 1763 New France only had a population of some 65,000.[45] From 1713 to 1787, 30,000 colonists immigrated from France to the Saint-Domingue. In 1805, when the French were forced out of Saint-Domingue (Haiti), 35,000 French settlers were given lands in Cuba.[46]\\r\\nBy the beginning of the 17th century, some 20% of the total male population of Catalonia was made up of French immigrants.[47] In the 18th century and early 19th century, a small migration of French emigrated by official invitation of the Habsburgs to the Austro-Hungarian Empire, now the nations of Austria, Czech Republic, Hungary, Slovakia, Serbia and Romania.[48] Some of them, coming from French-speaking communes in Lorraine or being French Swiss Walsers from the Valais canton in Switzerland, maintained for some generations the French language and a specific ethnic identity, later labelled as Banat (French: Fran?ais du Banat). By 1788 there were 8 villages populated by French colonists.[49]\\r\\nThe French First Republic appeared following the 1789 French Revolution. It replaced the ancient kingdom of France, ruled by the divine right of kings.\\r\\nHobsbawm highlighted the role of conscription, invented by Napoleon, and of the 1880s public instruction laws, which allowed mixing of the various groups of France into a nationalist mold which created the French citizen and his consciousness of membership to a common nation, while the various regional languages of France were progressively eradicated.\\r\\nThe 1870 Franco-Prussian War, which led to the short-lived Paris Commune of 1871, was instrumental in bolstering patriotic feelings; until World War I (1914ÿ1918), French politicians never completely lost sight of the disputed Alsace-Lorraine region which played a major role in the definition of the French nation and therefore of the French people.\\r\\nThe decrees of 24 October 1870 by Adolphe Crmieux granted automatic and massive French citizenship to all Jewish people of Algeria.\\r\\nSuccessive waves of immigrants during the 19th and 20th centuries were rapidly assimilated into French culture. France's population dynamics began to change in the middle of the 19th century, as France joined the Industrial Revolution. The pace of industrial growth attracted millions of European immigrants over the next century, with especially large numbers arriving from Poland, Belgium, Portugal, Italy, and Spain.[50]\\r\\nIn the period from 1915 to 1950, many immigrants came from Czechoslovakia, Hungary, Russia, Scandinavia and Yugoslavia. Small but significant numbers of Frenchmen in the North and Northeast regions have relatives in Germany and Great Britain.\\r\\nBetween 1956 and 1967, about 235,000 North African Jews from Algeria, Tunisia, and Morocco also immigrated to France due to the decline of the French empire and following the Six-Day War. Hence, by 1968, Jews of North African origin comprised the majority of the Jewish population of France. As these new immigrants were already culturally French they needed little time to adjust to French society.[51]\\r\\nFrench law made it easy for thousands of settlers (colons in French), national French from former colonies of North and East Africa, India and Indochina to live in mainland France. It is estimated that 20,000 settlers were living in Saigon in 1945, and there were 68,430 European settlers living in Madagascar in 1958.[52] 1.6?million European pieds noirs settlers migrated from Algeria, Tunisia and Morocco.[53] In just a few months in 1962, 900,000 pied noir settlers left Algeria in the most massive relocation of population in Europe since the World War II.[54] In the 1970s, over 30,000 French settlers left Cambodia during the Khmer Rouge regime as the Pol Pot government confiscated their farms and land properties.\\r\\nIn the 1960s, a second wave of immigration came to France, which was needed for reconstruction purposes and for cheaper labour after the devastation brought on by World War II. French entrepreneurs went to Maghreb countries looking for cheap labour, thus encouraging work-immigration to France. Their settlement was officialized with Jacques Chirac's family regrouping act of 1976 (regroupement familial). Since then, immigration has become more varied, although France stopped being a major immigration country compared to other European countries. The large impact of North African and Arab immigration is the greatest and has brought racial, socio-cultural and religious questions to a country seen as homogenously European, French and Christian for thousands of years. Nevertherless, according to Justin Va?sse, professor at Sciences Po Paris, integration of Muslim immigrants is happening as part of a background evolution[55] and recent studies confirmed the results of their assimilation, showing that \\"North Africans seem to be characterized by a high degree of cultural integration reflected in a relatively high propensity to exogamy\\" with rates ranging from 20% to 50%.[56] According to Emmanuel Todd the relatively high exogamy among French Algerians can be explained by the colonial link between France and Algeria.[57]\\r\\nA small French descent group also subsequently arrived from Latin America (Argentina, Chile and Uruguay) in the 1970s.\\r\\nMost French people speak the French language as their mother tongue, but certain languages like Norman, Occitan, Auvergnat, Corsican, Euskara, French Flemish and Breton remain spoken in certain regions (see Language policy in France). There have also been periods of history when a majority of French people had other first languages (local languages such as Occitan, Catalan, Alsatian, West Flemish, Lorraine Franconian, Gallo, Picard or Ch'timi and Arpitan). Today, many immigrants speak another tongue at home.\\r\\nAccording to historian Eric Hobsbawm, \\"the French language has been essential to the concept of 'France',\\" although in 1789, 50 percent of the French people did not speak it at all, and only 12 to 13 percent spoke it fairly well; even in o?l languages zones, it was not usually used except in cities, and even there not always in the outlying districts.[58]\\r\\nAbroad, the French language is spoken in many different countries ÿ in particular the former French colonies. Nevertheless, speaking French is distinct from being a French citizen. Thus, francophonie, or the speaking of French, must not be confused with French citizenship or ethnicity. For example, French speakers in Switzerland are not \\"French citizens\\".\\r\\nNative English-speaking Blacks on the island of Saint-Martin hold French nationality even though they do not speak French as a first language, while their neighbouring French-speaking Haitian immigrants (who also speak a French-creole) remain foreigners. Large numbers of people of French ancestry outside Europe speak other first languages, particularly English, throughout most of North America (except French Canada), Spanish or Portuguese in southern South America, and Afrikaans in South Africa.\\r\\nThe adjective \\"French\\" can be used to mean either \\"French citizen\\" or \\"French-speaker\\", and usage varies depending on the context, with the former being common in France. The latter meaning is often used in Canada, when discussing matters internal to Canada.\\r\\nThe modern ethnic French are the descendants of Celts, Iberians, Ligurians and Greeks in southern France,[59][60] mixed with Germanic peoples arriving at the end of the Roman Empire such as the Franks and the Burgundians,[31][61][62] and some Vikings who mixed with the Normans and settled mostly in Normandy in the 9th century.[42]\\r\\nAccording to Dominique Schnapper, \\"The classical conception of the nation is that of an entity which, opposed to the ethnic group, affirms itself as an open community, the will to live together expressing itself by the acceptation of the rules of a unified public domain which transcends all particularisms\\".[63] This conception of the nation as being composed by a \\"will to live together,\\" supported by the classic lecture of Ernest Renan in 1882, has been opposed by the French far-right, in particular the nationalist Front National (\\"National Front\\" - FN) party which claims that there is such a thing as a \\"French ethnic group\\". The discourse of ethno-nationalist groups such as the Front National (FN), however, advances the concept of Fran?ais de souche or \\"indigenous\\" French.\\r\\nThe conventional conception of French history starts with Ancient Gaul, and French national identity often views the Gauls as national precursors, either as biological ancestors (hence the refrain nos anctres les Gaulois), as emotional/spiritual ancestors, or both.[64][65][66] Vercingetorix, the Gaulish chieftain who tried to unite the various Gallic tribes of the land against Roman encroachment but was ultimately vanquished by Julius Caesar, is often revered as a \\"first national hero\\".[65][66] In the famously popular French comic Asterix, the main characters are patriotic Gauls fight against Roman invaders[64][66] while in modern days the term Gaulois is used in French to distinguish the \\"native\\" French from French of immigrant origins. However, despite its occasional nativist usage, the Gaulish identity has also been embraced by French of non-native origins as well: notably, Napoleon III, whose family was ultimately of Corsican and Italian roots, identified France with Gaul and Vercingetorix,[66] and declared that \\"New France, ancient France, Gaul are one and the same moral person.\\"[65]\\r\\nIt has been noted that the French view of having Gallic origins has evolved over history. Before the French Revolution, it divided social classes, with the peasants identifying with the native Gauls while the aristocracy identified with the Franks.[65] During the early nineteenth century,[65] intellectuals began using the identification with Gaul instead as a unifying force[66] to bridge divisions within French society with a common national origin myth. Myriam Krepps of the University of Nebraska-Omaha argues that the view of \\"a unified territory (one land since the beginning of civilization) and a unified people\\" which de-emphasized \\"all disparities and the succession of waves of invaders\\" was first imprinted on the masses by the unified history curriculum of French textbooks in the late 1870s.[65]\\r\\nSince the beginning of the Third Republic (1871ÿ1940), the state has not categorized people according to their alleged ethnic origins. Hence, in contrast to the United States Census, French people are not asked to define their ethnic appartenance, whichever it may be. The usage of ethnic and racial categorization is avoided to prevent any case of discrimination; the same regulations apply to religious membership data that cannot be compiled under the French Census. This classic French republican non-essentialist conception of nationality is officialized by the French Constitution, according to which \\"French\\" is a nationality, and not a specific ethnicity.\\r\\nFrance has been influenced by the many different human migrations that wide-crossed Europe over time. Prehistoric and Neolithic population movements could have influenced the genetic diversity of this country. A study in 2009 analysed 555 French individuals from 7 different regions in mainland France and found the following Y-DNA Haplogroups. The five main haplogroups are R1 (63.41%), E (11.41%) (traced mostly in the Paris area), I (8.88%), J (7.97%) and G (5.16%). R1b (particularly R1b1b2) was found to be the most dominant Y chromosomal lineage in France, covering about 60% of the Y chromosomal lineages. The high frequency of this haplogroup is typical in all West European populations. Haplogroups I and G are also characteristic markers for many different West European populations. Haplogroups J and E1b1b (M35, M78, M81 and M34) consist of lineages with differential distribution within Middle East, North Africa and Europe. Only adults with French surnames were analyzed by the study.[67][68]\\r\\nProvence, a province of southern France was colonized by Ancient Greeks who founded the cities of Marseilles and Nice. A study in 2011 found that 17% of the Y-chromosomes (exclusive to males) of Marseilles may be attributed to Greek colonization, predicting a maximum of a 10% Greek contribution into the local population as opposed to Celto-Ligurian autochthonous input, suggesting a Greek male elite-dominant input into the Iron Age Provence population. There was also some evidence for limited Greek influence in Corsica.[69]\\r\\nFrench nationality has not meant automatic citizenship. Some categories of French people have been excluded, throughout the years, from full citizenship:\\r\\nFrance was one of the first countries to implement denaturalization laws. Philosopher Giorgio Agamben has pointed out this fact that the 1915 French law which permitted denaturalization with regard to naturalized citizens of \\"enemy\\" origins was one of the first example of such legislation, which Nazi Germany later implemented with the 1935 Nuremberg Laws.[74]\\r\\nFurthermore, some authors who have insisted on the \\"crisis of the nation-state\\" allege that nationality and citizenship are becoming separate concepts. They show as example \\"international\\", \\"supranational citizenship\\" or \\"world citizenship\\" (membership to international nongovernmental organizations such as Amnesty International or Greenpeace). This would indicate a path toward a \\"postnational citizenship\\".[71]\\r\\nBeside this, modern citizenship is linked to civic participation (also called positive freedom), which implies voting, demonstrations, petitions, activism, etc. Therefore, social exclusion may lead to deprivation of citizenship. This has led various authors (Philippe Van Parijs, Jean-Marc Ferry, Alain Caill, Andr Gorz) to theorize a guaranteed minimum income which would impede exclusion from citizenship.[75]\\r\\nIn France, the conception of citizenship teeters between universalism and multiculturalism, especially in recent years. French citizenship has been defined for a long time by three factors: integration, individual adherence, and the primacy of the soil (jus soli). Political integration (which includes but is not limited to racial integration) is based on voluntary policies which aims at creating a common identity, and the interiorization by each individual of a common cultural and historic legacy. Since in France, the state preceded the nation, voluntary policies have taken an important place in the creation of this common cultural identity.[76]\\r\\nOn the other hand, the interiorization of a common legacy is a slow process, which B. Villalba compares to acculturation. According to him, \\"integration is therefore the result of a double will: the nation's will to create a common culture for all members of the nation, and the communities' will living in the nation to recognize the legitimacy of this common culture\\".[71] Villalba warns against confusing recent processes of integration (related to the so-called \\"second generation immigrants\\", who are subject to discrimination), with older processes which have made modern France. Villalba thus shows that any democratic nation characterize itself by its project of transcending all forms of particular memberships (whether biological - or seen as such,[77] ethnic, historic, economic, social, religious or cultural). The citizen thus emancipates himself from the particularisms of identity which characterize himself to attain a more \\"universal\\" dimension. He is a citizen, before being a member of a community or of a social class[78]\\r\\nTherefore, according to Villalba, \\"a democratic nation is, by definition, multicultural as it gathers various populations, which differs by their regional origins (Auvergnats, Bretons, Corsicans or Lorrains...), their national origins (immigrant, son or grandson of an immigrant), or religious origins (Catholics, Protestants, Jews, Muslims, Agnostics or Atheists...).\\"[71]\\r\\nErnest Renan described this republican conception in his famous 11 March 1882 conference at the Sorbonne, Qu'est-ce qu'une nation? (\\"What is a Nation?\\").[79] According to him, to belong to a nation is a subjective act which always has to be repeated, as it is not assured by objective criteria. A nation-state is not composed of a single homogeneous ethnic group (a community), but of a variety of individuals willing to live together.\\r\\nRenan's non-essentialist definition, which forms the basis of the French Republic, is diametrically opposed to the German ethnic conception of a nation, first formulated by Fichte. The German conception is usually qualified in France as an \\"exclusive\\" view of nationality, as it includes only the members of the corresponding ethnic group, while the Republican conception thinks itself as universalist, following the Enlightenment's ideals officialized by the 1789 Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen. While Ernest Renan's arguments were also concerned by the debate about the disputed Alsace-Lorraine region, he said that not only one referendum had to be made in order to ask the opinions of the Alsatian people, but also a \\"daily referendum\\" should be made concerning all those citizens wanting to live in the French nation-state. This plbiscite de tous les jours ('everyday plebiscite') might be compared to a social contract or even to the classic definition of consciousness as an act which repeats itself endlessly.[80]\\r\\nHenceforth, contrary to the German definition of a nation based on objective criteria, such as race or ethnic group, which may be defined by the existence of a common language, among other criteria, the people of France is defined as all the people living in the French nation-state and willing to do so, i.e. by its citizenship. This definition of the French nation-state contradicts the common opinion, which holds that the concept of the French people identifies with one particular ethnic group. This contradiction explains the seeming paradox encountered when attempting to identify a \\"French ethnic group\\": the French conception of the nation is radically opposed to (and was thought in opposition to) the German conception of the Volk (\\"ethnic group\\").\\r\\nThis universalist conception of citizenship and of the nation has influenced the French model of colonization. While the British empire preferred an indirect rule system, which did not mix the colonized people with the colonists, the French Republic theoretically chose an integration system and considered parts of its colonial empire as France itself and its population as French people.[81] The ruthless conquest of Algeria thus led to the integration of the territory as a Dpartement of the French territory.\\r\\nThis ideal also led to the ironic sentence which opened up history textbooks in France as in its colonies: \\"Our ancestors the Gauls...\\". However, this universal ideal, rooted in the 1789 French Revolution (\\"bringing liberty to the people\\"), suffered from the racism that impregnated colonialism. Thus, in Algeria, the Crmieux decrees at the end of the 19th century gave French citizenship to north African Jews, while Muslims were regulated by the 1881 Indigenous Code. Liberal author Tocqueville himself considered that the British model was better adapted than the French one and did not balk before the cruelties of General Bugeaud's conquest. He went as far as advocating racial segregation there.[82]\\r\\nThis paradoxical tension between the universalist conception of the French nation and the racism inherent in colonization is most obvious in Ernest Renan himself, who went as far as advocating a kind of eugenics. In a 26 June 1856 letter to Arthur de Gobineau, author of An Essay on the Inequality of the Human Races (1853ÿ55) and one of the first theoreticians of \\"scientific racism\\", he wrote:\\r\\n\\"You have written a remarkable book here, full of vigour and originality of mind, only it's written to be little understood in France or rather it's written to be misunderstood here. The French mind turns little to ethnographic considerations: France has little belief in race, [...] The fact of race is huge originally; but it's been continually losing its importance, and sometimes, as in France, it happens to disappear completely. Does that mean total decadence? Yes, certainly from the standpoint of the stability of institutions, the originality of character, a certain nobility that I hold to be the most important factor in the conjunction of human affairs. But also what compensations! No doubt if the noble elements mixed in the blood of a people happened to disappear completely, then there would be a demeaning equality, like that of some Eastern states and in some respects China. But it is in fact a very small amount of noble blood put into the circulation of a people that is enough to ennoble them, at least as to historical effects; this is how France, a nation so completely fallen into commonness, in practice plays on the world stage the role of a gentleman. Setting aside the quite inferior races whose intermingling with the great races would only poison the human species, I see in the future a homogeneous humanity.\\"[83]\\r\\nDuring the Ancien Rgime (before the 1789 French revolution), jus soli (or \\"right of territory\\") was predominant. Feudal law recognized personal allegeance to the sovereign, but the subjects of the sovereign were defined by their birthland. According to the 3 September 1791 Constitution, those who are born in France from a foreign father and have fixed their residency in France, or those who, after being born in foreign country from a French father, have come to France and have sworn their civil oath, become French citizens. Because of the war, distrust toward foreigners led to the obligation on the part of this last category to swear a civil oath in order to gain French nationality.\\r\\nHowever, the Napoleonic Code would insist on jus sanguinis (\\"right of blood\\"). Paternity, against Napolon Bonaparte's wish, became the principal criterion of nationality, and therefore broke for the first time with the ancient tradition of jus soli, by breaking any residency condition toward children born abroad from French parents. However, according to Patrick Weil, it was not \\"ethnically motivated\\" but \\"only meant that family links transmitted by the pater familias had become more important than subjecthood\\".[84]\\r\\nWith the 7 February 1851 law, voted during the Second Republic (1848ÿ1852), \\"double jus soli\\" was introduced in French legislation, combining birth origin with paternity. Thus, it gave French nationality to the child of a foreigner, if both are born in France, except if the year following his coming of age he reclaims a foreign nationality (thus prohibiting dual nationality). This 1851 law was in part passed because of conscription concerns. This system more or less remained the same until the 1993 reform of the Nationality Code, created by the 9 January 1973 law.\\r\\nThe 1993 reform, which defines the Nationality law, is deemed controversial by some. It commits young people born in France to foreign parents to solicit French nationality between the ages of 16 and 21. This has been criticized, some arguing that the principle of equality before the law was not complied with, since French nationality was no longer given automatically at birth, as in the classic \\"double jus soli\\" law, but was to be requested when approaching adulthood. Henceforth, children born in France from French parents were differentiated from children born in France from foreign parents, creating a hiatus between these two categories.\\r\\nThe 1993 reform was prepared by the Pasqua laws. The first Pasqua law, in 1986, restricts residence conditions in France and facilitates expulsions. With this 1986 law, a child born in France from foreign parents can only acquire French nationality if he or she demonstrates his or her will to do so, at age 16, by proving that he or she has been schooled in France and has a sufficient command of the French language. This new policy is symbolized by the expulsion of 101 Malians by charter.[71]\\r\\nThe second Pasqua law on \\"immigration control\\" makes regularisation of illegal aliens more difficult and, in general, residence conditions for foreigners much harder. Charles Pasqua, who said on 11 May 1987: \\"Some have reproached me of having used a plane, but, if necessary, I will use trains\\", declared to Le Monde on 2 June 1993: \\"France has been a country of immigration, it doesn't want to be one anymore. Our aim, taking into account the difficulties of the economic situation, is to tend toward 'zero immigration' (\\"immigration zro\\")\\".[71]\\r\\nTherefore, modern French nationality law combines four factors: paternality or 'right of blood', birth origin, residency and the will expressed by a foreigner, or a person born in France to foreign parents, to become French.\\r\\nThe 1992 Maastricht Treaty introduced the concept of European citizenship, which comes in addition to national citizenships.\\r\\nBy definition, a \\"foreigner\\" is someone who does not have French nationality. Therefore, it is not a synonym of \\"immigrant\\", as a foreigner may be born in France. On the other hand, a Frenchman born abroad may be considered an immigrant (e.g. former prime minister Dominique de Villepin who lived the majority of his life abroad). In most of the cases, however, a foreigner is an immigrant, and vice versa. They either benefit from legal sojourn in France, which, after a residency of ten years, makes it possible to ask for naturalisation.[85] If they do not, they are considered \\"illegal aliens\\". Some argue that this privation of nationality and citizenship does not square with their contribution to the national economic efforts, and thus to economic growth.\\r\\nIn any cases, rights of foreigners in France have improved over the last half-century:\\r\\nThe INSEE does not collect data about language, religion, or ethnicity ÿ on the principle of the secular and unitary nature of the French Republic.[86]\\r\\nNevertheless, there are some sources dealing with just such distinctions:\\r\\nIt is said by some[who?] that France adheres to the ideal of a single, homogeneous national culture, supported by the absence of hyphenated identities and by avoidance of the very term \\"ethnicity\\" in French discourse.[91]\\r\\nAs of 2008, the French national institute of statistics INSEE estimated that 5,3 million foreign-born immigrants and 6,5 million direct descendants of immigrants (born in France with at least one immigrant parent) lived in France representing a total of 11.8 million and 19% of the total population in metropolitan France (62,1 million in 2008). Among them, about 5,5 million are of European origin and 4 million of North African origin.[92][93]\\r\\nBetween 1848 and 1939, 1 million people with French passports emigrated to other countries.[94] The main communities of French ancestry in the New World are found in the United States, Canada and Argentina while sizeable groups are also found in Brazil, Chile, Uruguay and Australia.\\r\\nThere are nearly seven million French speakers out of nine to ten million people of French and partial French ancestry in Canada. The Canadian province of Quebec (2006 census population of 7,546,131), where more than 95 percent of the people speak French as either their first, second or even third language, is the center of French life on the Western side of the Atlantic; however, French settlement began further east, in Acadia. Quebec is home to vibrant French-language arts, media, and learning. There are sizable French-Canadian communities scattered throughout the other provinces of Canada, particularly in Ontario, which has about 1 million people with French ancestry (400 000 who have French as their mother tongue), Manitoba, and New Brunswick, which is the only fully bilingual province and is 33 percent Acadian.\\r\\nThe United States is home to an estimated 13 to 16 million people of French descent, or 4 to 5 percent of the US population, particularly in Louisiana, New England and parts of the Midwest. The French community in Louisiana consists of the Creoles, the descendants of the French settlers who arrived when Louisiana was a French colony, and the Cajuns, the descendants of Acadian refugees from the Great Upheaval. Very few creoles remain in New Orleans in present times. In New England, the vast majority of French immigration in the 19th and early 20th centuries came not from France, but from over the border in Quebec, the Quebec diaspora. These French Canadians arrived to work in the timber mills and textile plants that appeared throughout the region as it industrialized. Today, nearly 25 percent of the population of New Hampshire is of French ancestry, the highest of any state.\\r\\nEnglish and Dutch colonies of pre-Revolutionary America attracted large numbers of French Huguenots fleeing religious persecution in France. In the Dutch colony of New Netherland that later became New York, northern New Jersey, and western Connecticut, these French Huguenots, nearly identical in religion to the Dutch Reformed Church, assimilated almost completely into the Dutch community. However, large it may have been at one time, it has lost all identity of its French origin, often with the translation of names (examples: de la Montagne > Vandenberg by translation; de Vaux > DeVos or Devoe by phonetic respelling). Huguenots appeared in all of the English colonies and likewise assimilated. Even though this mass settlement approached the size of the settlement of the French settlement of Quebec, it has assimilated into the English-speaking mainstream to a much greater extent than other French colonial groups and has left few traces of cultural influence. New Rochelle, New York is named after La Rochelle, France, one of the sources of Huguenot emigration to the Dutch colony; and New Paltz, New York, is one of the few non-urban settlements of Huguenots that did not undergo massive recycling of buildings in the usual redevelopment of such older, larger cities as New York City or New Rochelle.\\r\\nFrench Argentines form the third largest ancestry group in Argentina, after Italian and Spanish Argentines. Most of French immigrants came to Argentina between 1871 and 1890, though considerable immigration continued until the late 1940s. At least half of these immigrants came from Southwestern France, especially from the Basque Country, Barn (Basses-Pyrnes accounted for more than 20% of immigrants), Bigorre and Rouergue but also from Savoy and the Paris region. Today around 6.8?million Argentines have some degree of French ancestry or are of partial or wholly of French descent (up to 17% of the total population).[95] French Argentines had a considerable influence over the country, particularly on its architectural styles and literary traditions, as well as on the scientific field. Some notable Argentines of French descent include writer Julio Cortzar, physiologist and Nobel Prize winner Bernardo Houssay or activist Alicia Moreau de Justo. With something akin to Latin culture, the French immigrants quickly assimilated into mainstream Argentine society.\\r\\nFrench Uruguayans form the third largest ancestry group in Uruguay, after Italian and Spanish Uruguayans. During the first half of the 19th century, Uruguay received mostly French immigrants to South America. It constituted back then the second receptor of French immigrants in the New World after the United States. Thus, while the United States received 195,971 French immigrants between 1820 and 1855, 13,922 Frenchmen, most of them from the Basque Country and Barn, left for Uruguay between 1833 and 1842.[96]\\r\\nThe majority of immigrants were coming from the Basque Country, Barn and Bigorre. Today, there are an estimated at 300,000 French descendants in Uruguay.[7]\\r\\nFrench migration to the United Kingdom is a phenomenon that has occurred at various points in history. Many British people have French ancestry, and French remains the foreign language most learned by British people. Much of the UK's mediaeval aristocracy was descended from Franco-Norman migrants at the time of the Norman Conquest of England, and also during the Angevin Empire of the Plantagenet dynasty.\\r\\nAccording to a study by Ancestry.co.uk, 3 million British people are of French descent.[97] Among those are television presenters Davina McCall and Louis Theroux. There are currently an estimated 400,000 French people in the United Kingdom, most of them in London.[98][99]\\r\\nThe first French emigration in Costa Rica was a very small number to Cartago in the mid-nineteenth century. Due to World War II, a group of exiled French (mostly soldiers and families orphaned) migrated to the country.[100]\\r\\nIn Mexico, a sizeable population can trace its ancestry to France. After Spain, this makes France the second largest European ethnicity in the country. The bulk of French immigrants arrived in Mexico during the 19th and early 20th centuries.\\r\\nFrom 1814 to 1955, inhabitants of Barcelonnette and the surrounding Ubaye Valley emigrated to Mexico by the dozens. Many established textile businesses between Mexico and France. At the turn of the 20th century, there were 5,000 French families from the Barcelonnette region registered with the French Consulate in Mexico. While 90% stayed in Mexico, some returned, and from 1880 to 1930, built grand mansions called Maisons Mexicaines and left a mark upon the city.\\r\\nIn the 1860s, during the Second Mexican Empire ruled by Emperor Maximilian I of Mexicowhich was part of Napoleon III's scheme to create a Latin empire in the New World (indeed responsible for coining the term of \\"Amrique latine\\", \\"Latin America\\" in English)-- many French soldiers, merchants, and families set foot upon Mexican soil. Emperor Maximilian's consort, Carlota of Mexico, a Belgian princess, was a granddaughter of Louis-Philippe of France.\\r\\nMany Mexicans of French descent live in cities or states such as Zacatecas, San Luis Potos, Sinaloa, Monterrey, Puebla, Guadalajara, and the capital, Mexico City, where French surnames such as Chairez/Chaires, Renaux, Pierres, Michel, Betancourt, Alaniz, Blanc, Ney, Jurado (Jure), Colo (Coleau), Dumas, or Moussier can be found.\\r\\nThe French came to Chile in the 18th century, arriving at Concepci܇n as merchants, and in the mid-19th century to cultivate vines in the haciendas of the Central Valley, the homebase of world-famous Chilean wine. The Araucana Region also has an important number of people of French ancestry, as the area hosted settlers arrived by the second half of the 19th century as farmers and shopkeepers. With something akin to Latin culture, the French immigrants quickly assimilated into mainstream Chilean society.\\r\\nFrom 1840 to 1940, around 25,000 Frenchmen immigrated to Chile. 80% of them were coming from Southwestern France, especially from Basses-Pyrnes (Basque country and Barn), Gironde, Charente-Infrieure and Charente and regions situated between Gers and Dordogne.[101]\\r\\nMost of French immigrants settled in the country between 1875 and 1895. Between October 1882 and December 1897, 8,413 Frenchmen settled in Chile, making up 23% of immigrants (second only after Spaniards) from this period. In 1863, 1,650 French citizens were registered in Chile. At the end of the century they were almost 30,000.[102] According to the census of 1865, out of 23,220 foreigners established in Chile, 2,483 were French, the third largest European community in the country after Germans and Englishmen.[103] In 1875, the community reached 3,000 members,[104] 12% of the almost 25,000 foreigners established in the country. It was estimated that 10,000 Frenchmen were living in Chile in 1912, 7% of the 149,400 Frenchmen living in Latin America.[105]\\r\\nIn World War II, a group of over 10,000 Chileans of French descent, the majority have French relatives joined the Free French Forces and fought the Nazi occupation of France .[citation needed]\\r\\nToday it is estimated that 500,000 Chileans are of French descent.\\r\\nCurrent president of Chile, Michelle Bachelet is of French origin, as was dictator Augusto Pinochet. A large percentage of politicians, businessmen, professionals and entertainers in the country are of French ancestry.\\r\\nIt is estimated that there are 1 million to 2 million or more Brazilians of French descent today. This gives Brazil the second largest French community in South America.[6]\\r\\nFrom 1819 to 1940, 40,383 Frenchmen immigrated to Brazil. Most of them settled in the country between 1884 and 1925 (8,008 from 1819 to 1883, 25,727 from 1884 to 1925, 6,648 from 1926 to 1940). Another source estimates that around 100,000 French people immigrated to Brazil between 1850 and 1965.\\r\\nThe French community in Brazil numbered 592 in 1888 and 5,000 in 1915.[106] It was estimated that 14,000 Frenchmen were living in Brazil in 1912, 9% of the 149,400 Frenchmen living in Latin America, the second largest community after Argentina (100,000).[107]\\r\\nThe Brazilian Imperial Family originates from the Portuguese House of Braganza and the last emperor's heir and daughter, Isabella, married Prince Gaston d'Orleans, Comte d'Eu, a member of the House of Orlans, a cadet branch of the Bourbons, the French Royal Family.\\r\\nThe first French immigrants were politicians such as Nicolas Raoul and Isidore Saget, Henri Terralonge and officers Aluard, Courbal, Duplessis, Gibourdel and Goudot. Later, when the Central American Federation was divided in 7 countries, Some of them settled to Costa Rica, others to Nicaragua, although the majority still remained in Guatemala. The relationships start to 1827, politicians, scientists, painters, builders, singers and some families emigrated to Guatemala. Later in a Conservative government, annihilated nearly all the relations between France and Guatemala, and most of French immigrants went to Costa Rica, but these relationships were again return to the late of the nineteenth century.[108]\\r\\nElsewhere in the Americas, French settlement took place in the 16th to 20th centuries. They can be found in Haiti, Cuba (refugees from the Haitian Revolution) and Uruguay. The Betancourt political families who influenced Peru,[8] Colombia, Venezuela, Ecuador, Puerto Rico, Bolivia and Panama have some French ancestry.[109]\\r\\nLarge numbers of Huguenots are known to have settled in the United Kingdom (ab 50 000), Ireland, in Protestant areas of Germany (especially the city of Berlin) (ab 40 000), in the Netherlands (ab 50 000), in South Africa and in North America. Many people in these countries still bear French names.\\r\\nIn Asia, a proportion of people with mixed French and Vietnamese descent can be found in Vietnam. Including the number of persons of pure French descent. Many are descendants of French settlers who intermarried with local Vietnamese people. Approximately 5,000 in Vietnam are of pure French descent, however, this number is disputed.[110] A small proportion of people with mixed French and Khmer descent can be found in Cambodia. These people number approximately 16,000 in Cambodia, among this number, approximately 3,000 are of pure French descent.[111] An unknown number with mixed French and Lao ancestry can be found throughout Laos.[112] A few thousand French citizens of Indian, European or creole ethnic origins live in the former French possessions in India (mostly Pondicherry). In addition to these Countries, small minorities can be found elsewhere in Asia; the majority of these living as expatriates.[112]\\r\\nApart from Qubcois, Acadians, Cajuns, and Mtis, other populations with some French ancestry outside metropolitan France include the Caldoches of New Caledonia, Louisiana Creole people of the United States, the so-called Zoreilles and Petits-blancs of various Indian Ocean islands, as well as populations of the former French colonial empire in Africa.","input":"When did france first come to latin america?"},{"output":"Gisborne","context":"The word \\"city\\" began to take on two meanings in New Zealand after the local government reforms of 1989. Before the reforms, a borough council with more than 20,000 people could be proclaimed a city. The boundaries of councils tended to follow the edge of the built-up area, so there was little difference between the urban area and the local government area.\\r\\nIn 1989, the structure of the local government in New Zealand was significantly reorganised. The new district councils and city councils were nearly always much larger geographically, and they covered both urban land and the surrounding rural land. Many locations that once had had a \\"city council\\" are now governed by a \\"district council\\".\\r\\nThe word \\"city\\" is used in a general sense to describe the urban areas of New Zealand, independent of local body boundaries. This informal usage is jealously guarded. The district government of the town of Gisborne, for example, adamantly described itself as the first \\"city\\" in the world to see the new millennium. However, Gisborne is governed by a \\"district council\\", though its status as a city is not generally disputed in New Zealand. Similarly, there is no \\"city council\\" in Auckland, though its status as a city is not generally disputed due to its size.\\r\\nToday an urban area has to be at least 50,000 residents before it can be proclaimed as a city.[1]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe populations given in the table below are provisional New Zealand resident populations, June 2017,[2] and they refer to the entire urban area, unless otherwise stated.\\r\\nNotes:\\r\\nThe populations given are the latest (June 2017)[2] Statistics New Zealand estimated resident populations.\\r\\nMany cities were reorganised into districts by the Local Government Commission in 1989 under the Local Government Act 1974, for example Timaru. Other urban areas that are no longer cities, such as Rotorua and Whangarei, have higher populations than some present cities. The most recently proclaimed city is Tauranga, which became a city, for the second time, from 1 March 2004. Christchurch (1862 and 1868) and Invercargill (1930 and 1991) have also been declared cities more than once.\\r\\nUnder Section 27 of the Local Government Act 2002, a district may become a city by either a \\"reorganisation scheme\\" with the Local Government Commission, or under Section 27(1) it may apply for a change in status under Schedule 3, Clause 7. The new city must have \\"a population of not less than 50,000 persons\\", be \\"predominantly urban\\" and \\"a distinct entity and a major centre of activity within the region\\" (or regions) that it is encompassed by. Existing cities are grandfathered under Schedule 2, Part 2 of the Act. The only new city council so far under this section is the Tauranga City Council, from 1 March 2004.\\r\\nPreviously, under Section 37L of the Local Government Act 1974, new cities could only be formed from a \\"reorganisation scheme\\".

Although vehicles that incorporated the basic principles of the tank (armour, firepower, and all-terrain mobility) had been projected in the decade or so before the War, it was the alarmingly heavy casualties of the start of its trench warfare that stimulated development.[1][2] Research took place in both Great Britain and France, with Germany only belatedly following the Allies' lead.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn Great Britain, an initial vehicle, nicknamed Little Willie, was constructed at William Foster & Co., during August and September 1915.[3] The prototype of a new design that became the Mark I tank was demonstrated to the British Army on  February 2 1916. Although initially termed \\"Landships\\" by the Landship Committee, production vehicles were named \\"tanks\\", to preserve secrecy. The term was chosen when it became known that the factory workers at William Foster referred to the first prototype as \\"the tank\\" because of its resemblance to a steel water tank.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe French fielded their first tanks in April 1917 and ultimately produced far more tanks than all other combatants combined.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Germans, on the other hand, began development only in response to the appearance of Allied tanks on the battlefield. Whilst the Allies manufactured several thousand tanks during the War, Germany deployed only 20 of her own.[4]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe first tanks were mechanically unreliable. There were problems that caused considerable attrition rates during combat deployment and transit. The heavily shelled terrain was impassable to conventional vehicles, and only highly mobile tanks such as the Mark and FTs performed reasonably well. The Mark I's rhomboid shape, caterpillar tracks, and 26-foot (8?m) length meant that it could negotiate obstacles, especially wide trenches, that wheeled vehicles could not.\\r\\nAlong with the tank, the first self-propelled gun (the British Gun Carrier Mk I) and the first armoured personnel carrier (the British Mk IX) were also constructed in World War I.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe conceptual roots of the tank go back to ancient times, with siege engines which were able to provide protection for troops moving up against stone walls or other fortifications. With the coming of the Industrial Revolution and the demonstrable power of steam, James Cowan presented a proposal for a Steam Powered Land Ram in 1855, towards the end of the Crimean War. Looking like a helmet on 'footed' Boydell wheels, early forerunners of the Pedrail wheel, it was essentially an armoured steam tractor equipped with cannon and rotating scythes sprouting from the sides. Lord Palmerston is said to have dismissed it as 'barbaric'.\\r\\n\\r\\nFrom 1904 to 1909, David Roberts, the engineer and managing director of Hornsby & Sons of Grantham, built a series of tractors using his patented 'chain-track' which were put through their paces by the British Army, a (small) section of which wanted to evaluate artillery tractors. At one point in 1908,  Major William E. Donohue of the Mechanical Transport Committee remarked to Roberts that he should design a new machine with armour, capable of carrying its own gun. But, disheartened by years of ultimately fruitless tinkering for the Army, Roberts did not take up the idea. In later years he expressed regret at not having pursued it.[5]\\r\\n\\r\\nAn engineer in the Austro-Hungarian Army, Lieutenant Gunther Burstyn, inspired by Holt tractors, designed a tracked armoured vehicle in 1911 carrying a light gun in a rotating turret; equipped also with hinged 'arms', two in front and two at the rear, carrying wheels on the ends to assist with obstacles and trenches, it was a very forward-looking design, if rather small. The Austrian government said it would be interested in evaluating it if Burstyn could secure commercial backing to produce a prototype. Lacking the requisite contacts, he let it drop. An approach to the German government was similarly fruitless.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1912, a South Australian, Lancelot De Mole, submitted a proposal to the British War Office for a \\"chain-rail vehicle which could be easily steered and carry heavy loads over rough ground and trenches\\". De Mole made more proposals to the War Office in 1914 and 1916, with a culminating proposal in late 1917, accompanied by a huge one-eighth scale model, yet all fell on substantially deaf ears. De Mole's proposal already had the climbing face, so typical of the later World War I British tanks, but it is unknown whether there was some connection. Inquiries to the government of Australia, after the war, yielded polite responses that Mr. De Mole's ideas had unfortunately been too advanced for the time to be properly recognised at their just value. The Commission on Awards to Inventors in 1919, which adjudicated all the competing claims to the development of the tank, recognised the brilliance of De Mole's design, even considering that it was superior to the machines actually developed, but due to its narrow remit, could only make a payment of S987 to De Mole to cover his expenses. De Mole noted in 1919 that he was urged by friends before the war to approach the Germans with his design, but declined to do so for patriotic reasons. \\r\\nBefore World War I, motorized vehicles were still relatively uncommon, and their use on the battlefield was initially limited, especially of heavier vehicles. Armoured cars soon became more commonplace with most belligerents, especially in more open terrain. On August 23, 1914, the French Colonel Jean Baptiste Eugne Estienne, later a major proponent of tanks, declared: Messieurs, la victoire appartiendra dans cette guerre  celui des deux belligrants qui parviendra le premier  placer un canon de 75 sur une voiture capable de se mouvoir en tout terrain (\\"Gentlemen, the victory will belong, in this war, to the one of the two belligerents who will be the first to succeed in mounting a 75 mm gun on a vehicle capable of moving in all types of terrain\\").\\r\\n\\r\\nArmored cars did indeed prove useful in open land such as in deserts, but were not very good at crossing obstacles (e.g. trenches, barriers) or in more challenging terrain. The other issue was that it was very hard to add much protection or armament.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe main limitation was the wheels, which gave a high ground pressure for the vehicle's weight. This could be solved by adding more wheels, but unless they also were driven, the effect was to reduce traction on the powered wheels. Driving extra wheels meant more drive train weight, in turn requiring a larger and heavier engine to maintain performance. Even worse, none of this extra weight was put into an improvement of armor or armament carried, and the vehicles were still incapable of crossing very rough terrain.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe adoption of caterpillar tracks offered a new solution to the problem. The tracks spread the weight of the vehicles over a much greater area, which was all used for traction to move the vehicle. The limitation on armor and firepower was no longer ground pressure but the power and weight of the power-plant.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe remaining issue was how to utilise and configure a vehicle.  Major Ernest Dunlop Swinton RE, was the official British war correspondent serving in France in 1914. He recounts in his book Eyewitness how the idea of using caterpillar tracks to drive an armoured fighting vehicle came to him on October 19, 1914, while he was driving through northern France. In July 1914 he had received a letter from a friend, Hugh Marriott, a mining engineer, drawing his attention to a Holt caterpillar tractor that Marriott had seen in Belgium. Marriott thought it might be useful for transport over difficult ground, and Swinton had passed the information on to the appropriate departments. Now Swinton suggested the idea of an armoured tracked vehicle to the military authorities, by sending a proposal to Lieutenant-Colonel Maurice Hankey. Hankey in turn tried to interest Lord Kitchener in the idea; when this failed he sent a memorandum in December to the Committee of Imperial Defence, of which he was himself the secretary; Winston Churchill the First Lord of the Admiralty was one of the members of the committee. Hankey proposed to build a gigantic steel roller, pushed by tracked tractors, to shield the advancing infantry. Churchill in turn wrote a note on January 5 to the Prime Minister H. H. Asquith, in which he warned that the Germans might any moment introduce a comparable system. A worried Asquith now ordered Kitchener to form a committee, headed by General Scott-Moncrieff, to study the feasibility of Swinton's idea; however, after trials with a Holt 75 h.p. machine the committee concluded in February 1915 that the idea was impractical.\\r\\n\\r\\nWinston Churchill however decided that if the Army wouldn't take up the idea, the Navy should proceed independently, even if it were to exceed the limits of his authority. He created the Landships Committee in February 1915, initially to investigate designs for a massive troop transporter. As a truer picture of front-line conditions was developed the aims of the investigation changed. A requirement was formulated for an armoured vehicle capable of 4?mph (6?km/h), climbing a 5 feet (1.5 m) high parapet, crossing an 8 feet (2.4 m) wide gap, and armed with machine guns and a light artillery piece. A similar proposal was working its way through the Army GHQ in France, and in June the Landships Committee was made a joint service venture between the War Office and the Admiralty. The Naval involvement in Armoured Fighting Vehicle (AFV) design had originally come about through the Royal Naval Air Service Armoured Car Division, the only British unit fielding AFVs in 1914; surprisingly, until the end of the war most experimentation on heavy land vehicles was conducted by Royal Naval Air Service Squadron 20.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt first, protecting heavy gun tractors with armour appeared the most promising line of development. Alternative early 'big wheel' designs on the lines of the Russian tsar tank of 1915 were soon understood to be impractical. However, adapting the existing Holt Company caterpillar designs  the only robust tracked tractors available in 1915  into a fighting machine, as France and Germany did, was decided against. While armour and weapon systems were easy to acquire, other existing caterpillar and suspension units were too weak, existing engines were underpowered for the vehicles that the designers had in mind, and trench-crossing ability was poor because of the shortness of the wheelbase. The Killen-Strait tractor with three tracks was used for the first experiments in June but was much too small to be developed further. The large Pedrail monotrack vehicle was proposed in a number of different configurations, but non were adopted. Trials to couple two American Bullock tractors failed. There also were considerable differences of opinion between the several committee members. Col R.E.B. Crompton, a veteran military engineer and electrical pioneer, drafted numerous designs with Lucien Legros for armoured troop carrying vehicles and gun-armed vehicles, to have used either Bullock tracks or variants of the Pedrail. At the same time, Lt Robert Macfie, of the RNAS, and Albert Nesfield, an Ealing-based engineer, devised a number of armoured tracked vehicles, which incorporated an angled front 'climbing face' to the tracks. The two men fell out bitterly as their plans came to nought; Macfie in particular pursued a vendetta against the other members of the Landships Committee after the war.\\r\\n\\r\\nTo resolve the threatened dissipation of effort, it was ordered in late July that a contract was to be placed with William Foster & Co. Ltd, a company having done some prewar design work on heavy tractors and known to Churchill from an earlier experiment with a trench-crossing supply vehicle, to produce a proof-of-concept vehicle with two tracks, based on a lengthened Bullock tractor chassis. Construction work began three weeks later.\\r\\n\\r\\nFosters of Lincoln built the 14 ton \\"Little Willie\\", which first ran on 8 September. Powered by a 105?hp (78?kW) Daimler engine, the 10-foot-high (3.0?m) armoured box was initially fitted with a low Bullock caterpillar. A rotating top turret was planned with a 40?mm gun but abandoned due to weight problems, leaving the final vehicle unarmed and little more than a test-bed for the difficult track system. Difficulties with the commercial tracks supplied led to Tritton designing a completely new track system different from, and vastly more robust than, any other system then in use. The next design by Lieutenant Walter Gordon Wilson RNAS, a pre-war motor engineer, added a larger track frame to the hull of \\"Little Willie\\". In order to achieve the demanded gap clearance a rhomboidal shape was chosenstretching the form to improve the track footprint and climbing capacity. To keep a low centre of gravity the rotating turret design was dropped in favour of sponsons on the sides of the hull fitted with naval 6-pounder (57?mm) guns. A final specification was agreed on in late September for trials in early 1916, and the resulting 30 ton \\"Big Willie\\" (later called \\"Mother\\") together with \\"Little Willie\\" underwent trials at Hatfield Park on 29 January and 2 February. Attendees at the second trial included Lord Kitchener, Lloyd George, Reginald McKenna and other political luminaries. On 12 February an initial order for 100 \\"Mother\\" type vehicles was made, later expanded to 150.\\r\\n\\r\\nCrews never called tanks \\"Willies\\"; at first they referred to them as \\"landships\\", and later informally \\"buses\\".[6] Although landship was a natural term coming from an Admiralty committee, it was considered too descriptive and could give away British intentions. The committee therefore looked for an appropriate code term for the vehicles. Factory workers assembling the vehicles had been told they were producing \\"mobile water tanks\\" for desert warfare in Mesopotamia. Water Container was therefore considered but rejected because the committee would inevitably be known as the WC Committee (WC meaning water closet was a common British term for a toilet). The term tank, as in water tank, was in December 1915 finally accepted as its official designation. From then on, the term \\"tank\\" was established among British and also German soldiers. While in German Tank specifically refers to the World War I type (as opposed to modern Panzer), in English, Russian and other languages the name even for contemporary armoured vehicles is still based on the word tank.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt is sometimes mistakenly stated that, after completion, the tanks were shipped to France in large wooden crates. For secrecy and in order to not arouse any curiosity, the crates and the tanks themselves were then each labelled with a destination in Russian, \\"With Care to Petrograd\\". In fact the tanks were never shipped in crates: the inscription in Russian was applied on the hull for their transport from the factory to the first training centre at Thetford.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe first fifty had been delivered to France on 30 August. They were 'male' or 'female', depending upon whether their armament comprised two 6-pounder cannon and three Hotchkiss machine guns or four Vickers machine guns and one Hotchkiss. It had a crew of eight, four of whom were needed to handle the steering and drive gears. The tanks were capable of, at best, 6?km/h (4?mph), matching the speed of marching infantry with whom they were to be integrated to aid in the destruction of enemy machine guns. In practice, their speed on broken ground could be as little as 1?mph.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter the war the Royal Commission on Awards to Inventors decided that the principal inventors of the Tank were Sir William Tritton, managing director of Fosters, and Major Walter Gordon Wilson.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe first use of tanks on the battlefield was the use of British Mark I tanks at the Battle of Flers-Courcelette (part of the Battle of the Somme) on 15 September 1916, with mixed results; many broke down, but nearly a third succeeded in breaking through. Of the forty-nine tanks shipped to the Somme, only thirty-two were able to begin the first attack in which they were used and only nine made it across \\"no man's land\\" to the German lines. The tanks had been rushed into combat before the design was mature enough (against Churchill's and Ernest Swinton's wishes)[7] and the number was small but their use gave important feedback on how to design newer tanks, the soundness of the concept, and their potential to affect the course of the war. On the other hand, the French Army was critical of the British employment of small numbers of tanks at this battle. They felt the British had sacrificed the secrecy of the weapon while employing it in numbers too small to be decisive. Considering that the British attack was part of an Anglo-French offensive while the Russians were also attacking at the same time, Haig felt justified in making a maximum effort, regardless of the limitations of the tank force.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Mark Is were capable of performing on the real battlefield of World War I, one of the most difficult battlefield terrains ever. They did have reliability problems, but when they were working they could cross trenches or craters of 9 feet (2.7 m) and drive right through barbed wire. It was still common for them to get stuck, especially in larger bomb craters, but overall the rhomboid shape allowed for extreme terrain mobility.\\r\\n\\r\\nTank crews who had read press reports depicting the new weapon driving through buildings and trees, and crossing wide rivers, were disappointed.[6] Most World War I tanks could travel only at about a walking pace at best. Their steel armour could stop small arms fire and fragments from high-explosive artillery shells. However they were vulnerable to a direct hit from artillery and mortar shells. The environment inside was extremely unpleasant; as ventilation was inadequate the atmosphere was heavy with poisonous carbon monoxide from the engine and firing the weapons, fuel and oil vapours from the engine and cordite fumes from the weapons. Temperatures inside could reach 50C (122F). Entire crews lost consciousness inside the tanks, or collapsed when again exposed to fresh air.[8] Crews learned how to create and leave behind supply dumps of fuel, motor oil, and tread grease, and converted obsolete models into supply vehicles for newer ones.[6]\\r\\n\\r\\nTo counter the danger of bullet splash or fragments knocked off the inside of the hull, the crew wore helmets with goggles and chainmail masks. Fragments were not as dangerous as fire, because of explosive fumes and the large amount of fuel aboard; smoking was prohibited inside and within 20 yards outside tanks.[6] Gas masks were also standard issue, as they were to all soldiers at this point in the war due to the use of chemical warfare. The side armour of 8?mm initially made them largely immune to small arms fire, but could be penetrated by the recently developed armour-piercing K bullets. There was also the danger of being overrun by infantry and attacked with grenades. The next generation had thicker armour, making them nearly immune to the K bullets. In response, the Germans developed a larger purpose-made anti-tank rifle, the 3.7 cm TAK 1918 anti-tank gun, and also a Geballte Ladung (\\"Bunched Charge\\")several regular stick grenades bundled together for a much bigger explosion.\\r\\n\\r\\nEngine power was a primary limitation on the tanks; the roughly one hundred horsepower engines gave a power-to-weight ratio of 3.3?hp/ton (2.5?kW/ton). By the end of the 20th century, power-to-weight ratios exceeded 20?hp/ton (15?kW/ton).\\r\\n\\r\\nMany feel that because the British Commander Field Marshal Douglas Haig was himself a horse cavalryman, his command failed to appreciate the value of tanks. In fact, horse cavalry doctrine in World War I was to \\"follow up a breakthrough with harassing attacks in the rear\\", but there were no breakthroughs on the Western Front until the tanks came along. Despite these supposed views of Haig, he made an order for 1,000 tanks shortly after the failure at the Somme and always remained firmly in favour of further production.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1919, Major General Sir Louis Jackson said: \\"The tank was a freak. The circumstances which called it into existence were exceptional and not likely to recur. If they do, they can be dealt with by other means.\\"[9]\\r\\n\\r\\nFrance at the same time developed its own tracked AFVs, but the situation there was very different. In Britain a single committee had coordinated design, and had to overcome the initial resistance of the Army, while the major industries remained passive. Almost all production effort was thus concentrated into the Mark I and its direct successors, all very similar in shape. In France, on the other hand, there were multiple and conflicting lines of development which were badly integrated, resulting in three major and quite disparate production types. A major arms producer, Schneider, took the lead in January 1915 and tried to build a first armoured vehicle based on the Baby Holt tractor but initially the development process was slow until in July they received political, even presidential, support by combining their project with that of a mechanical wire cutter devised by engineer and politician Jean-Louis Brton. In December 1915, the influential Colonel Estienne made the Supreme Command very enthusiastic about the idea of creating an armoured force based on these vehicles; strong Army support for tanks was a constant during the decades that followed. Already in January and February 1916 quite substantial orders were made, at that moment with a total number of 800 much larger than the British ones.\\r\\n\\r\\nArmy enthusiasm and haste had its immediate drawbacks however. As a result of the involvement of inexperienced army officers ordered to devise a new tank based on the larger 75?hp Holt chassis in a very short period of time, the first French tanks were poorly designed with respect to the need to cross trenches and did not take the sponson-mounting route of the British tanks. The first, the Char Schneider CA equipped with a short 75?mm howitzer, had poor mobility due to a short track length combined with a hull that overhung front and rear. It was unreliable as well; a maximum of only about 130 of the 400 built were ever operational at the same time. Then industrial rivalry began to play a detrimental role: it created the heavy Char St Chamond, a parallel development not ordered by the Army but approved by government through industrial lobby, which mounted much more impressive weaponry  its 75?mm was the most powerful gun fielded by any operational tank up till 1941  but also combined many of the Schneider CA's faults with an even larger overhanging body. Its innovative petro-electrical transmission, while allowing for easy steering, was insufficiently developed and led to a large number of breakdowns.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut industrial initiative also led to swift advances. The car industry, already used to vehicle mass production and having much more experience in vehicle layout, in 1916 designed the first practical light tanks, a class largely neglected by the British. It was Renault's excellent small tank design, the FT, incorporating a proper climbing face for the tracks, that was the first tank to incorporate a top-mounted turret with a full 360 traverse capability. In fact the FT was in many respects the first truly 'modern' tank having a layout that has been followed by almost all designs ever since: driver at the front; main armament in a fully rotating turret on top; engine at the rear. Previous models had been \\"box tanks\\", with a single crowded space combining the role of engine room, fighting compartment, ammunition stock and driver's cabin. (A very similar Peugeot prototype, with a fixed casemate mounting a short 75mm cannon, was trialled in 1918 but the idea was not pursued). The FT had the largest production run of any tank of the war, with over 3700 built, more numerous than all British tanks combined. That this would happen was at first far from certain; some in the French army lobbied for the alternative mass production of super-heavy tanks. Much design effort was put in this line of development resulting in the gigantic Char 2C, the most complex and technologically advanced tank of its day. Its very complexity ensured it being produced too late to participate in World War I and in the very small number of just ten, but it was the first tank with a three-man turret; the heaviest to enter service until late in World War II and still the largest ever operational.\\r\\n\\r\\nFrench production at first lagged behind the British. After August 1916 however, British tank manufacture was temporarily halted to wait for better designs, allowing the French to overtake their allies in numbers. When the French used tanks for the first time on 16 April 1917, during the Nivelle Offensive, they had four times more tanks available. But that did not last long as the offensive was a major failure; the Schneiders were badly deployed and suffered 50% losses from German long-range artillery. The Saint-Chamond tanks, first deployed on 5 May, proved to be so badly designed that they were unable to cross the first line of German trenches.\\r\\n\\r\\nGermany concentrated more on the development of anti-tank weapons than on development of tanks themselves. They only developed one type of tank which saw combat in the war. The A7V Sturmpanzerwagen was designed in 1917 and was used in battle from March 1918. It was manned by a crew of 18, and had eight machine guns and a 57mm cannon. Only 20 A7Vs were produced during the war.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe first battle in which tanks made a great impact was the Battle of Cambrai in 1917. British Colonel J.F.C. Fuller, chief of staff of the Tank Corps, was responsible for the tanks' role in the battle. They made an unprecedented breakthrough but, as ever on the Western front, the opportunity was not exploited. Ironically, it was the soon-to-be-supplanted horse cavalry that had been assigned the task of following up the motorised tank attack.[10]\\r\\n\\r\\nTanks became more effective as the lesson of the early tanks was absorbed. The British produced the Mark IV in 1917. Similar to the early Marks in appearance, its construction was considered to produce a more reliable machine, the long-barrelled naval guns were shortened (the barrels of the earlier, longer guns were prone to digging in the mud when negotiating obstacles) and armour was increased just enough to defeat the standard German armour-piercing bullet.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe continued need for four men to drive the tank was solved with the Mark V which used Wilson's epicyclic gearing in 1918. Also in 1918 the French produced the Renault FT, the result of a co-operation between Estienne and Louis Renault. As mentioned before, it had the innovative turret position, and was operated by two men. At just 8 tons it was half the weight of the Medium A Whippet but the version with the cannon had more firepower. It was conceived for mass production, and the FT became the most produced tank of World War I by a wide margin, with over 3,000 delivered to the French Army.  Large numbers were used by the Americans and several were also lent to the British.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn July 1918, the French used 480 tanks (mostly FTs) at the Battle of Soissons, and there were even larger assaults planned for the next year. In Plan 1919, the Entente hoped to commit over 30,000 tanks to battle in that year.\\r\\n\\r\\nFinally, in a preview of later developments, the British developed the Whippet. This tank was specifically designed to exploit breaches in the enemy front with its relatively higher speed (around 8mph vs 3-4mph for the British heavy tanks). The Whippet was faster than most other tanks, although it carried only machine gun armament, meaning it was not suited to combat with armoured vehicles but instead with infantry. Postwar tank designs reflected this trend towards greater tactical mobility.[citation needed]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe German General Staff did not have enthusiasm for the tanks, but allowed the development of anti-tank weapons. Regardless, development of a German tank was under way. The only project to be produced and fielded was the A7V, although only twenty were built. The majority of the fifty or so tanks fielded by Germany were captured British vehicles. A7Vs were captured by the Allies, but they were not used, and most ended up being scrapped.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe first tank-versus-tank battles took place 24 April 1918. It was an unexpected engagement between three German A7Vs and three British Mk. IVs at Villers-Bretonneux.\\r\\n\\r\\nFuller's Plan 1919, involving massive use of tanks for an offensive, was never used because the blockade of Germany and the entry of the US brought an end to the war.\\r\\n\\r\\nTucker, Spencer C.

Located in Southeast Texas on the Neches River about 90?mi (140?km) east of Houston, Beaumont city had a population of 118,296 at the time of the 2010 census, making it the twenty-fourth-most populous city in the state of Texas.\\r\\nBeaumont was founded as a town in 1835 by Northerners. The early European-American settlement had an economy based on the development of lumber, farming, and port industries. In 1892, Joseph Eloi Broussard opened the first commercially successful rice mill in the state, stimulating development of rice farming in the area; he also started an irrigation company (since 1933 established as the Lower Neches Valley Authority) to support rice culture. Rice became an important commodity crop in Texas, and is now cultivated in 23 counties.[5]\\r\\nA big change occurred in 1901 with the Spindletop gusher, which demonstrated the potential of the huge oil field. With Spindletop, several energy companies developed in Beaumont, and some continue. The area rapidly developed as one of the major petro-chemical refining areas in the country. Along with Port Arthur and Orange, Beaumont forms the Golden Triangle, a major industrial area on the Texas Gulf Coast.\\r\\nBeaumont is home of Lamar University, a national Carnegie Doctoral Research university with 14,966 students, including undergraduates and post graduates. Over the years, several corporations have been based in this city, including Gulf States Utilities which had its headquarters in Beaumont until its takeover by Entergy Corporation in 1993. GSU's Edison Plaza headquarters is still the tallest building in Beaumont (as of 2017).\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1824 Noah and Nancy Tevis settled on the west bank of the Neches River and developed a farm. Soon after that, a small community grew up around the farm, which was named Tevis Bluff or Neches River Settlement.[6] In 1835 the land of Tevis, together with the nearby community of Santa Anna (in total, 50 acres (20?ha)), was purchased by Northerners Henry Millard (1796?ÿ1844) of New York,[7] Joseph Pulsifer (1805ÿ1861) of Massachusetts,[8] and Thomas Byers Huling (1804ÿ1865) of Pennsylvania .[9] They began planning a town to be laid out on this land.[6] Their partnership, J.P. Pulsifer and Company, controlled the first 50 acres (200,000?m2) upon which the town was founded.[8] This town was named Beaumont, after Jefferson Beaumont, the brother-in-law of Henry Millard. They added more property for a total of 200 acres.\\r\\nBeaumont became a town on 16 December 1838. Beaumont's first mayor was Alexander Calder.[10] From the town's founding in 1835, business activities included real estate, transportation, and retail sales. Later, other businesses were formed, especially in railroad construction and operation, new building construction, lumber sales, and communications. The Port of Beaumont became a successful regional shipping center. Beaumont was a small center for cattle raisers and farmers in its early years. With an active riverport by the 1880s, it became an important lumber and rice-milling town. It exported rice as a commodity crop.\\r\\nThe Beaumont Rice Mill, founded in 1892 by Joseph Eloi Broussard, was the first commercially successful rice mill in Texas.[5] In addition, Broussard founded a company to operate an irrigation system to support rice culture. (It became a public institution, the Lower Neches Irrigation Authority.) This helped stimulate the expansion of rice cultivation from 1500 acres in 1892 to 400,000 acres in 23 counties by his death in 1956.[5] Beaumont's lumber boom, which reached its peak in the late 19th century, was stimulated by the rebuilding and expansion of the railroads in the state and region after the Civil War.\\r\\nThe rise of Beaumont's mill economy drew many new residents to the city, many of them immigrants. The first Jewish man in the city was from Louisiana, others migrated from the South, and were joined by immigrants. They worked as merchants and in a variety of jobs in the growing city and ranching area. In 1895 Jews formed their first congregation.[11] By the early 20th century, the city was served by the Southern Pacific; Kansas City Southern, Atchison, Topeka, and Santa Fe; and Missouri Pacific railroad systems.[12]\\r\\nOil was discovered at nearby Spindletop on 10 January 1901. Spindletop became the first major oil field and one of the largest in American history. With the discovery of oil at Spindletop, Beaumont's population more than tripled in two months from 9,000 in January 1901 to 30,000 in March 1901. Oil is, and has always been, a major export of the city, and a major contributor to the national GDP.\\r\\nWilliam Casper Tyrrell, nicknamed \\"Captain W.C.\\", was a leading businessman and oil tycoon in the city in the early 20th century, developing businesses during the Texas Oil Boom. An entrepreneur from Pennsylvania and Iowa, he arrived after the gusher at Spindletop, and invested in development of a commercial port in the city, and an irrigation system to support the local rice industry, as well as residential and retail development of suburban property. He was also a philanthropist. He purchased and donated First Baptist Church, whose congregation had moved to a new facility, to use as the city's first public library, now known as the Tyrrell Historical Library.[13]\\r\\nWhen the city became a major center for defense shipbuilding during World War II, tens of thousands of rural Texans migrated there for the new high-paying jobs. The Roosevelt administration ordered the defense industry to be integrated, and many Southern whites were working closely with blacks for the first time. Housing was scarce in the crowded city, and racial tensions increased. In June 1943 after workers at the Pennsylvania shipyard in Beaumont learned that a white woman had accused a black man of raping her, nearly 2,000 went to the jail where a suspect was being held, attracting more men along the way and reaching a total of 4,000.[14] Ultimately the white mob rioted for three days, destroying major black neighborhoods and killing five persons. No one was prosecuted for the deaths. The riot in Beaumont was one of several in 1943 which centered in the defense industry, including Los Angeles,[15] Detroit,[16] Chicago[17] and Mobile, Alabama[18] as well as other cities across the country. The wartime social disruption was similar to war time riots which had occurred in other parts of the country during and following World War I.\\r\\nIn the postwar years, Beaumont's port continued in importance. Although Beaumont's city center is located 85 highway miles from the Houston city center and 60 air miles from city limit boundary to city limit boundary, the city is now considered part of the widespread Houston metropolitan area. As was typical with other cities, post-war highway construction led to the development of new suburbs and dispersal of the population in search of new housing. There has been some renewal in Beaumont downtown and people have rediscovered the river.\\r\\nIn 1996, the Jefferson County courts, located in Beaumont, became the first court in the nation to implement electronic filing and service of court documents, eliminating the need for law firms to print and mail reams of documents.\\r\\nIn 2005 and 2008, Beaumont and surrounding areas suffered extensive damage from Hurricane Rita and Hurricane Ike. A mandatory evacuation was ordered for residents, lasting about two weeks.\\r\\nIn August 2017, Beaumont and surrounding areas suffered extensive flooding as a result of Hurricane Harvey. As a result of this flooding, Memorial Herman Baptist Hospital evacuated all its highest level of acuity patients with the help of National Guard helicopters.\\r\\nAccording to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of 85.9 square miles (222?km2), of which 85.0 square miles (220?km2) is land and 0.9 square miles (2.3?km2) (1.07%) is water.\\r\\nBeaumont lies on Texas' coastal plain, about 30 miles (48?km) inland from the Gulf of Mexico, one hour drive east of Houston, and just south of the dense pine forests of East Texas. The city is bordered on the east by the Neches River and to the north by Pine Island Bayou. Before being settled, the area was crisscrossed by numerous small streams. Most of these streams have since been filled in or converted for drainage purposes. The island directly across from Riverfront Park is called Trinity Island. There are also three other islands in the Neches River around the downtown area/port: Harbor, Smith and Clark.\\r\\nThe city of Beaumont, Texas is within the humid subtropical climate zone.[19] This city is located within the Piney Woods, which cover the eastern region of Texas, as well as adjacent Louisiana.[20] This region of Texas receives the most rainfall in the state, with more than 48 inches (1,200?mm) annually. This is due to the warm gulf waters that carry humid air to the region, where it condenses and precipitates. The humidity of the region greatly amplifies the feeling of heat during the summer.\\r\\nHurricanes such as the Galveston Hurricane of 1900, and Hurricane Ike in 2008, also strike the region. Hurricane Ike was the largest and most damaging hurricane to hit Beaumont to date, striking 13 September 2008. Causing $32 billion in damage, it is the third-costliest hurricane in United States history.[21] On 18 August 2009, a tornado hit the west end of Beaumont, and caused damage to several local businesses and cars. Injuries were minimal.[22]\\r\\nThe winters are moderated by warm gulf currents. Wintry precipitation is unusual, but does occur. A recent snow event was 24 December 2004, the first such since 1989. However, more recently, Beaumont and the surrounding areas received a light snow on 11 December 2008, with up to 4 inches (100?mm) in the west end. Beaumont and the surrounding areas received a trace to half an inch of light snow on 4 December 2009. These are the earliest measurable snowfalls at the airport since the late 19th century. Although in unofficial records, Beaumont received as much as 30 inches (760?mm) of snow on 14 February and 15 during the blizzard of 1895 that impacted the gulf coast with unusual cold weather. Unofficially the temperature reported a drop to a low of 4?F (?16?C) after the storm. The area suffered a severe ice storm in January 1997.\\r\\nThe Beaumont-Port Arthur region has historically been cited as one of the most polluted urban areas in the United States due to various energy industries and chemical plants in the area. Even so, as of July, 2014, the Beaumont-Port Arthur region was not under any Environmental Protection Agency non-attainment restrictions; however, counties in the Greater Houston area, the DallasÿFort Worth metroplex, and El Paso were.[23] As of October, 2014, the Beaumont-Port Arthur area was not under any Texas Commission on Environmental Quality attainment compliance deadlines.[24] Regardless, according to an article published in 2007 focusing on Beaumont's neighbor to the south, Port Arthur, pollution was believed to have caused some general area residents to become sick and has generated debates throughout the media.[25]\\r\\nTropical storm Harvey caused significant damage to the area in 2017, dumping 47.47\\" of rain. This means 2017 is already the wettest year on record for the city with 89.59\\" and August 2017 is already the wettest calendar month on record with 54.73\\" of rain.[26]\\r\\nAs of the census[2] of 2010, there were 118,296 people, 45,648 households, and 28,859 families residing in the city. The population density was 1,339.4 people per square mile (517.2/km2). There were 48,815 housing units at an average density of 574.2 per square mile (221.7/km2). The racial makeup of the city was 33.5% non-Hispanic White, 47.3% African American, 0.0% Native American, 3.3% Asian, 0.0% Pacific Islander, 7.1% from other races, and 2.0% from two or more races. Hispanic or Latino of any race were 13.4% of the population.\\r\\nThere were 45,648 households out of which 28.9% had children under the age of 18 living with them, 38.7% were married couples living together, 19.2% had a female householder with no husband present, and 36.8% were non-families. 30.7% of all households were made up of individuals and 10.0% had someone living alone who was 65 years of age or older. The average household size was 2.48 and the average family size was 3.12.\\r\\nIn the city, the population was spread out with 28.3% the age of 19 or under, 8.5% from 20 to 24, 25.8% from 25 to 44, 25.2% from 45 to 64, and 10.5% who were 65 years of age or older. The median age was 34.4 years. For every 100 females there were 95 males. For every 100 females age 18 and over, there were 92.7 males.\\r\\nThe median income for a household in the city was $39,699, according to the American Community Survey (5 year), and the median income for a family was $49,766. The per capita income for the city was $23,137. About 17.6% of families and 22.1% of the population were below the poverty line.\\r\\nAccording to the City's 2014 Comprehensive Annual Financial Report[31] the top employers in the city are:\\r\\nA significant element of the region's economy is the Port of Beaumont, the nation's fourth-largest seaport by tonnage. The 842d Transportation Battalion, and the 596th Transportation Group are both stationed at the port in Beaumont.\\r\\nIn addition to companies doing business within the city limits, several large industrial facilities are located within the city's five-mile extraterritorial jurisdiction boundaries including the ExxonMobil Beaumont refinery and chemical plants, Goodyear Beaumont chemical plant, and DuPont chemical plant.\\r\\nJason's Deli has its headquarters in Beaumont.[32] Conn's Appliances did have its headquarters in Beaumont; however, in mid-2012, Conn's moved its corporate headquarters to The Woodlands.[33] Originally Sweet Leaf Tea Company had its headquarters in Beaumont.[34] The headquarters moved to Austin in October 2003.[35]\\r\\nDowntown Beaumont is the center of Business, Government and night time entertainment in southeast Texas. Downtown features the Crockett Street Entertainment Complex with entertainment options from dancing, to live music to dining or a bar. In addition to the night time entertainment downtown also features a museum district with five distinct museums.\\r\\nOther entertainment and recreation venues located downtown include the following.\\r\\nThe sports teams of Lamar University compete in Division I NCAA athletics as the Lamar Cardinals. The athletics program is a full member of the Southland Conference. The Cardinals and Lady Cardinals compete in 17 varsity sports. The Cardinals Basketball team plays in the Montagne Center and Cardinals Baseball Team plays in Vincent-Beck Stadium.\\r\\nThe university brought back football in 2010. As part of the return, Provost Umphrey Stadium was completely renovated. The return was official when the Cardinals Football team played its first game in 21 years in the fall of 2010. The team currently competes in the Southland Conference as a member of the NCAA Division I Football Championship Subdivision (formerly Division I-AA).\\r\\nAccording to the city's 2015 Comprehensive Annual Financial Report, the city's various funds had $219.0 million in revenues, $202.8 million in expenditures, $900.1 million in total assets, $586.8 million in total liabilities, and $202.2 million in cash and investments.[59]\\r\\nBeaumont is a council-manager form of government. Elections are held annually, with the Mayor and Council members each serving two-year terms. All powers of the City are vested in the Council, which enacts local legislation, adopts budgets, and determines policies. Council is also responsible for appointing the City Attorney, the City Clerk and Magistrates, and the City Manager. The city council is composed of two council members elected at-large, and four council members each elected from single-member districts, the four Wards of the city.[60]\\r\\nCouncil Districts\\r\\nThe Texas Department of Transportation operates the Beaumont District Office in Beaumont.[69]\\r\\nThe Texas Ninth Court of Appeals is located in the Jefferson County Courthouse in Beaumont.[70] The Texas Department of Criminal Justice (TDCJ) operates the Beaumont District Parole Office in Beaumont.[71] The Texas Department of Corrections operates three facilities of various custody types in unincorporated areas of Jefferson County, with a total capacity of about 7500 inmates.\\r\\nThe Federal Bureau of Prisons operates the Beaumont Federal Correctional Complex in an unincorporated area in Jefferson County, near Beaumont.[72]\\r\\nBeaumont has one state university, Lamar University, which belongs to The Texas State University System. Lamar University was established in 1923 as South Park Junior College. The university is currently classified as a national university. It is also classified as a Doctoral Research University by the Carnegie Foundation.[73] With over 100 degrees offered, the university's main academic offerings are in Business, Nursing, Teaching and Engineering. Lamar University's enrollment has grown tremendously in the first decade of the 21st century.[74] This has prompted a building boom at the campus. The school's enrollment as of Fall, 2015 was above 14,966 students.[75]\\r\\nLamar Institute of Technology, located directly adjacent to Lamar University, serves as the region's technical college for two-year degrees and certificates. Originally a part of Lamar University and its predecessors since 1923, Lamar Institute of Technology was chartered in 1949 when the Lamar College Bill was passed. The bill was sponsored in the Texas Legislature by State Representative Jack Brooks and Senator W.R. Cousins, Jr. of Beaumont. Lamar Institute of Technology became a separate entity in 1995.[76][77] As of Fall, 2014, enrollment totaled 2,920 students.\\r\\nBeaumont is served by the Beaumont Independent School District.\\r\\nHigh Schools\\r\\nHarmony Science Academy of Beaumont, public charter school.

Built in 1921, it sports one of the largest four faced clock towers in the nation, each dial being 17 feet (5.2?m) in diameter.[130] In 1922 the 11-story Hotel Beaumont was built across the street from the San Jacinto. The Hotel Beaumont bears a resemblance to the old Winecoff Hotel in Atlanta. The second oil boom of 1925 brought more people and wealth to Beaumont, the same year the 12-story American National Bank Building (now Orleans Building), was erected, and in 1926 Forrest Goodhue built the 12-story Goodhue Building which included a penthouse. In 1928, the Edson Hotel was built. No other buildings were built until Century Tower in 1962 and in 1982 Edison Plaza was built. In 1994 the 12-story LaSalle Hotel, built in 1927, was demolished.\\r\\nThe Jefferson Theatre was built in 1927 by the Jefferson Amusement Company for $1 million and was Beaumont's showpiece for many years.

It was released as IBM Machine Type number 5160 on March 8, 1983. Apart from the hard drive, it was essentially the same as the original PC, with only minor improvements. The XT was mainly intended as an enhanced IBM PC for business users. Later floppy-only models would effectively replace the original model 5150 PC. A corresponding 3270 PC featuring 3270 terminal emulation was released later in October 1983. XT stands for eXtended Technology.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe IBM Personal Computer XT originally came with 128?KB of RAM, a 360?KB double-sided 5? inch floppy disk drive, a 10?MB Seagate ST-412 hard drive with Xebec 1210 Modified Frequency Modulation (MFM) controller, an Asynchronous Adapter (serial card with 8250 UART), and a 130-watt power supply.[1] The motherboard had an Intel 8088 microprocessor running at 4.77?MHz, with a socket for an optional 8087 math coprocessor.\\r\\nIBM recognized soon after the IBM PC's release in 1981 that its five 8-bit \\"I/O channel\\" expansion slots (later named Industry Standard Architecture (ISA) by IBM's competitors) were insufficient. An internal IBM publication stated in October 1981 about the number that \\"In my opinion, it could be a problem\\", reporting that others within IBM advised swapping cards if necessary.[2] Virtually every PC required at least a display adapter card and a floppy disk controller card, leaving only three slots available for a parallel printer port card (if the Color Graphics Adapter was used), a serial port card, memory expansion boards, a 3rd-party hard disk controller card, a second display adapter card, or possible other special adapter cards.\\r\\nWhen IBM announced a successor product to the PC in early 1983, initial speculations were that it would be a next-generation machine possibly based on the Intel 80186 or include other advanced features. When the XT was actually unveiled however, there was mild disappointment that the new machine was merely an incremental improvement of the PC based on the same 8088 CPU and would in fact not replace it at all. A BYTE Magazine article commented that \\"DOS 2.0 is more revolutionary and advanced than the computer itself.\\"\\r\\nA Seagate ST-412 hard disk was standard equipment, and the XT was not offered in a floppy-only model for its first two years on the market, although the standard ribbon cable with two floppy connectors was still included. The only way to purchase an XT with factory-installed dual floppy drives was if the user also bought the optional 5161 expansion chassis and placed the hard disk in that, which in effect amounted to purchasing two hard disks as the 5161 also came with one standard. Unlike many hard disk systems on microcomputers at the time, the XT was able to boot directly off the drive and did not require a boot floppy. Aside from the hard disk, a serial port card was also standard equipment on the XT, all other cards being optional.\\r\\nBy the end of 1983, the XT was neck-and-neck with the original PC for sales and IBM were selling every one that they made.\\r\\nThe XT had eight slots. Two were behind the floppy drive, and shorter than the original PC's slots. The other six fit into the same space as the original PC's five slots. Most PC cards would not fit into the two short slots, and some would not fit into the six standard-length, but narrower, slots, particularly cards with double boards on them.[3] The floppy and hard drive adapters, the serial port card, and nearly always a display adapter board occupied slots. The basic specification was soon upgraded to have 256?KB of RAM as standard. Expansion slots could be used for I/O devices or for memory expansion. Available Video cards were initially the Monochrome Display Adapter (MDA) and Color Graphics Adapter (CGA) (the same two cards that were available for the type 5150 PC), with Enhanced Graphics Adapter (EGA) and Professional Graphics Controller (PGC) becoming available in 1984.\\r\\nThe XT had a desktop case similar to that of the IBM PC. It weighed 32 pounds and was approximately 19.5?inches wide by 16?inches deep by 5.5?inches high. The power supply of the original XT sold in the US was configured for 120 V AC only and could not be used with 240 V mains supplies.[1] XTs with 240V-compatible power supplies were later sold in international markets. Both were rated at 130 Watts.[4]\\r\\nThe operating system usually sold with the XT was PC DOS 2.0 or, by the time the XT was discontinued in early 1987, DOS 3.2. Like the original PC, the XT came with IBM BASIC in its ROM. Despite the lack of a cassette port on XTs, IBM's licensing agreement with Microsoft forced them to include BASIC on all their PCs, and the BASICA program that was included with DOS depended on the BASIC ROM. The XT BIOS also displayed a memory count during the POST, unlike the PC.\\r\\nThe XT was discontinued in the spring of 1987, replaced by the PS/2 Model 30.\\r\\nXT motherboards came in two different versions. The original (1983ÿ85) had 64?KB of 4164 RAM (64kx1 chips) socketed on it with further sockets to support up to 256?KB and any more RAM had to be put on an expansion card, of which the AST Research Six Pak was the most widespread and popular. XTs produced in 1983-84 shipped from the factory with 128?KB and in 1985, 256k. The second version (1986ÿ87) had 256?KB socketed on it and could accommodate the entire 640?KB.[1] Later XTs used 4164 DRAMs only for the first 256k and the remainder of system memory consisted of larger 41256 DRAMs (256kx1). As a result, it took only 44 RAM chips to reach 640k versus the 80 chips needed on the original model XT.\\r\\nThere were also two or three revisions of the motherboard with minor differences between them. The first version (Model 084) incorporates a 470 ohm resistor to fix a race condition between the CPU and DMA controller which created the possibility of the system locking up.[5] In the spring of 1984, a revised motherboard (Model 083) was introduced which rearranged some components and also incorporated a better solution to the DMA race condition by utilizing a 74LS44 gate (most XT clones instead used a group of 74LS04 gates), however most of the remaining Model 084 motherboards were modified for this before the revised Model 083 appeared. The motherboard revision and that Model 086 came with the full 256?KB RAM (instead of only 128?KB RAM) from the factory were the only differences between the two first models. Unlike the IBM PC motherboard, the XT lacked the trimmer capacitor used to adjust the NTSC color burst for CGA video cards or the second set of DIP switches used to configure memory size. Slot 8 (the one closest to the power supply) was wired slightly differently for cards used to connect IBM 3270 terminals. As a result, some ISA cards will not work in Slot 8 and others included a DIP switch to accommodate it. This feature is unique to the XT and IBM Portable PC and not found on the IBM PC, AT, or any clones.\\r\\nBeginning in 1985, the XT was offered in floppy-only models without a hard drive (Model 068 and 078) and the new Enhanced Graphics Adapter and Professional Graphics Adapter became available as video card options[1] In 1986, the 256ÿ640KB motherboard models were launched, which switched to half-height drives and 101-key keyboards (essentially the IBM Model M, but in a modified variant that used the XT's keyboard protocol and lacked LEDs). 3.5\\" floppy drives became available and 20?MB Seagate ST-225 hard disks in 5.25\\" half-height size replaced the full-height 10?MB drives.\\r\\nModel 788 was the only XT sold with the Color Graphics Adapter as a standard feature.[4]\\r\\nModels 568, 588, and 589 were used as basis for the XT/370; they had an additional (co-)processor board that could execute System/370 instructions.[4] An XT-based machine with a Series/1 co-processor board existed as well, but it had its own System Unit number, the IBM 4950.[6]\\r\\nThe XT had three BIOS revisions; the original dated November 8, 1982, the second dated January 10, 1986, and the third dated May 9, 1986. The latter two were the versions found on 256ÿ640KB motherboards and added support for 3.5\\" floppies, 101 key keyboards, and a few other minor things such as a joystick input function (INT 15h Function 84h) and faster POST. The May 1986 BIOS was identical to the January 1986 revision except for bug fixes pertaining to keyboard input. XTs with the 1982 BIOS may be upgraded to the newer revision.\\r\\nThe XT BIOS added a few technical improvements over the 5150 BIOS, including displaying a memory count during the POST instead of a blank screen. In the interest of faster booting (a fully loaded 5150 with 640k could take over half a minute to complete the POST memory scan), the XT BIOS only attempts to read one bit each from the leftmost chip in each bank and if so, assumes that bank is filled.\\r\\nWhile the 5150 had two DIP switch blocks, one for RAM size and the other for system configuration, the XT has one DIP block and just three possible RAM settings (128k, 128-256k, and greater than 256k).\\r\\nThe 5161 was an expansion chassis that used an identical case and power supply as the XT but had instead of a system board a backplane with 8 card slots (and no microprocessor). The 5161 came with a 10?MB hard drive and had room for another one. The 5161 was connected to the 5160 using an Extender Card in the system unit and a Receiver Card in the Expansion Unit, connected by a custom cable. The Expansion Unit could also contain extra memory, but the Extender card inserted wait states for memory in the Expansion Unit, so it was preferable to install memory onto the XT system board or on memory cards in slots plugged into the XT system board directly. The 5161 could be connected to either an XT or to the earlier 5150 (the original IBM PC).[7] This expansion feature was not available for later machines like the IBM PC AT and in fact the 5161 is completely incompatible with anything but an 8088-based PC.\\r\\nIn 1986, the XT 286 (IBM 5162) with a 6?MHz Intel 80286 processor was introduced. Despite being marketed as a lower-tier model than the IBM AT, this system actually ran many applications faster than the ATs of the time with 6?MHz 286 processors, because the XT 286 had zero wait state RAM, which could move data more quickly.[1]:95 It came with standard 640?KB RAM on its system board (128?KB actually on board, plus two 256?KB SIMMs) and with an AT-style 1.2?MB high density diskette drive plus a 20?MB hard disk.[8][9] Despite these features, an InfoWorld review from March 1987 declared it a poor market value.[10]\\r\\nThe XT 286 used a 157 watt power supply, which could internally switch between 115 or 230 V AC operation.[8]\\r\\nByte in November 1983 stated that DOS 2.0 had changed more compared to its predecessor than the XT had. The magazine advised consumers to make sure that expansion cards fit the computer's shorter and narrower slots, and concluded that the XT was \\"competitively priced\\" and \\"solidly engineered, although technically modest, encore to the\\" IBM PC.[3]\\r\\nPhoto galleries:","input":"When was the ibm xt microcomputer released in the market?"},{"output":"donated to a variety of causes including various scholarships, non-profit organizations, and village services.

The village is also served by County Routes 31 and 33.\\r\\nClimate\\r\\nCooperstown has a humid continental climate, with cold, very snowy winters, warm summers, and abundant precipitation year-round. Freezing temperatures have been observed in every month of the year, except for July. The record low temperature is ?34?F (?37?C), set on February 9, 1934, and the record high temperature is 99?F (37?C), set on July 9 and 10, 1936.[6]\\r\\n\\r\\nAs of the census[9] of 2000, there were 2,032 people, 906 households, and 479 families residing in the village. The population density was 1,317.5 people per square mile (509.5/km2). There were 1,070 housing units at an average density of 693.8 per square mile (268.3/km2). The racial makeup of the village was 96.21% White, 0.94% African American, 0.10% Native American, 1.62% Asian, 0.34% from other races, and 0.79% from two or more races. Hispanic or Latino of any race were 2.31% of the population.\\r\\nThere were 906 households out of which 23.2% had children under the age of 18 living with them, 41.9% were married couples living together, 8.7% had a female householder with no husband present, and 47.1% were non-families. 41.4% of all households were made up of individuals and 19.2% had someone living alone who was 65 years of age or older. The average household size was 2.05 and the average family size was 2.83.\\r\\nIn the village the population was spread out with 20.2% under the age of 18, 5.4% from 18 to 24, 24.7% from 25 to 44, 22.8% from 45 to 64, and 26.9% who were 65 years of age or older. The median age was 45 years. For every 100 females there were 81.4 males. For every 100 females age 18 and over, there were 76.8 males.\\r\\nThe median income for a household in the village was $36,992, and the median income for a family was $50,250. Males had a median income of $39,625 versus $20,595 for females. The per capita income for the village was $26,799. About 5.0% of families and 10.2% of the population were below the poverty line, including 7.5% of those under age 18 and 5.4% of those age 65 or over.\\r\\nNotable historic year-round or summer residents of Cooperstown included:\\r\\nAside from James Fenimore Cooper, noted Cooperstown authors include his daughter Susan Fenimore Cooper, the author of Rural Hours, and his great-great-grandson Paul Fenimore Cooper, author of Tal: His Marvelous Adventures with Noom-Zor-Noom (1929, 1957, 2001).\\r\\nOther writers include the prolific poet W. W. Lord, who captured Cooperstown in many of his poems, as well as modern author Lauren Groff, who has written extensively about her hometown, notably in The Monsters of Templeton., a story that brings several Cooperstown legends to life.\\r\\nThe work of Cooperstown-based novelist and poet Marly Youmans has referred to the area, notably in her epic poem Thaliad (2012), in which a group of child survivors of an apocalypse travel north and make their new home in an abandoned village on the shore of Glimmerglass Lake.[10]'[11][12]\\r\\nThe Clark family, whose fortune originated with a half-ownership of the patent for Singer Sewing Machine, have lived in Cooperstown since the mid-19th century. The family's holdings include interests assembled over a century and a half, which are now held through trusts and foundations. Their dominance is reflected in Clark ownership of more than 10,000 acres (40?km2) of largely undeveloped land in and around greater Cooperstown.\\r\\nIn the village, the Otesaga, the Cooper Inn, Clark Estates, and the Clara Welch Thanksgiving Home are all Clark properties. In addition, the Clarks were founding partners of, and retain an interest in, the Baseball Hall of Fame and the Mary Imogene Bassett Hospital.\\r\\nCooperstown still receives support from the Clark Foundation, which has donated to a variety of causes including various scholarships, non-profit organizations, and village services. The family has also donated land for the Cooperstown Central School District's new high school location ? formerly horse stables ? as well as for parks such as Fairy Springs and Council Rock, and recently, for a new Little League baseball field.\\r\\nJane Forbes Clark II,[13] the primary family heir today, has continued this commitment. She has purchased strategic land to ensure the preservation of village entry points, as well as overseeing the expansion of the various Clark holdings.\\r\\nIn late November 2013, Clark discussed her family's continued support for the community during a meeting of The Womens Club of Cooperstown.[14] The Clark Foundation supports a variety of Cooperstown and Otsego County organizations and causes with donations of $7.5 million to charitable organizations every year. The family's Scriven Foundation, formed in 1975, donates only to Otsego County nonprofit organizations, such as the Cooperstown Village Library. The Scriven Foundation donates $1.5 million every year. According to Clark's presentation, the family's businesses employ 4,198 people, with 3,100 of those positions being full-time jobs.[14]\\r\\nThe Cooperstown Central School District has two buildings located in the town. The Elementary School is located at 21 Walnut Street. It was built in the 1950s, and was designed with a bomb shelter in the basement. The Junior/Senior High School was built in 1970 at 39 Linden Avenue, on land donated by the Clark family. The school district offices are located in the high school building.[15]\\r\\nCooperstown is best known as the home of the National Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum, which was founded in 1939 by Stephen Carlton Clark. According to an interview conducted in 1906 by the Mills Commission, nearby resident Abner Graves attributed the game's invention to his deceased friend, Abner Doubleday. Graves stated that Doubleday invented baseball on a cow pasture within the village in 1839, the present site of Doubleday Field, but this claim is universally discounted by baseball historians.\\r\\nEven so, as the site of the Hall of Fame, Cooperstown retains a close connection with the baseball world, and \\"Cooperstown\\" had become synonymous with the Hall. Several nationally recognized tournaments are held in the area. Cooperstown Dreams Park in nearby Hartwick Seminary hosts 104 level U12 teams for weekly tournaments in the summer. Several professionals, including David Price and Matt Garza, have attended CDP. In 2010, Cooperstown got an official baseball team of its own, the Cooperstown Hawkeyes, a collegiate league team who play against many other teams from the northeast during the summer, with home games played at historic Doubleday Field.[16]\\r\\nOther attractions include the Farmers' Museum, the Fenimore Art Museum, The New York State Historical Association's (NYSHA) library, Brewery Ommegang, and the Clark Sports Center, a large fitness facility, where the annual Hall of Fame Induction is held.\\r\\nOnce known as the \\"Village of Museums\\", until the 1970s Cooperstown also boasted the Indian Museum (adjacent to Lakefront Park), The Carriage and Harness Museum (displaying a world-class collection primarily from F. Ambrose Clark's estate; now the Bassett Hospital offices on Elk Street), and The Woodland Museum near Three Mile Point. The latter, opened in 1962 by heirs to the Anheuser-Busch company, folded in 1974. It ran a close third in annual attendance to the Hall of Fame and Farmers' Museum.\\r\\nThe internationally noted Glimmerglass Opera is closely associated with Cooperstown. Founded in 1975, the company originally performed in the Cooperstown High School auditorium. In 1987, the company relocated to farmland donated by Tom Goodyear of the Cary Mede Estate 8 miles (13?km) north of the village, where the Alice Busch Opera Theater was built, the first new opera-specific hall in the United States built since 1966. It has a popular summer season with a reputation for producing high quality opera and commissioning new works.\\r\\nThe Cooperstown Historic District, Glimmerglass Historic District, Middlefield District No. 1 School, Otsego County Courthouse, and United States Post Office are listed on the National Register of Historic Places.[17]\\r\\nSuperficially, the downtown commercial district looks not unlike it did in the 1970s. It has undergone significant change since the late 20th century.\\r\\nThrough the 1970s, Main Street was still home to at least five grocery stores, including an A&P. Western Auto had a branch on Main Street and J.J. Newberry's had a two-story five-and-dime with a food counter. Smalley's, a stage theater converted into a movie theater, had a single screen across from a Farm & Home store. With its post office, library, and the Baseball Hall of Fame, Main Street resembled a true village square.\\r\\nToday, the village has fewer traditional services for year-round and seasonal residents. Once boasting half a dozen gas stations, the village now has two. Traditional grocers have been reduced to one, and in 1977 Great American was built on the outskirts of town, replacing the town's bowling alley. In 2010 it was converted to a Price Chopper. Hardware stores such as Western Auto, McGown's and Farm & Home have been displaced by an Ace Hardware just outside the village. Newberry's has become a single-floor general store with the basement stairs boarded up. Sherry's Famous Restaurant closed in the late 1990s after more than half a century of business. Most Main Street shops now cater to the tourist trade and feature gifts and souvenirs.\\r\\nThe Cooperstown Chamber of Commerce, established in 1917, looks to develop business and trade in the Cooperstown region. Serving also as a visitor center in its main office, the Chamber also manages a seasonal kiosk on the corner of Main and Pioneer St for tourists.\\r\\nCooperstown was formerly served by the Cooperstown Municipal Airport, which was a two-runway facility fewer than two miles to the northwest of town center. That field closed in the 1960s. The village is now served by a small grass field in nearby Westville and a one-runway facility in Oneonta, NY.\\r\\nThere are, and were, significant residential, commercial and religious structures in Cooperstown. Original residences related to the founding Cooper family, such as Edgewater and Heathcote, are still standing. Otsego Hall, James Fenimore Cooper's residence which once stood in what is now Cooper Park, has been lost, along with his chalet. Byberry, the cottage built for his daughter, remains on River Street, albeit in altered form.\\r\\n\\"Fynmere\\", a grand stone manor from the early 20th century, erected by Cooper heirs on the eastern edge of town, was designed by noted architect Charles A. Platt. Later donated to the Presbyterian Church as a retirement home, the property was razed in 1979. Both its grounds and those of neighboring property Heathcote (extant today), built for Katherine Guy Cooper (1895ÿ1988), daughter-in-law of James Fenimore Cooper III, were laid out by noted landscape architect Ellen Biddle Shipman.\\r\\nResidences, business, and properties related to the Clark family abound within the village. From the original family seat of \\"Fernleigh\\" to the 1928 Georgian manor of \\"West Hill\\", the properties are exceptionally well cared for. Fernleigh is a Second Empire stone mansion designed by New Jersey architect James Van Dyke and built in 1869. The original garden at Fernleigh, located to the south of the mansion, included a servants' house and Turkish bath; both details have since been lost. In 1923, Stephen C. Clark, Sr. commissioned Marcus T. Reynolds and Bryant Fleming, a landscape design professor at Cornell University, to design new gardens for Fernleigh.[18]\\r\\nThe manor home of Robert Sterling Clark, Red Creek Farm, remains on the outskirts of the Village. His brother F. Ambrose Clark's \\"Iroquois Farm\\" manor house was razed in the early 1980s. Also razed in 1979 was the Mohican Farms manor house, owned by the Clark Estates, in Springfield Center, New York. It was formerly the summer home of the Spaulding sporting good family from Buffalo.\\r\\nEdward Severin Clark built a farm complex at Fenimore Farm in 1918, which has been adapted as the Farmers Museum. His stone manor, built in 1931, was bequeathed to the New York State Historical Association and today serves as the Fenimore Art Museum.\\r\\nOther structures, such as the Baseball Hall of Fame, Otesaga Hotel, Clark Estate Office, Kingfisher Tower, which lies on the east side of Lake Otsego, Bassett Hospital, and The Clara Welch Thanksgiving Home, exemplify Cooperstown's architectural wealth.\\r\\nThe Bowers family \\"Lakelands\\" manor, neighboring \\"Mohican Lodge\\", and their former estate of \\"Willowbrook\\" (1818; presently the Cooper Inn) serve as further examples of grand homes erected by affluent residents. The Bowers family received the land patent extending from current-day Bowerstown to very near Cherry Valley, New York, upon which Congressman John Myer Bowers built Lakelands in 1804. Woodside Hall, on the eastern edge of the village proper, was built c. 1829 by Eben B. Morehouse and was subsequently owned by several prominent individuals, including, in 1895, financier Walter C. Stokes of New York City. Prior to the Stokes' ownership, the home was visited by Martin Van Buren, the eighth President of the United States.\\r\\nThe village offices and Cooperstown Art Association are housed in a neo-classical building designed by Ernest Flagg. He is famed for Manhattan's 47-story Singer Building and the Boldt Castle on the St. Lawrence River. The Cooperstown building was originally commissioned by Elizabeth Scriven Clark in 1898 as a YMCA. Her son Robert Sterling Clark gave it to the village in 1932 during the Great Depression.\\r\\nSeveral prominent buildings in town were designed or updated by noted architect Frank P. Whiting, who originally worked under Ernest Flagg. A resident of New York City and Cooperstown, Whiting was also a noted artist. He designed the Farmers Museum farm buildings[19] and the shingle-style manor at \\"Leatherstocking Falls Farm\\", the residence of Dorothy Stokes Bostwick Smith Campbell, the landscaping for which was done by the all-female firm of Wodell & Cottrell in the 1930s.[20] Whiting also designed 56 Lake Street. In 1932 Whiting designed and built his residence, \\"Westerly\\", on a half acre lot at the north end of Nelson Avenue. The home is in the Colonial style and today retains many interior and exterior features of the original home. In June 1923 Whiting wrote a featured monograph \\"Cooperstown in The Times of Our Forefathers\\" for volume IX of the White Pine Series of Architectural Monographs containing several sketches and measured drawings of homes in Cooperstown.\\r\\nIn 1916, financier William T. Hyde acquired \\"Glimmerglen\\", a lakeside property north of Fenimore Farm, from the Constable family.[21] The house burned to the ground shortly thereafter and was rebuilt by society architect Alfred Hopkins, who also designed a new farm complex, gate house, and assorted dependencies. The estate was featured in a multipage advertisement in Country Life magazine in late 1922 when the property was put up for sale. The manor and greenhouses were razed in the late 1960s after their acquisition by the Clark family. The stone gatehouse, featured in the Architectural Record is extant today and owned by the Clark Foundation, as is the boathouse and the distinctive cottage known as \\"Winter House\\".\\r\\nNotes\\r\\nFurther reading","input":"What impact has the clark family had upon cooperstown?"},{"output":"Dominican vocations","context":"The Blessed Jordan of Saxony, O.P. (referred to in Latin as Jordanis, also known as de Alamania; c. 1190 ÿ 1237), was one of the first leaders of the Dominican Order. His feast day is February 13.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nJordan belonged to the noble German family of the Counts of Eberstein. He was born in the Castle of Borrenstrick, in the diocese of Paderborn. He began his studies in his native land, and was sent to complete them at the University of Paris.[2] While a student he met Dominic de Guzman, the founder of the Order of Preachers, and was inspired by the preaching of Reginald of Orleans (also known as Reginald of Saint-Gilles) to join the Dominican Order. He received the habit on Ash Wednesday, 1220. Jordan was a Master of Arts and a grammarian, and taught in the schools of Paris.[3]\\r\\nIn 1221, a General Chapter of the Order held in Bologna appointed Jordan Prior Provincial of Lombardy in Italy.[4]\\r\\nOn 6 August 1221, Dominic died, and in 1222 Jordan was elected as his successor as Master General of the Order of Preachers.[2] Like Saint Dominic, Jordan was famed as a strict disciplinarian whose commitment to the Rule was tempered with kindness.\\r\\nDuring Jordan's administration, the young Order increased to over 300 priories. Jordan is particularly remembered for his eloquence in attracting candidates to join the Order. Through his lectures in university towns, he won manyallegedly well over 1,000professors and students for the Order from the universities of Europe, among whom was Albertus Magnus who is thought to have been recruited in Padua.[5] He added four new provinces to the eight already existing. Twice he obtained for the Order a chair at the University of Paris and helped to found the University of Toulouse. He established the first general house of studies of the Order.[6]\\r\\nAdditionally, Jordan was a spiritual guide to many, including one of the first Dominican nuns, the Blessed Diana degli Andal, O.P.[2] He also found time to write a number of books: a life of St. Dominic and several other works. Among them was the Libellus de principiis Ordinis Praedicatorum (\\"Booklet on the beginnings of the Order of Preachers\\"), a Latin text which is both the earliest biography of Saint Dominic and the first narrative history of the foundation of the Order.\\r\\nA section of a work by Friar Gerald de Frachet describing the lives of the first Dominicans, the Lives of the Brothers (Vitae fratrum), is dedicated to describing his character, virtue, and miracles. All of the first chroniclers of the Order describe Jordan's kindness and personal charm. He had the ability to console the troubled and to inspire the despondent with new hope.[7]\\r\\nJordan died, at the age of forty-seven, in a shipwreck on his return from Palestine, where he was visiting the local monasteries of the Order. The shipwreck occurred off the coast of Syria on 13 February 1237.[8] Jordan was buried in the Dominican Church of St. John in Akko, in present-day Israel. The boat Angel Mika Kemp has recently been raised from the seabed.\\r\\nHis feast day is 13 February.[9]\\r\\nJordan of Saxony was beatified by Pope Leo XII in 1825.\\r\\nHe is venerated as the patron of Dominican vocations. Jordan is honored as the patron saint of the Faculty of Engineering of the University of Santo Tomas, in Manila, which was founded by the Dominican Order. In Colombia, he is honored as the patron saint of the Colegio Jordan de Sajonia, one of the most important private schools of Bogota.\\r\\nJordan of Saxony is credited with introducing the practice of singing the Salve Regina in procession at the end of Compline, done, it is recorded, to calm the spirits of the Brothers, who were being tried by the Devil.[6]","input":"What is st jordan the patron saint of?"},{"output":"November 13, 1997","context":"Miami-Dade County is a county located in the southeastern part of the U.S. state of Florida. It is the southeasternmost county on the U.S. mainland. According to a 2016 census report,[1] the county had a population of 2,712,945,[2] making it the most populous county in Florida and the seventh-most populous county in the United States.[3] It is also Florida's third-largest county in terms of land area, with 1,946 square miles (5,040?km2). The county seat is Miami.[4]\\r\\nMiami-Dade County is included in the Miami-Fort Lauderdale-West Palm Beach, FL Metropolitan Statistical Area.\\r\\nThe county is home to 34 incorporated cities and many unincorporated areas. The northern, central and eastern portions of the county are heavily urbanized with many high rises up the coastline, as well as the location of South Florida's central business district, Downtown Miami. Southern Miami-Dade County includes the Redland and Homestead areas, which make up the agricultural economy of Miami. Agricultural Redland makes up roughly one third of Miami-Dade County's inhabited land area, and is sparsely populated, a stark contrast to the densely populated, urban northern Miami-Dade County. The western portion of the county extends into the Everglades National Park and is populated only by a Miccosukee tribal village. East of the mainland in Biscayne Bay is also Biscayne National Park and the Biscayne Bay Aquatic Preserves.[5]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe earliest evidence of Native American settlement in the Miami region came from about 12,000 years ago.[6] The first inhabitants settled on the banks of the Miami River, with the main villages on the northern banks.\\r\\nThe inhabitants at the time of first European contact were the Tequesta people, who controlled much of southeastern Florida, including what is now Miami-Dade County, Broward County, and the southern part of Palm Beach County. The Tequesta Indians fished, hunted, and gathered the fruit and roots of plants for food, but did not practice any form of agriculture. They buried the small bones of the deceased with the rest of the body, and put the larger bones in a box for the village people to see. The Tequesta are credited with making the Miami Circle.[7]\\r\\nJuan Ponce de Le܇n was the first European to visit the area in 1513 by sailing into Biscayne Bay. His journal records that he reached Chequescha, a varianth of Tequesta, which was Miami's first recorded name.[8] It is unknown whether he came ashore or made contact with the natives. Pedro Menndez de Avils and his men made the first recorded landing when they visited the Tequesta settlement in 1566 while looking for Avils' missing son, shipwrecked a year earlier.[9] Spanish soldiers led by Father Francisco Villarreal built a Jesuit mission at the mouth of the Miami River a year later but it was short-lived. After the Spaniards left, the Tequesta Indians were left to fend themselves from European-introduced diseases like smallpox. By 1711, the Tequesta sent a couple of local chiefs to Havana, Cuba, to ask if they could migrate there. The Cubans sent two ships to help them, but Spanish illnesses struck and most of the Indians died.[10]\\r\\nThe first permanent European settlers arrived in the early 19th century. People came from the Bahamas to South Florida and the Keys to hunt for treasure from the ships that ran aground on the treacherous Great Florida Reef. Some accepted Spanish land offers along the Miami River. At about the same time, the Seminole Indians arrived, along with a group of runaway slaves. The area was affected by the Second Seminole War, during which Major William S. Harney led several raids against the Indians. Most non-Indian residents were soldiers stationed at Fort Dallas. It was the most devastating Indian war in American history, causing almost a total loss of population in Miami.\\r\\nAfter the Second Seminole War ended in 1842, William English, re-established a plantation started by his uncle on the Miami River. He charted the Village of Miami on the south bank of the Miami River and sold several plots of land. In 1844, Miami became the county seat, and six years later a census reported that there were ninety-six residents living in the area.[11] The Third Seminole War was not as destructive as the second one. Even so, it slowed down the settlement of southeast Florida. At the end of the war, a few of the soldiers stayed.\\r\\nDade County was created on January 18, 1836, under the Territorial Act of the United States. The county was named after Major Francis L. Dade, a soldier killed in 1835 in the Second Seminole War, at what has since been named the Dade Battlefield.[12] At the time of its creation, Dade County included the land that now contains Palm Beach and Broward counties, together with the Florida Keys from Bahia Honda Key north and the land of present-day Miami-Dade County. The county seat was originally at Indian Key in the Florida Keys; then in 1844, the County seat was moved to Miami. The Florida Keys from Key Largo to Bahia Honda were returned to Monroe County in 1866. In 1888 the county seat was moved to Juno, near present-day Juno Beach, Florida, returning to Miami in 1899. In 1909, Palm Beach County was formed from the northern portion of what was then Dade County, and then in 1915, Palm Beach County and Dade County contributed nearly equal portions of land to create what is now Broward County. There have been no significant boundary changes to the county since 1915.[13][14][15]\\r\\nThe third-costliest natural disaster to occur in the United States was Hurricane Andrew, which hit Miami in the early morning of Monday, August 24, 1992. It struck the southern part of the county from due east, south of Miami and very near Homestead, Kendall, and Cutler Ridge (now the Town of Cutler Bay). Damages numbered over US$25 billion in the county alone, and recovery has taken years in these areas where the destruction was greatest. This was the costliest natural disaster in US history until Hurricane Katrina struck the Gulf region in 2005.\\r\\nOn November 13, 1997, voters changed the name of the county from Dade to Miami-Dade to acknowledge the international name recognition of Miami.[16] Voters were acting pursuant to home rule powers granted to Dade County, including the ability to change the name of the county without the consent of the Florida Legislature.[17] The change in name also addressed a source of public dissatisfaction with the name \\"Dade\\" which was chosen to honor of Francis L. Dade, who had been killed in the Dade Massacre in the 1830s. The massacre did not occur in South Florida, but in the west central part of the state, in present-day Sumter County, near Bushnell. There is also a Dade City, which is closer to the site of the massacre.\\r\\nAccording to the U.S. Census Bureau, the county has a total area of 2,431 square miles (6,300?km2), of which 1,898 square miles (4,920?km2) is land and 533 square miles (1,380?km2) (21.9%) is water.[18] It is the third-largest county in Florida by land area and second-largest by total area. Most of the water is in the Biscayne Bay, with another significant portion in the adjacent waters of the Atlantic Ocean.\\r\\nMiami-Dade County is only about 6 feet (1.8?m) above sea level. It is rather new geologically and located at the eastern edge of the Florida Platform, a carbonate plateau created millions of years ago. Eastern Dade is composed of Oolite limestone while western Dade is composed mostly of Bryozoa.[19] Miami-Dade is among the last areas of Florida to be created and populated with fauna and flora, mostly in the Pleistocene.\\r\\nThe bay is divided from the Atlantic Ocean by the many barrier isles along the coast, one of which is where well-known Miami Beach is located, home to South Beach and the Art Deco district. The Florida Keys, which are also barrier islands are only accessible through Miami-Dade County, but which are otherwise part of neighboring Monroe County. Miami is situated seventy miles from West Palm Beach, and thirty miles from Fort Lauderdale.\\r\\nU.S. Census Bureau 2010 Ethnic/Race Demographics:[25][26]\\r\\nIn 2010, 3.4% of the Miami-Dade's population considered themselves to be of only \\"American\\" ancestry (regardless of race or ethnicity.)[25]\\r\\nIn 2010, Cubans made up the largest population of immigrants (with more than half of the population,) with Colombians coming in second, Haitians in third, followed by Hondurans in fourth place, then Dominicans, Venezuelans, Peruvians, Jamaicans, Mexicans, and Argentinians among the highest group of expatriates.[29]\\r\\nThere were 867,352 households out of which 30.61% had children under the age of 18 living with them, 43.8% were married couples living together, 18.79% had a female householder with no husband present, and 30.49% were non-families. 23.55% of all households were made up of individuals and 8.38% (2.52% male and 5.86% female) had someone living alone who was 65 years of age or older.

In relation to ancestry (excluding the various Hispanic and Latino ancestries), 5% were Haitian, 5% American, 2% Italian, 2% Jamaican, 2% German, 2% Irish, and 2% English ancestry.[35]\\r\\n1,147,765 Miami-Dade residents50.9% of the total populationwere foreign-born, a percentage greater than that of any other county in the United States. 47% of the foreign-born population were naturalized U.S. citizens.[35][36] Among the foreign-born population, the most common countries of origin were Cuba (46%), Nicaragua (8%), Colombia (7%), Haiti (6%), the Dominican Republic (3%), Honduras (3%), Jamaica (3%) and El Salvador (2%).[35]\\r\\nThere were 776,774 households out of which 33.8% had children under the age of 18 living with them, 47.7% were married couples living together, 17.2% had a female householder with no husband present, and 29.4% were non-families. 23.3% of all households were made up of individuals and 8.6% had someone living alone who was 65 years of age or older. The average household size was 2.84 and the average family size was 3.35.\\r\\nThe age distribution is 24.8% under the age of 18, 9.1% from 18 to 24, 31.0% from 25 to 44, 21.7% from 45 to 64, and 13.3% who were 65 years of age or older. The median age was 36 years. For every 100 females there were 93.5 males. For every 100 females age 18 and over, there were 90.2 males.\\r\\nThe median income for a household in the county was $35,966, and the median income for a family was $40,260. Males had a median income of $30,120 versus $24,686 for females. The per capita income for the county was $18,497. About 14.5% of families and 18.0% of the population were below the poverty line, including 22.9% of those under age 18 and 18.9% of those age 65 or over.\\r\\nAs of 2010, 63.77% of the population spoke Spanish, 28.07% English, 4.22% French Creole (mainly Haitian Creole), 0.64% French, and 0.55% Portuguese as their mother language.[37] 52% of the county residents were born outside the United States, while 71.93% of the population spoke a language other than English as their primary language.[37]\\r\\nIn the 1950s about 80% of the county population were English-speaking non-Hispanic whites. As of 2010 58.5% of the population natively spoke Spanish, with about half of them having low English fluency. 27.2% of the population spoke only English.[38]\\r\\nBrightstar Corporation,[39] Burger King,[40] Intradeco Holdings,[41] Latin Flavors,[42] Norwegian Cruise Line,[43] and Ryder have their headquarters in unincorporated areas in the county.[44] Centurion Air Cargo, Florida West International Airways, IBC Airways, and World Atlantic Airlines have their headquarters on the grounds of Miami International Airport in an unincorporated area in the county.[45][46][47][48][49]\\r\\nHewlett Packard's main Latin America offices are located on the ninth floor of the Waterford Building in unincorporated Miami-Dade County.[50]\\r\\nOther companies with offices in an unincorporated area not in any CDP:\\r\\nSeveral defunct airlines, including Airlift International, Arrow Air, National Airlines, and Rich International Airways, were headquartered on or near the airport property.[56][57][58][59]\\r\\nAfter Frank Borman became president of Eastern Airlines in 1975, he moved Eastern's headquarters from Rockefeller Center in Midtown Manhattan, New York City to an unincorporated area in Miami-Dade County[60][61] Around 1991 the Miami-Dade County lost a few corporations, including Eastern Airlines, which folded in 1991.[62]\\r\\nAt one time the cruise line ResidenSea had its headquarters in an unincorporated area in the county.[63]\\r\\nAccording to Miami's Beacon Council, the top private employers in 2014 in Miami-Dade were:[64]\\r\\nAccording to Miami's Beacon Council, the top Government employers in 2014 in Miami-Dade were:[64]\\r\\nMiami-Dade County includes 34 incorporated areas, 38 census-designated places, and 16 unincorporated regions.\\r\\nMiami-Dade County has operated under a unique metropolitan system of government, a \\"two-tier federation,\\" since 1957. This was made possible when Florida voters approved a constitutional amendment in 1956 that allowed the people of Dade County (as it was known then) to enact a home rule charter. Prior to this year, home rule did not exist in Florida, and all counties were limited to the same set of powers by the Florida Constitution and state law. Mattie Belle Davis, the first woman from Florida elected to the American Bar Foundation and the second woman to be elected in the US, was the first woman judge of Metropolitan Court of Dade County, Florida.\\r\\nUnlike a consolidated city-county, where the city and county governments merge into a single entity, these two entities remain separate. Instead there are two \\"tiers\\", or levels, of government: city and county. There are 34 municipalities in the county, the City of Miami being the largest.\\r\\nCities are the \\"lower tier\\" of local government, providing police and fire protection, zoning and code enforcement, and other typical city services within their jurisdiction. These services are paid for by city taxes. The County is the \\"upper tier\\", and it provides services of a metropolitan nature, such as emergency management, airport and seaport operations, public housing and health care services, transportation, environmental services, solid waste disposal etc. These are funded by county taxes, which are assessed on all incorporated and unincorporated areas.\\r\\nOf the county's 2.6 million total residents (as of 2013), approximately 52% live in unincorporated areas, the majority of which are heavily suburbanized. These residents are part of the Unincorporated Municipal Services Area (UMSA). For these residents, the County fills the role of both lower- and upper-tier government, the County Commission acting as their lower-tier municipal representative body. Residents within UMSA pay a UMSA tax, equivalent to a city tax, which is used to provide County residents with equivalent city services (police, fire, zoning, water and sewer, etc.). Residents of incorporated areas do not pay UMSA tax.\\r\\nThe Mayor of Miami-Dade County is elected countywide to serve a four-year term and is considered a \\"strong mayor.\\" The mayor is not a member of the County Commission, appoints all 25 directors who oversee the operations of the County Departments and has veto power over the Commission. A mayoral appointment and veto can only be overridden by a two-thirds majority of the County Commission. The post is occupied by Carlos A. Gimnez.\\r\\nThe Board of County Commissioners is the legislative body, consisting of 13 members elected from single-member districts. Members are elected to serve four-year terms, and elections of members are staggered. The Board chooses a Chairperson, who presides over the Commission, as well as appoints the members of its legislative committees. The Board has a wide array of powers to enact legislation, create departments, and regulate businesses operating within the County. It also has the power to override the Mayor's veto with a two-thirds vote.\\r\\nFlorida's Constitution provides for six elected officials to oversee executive and administrative functions for each county (called \\"Constitutional Officers\\"): Sheriff, Property Appraiser, Supervisor of Elections, Tax Collector, Clerk of the Circuit Court and Comptroller. However, the current Constitution allows voters in home-rule counties (including Miami-Dade) to abolish the offices and reorganize them as subordinate County departments; Miami-Dade voters chose this option for Sheriff, Supervisor of Elections, Controller and Tax Collector. The office of Clerk of the Circuit Court, and the judicial offices of State Attorney, and Public Defender, are still branches of State government and are, therefore, independently elected and not part of County government.[citation needed]\\r\\nThe most visible distinction between Miami-Dade and other Florida counties is the title of its law enforcement agency. It is the only county in Florida that does not have an elected sheriff, or an agency titled \\"Sheriff's Office.\\"[citation needed] Instead, the equivalent agency is known as the Miami-Dade Police Department, and its leader is known as the Metropolitan Sheriff and Director of the Miami-Dade Police Department. However, the badges of Miami-Dade police officers still have \\"Deputy Sheriff, Dade County, Fla.\\" inscribed.\\r\\nThe Miami-Dade County Fire Rescue Department is the agency that provides fire protection and emergency medical services for Miami-Dade County, Florida. The department serves 29 municipalities and all unincorporated areas of Miami-Dade County from 60 fire stations.[67] The Department also provides fire protection services for Miami International Airport, Miami Executive Airport and Opa-locka Airport.[68]\\r\\nThe communities served are Aventura, Bal Harbour, Bay Harbor Islands, Biscayne Park, Cutler Bay, Doral, El Portal, Florida City, Golden Beach, Hialeah Gardens, Homestead, Indian Creek, Medley, Miami Gardens, Miami Lakes, Miami Shores, Miami Springs, North Bay Village, North Miami, North Miami Beach, Opa-locka, Palmetto Bay, Pinecrest, South Miami, Surfside, Sweetwater, Sunny Isles Beach, Virginia Gardens, and West Miami.[69]\\r\\nMiami-Dade Fire Rescue is also the home to Urban Search and Rescue Florida Task Force 1 as well as EMS operations consisting of 57 Advanced Life Support units staffed by 760 state-certified paramedics and 640 state-certified emergency medical technicians.\\r\\nThe Miami-Dade Police Department is a full service metropolitan police department serving Miami-Dade County's unincorporated areas, although they have lenient mutual aid agreements with other municipalities, most often the City of Miami Police Department. The Miami-Dade Police Department is the largest police department in the state of Florida with over 4,700 employees. The Department is still often referred by its former name, the Metro-Dade Police or simply Metro.\\r\\nThe Miami-Dade Police Department operate out of nine districts throughout Miami-Dade County and have two special bureaus. The current director of the department is Juan Perez, who succeeded J. D. Patterson, Jr.[70] The Department's headquarters are located in Doral, Florida.\\r\\nMiami-Dade Water and Sewer Department (MDWASD) is one of the largest public utilities in the United States, employing approximately 2,700 employees as of 2007. It provides service to over 2.4 million customers, operating with an annual budget of almost $400 million. Approximately 330 million gallons of water are drawn everyday from the Biscayne Aquifer for consumer use. MDWASD has over 7,100 miles (11,400?km) of water lines, a service area of 396 square miles (1,026?km2) and 14 pump stations. MDWASD has over 3,600 miles (5,800?km) of sewage pipes, a service area of 341 square miles (883?km2) and 954 pump stations.[71]\\r\\nMiami-Dade County Corrections and Rehabilitation Department is the correction agency.\\r\\nThe Miami-Dade Aviation Department operates Miami International Airport, Miami Executive Airport, Opa-locka Executive Airport, Homestead General Aviation Airport, and Dade-Collier Training and Transition Airport.[72]\\r\\nThe Florida Department of Juvenile Justice operates the Miami-Dade Regional Juvenile Detention Center in an unincorporated area in the county.[73]\\r\\nIn Florida, each county is also a school district. Miami-Dade County Public Schools, is operated by an independently elected School Board. A professional Superintendent of Schools manages the day-to-day operations of the district, who is appointed by and serves at the pleasure of the School Board. The Miami-Dade County Public School District is currently the fourth-largest public school district in the nation with almost 400,000 students in 2007/2008.\\r\\nThe Miami-Dade Public Library is one of the largest public library systems in the country, comprising 42 branch locations, and 8 branch locations currently being built/not officially opened.\\r\\nMiami-Dade County is home to many private and public universities and colleges.\\r\\nMiami International Airport, located in an unincorporated area in the county, serves as the primary international airport of the Miami Area. One of the busiest international airports in the world, Miami International Airport caters to over 35 million passengers a year. Identifiable locally, as well as several worldwide authorities, as MIA or KMIA, the airport is a major hub and the single largest international gateway for American Airlines, the worlds largest passenger air carrier. Miami International is the United States third largest international port of entry for foreign air passengers (behind New York's John F. Kennedy International Airport and Los Angeles International Airport), and is the seventh largest such gateway in the world. The airports extensive international route network includes non-stop flights to over seventy international cities in North and South America, Europe, Asia, and the Middle East.\\r\\nPublic transit in Miami-Dade County is served by Miami-Dade Transportation and Public Works, and is the largest public transit in Florida. Miami-Dade Transportation and Public Works operates a heavy rail metro system Metrorail, an elevated people mover in Downtown Miami, Metromover and the bus system, Metrobus.[74]\\r\\nIn Florida a Tolled State Road is often (but not always) denoted by having the word \\"TOLL\\" printed on the top of the State Road shield.\\r\\nWhen a driver passes through a toll plaza without paying the proper toll a digital image of the car's license tag is recorded. Under Florida Law, this image can be used by the Authority to issue a toll violation.[75]\\r\\nMiami-Dade County has 10 major expressways and 1 minor expressway in Downtown Miami.\\r\\nThis is a list of Miami-Dade county roads. Miami-Dade County has fewer county roads than any other county in Florida, despite its large population. None are signed.\\r\\nSources:\\r\\nA street grid stretches from downtown Miami throughout the county. This grid was adopted by the City of Miami following World War I after the United States Post Office threatened to cease mail deliveries in the city because the original system of named streets, with names often changing every few blocks and multiple streets in the city sharing the same name, was too confusing for the mail carriers.[77] The new grid was later extended throughout the county as the population grew west, south, and north of city limits. The grid is laid out with Miami Avenue as the meridian going North-South and Flagler Street the baseline going east-west. The grid is primarily numerical so that, for example, all street addresses north of Flagler and west of Miami Avenue have NW in their address (e.g. NW 27th Avenue). Because its point of origin is in downtown Miami which is close to the coast, the NW and SW quadrants are much larger than the SE and NE quadrants. Many roads, especially major ones, are also named, although, with a few notable exceptions, the number is in more common usage among locals. Although this grid is easy to understand once one is oriented to it, it is not universal in the entire county. Hialeah uses its own grid system which is entirely different in its orientation. Coral Gables and Miami Lakes use named streets almost exclusively, and various smaller municipalities such as Florida City and Homestead use their own grid system along with the Miami-Dade grid system adding to the confusion. In the beach cities and parks of Miami Beach, Surfside, Bal Harbor, Haulover, Sunny Isles, and Golden Beach, the streets are coordinated with the main grid; however, their avenues are named.\\r\\nMiami-Dade County holds the majority of sports arenas, stadiums and complexes in South Florida.

Groups are usually described as indigenous when they maintain traditions or other aspects of an early culture that is associated with a given region. Not all indigenous peoples share this characteristic, usually having adopted substantial elements of a colonising culture, such as dress, religion or language. Indigenous peoples may be settled in a given region (sedentary) or exhibit a nomadic lifestyle across a large territory, but they are generally historically associated with a specific territory on which they depend. Indigenous societies are found in every inhabited climate zone and continent of the world.[1][2]\\r\\nSince indigenous peoples are often faced with threats to their sovereignty, economic well-being and their access to the resources on which their cultures depend, political rights have been set forth in international law by international organizations such as the United Nations, the International Labour Organization and the World Bank.[1] The United Nations has issued a Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples (UNDRIP) to guide member-state national policies to the collective rights of indigenous people, such as culture, identity, language and access to employment, health, education and natural resources. Estimates put the total population of indigenous peoples from 220 million to 350 million.[3]\\r\\nInternational Day of the World's Indigenous Peoples is celebrated on 9 August each year.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe adjective indigenous was historically used to describe animals and plant origins. During the late twentieth century, the term Indigenous people began to be used to describe a legal category in indigenous law created in international and national legislations; it refers to culturally distinct groups affected by colonization.[4] It is derived from the Latin word indigena, which is based on the root gen- 'to be born' with an archaic form of the prefix in 'in'.[5] Any given people, ethnic group or community may be described as indigenous in reference to some particular region or location that they see as their traditional native land claim.[6] Other terms used to refer to indigenous populations are aboriginal, native, original, or first (as in Canada's First Nations).\\r\\nThe use of the term peoples in association with the indigenous is derived from the 19th century anthropological and ethnographic disciplines that Merriam-Webster Dictionary defines as \\"a body of persons that are united by a common culture, tradition, or sense of kinship, which typically have common language, institutions, and beliefs, and often constitute a politically organized group\\".[7]\\r\\nJames Anaya, former Special Rapporteur on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples, has defined indigenous peoples as \\"living descendants of pre-invasion inhabitants of lands now dominated by others. They are culturally distinct groups that find themselves engulfed by other settler societies born of forces of empire and conquest\\".[8][9]\\r\\nThey form at present non-dominant sectors of society and are determined to preserve, develop and transmit to future generations their ancestral territories, and their ethnic identity, as the basis of their continued existence as peoples, in accordance with their own cultural patterns, social institutions and legal system. The International Day of the World's Indigenous People falls on 9 August as this was the date of the first meeting in 1982 of the United Nations Working Group of Indigenous Populations of the Subcommission on Prevention of Discrimination and Protection of Minorities of the Commission on Human Rights.\\r\\nThroughout history, different states designate the groups within their boundaries that are recognized as indigenous peoples according to international or national legislation by different terms. Indigenous people also include people indigenous based on their descent from populations that inhabited the country when non-indigenous religions and cultures arrivedor at the establishment of present state boundarieswho retain some or all of their own social, economic, cultural and political institutions, but who may have been displaced from their traditional domains or who may have resettled outside their ancestral domains.\\r\\nThe status of the indigenous groups in the subjugated relationship can be characterized in most instances as an effectively marginalized, isolated or minimally participative one, in comparison to majority groups or the nation-state as a whole. Their ability to influence and participate in the external policies that may exercise jurisdiction over their traditional lands and practices is very frequently limited. This situation can persist even in the case where the indigenous population outnumbers that of the other inhabitants of the region or state; the defining notion here is one of separation from decision and regulatory processes that have some, at least titular, influence over aspects of their community and land rights.\\r\\nIn a ground-breaking 1997 decision involving the Ainu people of Japan, the Japanese courts recognised their claim in law, stating that \\"If one minority group lived in an area prior to being ruled over by a majority group and preserved its distinct ethnic culture even after being ruled over by the majority group, while another came to live in an area ruled over by a majority after consenting to the majority rule, it must be recognised that it is only natural that the distinct ethnic culture of the former group requires greater consideration.\\"[10]\\r\\nThe presence of external laws, claims and cultural mores either potentially or actually act to variously constrain the practices and observances of an indigenous society. These constraints can be observed even when the indigenous society is regulated largely by its own tradition and custom. They may be purposefully imposed, or arise as unintended consequence of trans-cultural interaction. They may have a measurable effect, even where countered by other external influences and actions deemed beneficial or that promote indigenous rights and interests.\\r\\nIn 1982 the United Nations Working Group on Indigenous Populations (WGIP) accepted as a preliminary definition a formulation put forward by Mr. Jos R. Martnez-Cobo, Special Rapporteur on Discrimination against Indigenous Populations. This definition has some limitations, because the definition applies mainly to pre-colonial populations, and would likely exclude other isolated or marginal societies.[11]\\r\\nIndigenous communities, peoples, and nations are those that, having a historical continuity with pre-invasion and pre-colonial societies that developed on their territories, consider themselves distinct from other sectors of the societies now prevailing in those territories, or parts of them. They form at present non-dominant sectors of society and are determined to preserve, develop, and transmit to future generations their ancestral territories, and their ethnic identity, as the basis of their continued existence as peoples, in accordance with their own cultural patterns, social institutions and legal systems.\\r\\nThe primary impetus in considering indigenous identity comes from the post-colonial movements and considering the historical impacts on populations by the European imperialism. The first paragraph of the Introduction of a report published in 2009 by the Secretariat of the Permanent Forum on Indigenous Issues published a report,[12] states\\r\\nFor centuries, since the time of their colonization, conquest or occupation, indigenous peoples have documented histories of resistance, interface or cooperation with states, thus demonstrating their conviction and determination to survive with their distinct sovereign identities. Indeed, indigenous peoples were often recognized as sovereign peoples by states, as witnessed by the hundreds of treaties concluded between indigenous peoples and the governments of the United States, Canada, New Zealand and others.[13]\\r\\nIn May 2016, the Fifteenth Session of the United Nations Permanent Forum on Indigenous Issues (UNPFII) affirmed that indigenous people (also termed aboriginal people, native people, or autochthonous people) are distinctive groups protected in international or national legislation as having a set of specific rights based on their linguistic and historical ties to a particular territory, prior to later settlement, development, and or occupation of a region.[14] The session affirms that since indigenous peoples are vulnerable to exploitation, marginalization, oppression, forced assimilation, and genocide by nation states formed from colonizing populations or by politically dominant, different ethnic groups, special protection of individuals and communities maintaining ways of life indigenous to their regions, are entitled to special protection.\\r\\nGreek sources of the Classical period acknowledge the prior existence of indigenous people(s), whom they referred to as \\"Pelasgians\\". These peoples inhabited lands surrounding the Aegean Sea before the subsequent migrations of the Hellenic ancestors claimed by these authors. The disposition and precise identity of this former group is elusive, and sources such as Homer, Hesiod and Herodotus give varying, partially mythological accounts. However, it is clear that cultures existed whose indigenous characteristics were distinguished by the subsequent Hellenic cultures (and distinct from non-Greek speaking \\"foreigners\\", termed \\"barbarians\\" by the historical Greeks).\\r\\nGreco-Roman society flourished between 250?BC and 480?AD and commanded successive waves of conquests that gripped more than half of the globe. But because already existent populations within other parts of Europe at the time of classical antiquity had more in common culturally speaking with the Greco-Roman world, the intricacies involved in expansion across the European frontier were not so contentious relative to indigenous issues.[15]\\r\\nBut when it came to expansion in other parts of the world, namely Asia, Africa, and the Middle East, then totally new cultural dynamics had entered into the equation, so to speak, and one sees here of what was to take the Americas, South East Asia, and the Pacific by storm a few hundred years later. The idea that peoples who possessed cultural customs and racial appearances strikingly different from those of the colonizing power is no new idea borne out of the Medieval period or the Enlightenment.\\r\\nThe rapid and extensive spread of the various European powers from the early 15th century onwards had a profound impact upon many of the indigenous cultures with whom they came into contact. The exploratory and colonial ventures in the Americas, Africa, Asia and the Pacific often resulted in territorial and cultural conflict, and the intentional or unintentional displacement and devastation of the indigenous populations.\\r\\nThe Canary Islands had an indigenous population called the Guanches whose origin is still the subject of discussion among historians and linguists.[16]\\r\\nIndigenous societies range from those who have been significantly exposed to the colonizing or expansionary activities of other societies (such as the Maya peoples of Mexico and Central America) through to those who as yet remain in comparative isolation from any external influence (such as the Sentinelese and Jarawa of the Andaman Islands).\\r\\nPrecise estimates for the total population of the world's Indigenous peoples are very difficult to compile, given the difficulties in identification and the variances and inadequacies of available census data. The United Nations estimates that there are over 370 million indigenous people living in over 70 countries worldwide.[17] This would equate to just fewer than 6% of the total world population. This includes at least 5000 distinct peoples[18] in over 72 countries.\\r\\nContemporary distinct indigenous groups survive in populations ranging from only a few dozen to hundreds of thousands and more. Many indigenous populations have undergone a dramatic decline and even extinction, and remain threatened in many parts of the world. Some have also been assimilated by other populations or have undergone many other changes. In other cases, indigenous populations are undergoing a recovery or expansion in numbers.\\r\\nCertain indigenous societies survive even though they may no longer inhabit their \\"traditional\\" lands, owing to migration, relocation, forced resettlement or having been supplanted by other cultural groups. In many other respects, the transformation of culture of indigenous groups is ongoing, and includes permanent loss of language, loss of lands, encroachment on traditional territories, and disruption in traditional lifeways due to contamination and pollution of waters and lands.\\r\\nIndigenous populations are distributed in regions throughout the globe. The numbers, condition and experience of indigenous groups may vary widely within a given region. A comprehensive survey is further complicated by sometimes contentious membership and identification.\\r\\nIn the post-colonial period, the concept of specific indigenous peoples within the African continent has gained wider acceptance, although not without controversy. The highly diverse and numerous ethnic groups that comprise most modern, independent African states contain within them various peoples whose situation, cultures and pastoralist or hunter-gatherer lifestyles are generally marginalized and set apart from the dominant political and economic structures of the nation. Since the late 20th century these peoples have increasingly sought recognition of their rights as distinct indigenous peoples, in both national and international contexts.\\r\\nThough the vast majority of African peoples are indigenous in the sense that they originate from that continentin practice, identity as an indigenous people per the modern definition is more restrictive, and certainly not every African ethnic group claims identification under these terms. Groups and communities who do claim this recognition are those who, by a variety of historical and environmental circumstances, have been placed outside of the dominant state systems, and whose traditional practices and land claims often come into conflict with the objectives and policies implemented by governments, companies and surrounding dominant societies.\\r\\nGiven the extensive and complicated history of human migration within Africa, being the \\"first peoples in a land\\" is not a necessary precondition for acceptance as an indigenous people. Rather, indigenous identity relates more to a set of characteristics and practices than priority of arrival. For example, several populations of nomadic peoples such as the Tuareg of the Sahara and Sahel regions now inhabit areas where they arrived comparatively recently; their claim to indigenous status (endorsed by the African Commission on Human and Peoples' Rights) is based on their marginalization as nomadic peoples in states and territories dominated by sedentary agricultural peoples.\\r\\nIndigenous peoples of the American continent are broadly recognized as being those groups and their descendants who inhabited the region before the arrival of European colonizers and settlers (i.e., Pre-Columbian). Indigenous peoples who maintain, or seek to maintain, traditional ways of life are found from the high Arctic north to the southern extremities of Tierra del Fuego.\\r\\nThe impact of European colonization of the Americas on the indigenous communities has been in general quite severe, with many authorities estimating ranges of significant population decline primarily due to disease but also violence. The extent of this impact is the subject of much continuing debate. Several peoples shortly thereafter became extinct, or very nearly so.\\r\\nAll nations in North and South America have populations of indigenous peoples within their borders. In some countries (particularly Latin American), indigenous peoples form a sizable component of the overall national populationin Bolivia they account for an estimated 56ÿ70% of the total nation, and at least half of the population in Guatemala and the Andean and Amazonian nations of Peru. In English, indigenous peoples are collectively referred to by different names that vary by region and include such ethnonyms as Native Americans, Amerindians, and American Indians. In Spanish or Portuguese speaking countries one finds the use of terms such as pueblos indgenas, amerindios, povos nativos, povos indgenas, and in Peru, Comunidades Nativas (Native Communities), particularly among Amazonian societies like the Urarina[19] and Matss. In Chile there are indigenous tribes like the Mapuches in the Center-South and the Aymaras in the North, also the Rapa Nui indigenous to Easter Island are a Polynesian tribe.\\r\\nIn Brazil, the term ndio (Portuguese pronunciation:?[??d?i.u] or ??d?ju) is used by most of the population, the media, the indigenous peoples themselves and even the government (FUNAI is acronym for the Funda??o Nacional do ndio) (National Indio Foundation), although its Hispanic equivalent indio is widely not considered politically correct and falling into disuse.\\r\\nIndigenous peoples in Canada comprise the First Nations,[20] Inuit[21] and Mtis.[22] The descriptors \\"Indian\\" and \\"Eskimo\\" are falling into disuse in Canada.[23][24] There are currently over 600 recognized First Nations governments or bands encompassing 1,272,790 2006 peoples spread across Canada with distinctive Aboriginal cultures, languages, art, and music.[25][26][27] National Aboriginal Day recognises the cultures and contributions of Aboriginals to the history of Canada\\r\\nThe Inuit have achieved a degree of administrative autonomy with the creation in 1999 of the territories of Nunavik (in Northern Qubec), Nunatsiavut (in Northern Labrador) and Nunavut, which was until 1999 a part of the Northwest Territories. The self-ruling Danish territory of Greenland is also home to a majority population of indigenous Inuit (about 85%).\\r\\nIn the United States, the combined populations of Native Americans, Inuit and other indigenous designations totalled 2,786,652 (constituting about 1.5% of 2003 US census figures). Some 563 scheduled tribes are recognized at the federal level, and a number of others recognized at the state level.\\r\\nIn Mexico, approximately 6,000,000 (constituting about 6.7% of 2005 Mexican census figures) identify as Indgenas (Spanish for natives or indigenous peoples). In the southern states of Chiapas, Yucatn and Oaxaca they constitute 26.1%, 33.5% and 35.3%, respectively, of the population. In these states several conflicts and episodes of civil war have been conducted, in which the situation and participation of indigenous societies were notable factors (see for example EZLN).\\r\\nThe Amerindians make up 0.4% of all Brazilian population, or about 700,000 people.[28] Indigenous peoples are found in the entire territory of Brazil, although the majority of them live in Indian reservations in the North and Center-Western part of the country. On 18 January 2007, FUNAI reported that it had confirmed the presence of 67 different uncontacted tribes in Brazil, up from 40 in 2005.

Their homeland is primarily occupied by the Kurdish autonomous region.\\r\\nThe indigenous people of modern Eastern Turkey, parts of the South Caucasus and much of Azerbaijan (Armenian Highlands) are the Armenians. They have a history in the region dating back to at least 2,450 BCE with the story of Hayk told by Movses Khorenatsi, however much like the Assyrians with whom they share several similarities including the Armenian Genocide and Assyrian Genocide, along with the two peoples becoming victims and minorities within their own land.[citation needed]\\r\\nThe most substantial populations are in India, which constitutionally recognizes a range of \\"Scheduled Castes and Tribes\\" within its borders. These various peoples (collectively referred to as Dalit, Adivasis, or tribal peoples) number about 68 million (1991 census figures, approximately 8% of the total national population).\\r\\nThere are also indigenous people residing in the hills of Northern, North-eastern and Southern India like the Ladakhi, Kinnaurs, Lepcha, Bhutia (of Sikkim), Naga (of Nagaland), indigenous Assamese communities, Munda people of Chota Nagpur Plateau, Mizo (of Mizoram), Kodava (of Kodagu), Toda, Kurumba, Kota (of the Nilgiris), Irulas and others.\\r\\nThe Jats are indigenous people of ancient India, and can be tracked down to 4th century BC.[32]\\r\\nThe Russians invaded Siberia and conquered the indigenous natives in the 17th-18th centuries.\\r\\nNivkh people are an ethnic group indigenous to Sakhalin, having a few speakers of the Nivkh language, but their fisher culture has been endangered due to the development of oil field of Sakhalin from 1990s.[33]\\r\\nAinu people are an ethnic group indigenous to Hokkaid, the Kuril Islands, and much of Sakhalin. As Japanese settlement expanded, the Ainu were pushed northward and fought against the Japanese in Shakushain's Revolt and Menashi-Kunashir Rebellion, until by the Meiji period they were confined by the government to a small area in Hokkaid, in a manner similar to the placing of Native Americans on reservations.[34]\\r\\nThe Dzungar Oirats are the natives of Dzungaria in Northern Xinjiang.\\r\\nThe Pamiris are the native people of Tashkurgan in Xinjiang.\\r\\nThe Ryukyuan people are indigenous to the Ryukyu Islands.\\r\\nThe languages of Taiwanese aborigines have significance in historical linguistics, since in all likelihood Taiwan was the place of origin of the entire Austronesian language family, which spread across Oceania.[35][36][37]\\r\\nThe Malay Singaporeans are the indigenous people of Singapore, inhabiting it since the Austronesian migration. They have established Kingdom of Singapura back in the 13th century. The name Singapore itself comes from the Malay word Singapura (Singa=Lion, Pura=City) which means the Lion City.\\r\\nThe Cham are the indigenous people of the former state of Champa which was conquered by Vietnam in the ChamÿVietnamese wars during Nam ti?n. The Cham in Vietnam are only recognized as a minority, and not as an indigenous people by the Vietnamese government despite being indigenous to the region.\\r\\nThe Degar (Montagnards) are the natives of the Central Highlands (Vietnam) and were conquered by the Vietnamese in the Nam ti?n.\\r\\nThe Khmer Krom are the native people of the Mekong Delta and Saigon which were acquired by Vietnam from Cambodian King Chey Chettha II in exchange for a Vietnamese princess.\\r\\nIn Indonesia, there are 50 to 70 million people who classify as indigenous peoples.[38] However, the Indonesian government does not recognize the existence of indigenous peoples, classifying every Native Indonesian ethnic group as \\"indigenous\\" despite the clear cultural distinctions of certain groups.[39] This problem is shared by many other countries in the ASEAN region.\\r\\nIn the Philippines, there are 135 ethno-linguistic groups, majority of which are considered as indigenous peoples by mainstream indigenous ethnic groups in the country. The indigenous people of Cordillera Administrative Region and Cagayan Valley in the Philippines are the Igorot people. The indigenous peoples of Mindanao are the Lumad peoples and the Moro (Tausug, Maguindanao Maranao and others) who also live in the Sulu archipelago. There are also others sets of indigenous peoples in Palawan, Mindoro, Visayas, and the rest central and south Luzon. The country has one of the largest indigenous peoples population in the world.\\r\\nIn Europe, present-day indigenous populations as recognized by the UN are relatively few, mainly confined to its north and far east. Nevertheless, the ethnic groups traditionally inhabiting most, if not all, European countries are considered to be indigenous to Europe. This includes the majority populations.\\r\\nNotable minority indigenous populations in Europe include the Basque people of northern Spain and southern France, the Sami people of northern Scandinavia, the Crimean Tatars of Crimea,[dubious ÿ discuss] the Nenets, Samoyedic and Komi peoples of northern Russia, and the Circassians of southern Russia and the North Caucasus.\\r\\nIn Australia the indigenous populations are the Aboriginal Australians, within which are many different nations and tribes, and the Torres Strait Islanders. These groups are often spoken of as Indigenous Australians.\\r\\nMany of the present-day Pacific Island nations in the Oceania region were originally populated by Polynesian, Melanesian and Micronesian peoples over the course of thousands of years. European colonial expansion in the Pacific brought many of these under non-indigenous administration. During the 20th century several of these former colonies gained independence and nation-states were formed under local control. However, various peoples have put forward claims for Indigenous recognition where their islands are still under external administration; examples include the Chamorros of Guam and the Northern Marianas, and the Marshallese of the Marshall Islands.\\r\\nThe remains of at least 25 miniature humans, who lived between 1,000 and 3,000 years ago, were recently found on the islands of Palau in Micronesia.[40]\\r\\nIn most parts of Oceania, indigenous peoples outnumber the descendants of colonists. Exceptions include New Zealand and Hawaii. According to the 2013 census, New Zealand Mori make up 14.9% of the population of New Zealand, with less than half (46.5%) of all Mori residents identifying solely as Mori. The Mori are indigenous to Polynesia and settled New Zealand relatively recently, the migrations were thought to have occurred in the 13th century CE. In New Zealand pre-contact Mori tribes were not a single people, thus the more recent grouping into tribal (iwi) arrangements has become a more formal arrangement in more recent times. Many Mori tribal leaders signed a treaty with the British, the Treaty of Waitangi, which formed the modern geo-political entity that is New Zealand.\\r\\nThe independent state of Papua New Guinea (PNG) has a majority population of indigenous societies, with more than 700 different tribal groups recognized out of a total population of 8 million.[41] The PNG Constitution and other Acts identify traditional or custom-based practices and land tenure, and explicitly set out to promote the viability of these traditional societies within the modern state. However, conflicts and disputes concerning land use and resource rights continue between indigenous groups, the government, and corporate entities.\\r\\nIndigenous peoples confront a diverse range of concerns associated with their status and interaction with other cultural groups, as well as changes in their inhabited environment. Some challenges are specific to particular groups; however, other challenges are commonly experienced.[42] These issues include cultural and linguistic preservation, land rights, ownership and exploitation of natural resources, political determination and autonomy, environmental degradation and incursion, poverty, health, and discrimination.\\r\\nThe interaction between indigenous and non-indigenous societies throughout history has been complex, ranging from outright conflict and subjugation to some degree of mutual benefit and cultural transfer. A particular aspect of anthropological study involves investigation into the ramifications of what is termed first contact, the study of what occurs when two cultures first encounter one another. The situation can be further confused when there is a complicated or contested history of migration and population of a given region, which can give rise to disputes about primacy and ownership of the land and resources.\\r\\nWherever indigenous cultural identity is asserted, common societal issues and concerns arise from the indigenous status. These concerns are often not unique to indigenous groups. Despite the diversity of Indigenous peoples, it may be noted that they share common problems and issues in dealing with the prevailing, or invading, society. They are generally concerned that the cultures of Indigenous peoples are being lost and that indigenous peoples suffer both discrimination and pressure to assimilate into their surrounding societies. This is borne out by the fact that the lands and cultures of nearly all of the peoples listed at the end of this article are under threat. Notable exceptions are the Sakha and Komi peoples (two of the northern indigenous peoples of Russia), who now control their own autonomous republics within the Russian state, and the Canadian Inuit, who form a majority of the territory of Nunavut (created in 1999). In Australia, a landmark case, Mabo v Queensland (No 2),[43] saw the High Court of Australia reject the idea of terra nullius. This rejection ended up recognizing that there was a pre-existing system of law practiced by the Meriam people.\\r\\nIt is also sometimes argued that it is important for the human species as a whole to preserve a wide range of cultural diversity as possible, and that the protection of indigenous cultures is vital to this enterprise.\\r\\nThe Bangladesh Government has stated that there are \\"no Indigenous Peoples in Bangladesh\\".[44] This has angered the Indigenous Peoples of Chittagong Hill Tracts, Bangladesh, collectively known as the Jumma.[45] Experts have protested against this move of the Bangladesh Government and have questioned the Government's definition of the term \\"Indigenous Peoples\\".[46][47] This move by the Bangladesh Government is seen by the Indigenous Peoples of Bangladesh as another step by the Government to further erode their already limited rights.[48]\\r\\nBoth Hindu and Chams have experienced religious and ethnic persecution and restrictions on their faith under the current Vietnamese government, with the Vietnamese state confisticating Cham property and forbidding Cham from observing their religious beliefs. Hindu temples were turned into tourist sites against the wishes of the Cham Hindus. In 2010 and 2013 several incidents occurred in Thnh Tn and Ph??c Nh?n villages where Cham were murdered by Vietnamese. In 2012, Vietnamese police in Chau Giang village stormed into a Cham Mosque, stole the electric generator, and also raped Cham girls.[49] Cham in the Mekong Delta have also been economically marginalised, with ethnic Vietnamese settling on land previously owned by Cham people with state support.[50]\\r\\nThe Indonesian government has outright denied the existence of indigenous peoples within the countries' borders. In 2012, Indonesia stated that The Government of Indonesia supports the promotion and protection of indigenous people worldwide Indonesia, however, does not recognize the application of the indigenous peoples concept in the country.[51] Along with the brutal treatment of the country's Papuan people (a conservative estimate places the violent deaths at 100,000 people in West New Guinea since Indonesian occupation in 1963, see Papua Conflict) has led to Survival International condemning Indonesia for treating its indigenous peoples as the worst in the world.[51]\\r\\nThe French, the Communist North Vietnamese, and the anti-Communist South Vietnamese all exploited and persecuted the Montagnards. North Vietnamese Communists forcibly recruited \\"comfort girls\\" from the indigenous Montagnard peoples of the Central Highlands and murdered those who didn't comply, inspired by Japan's use of comfort women.[52] The Vietnamese viewed and dealt with the indigenous Montagnards in the CIDG from the Central Highlands as \\"savages\\" and this caused a Montagnard uprising against the Vietnamese.[53] The Vietnamese were originally centered around the Red River Delta but engaged in conquest and seized new lands such as Champa, the Mekong Delta (from Cambodia) and the Central Highlands during Nam Tien, while the Vietnamese received strong Chinese influence in their culture and civilization and were Sinicized, and the Cambodians and Laotians were Indianized, the Montagnards in the Central Highlands maintained their own native culture without adopting external culture and were the true indigenous natives of the region, and to hinder encroachment on the Central Highlands by Vietnamese nationalists, the term Pays Montagnard du Sud-Indochinois PMSI emerged for the Central Highlands along with the natives being addressed by the name Montagnard.[54] The tremendous scale of Vietnamese Kinh colonists flooding into the Central Highlands has significantly altered the demographics of the region.[55] The anti-ethnic minority discriminatory policies by the Vietnamese, environmental degradation, deprivation of lands from the natives, and settlement of native lands by a massive amount of Vietnamese settlers led to massive protests and demonstrations by the Central Highland's indigenous native ethnic minorities against the Vietnamese in JanuaryÿFebruary 2001 and this event gave a tremendous blow to the claim often published by the Vietnamese government that in Vietnam There has been no ethnic confrontation, no religious war, no ethnic conflict. And no elimination of one culture by another.[56]\\r\\nIn December 1993, the United Nations General Assembly proclaimed the International Decade of the World's Indigenous People, and requested UN specialized agencies to consider with governments and indigenous people how they can contribute to the success of the Decade of Indigenous People, commencing in December 1994. As a consequence, the World Health Organization, at its Forty-seventh World Health Assembly, established a core advisory group of indigenous representatives with special knowledge of the health needs and resources of their communities, thus beginning a long-term commitment to the issue of the health of indigenous peoples.[57]\\r\\nThe WHO notes that \\"Statistical data on the health status of indigenous peoples is scarce. This is especially notable for indigenous peoples in Africa, Asia and eastern Europe\\", but snapshots from various countries, where such statistics are available, show that indigenous people are in worse health than the general population, in advanced and developing countries alike: higher incidence of diabetes in some regions of Australia;[58] higher prevalence of poor sanitation and lack of safe water among Twa households in Rwanda;[59] a greater prevalence of childbirths without prenatal care among ethnic minorities in Vietnam;[60] suicide rates among Inuit youth in Canada are eleven times higher than the national average;[61] infant mortality rates are higher for indigenous peoples everywhere.[62]\\r\\nIndigenous peoples have been denoted primitives, savages[63] or uncivilized. These terms were common during the heights of European colonial expansion, but still continue in certain societies in modern times .[64]\\r\\nDuring the 17th century, indigenous peoples were commonly labeled \\"uncivilized\\". Some philosophers such as Thomas Hobbes considered indigenous people to be merely 'savages', while others are purported to have considered them to be \\"noble savages\\". Those who were close to the Hobbesian view tended to believe themselves to have a duty to \\"civilize\\" and \\"modernize\\" the indigenous. Although anthropologists, especially from Europe, used to apply these terms to all tribal cultures, it has fallen into disfavor as demeaning and is, according to many anthropologists, not only inaccurate, but dangerous.\\r\\nSurvival International runs a campaign to stamp out media portrayal of indigenous peoples as 'primitive' or 'savages'.[65] Friends of Peoples Close to Nature considers not only that indigenous culture should be respected as not being inferior, but also sees their way of life as a lesson of sustainability and a part of the struggle within the \\"corrupted\\" western world, from which the threat stems.[66]\\r\\nAfter World War I, however, many Europeans came to doubt the morality of the means used to \\"civilize\\" peoples. At the same time, the anti-colonial movement, and advocates of indigenous peoples, argued that words such as \\"civilized\\" and \\"savage\\" were products and tools of colonialism, and argued that colonialism itself was savagely destructive. In the mid 20th century, European attitudes began to shift to the view that indigenous and tribal peoples should have the right to decide for themselves what should happen to their ancient cultures and ancestral lands.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfrica\\r\\n\\r\\nAsia\\r\\n\\r\\nEurope\\r\\n\\r\\nNorth America\\r\\n\\r\\nOceania\\r\\n\\r\\nSouth America","input":"What percentage of the world's population is indigenous?"},{"output":"25 to 30 minutes","context":"The Grand Haven Musical Fountain is a synchronized display of water and lights in Grand Haven, Michigan located on Dewey Hill on the north shore of the Grand River, not far from the Grand's mouth at Lake Michigan and Grand Haven State Park.

Shows begin at dusk and run 25 to 30 minutes\\r\\n\\r\\nMany themes are used in the fountain's performances.  The fountain's narration takes on personas ranging from a 12-year-old girl to a grown man.  A Patriotic themed program runs each July 4 along with fireworks and, in August, a program saluting the United States Coast Guard runs yearly during the Coast Guard Festival; in 2011 a special introduction and closing song were introduced honoring the men and women of the United States Coast Guard.  The special introduction and closing featured music performed by the USCG Band.  Fountain viewing, not including July 4 or the festival, is estimated at around 10,000 annually.\\r\\n\\r\\nDesigned by a local engineer, William Morris Booth II (who is also the patent holder), and built in 1962 by volunteers at an estimated cost of $250,000, this fountain was based on a Przystawic musical fountain show seen in Germany and was the largest musical fountain in the world when it was built. The display comprises a small number of water formations grouped in odd and even segments, with the same formations on each. Augmented by curtains of water at the back and front, a large fanlike array called the Peacock, and three fire hose nozzles - one placed vertically in the center, and the others aimed at an angle from each end - the show produces a simple Dancing Waters style display. Colored lights are arrayed along the front of the fountain in individually controllable groups in red, blue, amber and white, and the back curtain and Peacock sprays have their own lights - green and yellow for the back curtain, and two sets each red, blue and amber for the Peacock. In addition, nozzles called \\"sweeps\\" provide the moving effects, swaying side-to-side. A patented drive mechanism allows each pair of sweeps to follow or oppose each other in direction of movement, to move along long or short paths, and to move at any of three speeds, allowing the moving water to follow nearly any kind of music. The original show used punched paper cards, though computers control the new system. The nozzles and pumps have never been changed, only cleaned and cared-for; and shows must still be programmed by hand. \\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1980 the fountain switched from punch tape to an Allen-Bradly PLC allowing for better control over the valves and lighting. The new control system also introduced using a Radio Shack TRS 80 Model 4 to program shows. Programmers were required to type special commands into a text editor, compile the show script, and then record it out through a 300 baud modem to a four track real-to-real tape unit.

This process took on average took over 200 hours to produce a single 20 minute performance. \\r\\n\\r\\nIn September 2006, a new PC based programming and playback system was introduced. The Grand Haven Musical Fountain Animated Choreographer was released to the public to encourage the development of new shows and allowed programmers to visually choreograph the fountain. In addition, the new playback system allowed for more complex water and lighting effects by eliminating the need for tape playback by directly controlling the Allen-Bradly PLC.

The Mother is played by Cristin Milioti.\\r\\nThe story of how Ted met The Mother is the framing device behind the series; many facts about her are revealed throughout the series, including the fact that Ted once unwittingly owned her umbrella before accidentally leaving it behind in her apartment. Ted and The Mother meet at the Farhampton train station following Barney Stinson and Robin Scherbatsky's wedding; this scene is shown in \\"Last Forever\\", the series finale. The Mother's death from an unspecified terminal illness in 2024, also revealed in the series finale, received a mixed reaction from fans.\\r\\nAn alternate ending was released in the ninth season DVD. In the alternate ending, Tracy Mosby is still living when Ted is telling the story in 2030.[1][2] In the video, future Ted is heard saying, \\"...When I think how lucky I am to wake up next to your mom every morning, I can't help but be amazed how easy it all really was...\\", indirectly stating that The Mother is alive. The video ends right after the train passes at Farhampton station and credits start rolling, implying that Ted never went back to Robin as he lived a successful married life with Tracy Mosby.[3]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nDuring its first eight seasons, the successful sitcom How I Met Your Mother often hinted at the unseen character of The Mother. Well-known actresses often made guest appearances on the show. Many fans expected that another would play one of the most-wanted roles in Hollywood, but creators Carter Bays and Craig Thomas wanted an unknown. Using Anne Hathaway and Amy Adams as examples, Thomas said that \\"We didnt want it to be a big famous star because we didnt want the wider audience to have associations with whatever actress this would be ... The whole idea is that Teds never seen this woman before, so it better feel that way to the audience\\", similar to how Cobie Smulders being cast as Robin Scherbatsky had \\"kept the show alive\\" when it began. Bays and Thomas also did not want a large casting call.[4][5]\\r\\nThey chose Cristin Milioti after seeing her on 30 Rock and Once; her musical ability was also helpful, as The Mother had been described as a band member. After competing for the role against at least two others, Milioti filmed her first scenefor the last episode of season 8having never watched How I Met Your Mother; she recalled, \\"I had ignorance on my side. So I didnt know what it meant.\\" Milioti learned of the character's importance only after binge watching the show during the summer.[5][6]\\r\\nThe Mother was born on September 19, 1984.[note 1]\\r\\nThe Mother, joined by her roommate Kelly awaits the arrival of her boyfriend Max only to receive a call informing her of his death. After the funeral service, she returns to the apartment to open Max's last gift to her  a ukulele. The Mother spends the next few years grieving the passing of the man she believes was her one true love.[7]\\r\\nIn \\"Wait for It\\", it is revealed that the short story of how they met involved her yellow umbrella. In \\"No Tomorrow\\", Ted finds the umbrella at a club and takes it home after attending a St. Patrick's Day party which she also attended, as it had been two and a half years since the death of Max, her late boyfriend. She is still grieving, but her roommate Kelly encourages her to go out and date again, bringing her to the same bar where Ted and Barney are celebrating. The two women run into Mitch, her old orchestra instructor; The Mother offers to give Mitch her cello for his work at a school and they head to her apartment. After they start talking, Mitch encourages her to pursue her dreams. The Mother expresses her desire to end poverty by taking up economics in college.[7]\\r\\nOn his first day of teaching as Professor Mosby, as seen in the season 4 finale \\"The Leap\\", he is seen in front of the classroom of students, one of which Future Ted says is the titular mother. But in the first episode of season 5, \\"Definitions\\", it is revealed that he was actually in the wrong classroom  Economics instead of Architecture. At the same time in \\"How Your Mother Met Me\\", the Mother sits her first session in Economics 305 and meets another graduate student named Cindy (Rachel Bilson), whom she offers to move in with her as her roommate. They see Ted enter the room, but when he announces the subject, The Mother thinks she is in the wrong room and runs off. She heads back to the room after seeing Ted scramble to his actual classroom.\\r\\nLater, in \\"Girls Versus Suits\\", Ted dates Cindy, not knowing that her roommate is his future wife. Throughout the episode, Ted notes that Cindy had spent most of their first date talking jealously about her roommate. When in Cindy and the mother's apartment he picks up many of The Mother's belongings, attempting to show how compatible he and Cindy are (thinking the items are Cindy's) and glimpses the mother's foot as she disappears into her room after taking a shower. Ted finds out at this time that she plays bass guitar in a band. Ted forgets to take the yellow umbrella with him when he goes out and Future Ted mentions, \\"this is how your mother got her yellow umbrella back.\\" In \\"How Your Mother Met Me\\", it is revealed that, after Ted left the apartment, the Mother had discovered the umbrella and, upon going to question Cindy, finds her in a state. As she tried to console her, Cindy said that she was a much better match for Ted, and began to lovingly list all of the reasons that Ted would find the mother attractive, before spontaneously kissing her, revealing that her jealousy towards her roommate was actually a crush. While this incident made Cindy realise that she is a lesbian, it also made the Mother decide to go back into dating, as the kiss was her first in a long time.\\r\\nSome time after this, a man named Darren approaches The Mother and is welcomed into her band named Superfreakonomics. Darren gradually takes over the band.[7]\\r\\nIn the season 6 opener \\"Big Days\\" it is revealed Ted meets his future wife \\"the day of\\" the wedding at which he is the best man. In the episode \\"False Positive\\" Robin asks Ted to be her future best man, should she ever get married. In the episode \\"Challenge Accepted\\", it is revealed that Ted meets the mother of his children the day of Barney's wedding. In the last episode of season 7, \\"The Magician's Code\\" it is shown that Barney will marry Robin, and Ted will meet the mother \\"the day of\\" their wedding.

Louis asks her to give him a call if she changes her mind and they begin dating not long after.\\r\\nThe Mother meets all of Ted's best friends (Barney, Lily, Marshall and Robin) before she meets him. The Mother is responsible for convincing Barney to pursue Robin, as revealed through a flashback in \\"Platonish\\". In \\"The Locket\\", Tracy meets Lily on a train journey.\\r\\nIn \\"Bass Player Wanted\\", the Mother picks up a hitchhiking Marshall, carrying his son Marvin, on her way to Farhampton Inn. On their way, it is revealed that the Mother is a bass player in the band, that is scheduled to play at the wedding reception. But the band's leader, Darren, forced her to quit. The Mother ultimately decides to confront Darren and retake the band. She ends up alone at the bar, and while practicing a speech to give Darren, Darren walks up to her furious the groom's best man punched him for \\"no reason.\\" Amused by this, the Mother laughs, and Darren quits the band in anger.\\r\\nIn \\"How Your Mother Met Me\\", it is shown that after this incident, the Mother returns to Louis' summer cottage not far from the Farhampton Inn where she has been staying for the duration of the wedding weekend. As she walks in the door, Louis proposes to her, but she goes outside to think about it for a few minutes. She declines Louis' proposal and leaves his cottage, going to check in at Farhampton Inn. On her room's balcony, she plays the ukulele and sings \\"La Vie en Rose\\". Ted hears her singing from his room next door.\\r\\nIn \\"Gary Blauman\\", Ted and the Mother are on their first date. Ted picks her up at her New York City apartment and they proceed to walk to a Scottish-Mexican fusion restaurant for dinner. On the way there, Ted is telling her a story when they nearly have a run-in with Louis. She says that she is in the \\"weirdest place on earth\\" right now and that it is too soon for her to be dating. Ted walks her back to her apartment. They say goodnight and Ted begins to walk away. The Mother then stops him and asks him to finish the story he was telling her. When the story is over, they say goodnight again. The Mother takes a step towards Ted and they kiss for the first time, before deciding to carry on their date.\\r\\nIn a flashforward in \\"The Lighthouse\\", Ted proposes to the Mother at the top of the lighthouse near Farhampton Inn. She immediately accepts. In another flashfoward in \\"Unpause\\", the Mother is revealed to be pregnant with their second child, Luke, in the year 2017. She goes into labor while she and Ted are staying at Farhampton.\\r\\nThe Mother's real name is not revealed until the series finale, \\"Last Forever\\". When Ted meets her at the Farhampton train station, she reveals that her name is Tracy McConnell. In the season 1 episode \\"Belly Full of Turkey\\", Ted meets a stripper named Tracy and says \\"...that, kids, is the true story of how I met your mother\\". The children react in surprise and appear to believe Ted before he admits he is joking,[9] which led some fans to correctly guess that The Mother's name is Tracy.[10]\\r\\nIn the series finale, it is revealed that six years prior to Ted telling the story to his children, Tracy died in 2024 from an undisclosed illness. In the finale the characters do not directly state that the mother is dead. Ted says that she \\"became sick\\" and his children saying that she has been \\"gone\\" for six years. Many fans expressed considerable disappointment to The Mother's death.[11] Milioti cried when she learned her character was supposed to die, but came to accept the ending was what the writers had planned from the beginning.[12] Bill Kuchman from Popculturology said that The Mother was \\"an amazing character\\"[9] and that \\"over the course of this final season HIMYM made us care about Tracy.[13] Kuchman said that \\"asking fans to drop all of that with a simple line about The Mother getting sick and passing away was a very difficult request\\", that the finale \\"advanced too quickly\\" and that \\"HIMYM was a victim of its own success on this issue\\".[9]\\r\\nA petition was started, aiming to rewrite and reshoot the finale. The petition has over 20,000 signatures and considerable online news coverage.[14][15] On April 5, 2014, Carter Bays announced on Twitter that an alternate ending would be included on the Season 9 DVD. No new material was shot for this scene.[16][17] In the alternate ending, the mother is still living when Ted is telling the story in 2030.[18][1]","input":"How i met your mother yellow umbrella first appearance?"},{"output":"May 2020","context":"Fine Guidance Sensor\\r\\nElements:\\r\\n\\r\\nJames Webb Space Telescope insignia\\r\\nThe James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) is a space telescope developed in collaboration between NASA, the European Space Agency and the Canadian Space Agency.[6] In contrast to the Hubble Space Telescope, which has a 2.4-meter (7.9?ft) mirror, the JWST primary mirror is composed of 18 hexagonal mirror segments for a combined mirror size of 6.5-meter-diameter (21?ft 4?in).

Webb, who was the second administrator of NASA and played an integral role in the Apollo program.[9] NASA has described JWST as the scientific successor to the Hubble Space Telescope, but not a replacement, because the capabilities are not identical.[10] The JWST idea arose from a desire in the late 1980s and 1990s to see high redshift objects, older and farther away than previous instruments could assess.[11] The result was a decision to extend the life of Hubble until the \\"Next Generation Space Telescope\\" (as it was then called) could go online and to investigate designs that would enable it to obtain images deeper into the infrared than Hubble, and beyond the capabilities of earlier space observatories such as the Infrared Space Observatory and the Spitzer Space Telescope.[11]\\r\\nIn December 2016, NASA announced that the JWST had passed major milestones, including completion of its primary mirror and integration of science instruments with the payload module, and had begun undergoing acoustic and extreme vibration testing to simulate launch conditions.[12][13] In March 2018, NASA delayed the JWST's launch an additional year after the telescope's sunshield ripped during a practice deployment and the sunshield's cables did not sufficiently tighten.[14] The JWST is currently scheduled to launch in May 2020.[3][4][15]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe JWST originated in 1996 as the Next Generation Space Telescope (NGST). In 2002 it was renamed after NASA's second administrator (1961ÿ1968) James E. Webb (1906ÿ1992), noted for playing a key role in the Apollo program and establishing scientific research as a core NASA activity.[16] The JWST is a project of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, the United States space agency, with international collaboration from the European Space Agency and the Canadian Space Agency.\\r\\nThe telescope has an expected mass about half of Hubble Space Telescope's, but its primary mirror (a 6.5 meter diameter gold-coated beryllium reflector) will have a collecting area about five times as large (25?m2 or 270?sq?ft vs. 4.5?m2 or 48?sq?ft). The JWST is oriented toward near-infrared astronomy, but can also see orange and red visible light, as well as the mid-infrared region, depending on the instrument. The design emphasizes the near to mid-infrared for three main reasons: High-redshift objects have their visible emissions shifted into the infrared, cold objects such as debris disks and planets emit most strongly in the infrared, and this band is difficult to study from the ground or by existing space telescopes such as Hubble. Ground based telescopes must look through the atmosphere, which is opaque in many infrared bands (see figure of atmospheric transmission). Even where the atmosphere is transparent, many of the target chemical compounds, such as water, carbon dioxide, and methane, also exist in the Earth's atmosphere, vastly complicating analysis. Existing space telescopes such as Hubble cannot study these bands since their mirrors are not cool enough (the Hubble mirror is maintained at about 15 degrees C) and hence the telescope itself radiates strongly in the IR bands.\\r\\nThe JWST will operate near the Earth-Sun L2 (Lagrange) point, approximately 930,000?mi (1,500,000?km) beyond Earth's orbit. By way of comparison, Hubble orbits 340 miles (550?km) above Earth's surface, and the Moon is roughly 250,000 miles (400,000?km) from Earth. This distance makes post-launch repair or upgrade of the JWST hardware virtually impossible. Objects near this point can orbit the Sun in synchrony with the Earth, allowing the telescope to remain at a roughly constant distance[17] and use a single sunshield to block heat and light from the Sun and Earth. This will keep the temperature of the spacecraft below 50?K (?220?C; ?370?F), necessary for infrared observations.[18][19] The prime contractor is Northrop Grumman.[20]\\r\\n3/4 view of the top\\r\\nBottom (sun-facing side)\\r\\nTo make observations in the infrared spectrum, the JWST must be kept very cold (under 50?K (?220?C; ?370?F)), otherwise infrared radiation from the telescope itself would overwhelm its instruments. Therefore, it uses a large sunshield to block light and heat from the Sun, Earth, and Moon, and its position near the EarthÿSun L2 point keeps all three bodies on the same side of the spacecraft at all times.[21] Its halo orbit around L2 avoids the shadow of the Earth and Moon, maintaining a constant environment for the sunshield and solar arrays.[17] The sunshield is made of polyimide film, and has membranes coated with aluminum on one side and silicon on the other.\\r\\nThe sunshield is designed to be folded twelve times so it will fit within the Ariane 5 rocket's 4.57 m (5 yards) G 16.19 m (17.7 yards) shroud. Once deployed at the L2 point, it will unfold to 21.197 m (23.18 yards) G 14.162 m (15.55 yards). The sunshield was hand-assembled at Man Tech (NeXolve) in Huntsville, Alabama before it was delivered to Northrop Grumman in Redondo Beach, California, USA for testing.[22]\\r\\nJWST's primary mirror is a 6.5-meter-diameter gold-coated beryllium reflector with a collecting area of 25?m2. This is too large for existing launch vehicles, so the mirror is composed of 18 hexagonal segments, which will unfold after the telescope is launched. Image plane wavefront sensing through phase retrieval will be used to position the mirror segments in the correct location using very precise micro-motors. Subsequent to this initial configuration they will only need occasional updates every few days to retain optimal focus.[23] This is unlike terrestrial telescopes like the Keck which continually adjust their mirror segments using active optics to overcome the effects of gravitational and wind loading, and is made possible because of the lack of environmental disturbances of a telescope in space.\\r\\nJWST's optical design is a three-mirror anastigmat,[24] which makes use of curved secondary and tertiary mirrors to deliver images that are free of optical aberrations over a wide field. In addition, there is a fast steering mirror, which can adjust its position many times per second to provide image stabilization.\\r\\nBall Aerospace & Technologies Corp. is the principal optical subcontractor for the JWST project, led by prime contractor Northrop Grumman Aerospace Systems, under a contract from the NASA Goddard Space Flight Center, in Greenbelt, Maryland.[2][25] Eighteen primary mirror segments, secondary, tertiary and fine steering mirrors, plus flight spares have been fabricated and polished by Ball Aerospace based on beryllium segment blanks manufactured by several companies including Axsys, Brush Wellman, and Tinsley Laboratories.\\r\\nThe final segment of the primary mirror was installed on February 3, 2016,[26] and the secondary mirror was installed on March 3, 2016.[27]\\r\\nThe Integrated Science Instrument Module (ISIM) is a framework that provides electrical power, computing resources, cooling capability as well as structural stability to the Webb telescope. It is made with bonded graphite-epoxy composite attached to the underside of Webb's telescope structure. The ISIM holds the four science instruments and a guide camera.[28]\\r\\nNIRCam and MIRI feature starlight-blocking coronagraphs for observation of faint targets such as extrasolar planets and circumstellar disks very close to bright stars.[34]\\r\\nThe infrared detectors for the NIRCam, NIRSpec, FGS, and NIRISS modules are being provided by Teledyne Imaging Sensors (formerly Rockwell Scientific Company). The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) Integrated Science Instrument Module (ISIM) and Command and Data Handling (ICDH) engineering team uses SpaceWire to send data between the science instruments and the data-handling equipment.[36]\\r\\nThe Spacecraft Bus is the primary support component of the James Webb Space Telescope, that hosts a multitude of computing, communication, propulsion, and structural parts, bringing the different parts of the telescope together.[37] Along with the Sunshield, it forms the Spacecraft Element of the space telescope.[38] The other two major elements of the JWST are the Integrated Science Instrument Module (ISIM) and the Optical Telescope Element (OTE).[39] Region 3 of ISIM is also inside the Spacecraft Bus; region 3 includes ISIM Command and Data Handling subsystem and the MIRI cryocooler.[39]\\r\\nThe Spacecraft Bus is connected to Optical Telescope Element via the Deployable Tower Assembly, which also connects to the sunshield.[37]\\r\\nThe structure of the Spacecraft Bus must support the 6.5 ton space telescope, while it itself weighs 350?kg (about 772?lb).[7] It is made primarily of graphite composite material.[7] It was assembled in California by 2015, and after that it had to be integrated with the rest of the space telescope leading up to its planned 2020 launch. The bus can provide pointing of one-arcsecond and isolates vibration down to two (2) milliarcseconds.[40]\\r\\nThe Spacecraft Bus is on the Sun-facing \\"warm\\" side and operates at a temperature of about 300?K.[38] Everything on the Sun facing side must be able to handle the thermal conditions of JWST's halo orbit, which has one side in continuous sunlight and the other in shade by the spacecraft sunshield.[38]\\r\\nAnother important aspect of the Spacecraft Bus is the central computing, memory storage, and communications equipment.[37] The processor and software direct data to and from the instruments, to the solid-state memory core, and to the radio system which can send data back to Earth and receive commands.[37] The computer also controls the pointing and moment of the spacecraft, taking in sensor data from the gyroscopes and star tracker, and sending the necessary commands to the reaction wheels or thrusters depending.[37]\\r\\nLaunch is planned May 2020[41] on an Ariane 5 rocket. The observatory attaches to the Ariane 5 rocket via a launch vehicle adapter ring which could be used by a future spacecraft to grapple the observatory to attempt to fix gross deployment problems. However, the telescope itself is not serviceable, and astronauts would not be able to perform tasks such as swapping instruments, as with the Hubble Telescope.[2] Its nominal mission time is five years, with a goal of ten years.[42] JWST needs to use propellant to maintain its halo orbit around L2, which provides an upper limit to its designed lifetime, and it is being designed to carry enough for ten years.[43] The planned five year science mission begins after a 6-month commissioning phase.[43] An L2 orbit is only meta-stable so it requires orbital station-keeping or an object will drift away from this orbital configuration.[44]\\r\\nThe desire for a large infrared space telescope traces back decades; in the United States the Shuttle Infrared Telescope Facility was planned while the Space Shuttle was in development and the potential for infrared astronomy was acknowledged at that time.[46] Compared to ground telescopes, space observatories were free from atmospheric absorption of infrared light; this would be a whole \\"new sky\\" for astronomers.[46]\\r\\nThe tenuous atmosphere above the 400?km nominal flight altitude has no measurable absorption so that detectors operating at all wavelengths from 5?m to 1000?m can achieve high radiometric sensitivity.\\r\\nHowever, infrared telescopes have an Achilles heelthey need to stay extremely cold, and the longer the wavelength of infrared, the colder they need to be.[47] If not, the background heat of the device itself overwhelms the detectors, making it effectively blind.[47] This can be overcome by careful spacecraft design, in particular by placing the telescope in dewar with an extremely cold substance, such as liquid helium.[47] This has meant most infrared telescopes have a lifespan limited by their coolant, as short as a few months, maybe a few years at most.[47] It has been possible to maintain a temperature low enough through the design of the spacecraft to enable near-infrared observations without a supply of coolant, such as the extended missions of Spitzer or NEOWISE. Another example is Hubble's NICMOS instrument, which started out using a block of nitrogen ice that depleted after a couple of years, but was then converted to a cryocooler that worked continuously. The James Webb Space Telescope is designed to cool itself without a dewar, using a combination of sunshield and radiators with the mid-infrared instrument using an additional cryocooler.[48]\\r\\nThe telescope's delays and cost increases can be compared to the Hubble Space Telescope.[49] When Hubble formally started in 1972, it then had an estimated development cost of $300 million (or about $1 billion in 2006 constant dollars),[49] but by the time it was sent into orbit in 1990, the cost was about four times that.[49] In addition new instruments and servicing missions increased the cost to at least $9 billion by 2006.[49]\\r\\nIn contrast to other proposed observatories, most of which have already been canceled or put on hold, including Terrestrial Planet Finder (2011), Space Interferometry Mission (2010), International X-ray Observatory (2011), MAXIM (Microarcsecond X-ray Imaging Mission), SAFIR (Single Aperture Far-Infrared Observatory), SUVO (Space Ultraviolet-Visible Observatory), and the SPECS (Submillimeter Probe of the Evolution of Cosmic Structure), the JWST is the last big NASA astrophysics mission of its generation to be built.\\r\\nEarly development work for a Hubble successor between 1989 and 1994 led to the Hi-Z[54] telescope concept, a fully baffled[Note 1] 4-meter aperture infrared telescope that would recede to an orbit at 3 AU.[55] This distant orbit would have benefited from reduced light noise from zodiacal dust.[55] Other early plans called for a NEXUS precursor telescope mission.[56][57]\\r\\nIn the \\"faster, better, cheaper\\" era in the mid-1990s, NASA leaders pushed for a low-cost space telescope.[58] The result was the NGST concept, with an 8-meter aperture and located at L2, estimated to cost $500 million.[58] In 1997, NASA worked with the Goddard Space Flight Center,[59] Ball Aerospace,[60] and TRW[61] to conduct technical requirement and cost studies, and in 1999 selected Lockheed Martin[62] and TRW for preliminary design concepts.[63]\\r\\nLaunch was initially planned for 2007, but the launch date was subsequently pushed back many times (see table further down).\\r\\nIn 2002, NASA awarded the $824.8 million prime contract for the NGST, now renamed the James Webb Space Telescope, to TRW. The design called for a descoped 6.1-meter (20?ft) primary mirror and a launch date of 2010.[64] Later that year, TRW was acquired by Northrop Grumman in a hostile bid and became Northrop Grumman Space Technology.[63]\\r\\nNASA's Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland, is leading the management of the observatory project. The project scientist for the James Webb Space Telescope is John C. Mather. Northrop Grumman Aerospace Systems serves as the primary contractor for the development and integration of the observatory. They are responsible for developing and building the spacecraft element, which includes both the spacecraft bus and sunshield. Ball Aerospace has been subcontracted to develop and build the Optical Telescope Element (OTE). Northrop Grumman's Astro Aerospace business unit has been contracted to build the Deployable Tower Assembly (DTA) which connects the OTE to the spacecraft bus and the Mid Boom Assembly (MBA) which helps to deploy the large sunshields on orbit.[65] Goddard Space Flight Center is also responsible for providing the Integrated Science Instrument Module (ISIM).[28] A solar panel converts sunlight into electrical power that recharges batteries needed to operate the other subsystems, as well as the science instruments, but heat from these operations must be dissipated for optimal instrument performance at 50?K (?220?C; ?370?F).[2][66]\\r\\nCost growth revealed in spring 2005 led to an August 2005 re-planning.[67] The primary technical outcomes of the re-planning were significant changes in the integration and test plans, a 22-month launch delay (from 2011 to 2013), and elimination of system-level testing for observatory modes at wavelength shorter than 1.7 micrometers. Other major features of the observatory were unchanged. Following the re-planning, the project was independently reviewed in April 2006. The review concluded the project was technically sound, but that funding phasing at NASA needed to be changed. NASA re-phased its JWST budgets accordingly.\\r\\nIn the 2005 re-plan, the life-cycle cost of the project was estimated at about US$4.5 billion. This comprised approximately US$3.5 billion for design, development, launch and commissioning, and approximately US$1.0 billion for ten years of operations.[67] ESA is contributing about ?300 million, including the launch,[68] and the Canadian Space Agency about $39M Canadian.[69]\\r\\nIn January 2007, nine of the ten technology development items in the project successfully passed a non-advocate review.[70] These technologies were deemed sufficiently mature to retire significant risks in the project. The remaining technology development item (the MIRI cryocooler) completed its technology maturation milestone in April 2007. This technology review represented the beginning step in the process that ultimately moved the project into its detailed design phase (Phase C). By May 2007, costs were still on target.[71] In March 2008, the project successfully completed its Preliminary Design Review (PDR). In April 2008, the project passed the Non-Advocate Review. Other passed reviews include the Integrated Science Instrument Module review in March 2009, the Optical Telescope Element review completed in October 2009, and the Sunshield review completed in January 2010.\\r\\nIn April 2010, the telescope passed the technical portion of its Mission Critical Design Review (MCDR). Passing the MCDR signified the integrated observatory can meet all science and engineering requirements for its mission.[72] The MCDR encompassed all previous design reviews. The project schedule underwent review during the months following the MCDR, in a process called the Independent Comprehensive Review Panel, which led to a re-plan of the mission aiming for a 2015 launch, but as late as 2018. By 2010, cost over-runs were impacting other project, though JWST itself remained on schedule.[73]\\r\\nBy 2011, the JWST project was in the final design and fabrication phase (Phase C). As is typical for a complex design that cannot be changed once launched, there are detailed reviews of every portion of design, construction, and proposed operation. New technological frontiers have been pioneered by the project, and it has passed its design reviews. In the 1990s it was unknown if a telescope so large and low mass was possible.[74]\\r\\nAssembly of the hexagonal segments of the primary mirror, which was done via robotic arm, began in November 2015 and was completed in February 2016.[75] Final construction of the Webb telescope was completed in November 2016, after which extensive testing procedures began.[76] In March 2018, NASA delayed the JWST's launch an additional year to May 2020 after the telescope's sunshield ripped during a practice deployment and the sunshield's cables did not sufficiently tighten.[14]\\r\\nThe JWST has a history of major cost overruns and delays which have resulted from outside factors such as delays in deciding on a launch vehicle and adding extra funding for contingencies. By 2006, $1 billion had been spent on developing JWST, with the budget at about $4.5 billion at that time. A 2006 article in the journal Nature noted a study in 1984 by the Space Science Board, which estimated that a next generation infrared observatory would cost $4 billion (about $7 billion in 2006 dollars).[49] Because the runaway budget diverted funding from other research, the science journal Nature described the James Webb as \\"the telescope that ate astronomy\\" in 2010.[88] In June 2011, it was reported that the Webb telescope would cost at least four times more than originally proposed, and launch at least seven years late. Initial budget estimates were that the observatory would cost $1.6 billion and launch in 2011.[89]\\r\\nThe telescope was originally estimated to cost $1.6bn but the cost estimate grew throughout the early development reaching about $5bn by the time the mission was formally confirmed for construction start in 2008. In summer 2010, the mission passed its Critical Design Review with excellent grades on all technical matters, but schedule and cost slips at that time prompted Maryland US Senator Barbara Mikulski to call for an independent review of the project. The Independent Comprehensive Review Panel (ICRP) chaired by J. Casani (JPL) found that the earliest possible launch date was in late 2015 at an extra cost of $1.5bn (for a total of $6.5bn). They also pointed out that this would have required extra funding in FY2011 and FY2012 and that any later launch date would lead to a higher total cost.[90]\\r\\nOn 6 July 2011, the United States House of Representatives' appropriations committee on Commerce, Justice, and Science moved to cancel the James Webb project by proposing an FY2012 budget that removed $1.9bn from NASA's overall budget, of which roughly one quarter was for JWST.[91][92][93][94] $3 billion had been spent and 75% of its hardware was in production.[95] This budget proposal was approved by subcommittee vote the following day. The committee charged that the project was \\"billions of dollars over budget and plagued by poor management\\".[91] However, in November 2011, Congress reversed plans to cancel the JWST and instead capped additional funding to complete the project at $8 billion.[96] Termination of the JWST project as proposed by the House appropriation committee also would have imperiled funding to other missions, such as the Wide-Field Infrared Survey Telescope.[97]\\r\\nThe American Astronomical Society issued a statement in support of JWST in 2011,[98] as did Maryland US Senator Barbara Mikulski.[99] A number of editorials supporting JWST appeared in the international press during 2011 as well.[91][100][101]\\r\\nSome scientists have expressed concerns about growing costs and schedule delays for the Webb telescope, which competes for scant astronomy budgets and thus threatens funding for other space science programs.[102][85] A review of NASA budget records and status reports noted that the JWST is plagued by many of the same problems that have affected other major NASA projects. Repairs and additional testing included underestimates of the telescope's cost that failed to budget for expected technical glitches, missed budget projections, and evaluation of components to estimate extreme launch conditions, thus extending the schedule and increasing costs further.[85][89][103]\\r\\nOne of the reasons why the cost grew so much is that it is difficult to forecast the cost of development, and in general budget predictability improved when initial development milestones were achieved.[85] By the mid-2010s, the U.S. contribution was still expected to cost $8.8 billion.[85] With the U.S. and international funding combined, the overall cost not including extended operations is projected to be over $10 billion when completed.[104] On 27 March 2018, NASA officials announced that JWST's launch would be pushed back to May 2020 or later, and admitted that the project's costs might exceed the $8.8 billion price tag.[87] In the March 27 press release announcing the latest delay, NASA said that it will release a revised cost estimate after a new launch window is determined in cooperation with the ESA.[3] If this cost estimate exceeds the $8 billion cap Congress put in place in 2011, as is considered likely, NASA will have to have the mission re-authorized by the legislature.[105][106]\\r\\nNASA, ESA and CSA have collaborated on the telescope since 1996. ESA's participation in construction and launch was approved by its members in 2003 and an agreement was signed between ESA and NASA in 2007. In exchange for full partnership, representation and access to the observatory for its astronomers, ESA is providing the NIRSpec instrument, the Optical Bench Assembly of the MIRI instrument, an Ariane 5 ECA launcher, and manpower to support operations.[68][107] The CSA will provide the Fine Guidance Sensor and the Near-Infrared Imager Slitless Spectrograph plus manpower to support operations.[108]\\r\\nA large telescope model has been on display at various places since 2005: in the United States at Seattle, Washington; Colorado Springs, Colorado; Greenbelt, Maryland; Rochester, New York; Manhattan, New York; and Orlando, Florida; and elsewhere at Paris, France; Dublin, Ireland; Montreal, Quebec, Canada; Hatfield, United Kingdom; and Munich, Germany. The model was built by the main contractor, Northrop Grumman Aerospace Systems.[109]\\r\\nIn May 2007, a full-scale model of the telescope was assembled for display at the Smithsonian Institution's National Air and Space Museum on the National Mall, Washington D.C. The model was intended to give the viewing public a better understanding of the size, scale and complexity of the satellite, as well as pique the interest of viewers in science and astronomy in general. The model is significantly different from the telescope, as the model must withstand gravity and weather, so is constructed mainly of aluminum and steel measuring approximately 24G12G12?m (79G39G39?ft) and weighs 5.5 tonnes (12,000?lb).\\r\\nThe model was on display in New York City's Battery Park during the 2010 World Science Festival, where it served as the backdrop for a panel discussion featuring Nobel Prize laureate John C. Mather, astronaut John M. Grunsfeld and astronomer Heidi Hammel. In March 2013, the model was on display in Austin, Texas for SXSW 2013.[110][111]\\r\\nThe JWST's primary scientific mission has four key goals: to search for light from the first stars and galaxies that formed in the Universe after the Big Bang, to study the formation and evolution of galaxies, to understand the formation of stars and planetary systems and to study planetary systems and the origins of life.[112] These goals can be accomplished more effectively by observation in near-infrared light rather than light in the visible part of the spectrum. For this reason the JWST's instruments will not measure visible or ultraviolet light like the Hubble Telescope, but will have a much greater capacity to perform infrared astronomy. The JWST will be sensitive to a range of wavelengths from 0.6 (orange light) to 28 micrometers (deep infrared radiation at about 100?K (?170?C; ?280?F)).\\r\\nJWST may be used to gather information on the dimming light of star KIC 8462852, which was discovered in 2015, and has some abnormal light-curve properties.[113]\\r\\nThe JWST will be located near the second Lagrange point (L2) of the Earth-Sun system, which is 1,500,000 kilometers (930,000?mi) from Earth, directly opposite to the Sun. Normally an object circling the Sun farther out than Earth would take longer than one year to complete its orbit, but near the L2 point the combined gravitational pull of the Earth and the Sun allow a spacecraft to orbit the Sun in the same time it takes the Earth. The telescope will circle about the L2 point in a halo orbit, which will be inclined with respect to the ecliptic, have a radius of approximately 800,000 kilometers (500,000?mi), and take about half a year to complete.[17] Since L2 is just an equilibrium point with no gravitational pull, a halo orbit is not an orbit in the usual sense: the spacecraft is actually in orbit around the Sun, and the halo orbit can be thought of as controlled drifting to remain in the vicinity of the L2 point.[114] This requires some station-keeping: around 2ÿ4?m/s per year[115] from the total budget of 150?m/s.[116] Two sets of thrusters constitute the observatory's propulsion system.[117]\\r\\nJWST is the formal successor to the Hubble Space Telescope (HST), and since its primary emphasis is on infrared observation, it is also a successor to the Spitzer Space Telescope. JWST will far surpass both those telescopes, being able to see many more and much older stars and galaxies.[118] Observing in the infrared is a key technique for achieving this, because it better penetrates obscuring dust and gas, allows observation of dim cooler objects, and because of cosmological redshift. Since water vapor and carbon dioxide in the Earth's atmosphere strongly absorbs most infrared, ground-based infrared astronomy is limited to narrow wavelength ranges where the atmosphere absorbs less strongly. Additionally, the atmosphere itself radiates in the infrared, often overwhelming light from the object being observed. This makes space the ideal position for infrared observation.[119]\\r\\nThe more distant an object is, the younger it appears: its light has taken longer to reach human observers. Because the universe is expanding, as the light travels it becomes red-shifted, and these objects are therefore easier to see if viewed in the infrared.[120] JWST's infrared capabilities are expected to let it see back in time to the first galaxies forming just a few hundred million years after the Big Bang.[121]\\r\\nInfrared radiation can pass more freely through regions of cosmic dust that scatter radiation in the visible spectrum. Observations in infrared allow the study of objects and regions of space which would be obscured by gas and dust in the visible spectrum,[120] such as the molecular clouds where stars are born, the circumstellar disks that give rise to planets, and the cores of active galaxies.[120]\\r\\nRelatively cool objects (temperatures less than several thousand degrees) emit their radiation primarily in the infrared, as described by Planck's law. As a result, most objects that are cooler than stars are better studied in the infrared.[120] This includes the clouds of the interstellar medium, brown dwarfs, planets both in our own and other solar systems, comets and Kuiper belt objects that will be observed with the Mid-Infrared Instrument (MIRI) requiring an additional cry-cooler.[33][121]\\r\\nSome of the missions in infrared astronomy that impacted JWST development were Spitzer and also the WMAP probe.[122] Spitzer showed the importance of mid-infrared, such as in its observing dust disks around stars.[122] Also, the WMAP probe showed the universe was \\"lit up\\" at redshift 17, further underscoring the importance of the mid-infrared.[122] Both these missions launched in the early 2000s, in time to influence JWST development.[122] On JWST the mid-infrared science instrument is MIRI, and it required an additional cry-cooler.\\r\\nThe Space Telescope Science Institute (STScI), located in Baltimore, Maryland on the Homewood campus of Johns Hopkins University, was selected as the Science and Operations Center (S&OC) for JWST with an initial budget of $162.2 million intended to support operations through the first year after launch.[123] In this capacity, STScI will be responsible for the scientific operation of the telescope and delivery of data products to the astronomical community. Data will be transmitted from JWST to the ground via NASA's Deep Space Network, processed and calibrated at STScI, and then distributed online to astronomers worldwide. Similar to how Hubble is operated, anyone, anywhere in the world, will be allowed to submit proposals for observations. Each year several committees of astronomers will peer review the submitted proposals to select the projects to observe in the coming year. The authors of the chosen proposals will typically have one year of private access to the new observations, after which the data will become publicly available for download by anyone from the online archive at STScI.\\r\\nMost of the data processing on the telescope is done by conventional single-board computers.[124] The conversion of the analog science data to digital form is performed by the custom-built SIDECAR ASIC (System for Image Digitization, Enhancement, Control And Retrieval Application Specific Integrated Circuit). NASA stated that the SIDECAR ASIC will include all the functions of a 9?kg (20?lb) instrument box in a 3?cm package and consume only 11 milliwatts of power.[125] Since this conversion must be done close to the detectors, on the cool side of the telescope, the low power use of this IC will be crucial for maintaining the low temperature required for optimal operation of the JWST.[125]\\r\\nNearly a month after launch, a trajectory correction will be initiated to place the JWST into a halo orbit at the L2 lagrangian point.[126]\\r\\nJWST after-launch deployment planned timeline[2]\\r\\nJWST observing time will be allocated through a Director's Discretionary Early Release Science (DD-ERS) Program, a Guaranteed Time Observations (GTO) Program, and a General Observers (GO) Program.[127] The GTO Program provides guaranteed observing time for scientists who developed hardware and software components for the observatory. The GO Program provides all astronomers the opportunity to apply for observing time. GO programs will be selected through peer review by a Time Allocation Committee (TAC), similar to the proposal review process used for the Hubble Space Telescope. JWST observing time is expected to be highly oversubscribed, meaning that the number of submitted GO proposals will be much larger than the number that can be approved in any observing cycle.\\r\\nIn November 2017, the Space Telescope Science Institute announced the selection of 13 Director's Discretionary Early Release Science (DD-ERS) Programs, chosen through a competitive proposal process.[128] The observations for these programs will be obtained during the first five months of JWST science operations after the end of the commissioning period. A total of 460 hours of observing time was awarded to these 13 programs, which span science topics including the Solar System, exoplanets, stars and star formation, nearby and distant galaxies, gravitational lenses, and quasars.","input":"When is the james webb telescope being launched?"},{"output":"cross-cut veal shanks","context":"Ossobuco (pronounced?[??sso?bu?ko]; Milanese: ss bus [??z?by?s]) is a Milanese speciality of cross-cut veal shanks braised with vegetables, white wine and broth.

Scientific understanding of the internal structure of the Earth is based on observations of topography and bathymetry, observations of rock in outcrop, samples brought to the surface from greater depths by volcanoes or volcanic activity, analysis of the seismic waves that pass through the Earth, measurements of the gravitational and magnetic fields of the  Earth, and experiments with crystalline solids at pressures and temperatures characteristic of the Earth's deep interior.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe force exerted by Earth's gravity can be used to calculate its mass. Astronomers can also calculate Earth's mass by observing the motion of orbiting satellites. Earths average density can be determined through gravimetric experiments, which have historically involved pendulums.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe mass of Earth is about 7024600000000000000?6G1024?kg.[1]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe structure of Earth can be defined in two ways: by mechanical properties such as rheology, or chemically. Mechanically, it can be divided into lithosphere, asthenosphere, mesospheric mantle, outer core, and the inner core. Chemically, Earth can be divided into the crust, upper mantle, lower mantle, outer core, and inner core. The geologic component layers of Earth[3][not in citation given] are at the following depths below the surface:\\r\\n\\r\\nThe layering of Earth has been inferred indirectly using the time of travel of refracted and reflected seismic waves created by earthquakes.  The core does not allow shear waves to pass through it, while the speed of travel (seismic velocity) is different in other layers.  The changes in seismic velocity between different layers causes refraction owing to Snell's law, like light bending as it passes through a prism.  Likewise, reflections are caused by a large increase in seismic velocity and are similar to light reflecting from a mirror.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Earth's  crust ranges from 5ÿ70 kilometres (3.1ÿ43.5?mi) in depth and is the outermost layer. The thin parts are the oceanic crust, which underlie the ocean basins (5ÿ10?km) and are composed of dense  (mafic) iron magnesium silicate igneous rocks, like basalt. The thicker crust is continental crust, which is less dense and composed of (felsic) sodium potassium aluminium silicate rocks, like granite. The rocks of the crust fall into two major categories ÿ  sial and sima (Suess,1831ÿ1914). It is estimated that sima starts about 11?km below the Conrad discontinuity (a second order discontinuity). The uppermost mantle together with the crust constitutes the lithosphere. The crust-mantle boundary occurs as two physically different events. First, there is a discontinuity in the seismic velocity, which is most commonly known as the Mohorovi?i? discontinuity or Moho. The cause of the Moho is thought to be a change in rock composition from rocks containing plagioclase feldspar (above) to rocks that contain no feldspars (below). Second, in oceanic crust, there is a chemical discontinuity between ultramafic cumulates and tectonized harzburgites, which has been observed from deep parts of the oceanic crust that have been obducted onto the continental crust and preserved as ophiolite sequences.\\r\\n\\r\\nMany rocks now making up Earth's crust formed less than 100 million (1G108) years ago; however, the oldest known mineral grains are about 4.4 billion (4.4G109) years old, indicating that Earth has had a solid crust for at least 4.4 billion years.[4]\\r\\n\\r\\nEarth's mantle extends to a depth of 2,890?km, making it the thickest layer of Earth. The mantle is divided into upper and lower mantle. The upper and lower mantle are separated by the transition zone. The lowest part of the mantle next to the core-mantle boundary is known as the D (pronounced dee-double-prime[5]) layer. The pressure at the bottom of the mantle is 140 GPa (1.4 Matm). The mantle is composed of silicate rocks that are rich in iron and magnesium relative to the overlying crust. Although solid,  the high temperatures within the mantle cause the silicate material to be sufficiently ductile that it can flow on very long timescales. Convection of the mantle is expressed at the surface through the motions of tectonic plates. As there is intense and increasing pressure as one travels deeper into the mantle, the lower part of the mantle flows less easily than does the upper mantle (chemical changes within the mantle may also be important). The viscosity of the mantle ranges between 1021 and 1024 Pa{s, depending on depth.[6] In comparison, the viscosity of water is approximately 10?3 Pa{s and that of pitch is 107 Pa{s. The source of heat that drives plate tectonics is the primordial heat left over from the planets formation as well as the radioactive decay of uranium, thorium, and potassium in Earths crust and mantle.[7]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe average density of Earth is\\r\\n7000551499999999999?5.515?g/cm3.[8] Because the average density of surface material is only around 7000300000000000000?3.0?g/cm3, we must conclude that denser materials exist within Earth's core. \\r\\nThis result has been known since the Schiehallion experiment, performed in the 1770s.\\r\\nCharles Hutton in his 1778 report concluded that the mean density of the Earth must be about  \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n9\\r\\n5\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n{\\\\displaystyle {\\\\tfrac {9}{5}}}\\r\\n\\r\\n that of surface rock, concluding that the interior of the Earth must be metallic. Hutton estimated  this metallic portion to occupy some 65% of the diameter of the Earth.[9]\\r\\nHutton's estimate on the mean density of the Earth was still about 20% too low, at 7000450000000000000?4.5?g/cm3\\r\\nHenry Cavendish in his torsion balance experiment of 1798 found a value of 7000545000000000000?5.45?g/cm3, within 1% of the modern value.[10]\\r\\nSeismic measurements show that the core is divided into two parts, a \\"solid\\" inner core with a radius of 1,220?km[11] and a liquid outer core extending beyond it to a radius of 3,400?km. The densities are between 9,900 and 12,200?kg/m3 in the outer core and 12,600ÿ13,000?kg/m3 in the inner core.[12]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe inner core was discovered in 1936 by Inge Lehmann and is generally believed to be composed primarily of iron and some nickel. Since this layer is able to transmit shear waves (transverse seismic waves), it must be solid.  Experimental evidence has at times been critical of crystal models of the core.[13]  Other experimental studies show a discrepancy under high pressure: diamond anvil (static) studies at core pressures yield melting temperatures that are approximately 2000?K below those from shock laser (dynamic) studies.[14][15]  The laser studies create plasma,[16] and the results are suggestive that constraining inner core conditions will depend on whether the inner core is a solid or is a plasma with the density of a solid.  This is an area of active research.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn early stages of Earth's formation about 4.6 billion years ago, melting would have caused denser substances to sink toward the center in a process called planetary differentiation (see also the iron catastrophe), while less-dense materials would have migrated to the crust. The core is thus believed to largely be composed of iron (80%), along with nickel and one or more light elements, whereas other dense elements, such as lead and uranium, either are too rare to be significant or tend to bind to lighter elements and thus remain in the crust (see felsic materials). Some have argued that the inner core may be in the form of a single iron crystal.[17][18]\\r\\n\\r\\nUnder laboratory conditions a sample of ironÿnickel alloy was subjected to the corelike pressures by gripping it in a vise between 2 diamond tips (diamond anvil cell), and then heating to approximately 4000 K. The sample was observed with x-rays, and strongly supported the theory that Earth's inner core was made of giant crystals running north to south.[19][20]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe liquid outer core surrounds the inner core and is believed to be composed of iron mixed with nickel and trace amounts of lighter elements.\\r\\n\\r\\nRecent speculation suggests that the innermost part of the core is enriched in gold, platinum and other siderophile elements.[21]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe matter that comprises Earth is connected in fundamental ways to matter of certain chondrite meteorites, and to matter of outer portion of the Sun.[22][23] There is good reason to believe that Earth is, in the main, like a chondrite meteorite. Beginning as early as 1940, scientists, including Francis Birch, built geophysics upon the premise that Earth is like ordinary chondrites, the most common type of meteorite observed impacting Earth, while totally ignoring another, albeit less abundant type, called enstatite chondrites. The principal difference between the two meteorite types is that enstatite chondrites formed under circumstances of extremely limited available oxygen, leading to certain normally oxyphile elements existing either partially or wholly in the alloy portion that corresponds to the core of Earth.\\r\\n\\r\\nDynamo theory suggests that convection in the outer core, combined with the Coriolis effect, gives rise to Earth's magnetic field. The solid inner core is too hot to hold a permanent magnetic field (see Curie temperature) but probably acts to stabilize the magnetic field generated by the liquid outer core. The average magnetic field strength in Earth's outer core is estimated to be 25 Gauss (2.5?mT), 50 times stronger than the magnetic field at the surface.[24][25]\\r\\n\\r\\nRecent evidence has suggested that the inner core of Earth may rotate slightly faster than the rest of the planet;[26] however, more recent studies in 2011[which?] found this hypothesis to be inconclusive. Options remain for the core which may be oscillatory in nature or a chaotic system.[citation needed] In August 2005 a team of geophysicists announced in the journal Science that, according to their estimates, Earth's inner core rotates approximately 0.3 to 0.5?degrees per year faster relative to the rotation of the surface.[27][28]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe current scientific explanation for Earth's temperature gradient is a combination of heat left over from the planet's initial formation, decay of radioactive elements, and freezing of the inner core.\\r\\n\\r\\n Media related to Structure of the Earth at Wikimedia Commons","input":"What is the solid part of earth called?"},{"output":"no longer than five minutes","context":"","input":"How long is a round in ufc fight?"},{"output":"August 2007","context":"","input":"When were smart meters introduced in the uk?"},{"output":"Raniganj Coalfield","context":"Coal mining in India began in 1774 when John Sumner and Suetonius Grant Heatly of the East India Company commenced commercial exploitation in the Raniganj Coalfield along the Western bank of Damodar river. As on 31 March 2015, India had estimated coal reserves of 306.6?billion metric tons (338.0?billion short tons), the fifth largest coal reserves in the world. India is the fourth largest producer of coal in the world, producing 536.5?million metric tons (591.4?million short tons) in 2014.\\r\\nDue to high demand and poor average quality, India is forced to import high quality coal to meet the requirements of steel plants. India's coal imports have risen from 43.08?million metric tons (0.04749?billion short tons) in 2006-07 to 199.88?million metric tons (0.22033?billion short tons) in 2015-16. India's coal exports rose from 1.55?million metric tons (1.71?million short tons) in 2006-07 to 2.45?million metric tons (2.70?million short tons) in 2009-10, but subsequently declined to 1.25?million metric tons (1.38?million short tons) in 2015-16.[2]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCommercial exploitation of coal in India began in 1774 with John Sumner and Suetonius Grant Heatly of the East India Company in the Raniganj Coalfield along the Western bank of Damodar river. The growth of Indian coal mining remained slow for nearly a century due to low demand. The introduction of steam locomotives in 1853 boosted demand, and coal production rose to an annual average of 1?million metric tons (1.1?million short tons). India produced 6.12?million metric tons (6.75?million short tons) of coal per year by 1900 and 18?million metric tons (20?million short tons) per year by 1920. Coal production received another boost during the First World War due to increased demand, but slumped again in the early 1930s. Production reached a level of 29?million metric tons (32?million short tons) by 1942 and 30?million metric tons (33?million short tons) by 1946.[3]\\r\\nIn the regions of British India known as Bengal, Bihar and Odisha, the Kutch Gurjar Kshatriyas pioneered Indian involvement in coal mining from 1894. They broke the previous monopolies held by British and other Europeans, establishing many collieries at locations such as Khas Jharia, Jamadoba, Balihari, Tisra, Katrasgarh, Kailudih, Kusunda, Govindpur, Sijua, Sijhua, Loyabad, Dhansar, Bhuli, Bermo, Mugma, Chasnala-Bokaro, Bugatdih, Putki, Chirkunda, Bhowrah, Sinidih, Kendwadih, and Dumka.[4][5]\\r\\nSeth Khora Ramji Chawda of Sinugra was the first Indian to break the British monopoly in the Jharia Coalfields.[4][6] Natwarlal Devram Jethwa says that\\r\\nThe East Indian Railway in 1894-95 extended its line from Barakar to Dhanbad via Katras and Jharia. Messrs. Khora Ramji in 1894 was working on railway lines contract of Jharia branch line and with his brother Jetha Lira was also building Jharia Railway Station, when he discovered coal in Jharia belt. The location of his three collieries named Jeenagora, Khas Jherria, Gareria is mentioned also in 1917 Gazetteers of Bengal, Assam, Bihar and Odisha.[7]\\r\\nOther Indian communities followed the example of the KGK in the Dhanbad-Jharia-Bokaro fields after the 1930s. These included the Punjabis, Kutchis, Marwaris, Gujaratis, Bengalis and Hindustanis. Encyclopaedia of Bengal, Bihar and Odisha -1920 mentions:- \\"Out of 92 collieries belonging to Gujaratis in Jharia Coalfields Area during 1920s - 50 belonged to Mistris of Kutch with Seth Khora Ramji as Head of them all.\\" Seth Khora Ramji of Sinugra was also honored by King of Kutch by giving him a Paghdi.[4][8][9][10][11][12]\\r\\nFollowing independence, the Government of India introduced several 5-year development plans. Annual production rose to 33?million metric tons (36?million short tons) at the beginning of the First Five Year Plan. The National Coal Development Corporation (NCDC), a Government of India Undertaking, was established in 1956 with the collieries owned by the railways. The NCDC aimed to increase coal production efficiently by systematic and scientific development of the coal industry. The Singareni Collieries Company Ltd. (SCCL) which was already in operation since 1945 and which became a Government company under the control of Government of Andhra Pradesh in 1956. The coal industry in India was thus controlled by state-owned companies in the 1950s. Today, SCCL is a joint undertaking of Government of Telangana and Government of India sharing its equity in 51:49 ratio.\\r\\nRight from its genesis, the commercial coal mining in modern times in India has been dictated by the needs of the domestic consumption. India has abundant domestic reserves of coal. Most of these are in the states of Jharkhand, Odisha, West Bengal, Bihar, Chhattisgarh, Telangana and Madhya Pradesh.[13] On account of the growing needs of the steel industry, a thrust had to be given on systematic exploitation of coking coal reserves in Jharia coalfield. Adequate capital investment to meet the burgeoning energy needs of the country was not forthcoming from the private coal mine owners.\\r\\nUnscientific mining practices adopted by some of them and poor working conditions of labor in some of the private coal mines became matters of concern for the Government. On account of these reasons, the Central Government took a decision to nationalize the private coal mines. The nationalization was done in two phases, the first with the coking coal mines in 1971-72 and then with the non-coking coal mines in 1973. In October, 1971, the Coking Coal Mines (Emergency Provisions) Act, 1971 provided for taking over in public interest of the management of coking coal mines and coke oven plants pending nationalization. This was followed by the Coking Coal Mines (Nationalization) Act, 1972 under which the coking coal mines and the coke oven plants other than those with the Tata Iron & Steel Company Limited and Indian Iron & Steel Company Limited, were nationalized on May 1, 1972 and brought under the Bharat Coking Coal Limited (BCCL), a new Central Government Undertaking. Another enactment, namely the Coal Mines (Taking Over of Management) Act, 1973, extended the right of the Government of India to take over the management of the coking and non-coking coal mines in seven States including the coking coal mines taken over in 1971. This was followed by the nationalization of all these mines on May 1, 1973 with the enactment of the Coal Mines (Nationalization) Act, 1973 which determined the eligibility of coal mining in India.[14]\\r\\nAll non-coking coal mines were nationalized in 1973 and placed under Coal Mines Authority of India. In 1975, Eastern Coalfields Limited, a subsidiary of Coal India Limited, was formed. It took over all the earlier private collieries in Raniganj Coalfield. Raniganj Coalfield covers an area of 443.50 square kilometres (171.24?sq?mi) and has total coal reserves of 8,552.85?million metric tons (9,427.90?million short tons). Eastern Coalfields puts the reserves at 29.72?billion metric tons (32.76?billion short tons). That makes it the second largest coalfield in the country (in terms of reserves).\\r\\nThe North East Indian states enjoys special privileges under constitution of India. The Sixth Schedule of constitution and article 371 of constitution allows state governments to formulate its own policy in order to recognize customary tribal laws. For example, Nagaland has its own coal policy which allows its natives to mine coal from their respective lands. Similarly, coal mining in Meghalaya was rampant till imposition of ban on coal mining by National Green Tribunal. The Nagaland Coal[15] and Meghalaya Coal[16] has large buyers in North India, Central India and Eastern India.\\r\\nParliament enacted the Coal Mines (Special Provisions) Act, 2015 in March 2015 containing provisions enabling the government to allocate coal mines through auctions. The law also permitted private players to mine coal for use in their own cement, steel, power or aluminium plants. On 20 February 2018, the Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs (CCEA) permitted private firms to enter the commercial coal mining industry in India. Under the new policy, mines will be auctioned to the firm offering the highest per tonne price. The move broke the monopoly over commercial mining that state-owned Coal India has enjoyed since nationalisation in 1973.[17] Establishment of coal regulator is needed to implement the policy in transparent and non-discriminatory manner.[18]\\r\\nThe Coking Coal Mines (Nationalization) Act, 1972 and the Coal Mines (Nationalization) Act, 1973 were repealed by the Repealing and Amending (Second) Act, 2017 on 8 January 2018.[19]\\r\\nIndia has the fifth largest coal reserves in the world. As on 31 March 2016, India had 308.80?billion metric tons (340.39?billion short tons) of the resource. The known reserves of coal rose 0.7% over the previous year, with the discovery of an estimated 2.20?billion metric tons (2.43?billion short tons). The estimated total reserves of lignite coal as on 31 March 2016 was 44.59?billion metric tons (49.15?billion short tons).[2] The energy derived from coal in India is about twice that of the energy derived from oil, whereas worldwide, energy derived from coal is about 30% less than energy derived from oil.\\r\\nCoal deposits are primarily found in eastern and south-central India. Jharkhand, Odisha, Chhattisgarh, West Bengal, Madhya Pradesh, Telangana and Maharashtra accounted for 98.58% of the total known coal reserves in India. As on 31 March 2016, Jharkhand and Odisha had the largest coal deposits of 26.29% and 24.58% respectively.[2]\\r\\nThe following table shows the estimated coal reserves in India by state as on 31 March 2016.[2][20]\\r\\nThe following table shows the estimated lignite reserves in India by state as on 31 March 2016.[2]\\r\\nThe production of coal was 639.23?million metric tons (704.63?million short tons) in 2015-16, a growth of 4.93% over the previous year. The production of lignite was 43.84?million metric tons (48.33?million short tons) in 2015-16, 9% lower than the previous fiscal.[2] India is ranked 2nd in world coal production.[21]\\r\\nThe top producing states are:\\r\\nOther notable coal-mining areas include:\\r\\nIndustries in India consumed 832.46 MT of coal in 2015-16. The largest consumers of coal in India are electricity generation (508.25 MT), steel and washery industries (56.45 MT), cement industries (8.93 MT) and sponge iron industries (7.76 MT). Consumption of lignite stood at 42.52 MT in 2015-16. Electricity generation alone accounts for 89.57% of the total lignite consumption.[2]\\r\\nAs on 31 October, the installed capacity of coal power in India was 186,492.88 MW, accounting for 60.7% of the total installed capacity.[22] India's electricity sector consumed about 72% of the coal produced in the country in 2013.[23]\\r\\nA large part of Indian coal reserve is similar to Gondwana coal. It is of low calorific value and high ash content. The carbon content is low in India's coal, and toxic trace element concentrations are negligible. The natural fuel value of Indian coal is poor. On average, the Indian power plants using India's coal supply consume about 0.7?kg of coal to generate a kWh, whereas United States thermal power plants consume about 0.45?kg of coal per kWh. This is because of the difference in the quality of the coal, as measured by the Gross Calorific Value (GCV). On average, Indian coal has a GCV of about 4500 Kcal/kg, whereas the quality elsewhere in the world is much better; for example, in Australia, the GCV is 6500 Kcal/kg approximately.[24] India imported nearly 95 Mtoe of steam coal and coking coal which is 29% of total consumption to meet the demand in electricity, cement and steel production.[25]\\r\\nThe state-owned coal mines of Bihar (now Jharkhand after the division of Bihar state) were among the first areas in India to see the emergence of a sophisticated mafia, beginning with the mining town of Dhanbad.[26] It is alleged that the coal industry's trade union leadership forms the upper echelon of this arrangement and employs caste allegiances to maintain its power.[27] Pilferage and sale of coal on the black market, inflated or fictitious supply expenses, falsified worker contracts and the expropriation and leasing-out of government land have allegedly become routine.[28] A parallel economy has developed with a significant fraction of the local population employed by the mafia in manually transporting the stolen coal for long distances over unpaved roads to illegal mafia warehouses and points of sale.[29]\\r\\nThe coal mafia has had a negative effect on Indian industry, with coal supplies and quality varying erratically. Higher quality coal is sometimes selectively diverted, and missing coal is replaced with stones and boulders in railway cargo wagons. A human corpse has been discovered in a sealed coal wagon.[30]\\r\\nIn June 2012, the Bollywood epic Gangs of Wasseypur was released portraying the coal mafia in the area of Dhanbad. The movie received overwhelming response and was declared a hit. Another Bollywood movie Gunday was also loosely based upon coal mafia.","input":"Which is the first coal mine in india?"},{"output":"Los Angeles, California","context":"American Horror Story: Roanoke is the sixth season of the FX horror anthology television series American Horror Story.

He also confirmed a fall 2016 premiere.[18] At the 2016 PaleyFest, Murphy divulged that the two previous ideas [the writers] had been considering had been merged into season six, saying it will involve children and operatic themes.[19] The season will consist of 10 episodes, the least in a given cycle, in the show's history; with the finale scheduled to air November 16, 2016.[20][21] On September 1, 2016, it was reported by Entertainment Weekly that the season was possibly subtitled The Mist, as a Rotten Tomatoes page and TV Guide magazine had printed; which was later proven untrue.[22] There is a direct connection to Freak Show with an exploration of the Mott family origin.[23]\\r\\nIn a late September issue of Entertainment Weekly, Falchuk and Murphy revealed there would be a major twist coming to the series in \\"Chapter 6\\". Murphy said of the matter, \\"You'll see starting in episode 6, the show has a huge turn and the thing that you think you're watching is not what you're watching, It's a hat on a hat on a hat on a hat that we've had to protect.\\" Falchuk added, \\"No matter what you think it is, it's not that. Then, episode 6 comes and you're like, 'Wait! What happened?' It's like [episodes] 1ÿ5, 6ÿ9, and 10 is its own thing.\\"[24] Murphy went on to confirm the turn in the season being a behind-the-camera look at the production of the faux documentary My Roanoke Nightmare.[25] He also stated that the final episode will feature characters, and their mythologies, that will continue on in the overall series.[26]\\r\\nColonial ware and design are incorporated into the season, which is theorized to be, at least partially, set in 1590 Roanoke, North Carolina. A pioneer cottage is incorporated in Santa Clarita, California. The set is fully dressed in time-period appropriate dressings, including an etched tree.[27] The production designers constructed an entire colonial house, that serves as the season's chief setting. The house was constructed in an undisclosed California forest, over the course of four months. The abode is completely functional, furnished, and finished inside and out. This is the first time in American Horror Story history that a complete home has been built, and is quite unprecedented for film and television productions in general.[28] A three-story set built in Malibu Canyon was not permitted properly, and after being torn down in October 2016, FX \\"will be required to do extensive restoration.\\"[29]\\r\\nIn October 2015, Murphy tweeted that he had asked Hotel star Lady Gaga to join the untitled season, but did not expect an answer anytime soon.[30] She later confirmed her involvement in March 2016.[31] Coven star Emma Roberts has stated that she and Murphy have talked about a \\"devilish\\" role for her in the season.[32] Murder House and Coven star Taissa Farmiga was heavily rumored to be involved with the season in some form.[33] Murphy later confirmed Farmiga would appear late in the season.[25][34] In February 2016, Angela Bassett confirmed her return to the series during an interview on Larry King Now, being the first cast member added to the season 6 roster. She portrays Lee Harris, a re-enactor of the documentary's horrific events.[35][36] At PaleyFest, Murphy invited Kathy Bates, Denis O'Hare, Sarah Paulson, Finn Wittrock, Cheyenne Jackson, Wes Bentley, and Matt Bomer to return to the show for its sixth season. In May 2016, Jessica Lange stated, in an interview with Charlie Rose, that she would not be returning for the sixth or any other future season of the series; saying, \\"No, I had four years with that, four seasons, and each year was a marvelous character, everything changed from one year to another which made it very interesting to me. But no, I think sometimes you come to the end of something...\\"[37] However, Variety published an article in September 2016, reporting Lange would appear.[38]\\r\\nIn June 2016, Coven alum Leslie Jordan announced his return to the series, stating he had been approached to appear in Freak Show, but declined. He was surprised to get a call from Murphy again.[39] Later in the month, Bomer, Jackson, and Evan Peters confirmed their involvement with the sixth season.[40][41][42] O'Hare stated he would return in some capacity in a May 2016 interview.[43] Us Weekly has reported the returns of Bentley, Bates, and Wittrock.[44] In an early August 2016 interview with Glamour, series veteran Sarah Paulson announced her return for the sixth year. She said of the show, \\"I just think I have the greatest job on the planet because my TV show [American Horror Story] is going into its sixth season and I'm playing an entirely different character, like nothing I've ever played.\\"[45] She plays the featured re-enactor in the horrific documentary. On Halloween 2016, Murphy announced the return of Paulson's Asylum character, Lana Winters.[46] TMZ reported the casting of The People v. O. J. Simpson: American Crime Story star Cuba Gooding Jr.[28] Gooding Jr. himself later went on to confirm his presence in the season, also announcing that he will share most screen-time with former co-star Paulson, stating, \\"It's really been a treat to finally engage with her on camera, because when we did The People v. O. J. it was more about my scenes and then her scenes and us being in the courtroom but separate, but we're not separate no more!\\"[47] He plays the co-lead of the My Roanoke Nightmare documentary. In September 2016, Glee alum Jacob Artist announced his involvement with the sixth season.[48] On the same month, the main casting was announced after the first episode with the addition of Andr Holland and series veteran Lily Rabe portraying the real-life couple, Matt Miller (Lee's brother) and his wife Shelby from the documentary's interviews. Adina Porter, after a small guest appearance on an episode of the first series, portrayed the real Lee Harris.[49][50]\\r\\nIn March 2016, the series received a major tax credit for filming of the season in Los Angeles, California.[51] Cast alum Angela Bassett, along with Jennifer Lynch, Marita Grabiak, Gwyneth Horder-Payton, Elodie Keene, and Alexis Korycinski were set as directors during the season, marking the first time women have served in the capacity on the show.[33] In June 2016, cast member Jackson stated that the season had already clandestinely begun principal photography earlier that month.[52] On August 1, 2016, TMZ published photographs of the American Horror Story set in Santa Clarita, California; that consists of a small Pioneer home, and a tree with the word \\"Croatoan\\" carved into its center. Both of these things are attributed to the 1590 colony of 117 people, in Roanoke, North Carolina, that disappeared without a trace, and the only clue left was the carving?ÿ the name being a nearby island and tribe of Native Americans.[27] Later, TMZ unveiled more set photos from an unknown California forest.[28]\\r\\nThe marketing campaign for the season was one of mystery. On June 6, 2016, all of the series' social media pages displayed a teaser image of a red number six, with a question mark superimposed. Little was known about plot details or casting before the premiere, which seems to be a deliberate ploy of publicity. The following months saw a virtual reality experience at the 2016 San Diego Comic-Con International,[54] a multitude of motley teaser trailers and posters,[55] a Mercedes-Benz sweepstakes;[56] and no casting or plot announcements. At the Television Critics Association Summer Press Tour, on August 9, 2016, FX chief John Landgraf announced that all, but one, of the teaser trailers released thus far have been deliberate misdirects by the network. Explaining, \\"[Murphy and Stephanie Gibbons, FX head of marketing and on-air promotions] went out and made many more trailers than you've actually seen for hypothetical seasons of American Horror Story, meaning different genres and different places\\". Landgraf also reiterated what had been previously reported, that the official theme of the cycle will not be revealed until the airing of the first episode.[14]\\r\\nA week before the premiere FX released a trailer featuring Lady Gaga's new single \\"Perfect Illusion\\", speaking to the anonymity of the season.[57] In a September 13, 2016 interview with The Hollywood Reporter, marketing chief Stephanie Gibbons spoke at length about the risks and idea behind the seasons complete anonymity. Explaining the origin of her campaign, \\"I felt we would play on two aspects of the human helix: Desire to know, the curiosity to find out what you don't know; and perhaps more importantly, the notion of how powerful withholding is to the human psyche. Often wanting is more fulfilling than having.\\"[53]\\r\\nOne of the earliest season hypotheses was that of Slender Man, the 2009 phenomenon, a man with a blank face, tractable arms, and killer of children. However, sources working on the show confirmed to Entertainment Weekly, in January 2016, that the myth would not be appearing, and that a theme had already been established for the season, and would be revealed in March. Though, this did not come to pass.[58] Based on the teaser trailers and several interviews given by Murphy, media reported the plot of the season as dealing with cult, farm, orphanage, colony, or the storyline of the Antichrist, which has already been touched on by the series in season one (Vivien and Tate's child, Michael, that Constance took as her own, was considered to be the titular figure).[59][60] Deadline's Ross A. Lincoln posited the theory that the cycle will revolve around the Bloody Benders family. They owned an inn and general store in rural 1800s Kansas and were responsible for the deaths of 11 passersby, later disappearing.[61] Photos from the set released by TMZ confirmed the season to incorporate colonial aspects. Vulture's Jordan Crucchiola theorized it to be about the Roanoke Colony, with Murphy likely to adapt the historical explanation of the settlers disappearance.[62] The Huffington Post added that another story avenue Murphy might venture on is the colloquial belief that the colonist vanished under supernatural circumstances.[63] Screener's Aaron Pruner noted that the colony was mentioned by Billie Dean Howard in Murder House, thus alluding to the possible Antichrist or supernatural presence in the sixth season. Pruner also mentioned that the history of the word \\"Croatoan\\" is vast and unnerving. Days before the death of author Edgar Allan Poe, he is said to have muttered the cryptic word as his final. Furthermore, in 1937, the word was found scribbled in fated pilot Amelia Earhart's journal.[64] Kate Feldman from New York Daily News has speculated that the season will revolve around the Manson family; she cited iconography in a teaser, Charles Manson's fascination with spiders (i.e. official poster for season), Evan Peters' appearance resembling Manson, and Murphy's previous comments stating that the series had considered the theme for the third year, which ultimately shifted to Coven.[65] However, Sarah Paulson has rejected the Manson theme, saying, \\"Wrong! You can look me dead in the eyes. You are wrong, dead wrong. And you will see that I am not lying to you. I'm not pulling a little Jedi mind trick.\\"[66] After the release of the revealing \\"Anthology\\" trailer, The Huffington Post's Bill Bradley suggested, after taking into account several factors, that the season would feature a discarded Murder House menace that slays his victims with hedge trimmers.[67] TV Guide suggested a major connection to Asylum concerning the spider shown travelling under the skin of a person in one of the teasers for the season.[68]\\r\\nAmerican Horror Story: Roanoke has received positive reviews from critics. The review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes gave the season a 78% approval rating, with an average rating of 6.7/10, based on 13 reviews. The site's consensus reads, \\"American Horror Story: My Roanoke Nightmare takes a surprising turn away from prior AHS formats, revisiting the deliberate pace of earlier seasons on a spookier, smaller scale, even if the true-crime format feels overdone.\\"[69] On Metacritic, the season was given a score of 72 out of 100 based on 9 reviews, indicating \\"generally positive reviews\\".[70]\\r\\nDan Fienberg of The Hollywood Reporter gave a positive review, writing, \\"When you're the type of show prone to kicking off a season with the introduction of a hairless mole man with a killer dildo, it's possible that the most provocative thing you can do to start a chapter is eschewing mole men, dildos and, in fact, killing altogether for a full week. The American Horror Story franchise has been and done many things, but it's never offered such a false sense of security, so this subdued start may be the scariest promise of all. It's the most curious I've been about future installments in a long time.\\"[71] Jeff Jensen of Entertainment Weekly also gave a positive review, writing, \\"The use of mystery to market the season may have been contrived, but at this point, mystery might also be the best thing going for it, too.\\"[72] Ben Travers of IndieWire called the premiere \\"a promising start with a central mystery as tantalizing as the ads teasing it.\\"[73]\\r\\n^1 Live +7 ratings were not available, so Live +3 ratings have been used instead.","input":"Where did they film american horror story roanoke?"},{"output":"?500,000","context":"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe 2018 Tour de France was the 105th edition of the Tour de France, one of cycling's three Grand Tours. The 3,351?km (2,082?mi) race started from Noirmoutier-en-l'?le, in the Vende department, on 7 July and concluded with the Champs-lyses stage in Paris, on 29 July.[n 1] A total of 176 riders across 22 teams were participating in the 21-stage race. The Tour was the shortest of the millennium and was the fifth time a tour had set out from Vende. The race was won for the first time by Geraint Thomas of Team Sky. Tom Dumoulin (Team Sunweb) placed second, with Thomas' teammate and four-time Tour champion Chris Froome coming third.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe opening stage was won by Fernando Gaviria of Quick-Step Floors, who became the Tour's first rider to wear the general classification leader's yellow jersey. Peter Sagan (BoraÿHansgrohe) then took the race lead the following stage. BMC Racing Team won stage three's team time trial, putting their rider Greg Van Avermaet in yellow. He held the jersey for eight days until the second high mountain stage, where stage winner Thomas took the lead. He held it for the rest of the race to become the first Welshman to win the overall race. As a result, Team Skyand additionally British riderswon six of the previous seven Tours dating back to 2012.\\r\\n\\r\\nSagan won the points classification for the sixth time, Julian Alaphilippe (Quick-Step Floors) won the mountains classification, and Pierre Latour of AG2R La Mondiale won the young rider classification. Movistar Team won the team classification, and UAE Team Emirates rider Dan Martin was named the most combative for the entire race.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe 18 UCI WorldTeams were automatically invited to the race. On 6 January 2018, organisers of the Tour, the Amaury Sport Organisation (ASO), announced the four second-tier UCI Professional Continental teams that received a wildcard invitation to participate in the event. The four teams were Cofidis, Direct nergie, FortuneoÿSamsic, from France and Belgium's WantyÿGroupe Gobert, all of which have participated in the race before.[2] This meant that new French team Vital Concept, with their team leader, sprinter Bryan Coquard, missed out on the race. Christian Prudhomme wished the team the best in their inaugural season.[3] The presentation of the teamswhere the members of each team's roster are introduced in front of the media and local dignitariestook place on Place Napoleon?(fr) in the town of La Roche-sur-Yon on 5 July, two days before the opening stage.[4]\\r\\n\\r\\nNew rules by the cycling's governing body, the Union Cycliste Internationale (UCI) reduced the number of riders per team for Grand Tours from 9 to 8, resulting in a start list total of 176, instead of the usual 198.[5][6] Of these, 35 competed in their first Tour de France.[7] The total number of riders that finished the race was 145.[8] The riders came from 30 countries. Seven countries had more than 10 riders in the race: France (35), Belgium (19), the Netherlands (13), Italy (13), Australia (11), Germany (11) and Spain (11).[6] The average age of riders in the race was 29.37 years,[9] ranging from the 21-year-old Egan Bernal (Team Sky) to the 40-year-old Franco Pellizotti (BahrainÿMerida).[10][11] GroupamaÿFDJ had the youngest average age while BahrainÿMerida had the oldest.[12]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe teams entering the race were:[6]\\r\\n\\r\\nUCI WorldTeams\\r\\n\\r\\nUCI Professional Continental teams\\r\\n\\r\\nDefending champion Chris Froome (Team Sky) had generally been considered the main favourite for the general classification.[13] He had won four out of the last five editions, and was also the current defending champion at both other Grand Tours, the Vuelta a Espa?a and the Giro d'Italia. However, Froome's participation was cast into doubt when he returned a urine sample at the 2017 Vuelta a Espa?a, which contained twice the allowed amount of the asthma drug salbutamol. This was considered not as a positive doping result, but as an \\"Adverse Analytical Finding\\" (AAF), meaning that he was allowed to continue racing until the case was resolved. He did however face the possibility of losing his Vuelta victory and all subsequent results.[14] The ASO were unhappy with the situation, which was very similar to that of Alberto Contador, who started the 2011 Tour with his case over a positive test for clenbuterol still unresolved.[15] The UCI conducted an investigation into the AAF, which was still unresolved at the time that Froome won the 2018 Giro d'Italia. With an outcome before the start of the Tour unlikely, the ASO attempted to bar Froome from starting the race, citing article 28 of the race's rules, saying that the organiser \\"expressly reserves the right to refuse participation inor to exclude fromthe event, a team or any of its members whose presence would be such as to damage the image or reputation of ASO or the event\\".[16] Froome was cleared by the UCI on 2 July 2018, with a press statement reading that the authorities had found sufficient evidence \\"that Mr Froomes sample results do not constitute an AAF\\".[17] He was thereafter cleared to start the Tour by the ASO as well.[18]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe closest rivals of Froome were thought to be Richie Porte (BMC Racing Team), Nairo Quintana, Mikel Landa (both of Movistar Team), Tom Dumoulin (Team Sunweb), and Vincenzo Nibali (BahrainÿMerida).[19] The other riders considered contenders for the general classification were Geraint Thomas (Team Sky), Romain Bardet (AG2R La Mondiale), Primo? Rogli? (LottoNLÿJumbo), Adam Yates (MitcheltonÿBikeExchange), Jakob Fuglsang (Astana), Alejandro Valverde (Movistar Team), Rigoberto Urn (EF Education FirstÿDrapac p/b Cannondale), Dan Martin (UAE Team Emirates), Bob Jungels (Quick-Step Floors) and Ilnur Zakarin (Team KatushaÿAlpecin).[13][20][21][22][23][24][25][26][27][28]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe sprinters considered favourites for the points classification and wins on the flat or hilly bunch sprint finishes were Peter Sagan (BoraÿHansgrohe), Fernando Gaviria (Quick-Step Floors), Dylan Groenewegen (LottoNLÿJumbo), Arnaud Dmare (GroupamaÿFDJ), Marcel Kittel (Team KatushaÿAlpecin), Michael Matthews (Team Sunweb), Mark Cavendish (Team Dimension Data), Andr Greipel (LottoÿSoudal), Alexander Kristoff (UAE Team Emirates), Sonny Colbrelli (BahrainÿMerida) and John Degenkolb (TrekÿSegafredo).[29][30][31]\\r\\n\\r\\nOn 12 February 2017 at a rugby union match between France and Scotland at the Stade de France, the Tour's race director Christian Prudhomme announced the start of the 2018 Tour (known as the Grand Dpart) would be in the Vende department, in the Pays de la Loire region. The departments in the Pays de la Loire region hosted the Tour de France in its first edition back in 1903. Since then, the cities and towns of the Pays de la Loire region have welcomed the Grand Dpart of the Tour de France nine times, five of which have set out from the Vende. The last time the region hosted the Tour was in 2011.[32] Two weeks after the announcement, the ASO revealed that the Grand Dpart would take place over three stages, with the third a team time trial.[33] In June 2017, the UCIs Professional Cycling Council (PCC) moved the start of the Tour a week later than usual and originally planned due to a clash with the 2018 FIFA World Cup.[1] The full route was announced on 17 October 2017; it was almost completely within France, with short deviations into Spain in the Pyrenees were the only exceptions. It would feature two of the Tour's most historic climbs, Alpe d'Huez and the Col de Tourmalet, which last featured in 2015 and 2016 respectively. For the first time in 60 to 70 years, it included a section of unpaved roads on the Glires Plateau.[34] Of the route, Mark Cavendish labelled it \\"absolutely brutal\\".[35]\\r\\n\\r\\nThere were 21 stages in the race, covering a total distance of 3,351?km (2,082?mi), the shortest of the 21st century.[36][37] The race also included 21.7?km (13.5?mi) of cobblestones (or pavs) in stage 9, which were last featured in 2015. In the first week of the race, two laps of the short, but steep, M?r-de-Bretagne were included.[34]\\r\\n\\r\\nStage one's bunch sprint was won by Tour debutant Fernando Gaviria, with Peter Sagan coming in second and Marcel Kittel in third. Gaviria took the yellow and green jerseys as the leader of the general and points classifications respectively. Kvin Ledanois (FortuneoÿSamsic) took the first polka dot jersey as the leader of the mountains classification.[38] Sagan won stage two from a sprint to take the yellow and green jerseys, with Dion Smith of WantyÿGroupe Gobert claiming the polka.[39] Stage three's team time trial was won by BMC Racing Team whose riders Tejay van Garderen and Greg Van Avermaet became tied for the overall lead,[40] with Van Avermaet moving into yellow for the second time in his career due to him crossing the finish line ahead of Van Garderen in the first two stages being as there was not yet an individual time trial to measure their times down to the 1000th of a second.[41] Stage four was won by Gaviria from a bunch sprint.[42][43] Sagan further extend his lead in the points competition by winning stage five. Also in stage five, Toms Skuji?? of TrekÿSegafredo won the mountains points which gave him the polka. Skujins became the first rider from Latvia to ever lead the mountains classification.[44]\\r\\n\\r\\nStage six was a sprint that Sagan and John Degenkolb raced for, seeing as virtually all of the top sprinters finished close to fifteen minutes behind the general classification contenders. Team Sky, BMC Racing Team, and Movistar Team controlled the peloton, where Geraint Thomas reeled in the final breakaway rider and won the three second time bonus sprint that put him back only three seconds behind Van Avermaet in the general classification. With only about a kilometre to go Dan Martin attacked and was able to stay away and win the stage one second ahead of the bulk of the general classification contenders. Romain Bardet and Tom Dumoulin suffered mechanical issues late in the stage which made them lose time.[45][46] Stage seven was the longest stage. At the start of stage seven, Van Avermaet remained in the yellow jersey with Thomas in second at three seconds behind. The stage was won by Dylan Groenewegen. There were multiple crashes in the first week of the tour and after stage seven, six riders had abandoned the race for various reasons including the promising young Belgian Tiesj Benoot (LottoÿSoudal), Luis Le܇n Snchez (Astana),[47] and the green jersey winner of the 2017 Tour Michael Matthews.[48] This marked the end of the first week of the tour.\\r\\n\\r\\nGroenewegen then won his second sprint stage in a row. Notably, Greipel and Gaviria were penalized for headbutting each other and lost their placing and green jersey points.[49] Martin lost more than a minute after being involved in a crash during the stage. Van Avermaet improved his lead in the general classification after earning a single second in the bonus sprint.[50] Stage nine was the cobblestone stage that was a bad day for numerous sprinters and general classification riders. Richie Porte abandoned after a crash for the second year in a row.[51] Egan Bernal, Jakob Fuglsang, Chris Froome, and Mikel Landa crashed as did many other riders; many riders had flat tires as well, including Bardet who got three of them.[52] Meanwhile, Yves Lampaert (Quick-Step Floors), Degenkolb, and Van Avermaet survived the carnage going on around them to escape the remaining peloton and cross the finish together with Degenkolb winning his first Tour stage, as Van Avermaet gained time as well as another time bonus to extend his lead in the yellow jersey.[53] The following day was the Tour's first rest day.[36]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe first stage at high altitude and first in the Alps, the tenth, was won by Quick-Step Floors rider Julian Alaphilippe from a large breakaway that included race leader Van Avermaet. Eventually, Alaphillipe attacked and won his first Tour stage while Van Avermaet retained his yellow jersey and extended his lead to nearly two and a half minutes,[54] when many people thought he would not be retaining it.[55] Alaphillipe also took the mountains classification.[54] Thomas achieved back-to-back summit finish wins both from the group of favourites on stages eleven and twelve by pushing the breakaway riders until the very end. In the steep finish of the eleventh, Thomas attacked in the final kilometre and passed lone breakaway rider Mikel Nieve (MitcheltonÿScott) to take the win.[56] He won stage twelve from a sprint on flat finish atop Alpe d'Huez. Dumoulin and Froome arose as the likely contenders in Paris.[57] Sagan won stage thirteen after coming out of nowhere while Kristoff and Arnaud Dmare (GroupamaÿFDJ) dueled it out.[58] In stage fourteen, Omar Fraile of Astana came out of the breakaway and remarkably opened a twenty-minute gap to the main peloton with the yellow jersey contenders. After the Alps, it was basically down to three riders in contention, Thomas, Froome, and Dumoulin. There were many withdrawals after the Alps after names like Kittel, Mark Cavendish, Rigoberto Uran, Gaviria, Groenewegen, and Andre Griepel withdrew for various reasons. Vincenzo Nibali was forced to withdraw after fracturing a vertebrae in his back after being involved in an accident with a spectator near the summit of Alpe d'huez. Smoke from flares and animosity towards Froome were a factor and better security was called for by many people for the final week.[59]\\r\\n\\r\\nStage fifteen, the start of the final week, was once again a breakaway victory. Magnus Cort took Astana's second win in two days as there were no major changes overall.[60] The next day was the second rest day of the race.[36] Stage sixteen had a further incident when the police used tear gas against a protest by local farmers who had placed hay bales on the road. As the riders passed that point, there was still gas in the air. The race was neutralized for about fifteen minutes because several riders had problems with their eyes and had to rinse them.[61] After the restart, a large breakaway escaped and Philippe Gilbert (Quick-Step Floors), while in the lead on a descent, lost control of his bike and smashed into and over the wall. Later, Adam Yates, having taken the lead, fell on the final descent and handed the position and win to Alaphilippe, giving him his second stage win of the tour.[62]\\r\\n\\r\\nOn the first of the three Pyrenan stages, seventeen, Froome's challenge faded on the approach to the summit of the Col de Portet and he dropped to third position in the general classification, 2:31 behind Thomas. Dumoulin moved into second place, 1:59 off the lead. Nairo Quintana won the stage after attacking at the bottom of the final climb, moving himself up to fifth overall, behind Primo? Rogli?.[63] The flat stage eighteen was won by Demare from a sprint finish; by now most of the top sprint had now left the race and Sagan was suffering with injury.[64] On the mountainous stage nineteen from Lourdes to Laruns, Rogli? attacked on the final climb, the Col d'Aubisque, and soloed to the finish nineteen seconds ahead of the chasing group of overall favourites. Thomas was able to consolidate his position in the yellow jersey by picking up six bonus seconds in the sprint thereby extending his lead over Dumoulin to 2 min 5 s.[65] The penultimate stage was a 31?km (19.3?mi) time trial, Dumoulin won the stage, one second ahead of Froome. Thomas survived a scare when his back wheel locked, but completed the time trial successfully, finishing fourteen seconds behind Dumoulin taking a lead of 1 min 51 s into the final stage.[66] The stage was won by Kristoff in a bunch sprint on the Champs-lyses in Paris.[67]\\r\\n\\r\\nFour main individual classifications were contested in the 2018 Tour de France, as well as a team competition. The most important was the general classification, calculated by adding each rider's finishing times on each stage.[68] Time bonuses were awarded at the end of every stage apart from the time trial stages. The first three riders would get 10, 6, and 4 seconds, respectively. Time bonuses of three, two and one seconds, would be given to the first three riders to cross a \\"bonus point\\" in each of the first nine mass-start stages of the race. It would affect the general classification, but not the points.[69] For crashes within the final 3?km (1.9?mi) of a stage, not including time trials and summit finishes, any rider involved would receive the same time as the group he was in when the crash occurred.[70] The rider with the lowest cumulative time would be the winner of the general classification and the overall winner of the Tour.[68] The rider leading the classification would wear a yellow jersey.[71]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe second classification was the points classification. Riders received points for finishing among the highest placed in a stage finish, or in intermediate sprints during the stage. The points available for each stage finish were determined by the stage's type.[72] The leader was identified by a green jersey.[71]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe third classification was the mountains classification. Points were awarded to the riders that reached the summit of the most difficult climbs first. The climbs were categorized, in order of increasing difficulty, as fourth-, third-, second-, and first-category and hors catgorie (read: \\"beyond category\\").[72] Double points were awarded at the top of the last mountains in the three mountain stages in the Pyrenees (16, 17 and 19).[73] The leader wore a white jersey with red polka dots.[71]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe final individual classification was the young rider classification. This was calculated the same way as the general classification, but was restricted to riders born on or after 1 January 1993.[72] The leader wears a white jersey.[71]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe final classification was a team classification. This was calculated using the finishing times of the best three riders per team on each stage; the leading team was the team with the lowest cumulative time.

C?ng Ha), was a country in Southeast Asia from 1945 to 1976, although it did not achieve widespread recognition until 1954.[a]\\r\\nVietnamese revolutionary leader H? Ch Minh declared independence from France on 2 September 1945 and announced the creation of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam. France reasserted its colonial dominance and a war ensued between France and the Viet Minh, led by President Ho Chi Minh. The Viet Minh (\\"League for the Independence of Vietnam\\") was a coalition of nationalist groups, mostly led by communists. In February 1951, the communists announced the creation of the Lao ??ng Party (Labor Party), gradually marginalizing non-communists in the Vi?t Minh.[10]\\r\\nBetween 1946 and 1954, the Vi?t Minh captured and controlled most of the rural areas of Vietnam. In 1954, after the French were defeated, the negotiation of the Geneva Accords ended the war between France and the Vi?t Minh and granted Vietnam independence. The Geneva Accords divided the country provisionally into northern and southern zones, and stipulated general elections in July 1956 to \\"bring about the unification of Viet-Nam\\".[11] The northern zone was commonly called North Vietnam, and the southern zone was commonly called South Vietnam.\\r\\nSupervision of the implementation of the Geneva Accords was the responsibility of an international commission consisting of India, Canada, and Poland. The United States did not sign the Geneva Accords, which stated that the United States \\"shall continue to seek to achieve unity through free elections supervised by the United Nations to insure that they are conducted fairly\\".[12] In July 1955, the prime minister of the Republic of Vietnam, Ng? ?nh Di?m, announced that the Republic of Vietnam would not participate in elections to unify the country. He said that South Vietnam had not signed the Geneva Accords and was not bound by it.[13]\\r\\nAfter the failure to reunify Vietnam by elections, the Democratic Republic of Vietnam attempted to unify the country by force in the Vietnam War (1955ÿ75). North Vietnam and the Vi?t C?ng insurgents supported by their communist allies, including the Soviet Union and China, fought against the military of South Vietnam, the United States and other anti-communist military forces, including South Korea, Australia, Thailand, and smaller players. North Vietnam also supported indigenous communist rebels in Cambodia and Laos against their respective U.S.-backed governments. The war ended when North Vietnamese forces and the Vi?t C?ng defeated the Republic of Vietnam and in 1976 united the two parts of the country into the Socialist Republic of Vietnam. The expanded Democratic Republic retained North Vietnam's political culture under Soviet influence and continued its existing memberships in international organisations such as Comecon.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter about 300 years of partition by feudal dynasties, Vietnam was again under one single authority in 1802 when Gia Long founded the Nguy?n dynasty, but the country became a French protectorate after 1883 and under Japanese occupation after 1940 during World War II. Soon after Japan surrendered on September 2, 1945, the Vi?t Minh in the August Revolution entered Hanoi, and the Democratic Republic of Vietnam was proclaimed on September 2, 1945: a government for the entire country, replacing the Nguy?n dynasty.[14] H? Ch Minh became leader of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam. U.S. President Franklin Roosevelt had spoken against French rule in Indochina, and U.S.A. was supportive of the Viet Minh at this time.\\r\\nThe Democratic Republic of Vietnam under Ho Chi Minh claimed dominion over all of Vietnam, but during this time South Vietnam was in profound political disorder. The successive collapse of French, then Japanese power, followed by the dissension among the political factions in Saigon had been accompanied by widespread violence in the countryside.[15][16] On August 16, 1945, H? Ch Minh organized the National Congress in Tan Tro. The Congress adopted 10 major policies of the Vi?t Minh, passed the General Uprising Order, decided the National Flag, in the middle with 5-pointed gold star, selected the national anthem and selected the National Committee for the Liberation of Vietnam, later becoming the Provisional Revolutionary Government, led by H? Ch Minh.[17] On September 12, 1945, the first British troops arrived in Saigon. On September 23, 28 days after the people of Saigon seized political power, French troops occupied the police stations, the post office, and other public buildings. The salient political fact of life in Northern Vietnam was Chinese Nationalist army of occupation, and the Chinese presence had forced Ho Chi Minh and the Viet Minh to accommodate Chinese-backed Viet Nationalists. In June 1946, Chinese Nationalist troops evacuated Hanoi, and on the 15th of June, the last detachments embarked at Haiphong. After the departure of the British in 1946, the French controlled a part of Cochinchina, South Central Coast, Central Highlands since the end Southern Resistance War. In January 1946, the Viet Minh held an election to establish a National Assembly. Public enthusiasm for this event suggests that the Viet Minh enjoyed a great deal of popularity at this time, although there were few competitive races and the party makeup of the Assembly was determined in advance of the vote.[b]\\r\\nOn September 18 and 19, 1945, the Vi?t Minh held secret meetings with Vi?t Cch (September 18, 1945) and Vi?t Qu?c (September 19, 1945). In these two meetings, Nguy?n H?i Th?n represented Vi?t Cch and Nguy?n T??ng Tam represent Vi?t Qu?c. H? Ch Minh agree to unite the Vi?t Minh with Vi?t Cch and Vi?t Qu?c. Thus, the Government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam led by the Vi?t Minh will receive the financial and political support of the Republic of China. For this proposal, within the Vi?t Minh there are many different opinions. V? Nguyn Gip disagrees with the suggestion that the proposals are not valid and not honest, as if replacing French colonialism with Chinese domination, but Hong Minh Gim thought that the unification of Vietnam With the Nationalist parties will reduce the opposition and strengthen the power of the Vi?t Minh, as the Chinese are relieved and the French have to worry. Eventually the Vi?t Minh under H? Ch Minh refused to merge with the Pro-Chinese Vi?t Cch and the Vi?t Qu?c League.[21]\\r\\nOn January 6, 1946, President H? Ch Minh held the nationwide General Election which voted for the first time and passed the Constitution. Many parties did not have the right to participate in General Elections seeking to undermine . These parties claimed to be the only Vi?t Minh communist, the government in the hands of the Vi?t Minh want anyone to win it. The two opposition parties in the government are the Vietnams Nationalist Party (Vi?t Qu?c) and the Vietnam Cch m?nh ??ng minh (Vi?t Cch) did not participate in the election although H? Ch Minh previously sent a letter to Nguy?n H?i Th?n leader of Vi?t Cch and V? H?ng Khanh leader of Vi?t Qu?c. H? Ch Minh invites Vi?t Qu?c and Vi?t Cch to attend the General Election and urges the two sides not to attack each other with words or actions until the Congress opens. Former Prime Minister Tr?n Tr?ng Kim said there were places where people were forced to vote for the Vi?t Minh.[22] According to the Vi?t Minh, the election was fair.[23] Despite being campaigned by many parties to campaign for the people to boycott the election and block the election in some places, where there are self-nominated candidates, publicly run, free elections are taking place everywhere. After the election results are announced, the truth is not the same as the propaganda parties. Many prestigious delegates of classes, classes, religions and ethnic groups were elected in the First National Assembly, most of them not party members.[24]\\r\\nThe presence of Chiang Kai-shek's army up to that time ensured the survival of Vietnams Nationalist Party and Vi?t Cch. These two parties did not have a cohesive program to enlist the people like the Vi?t Minh[25] The leaders of the Vietnams Nationalist Party and the Vi?t Cch Revolutionary Party are far from having comparable qualities with H? Ch Minh, V? Nguyn Gip, and other responsible Vi?t Minh members. When the Chinese nationalist army withdrawal from Vietnam on June 15, 1946, in one way or another, V? Nguy?n Gip, decided that the Vi?t Minh had to completely control the government. V? Nguy?n Gip is in immediate action with the goal of spreading Vi?t Minh leadership: the Allied Powers are supported by the Vietnams Nationalist Party (according to Cecil B. Currey, this organization borrows the revolutionary name of Vietnams Nationalist Party of 1930 was founded by Nguy?n Thi H?c and, according to David G. Marr, the Vietnamese Communist Party under H? Ch Minh tried to banned the Pro-Chinese Nationalist Party in Vietnam[26] betraying the revolutionary cause of Nguy?n Thi H?c in 1930. By the end of 1945, many people still did not believe in it.) The pro-Japan nationalist group, the Trotskyists, the anti-French nationalists, the Catholic group called \\"Catholic soldiers.\\" V? Nguy?n Gip has gradually sought to phase out these parties. On June 19, 1946, the Vi?t Minh Journal reportedly vehemently criticized \\"reactionaries sabotage the Franco-Vietnamese preliminary agreement on 6 March\\". Shortly thereafter, V? Nguy?n Gip began a campaign to pursue opposition parties by police and military forces controlled by the Vi?t Minh with the help of the French authorities. He also used soldiers, Japanese officers volunteered to stay in Vietnam and some of the supplies provided by France (in Hn Gai French troops provided the Vi?t Minh with cannons to kill some of the positions commanded by the Great Occupation) in this campaign.\\r\\nWhen France declared Cochinchina, the southern third of Vietnam, a separate state as the \\"Autonomous Republic of Cochinchina\\" in June 1946, Vietnamese nationalists reacted with fury. In November, the National Assembly adopted the first Constitution of the Republic.[27]\\r\\nThe French reoccupied Hanoi and the First Indochina War (1946ÿ54) followed. Following the Chinese Communist Revolution (1946?50), Chinese communist forces arrived on the border in 1949. Chinese aid revived the fortunes of the Viet Minh and transformed it from a guerrilla militia into a standing army. The outbreak of the Korean War in June 1950 transformed what had been an anti-colonial struggle into a Cold War battleground, with the U.S. providing financial support to the French.\\r\\nFollowing the partition of Vietnam in 1954 at the end of the First Indochina War, more than one million North Vietnamese migrated to South Vietnam,[28] under the U.S.-led evacuation campaign named Operation Passage to Freedom,[29] with an estimated 60% of the north's one million Catholics fleeing south.[30][31] The Catholic migration is attributed to an expectation of persecution of Catholics by the North Vietnamese government, as well as publicity employed by the Saigon government of the President Ngo Dinh Diem.[32] The CIA ran a propaganda campaign to get Catholics to come to the south. However Colonel Edward Lansdale, the man credited with the campaign, rejected the notion that his campaign had much effect on popular sentiment.[33] The Viet Minh sought to detain or otherwise prevent would-be refugees from leaving, such as through intimidation through military presence, shutting down ferry services and water traffic, or prohibiting mass gatherings.[34] Concurrently, between 14,000 and 45,000 civilians and approximately 100,000 Viet Minh fighters moved in the opposite direction.[30][35][36]\\r\\nLand reform was an integral part of the Viet Minh and communist Democratic Republic of Vietnam. A Viet Minh Land Reform Law of 4 December 1953 called for (1) confiscation of land belonging to landlords who were enemies of the regime; (2) requisition of land from landlords not judged to be enemies; and (3) purchase with payment in bonds. The land reform was carried out from 1953 to 1956. Some farming areas did not undergo land reform but only rent reduction and the highland areas occupied by minority peoples were not substantially impacted. Some land was retained by the government but most was distributed without payment with priority given to Viet Minh fighters and their families.[37] The total number of rural people impacted by the land reform program was more than 4 million. The rent reduction program impacted nearly 8 million people.[38]\\r\\nThe land reform program was a success in terms of distributing much land to poor and landless peasants and reducing or eliminating the land holdings of landlords and rich peasants. However it was carried out with violence and repression primarily directed against large landowners identified, sometimes incorrectly, as landlords.[39] On 18 August 1956, North Vietnamese leader Ho Chi Minh acknowledged the serious errors the government had made in the land reform program. Too many farmers, he said, had been incorrectly classified as \\"landlords\\" and executed or imprisoned and too many mistakes had been made in redistributing land. Severe rioting protesting the excesses of the land reform program broke out in November 1956 in one largely Catholic rural district. About 1,000 people were killed or injured and several thousand imprisoned. Democratic Republic of Vietnam initiated a \\"correction campaign\\" which by 1958 had resulted in the return of land to many of those harmed by the land reform.[40] As part of the correction campaign as many as 23,748 political prisoners were released by North Vietnam by September 1957.[41]\\r\\nExecutions and imprisonment of persons classified as \\"landlords\\" or enemies of the state were contemplated from the beginning of the land reform program. A Politburo document dated 4 May 1953 said that executions were \\"fixed in principle at the ratio of one per one thousand people of the total population.\\" .[42] The number of persons actually executed by communist cadre carrying out the land reform program has been variously estimated. Some estimates of those killed range up to 200,000.[43] Other scholarship has concluded that the higher estimates were based on political propaganda emanating from South Vietnam and that the actual total of those executed was probably much lower. Scholar Edwin E. Moise estimated the total number of executions at between 3,000 and 15,000 and later came up with a more precise figure of 13,500.[44] Moise's conclusions were supported by documents of Hungarian diplomats living in Democratic Republic of Vietnam at the time of the land reform.[45] Author Michael Lind in a 2013 book gives a similar estimate of \\"at least ten or fifteen thousand\\" executed.[46]\\r\\nThe ultimate objective of the land reform program of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam government was not to achieve equitable distribution of farmland but rather the organization of all farmers into co-operatives in which land and other factors of agricultural production would be owned and used collectively.[47] The first steps after the 1953-1956 land reform were the encouragement by the government of labor exchanges in which farmers would unite to exchange labor; secondly in 1958 and 1959 was the formation of \\"low level cooperatives\\" in which farmers cooperated in production. By 1961, 86 percent of farmers were members of low-level cooperatives. The third step beginning in 1961 was to organize \\"high level cooperatives\\", true collective farming in which land and resources were utilized collectively without individual ownership of land.[48] By 1971, the great majority of farmers in North Vietnam were organized into high-level cooperatives. Collective farms were abandoned gradually in the 1980s and 1990s.[49]\\r\\nAfter the fall of Saigon on 30 April 1975, the Provisional Revolutionary Government of the Republic of South Vietnam, or Vietcong, alongside the North Vietnamese Army, governed South Vietnam during the period before reunification. However it was seen as a vassal government of North Vietnam.[50][51][52] North and South Vietnam were officially reunited under one state on 2 July 1976, forming the Socialist Republic of Vietnam which continues to administer the country today.\\r\\nFrom 1960, the North Vietnamese government went to war with Republic of Vietnam via its proxy the Viet Cong, in an attempt to annex South Vietnam and reunify Vietnam under a communist party.[53] North Vietnamese and Viet Cong forces and supplies were sent along the Ho Chi Minh trail. In 1964 the United States sent combat troops to South Vietnam to support the South Vietnamese government, but the U.S. had advisors there since 1950. Other nations, including Australia, the Republic of Korea, Thailand and New Zealand also contributed troops and military aid to South Vietnam's war effort. China and the Soviet Union provided aid to and troops in support of North Vietnamese military activities. This was known as the Vietnam War, or the American War in Vietnam itself (1955ÿ75). In addition to the Viet Cong in South Vietnam, other communist insurgencies also operated within neighboring Kingdom of Laos and Khmer Republic, both formerly part of the French colonial territory of Indochina. These were the Pathet Lao and the Khmer Rouge, respectively. These insurgencies were aided by the North Vietnamese government, which sent troops to fight alongside them.\\r\\nDemocratic Republic of Vietnam was diplomatically isolated by many Western states, and many other anti-communist states worldwide throughout most of the North's history, as these states only extended recognition to the anti-communist government of South Vietnam. North Vietnam however, was recognized by almost all Communist countries, such as the Soviet Union and other Socialist countries of Eastern Europe and Central Asia, China, North Korea, and Cuba, and received aid from these nations. North Vietnam refused to establish diplomatic relations with Yugoslavia from 1950 to 1957, perhaps reflecting Hanoi's deference to the Soviet line on the Yugoslav government of Josip Broz Tito, and North Vietnamese officials continued to be critical of Tito after relations were established.[54][55] Several non-aligned countries also recognized North Vietnam, mostly, similar to India, according North Vietnam de facto rather than de jure (formal) recognition.[56]\\r\\nIn 1969, Sweden became the first Western country to extend full diplomatic recognition to North Vietnam.[57] Many other Western countries followed suit in the 1970s, such as the government of Australia under Gough Whitlam.\\r\\nCoordinates: 2102N 10551E? / ?21.033N 105.850E? / 21.033; 105.850","input":"What was the capital of north vietnam in the mid 1950s?"},{"output":"Christianity","context":"The world's principal religions and spiritual traditions may be classified into a small number of major groups, although this is by no means a uniform practice. This theory began in the 18th century with the goal of recognizing the relative levels of civility in societies.[1]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nIn world cultures, there have traditionally been many different groupings of religious belief. In Indian culture, different religious philosophies were traditionally respected as academic differences in pursuit of the same truth. In Islam, the Quran mentions three different categories: Muslims, the People of the Book, and idol worshipers. Initially, Christians had a simple dichotomy of world beliefs: Christian civility versus foreign heresy or barbarity. In the 18th century, \\"heresy\\" was clarified to mean Judaism and Islam;[citation needed][2] along with paganism, this created a fourfold classification which spawned such works as John Toland's Nazarenus, or Jewish, Gentile, and Mahometan Christianity,[3] which represented the three Abrahamic religions as different \\"nations\\" or sects within religion itself, the \\"true monotheism.\\"\\r\\nDaniel Defoe described the original definition as follows: \\"Religion is properly the Worship given to God, but 'tis also applied to the Worship of Idols and false Deities.\\"[4] At the turn of the 19th century, in between 1780 and 1810, the language dramatically changed: instead of \\"religion\\" being synonymous with spirituality, authors began using the plural, \\"religions,\\" to refer to both Christianity and other forms of worship. Therefore, Hannah Adams's early encyclopedia, for example, had its name changed from An Alphabetical Compendium of the Various Sects... to A Dictionary of All Religions and Religious Denominations.[5][6]\\r\\nIn 1838, the four-way division of Christianity, Judaism, Mahommedanism (archaic terminology for Islam) and Paganism was multiplied considerably by Josiah Conder's Analytical and Comparative View of All Religions Now Extant among Mankind. Conder's work still adhered to the four-way classification, but in his eye for detail he puts together much historical work to create something resembling our modern Western image: he includes Druze, Yezidis, Mandeans, and Elamites[clarification needed] [7] under a list of possibly monotheistic groups, and under the final category, of \\"polytheism and pantheism,\\" he listed Zoroastrianism, \\"Vedas, Puranas, Tantras, Reformed sects\\" of India as well as \\"Brahminical idolatry,\\" Buddhism, Jainism, Sikhism, Lamaism, \\"religion of China and Japan,\\" and \\"illiterate superstitions\\" as others.[8][9]\\r\\nThe modern meaning of the phrase \\"world religion,\\" putting non-Christians at the same level as Christians, began with the 1893 Parliament of the World's Religions in Chicago. The Parliament spurred the creation of a dozen privately funded lectures with the intent of informing people of the diversity of religious experience: these lectures funded researchers such as William James, D. T. Suzuki, and Alan Watts, who greatly influenced the public conception of world religions.[10]\\r\\nIn the latter half of the 20th century, the category of \\"world religion\\" fell into serious question, especially for drawing parallels between vastly different cultures, and thereby creating an arbitrary separation between the religious and the secular.[11] Even history professors have now taken note of these complications and advise against teaching \\"world religions\\" in schools.[12] Others see the shaping of religions in the context of the nation-state as the \\"invention of traditions.\\"\\r\\nReligious traditions fall into super-groups in comparative religion, arranged by historical origin and mutual influence. Abrahamic religions originate in West Asia,[13][14] Indian religions in the Indian subcontinent (South Asia)[15] and East Asian religions in East Asia.[16] Another group with supra-regional influence are Afro-American religion,[17] which have their origins in Central and West Africa.\\r\\nOne way to define a major religion is by the number of current adherents. The population numbers by religion are computed by a combination of census reports and population surveys (in countries where religion data is not collected in census, for example the United States or France), but results can vary widely depending on the way questions are phrased, the definitions of religion used and the bias of the agencies or organizations conducting the survey. Informal or unorganized religions are especially difficult to count.\\r\\nThere is no consensus among researchers as to the best methodology for determining the religiosity profile of the world's population. A number of fundamental aspects are unresolved:\\r\\nWorldwide percentage of Adherents by Religion, 2010[28]\\r\\nThe table (below) and the pie chart list religions classified by philosophy; however, religious philosophy is not always the determining factor in local practice. Please note that this table includes heterodox movements as adherents to their larger philosophical category, although this may be disputed by others within that category. For example, Christianity and Islam include those who are culturally Christian and Muslim as well as indigenous people combining folk religions or shamanism with either.\\r\\nThe population numbers below are computed by a combination of census reports, random surveys (in countries where religion data is not collected in census, for example the United States or France), and self-reported attendance numbers, but results can vary widely depending on the way questions are phrased, the definitions of religion used and the bias of the agencies or organizations conducting the survey. Informal or unorganized religions are especially difficult to count. Some organizations may wildly inflate their numbers.\\r\\nThe following are medium-sized world religions:\\r\\nSince the late 19th century, the demographics of religion have changed a great deal. On the one hand, since the 19th century, large areas of Sub-Saharan Africa have been converted to Christianity, and this area of the world has the highest population growth rate. On the other hand, some countries with a historically large Christian population have experienced a significant decline in the numbers of professed active Christians: see demographics of atheism. Symptoms of the decline in active participation in Christian religious life include declining recruitment for the priesthood and monastic life, as well as diminishing attendance at church. In the realm of Western culture, there has been an increase in the number of people who identify themselves as secular humanists. In many countries, such as the People's Republic of China, communist governments have discouraged religion, making it difficult to count the actual number of believers. However, after the collapse of communism in numerous countries of Eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union, religious life has been experiencing resurgence there, both in the form of traditional Eastern Christianity and particularly in the forms of Neopaganism and East Asian religions.[citation needed]\\r\\nFollowing is some available data based on the work of the World Christian Encyclopedia:[47]","input":"What is the main religion in the world?"},{"output":"World War I","context":"The choice of whether to use daylight saving time (DST) in Australia is a matter for the individual states and territories. However, during World War I and World War II all states and territories had daylight saving. In 1968 Tasmania became the first state since the war to practise daylight saving. In 1971, New South Wales, Victoria, Queensland, South Australia, and the Australian Capital Territory followed Tasmania by observing daylight saving. Western Australia and the Northern Territory did not. Queensland abandoned daylight saving time in 1972. Queensland and Western Australia have observed daylight saving over the past 40 years from time to time on trial bases.\\r\\nNew South Wales, the Australian Capital Territory, Victoria, Tasmania and South Australia observe DST every year. This has resulted in three time zones becoming five during the daylight-saving period. South Australia time becomes UTC+10:30, called Central Daylight Time (CDT), possibly with \\"Australia\\" prefixed (ACDT). The time in the southeastern states becomes UTC+11, using \\"Eastern\\" in the time zone name, Eastern Daylight Time (EDT), respectively Australia Eastern Daylight Time (AEDT).\\r\\nOfficially, the change to and from DST takes place at 2:00 am local standard time (which is 3:00 am DST) on the appropriate Sunday.\\r\\nOf the states that observe DST, most began on the last Sunday in October, and ended on the last Sunday in March, until 2008.

From the 2008/09 period, the start of DST in these states and in South Australia commences on the first Sunday in October and ends on the first Sunday in April. Western Australia became the only state to observe daylight saving from the last Sunday in October to the last Sunday in March. Since 2009 Western Australia no longer observes daylight saving.[1]\\r\\nQueensland (AEST UTC+10), Northern Territory (ACST UTC+9:30) and Western Australia (AWST UTC+8) do not observe DST.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nQueensland has had a particularly involved debate over daylight-saving time, with public opinion geographically divided. A referendum on daylight saving, was held on 22 February 1992, following a three-year trial (1989/90 - 1991/92), and was defeated with a 54.5% 'no' vote.[full citation needed] [4] The referendum result displayed a distinct trend - that public opinion on daylight saving in Queensland is geographically divided, with the no vote strongest in the north and west regional districts, while the yes vote was strongest in the states metropolitan south-east.[5]\\r\\nSince the early 2000s, there have been a number of petitions submitted to Queensland Parliament, lobbying for the introduction of daylight-saving time or for another referendum to be held. A petition in 2006 was signed by 62,232 people.[6] In response to these petitions, then Queensland Premier Peter Beattie commissioned research to find out if daylight-saving time should be re-introduced into Queensland. Around this time, Premier Peter Beattie claimed that daylight-saving time in Queensland would increase the rate of skin cancer in the state, an unfounded claim for which there is no evidence according to the Queensland Cancer Fund.[full citation needed] [7]\\r\\nIn October 2007, the completed government-commissioned research was presented to a newly sworn-in Premier Anna Bligh, who ruled out holding a new referendum, despite the report indicating 59% of Queensland residents and 69% of South East Queenslanders to be in favour of adopting daylight-saving time.[8]\\r\\nIn December 2008, the Daylight Saving for South East Queensland (DS4SEQ) political Party was officially registered, advocating the implementation of a dual-time zone arrangement for Daylight Saving in South East Queensland while the remainder of the state maintains standard time. The party contested the March 2009 Queensland State election with 32 candidates and received around one percent of the statewide primary vote, equating to around 2.5% across the 32 electorates contested.[9]\\r\\nIn early 2010, the DS4SEQ political party approached independent Member, Peter Wellington, to introduce a private member's Bill for daylight saving.[10] As Wellington agreed with the principles of the DS4SEQ proposal, specifically the dual time zone arrangement, he drafted the Daylight Saving for South East Queensland Referendum Bill 2010 and tabled the Bill into Queensland Parliament on 14 April 2010.[11] Wellington has called for a referendum to be held at the next State election on the introduction of daylight saving into south-east Queensland under a dual-time zone arrangement.\\r\\nIn response to this Bill, Premier of Queensland, Anna Bligh, announced a community consultation process, which resulted in over 74,000 respondents participating, 64 percent of whom voted in favour of a trial and 63% were in favour of holding a referendum.[12] The decision announced by the Premier on 7 June 2010 was that her Government would not support the Bill, because regional Queenslanders were overwhelmingly opposed to daylight saving.[13] The Bill was defeated in Queensland Parliament on 15 June 2011.[14]\\r\\nWestern Australia also had a particularly involved debate over daylight-saving time, with the issue being put to a referendum four times, 1975, 1984, 1992 and 2009. All were defeated. Voters returned a \\"no\\" vote of 54.57% in 2009, the highest in all four referendums. Each referendum followed a trial period during which the state observed daylight saving time. The first three followed a one-year trial, while the 2006 Western Australian Daylight Saving Bill (No. 2) 2006 instituted a daylight-saving trial that began on 3 December 2006 and lasted for three years.[15] The referendum was defeated in 2009.\\r\\nIn 2000, all eastern jurisdictions that normally observe daylight-saving time  New South Wales, Victoria, the Australian Capital Territory and Tasmania  started daylight-saving time early, due to the 2000 Summer Olympics in Sydney.

South Australia did not change until the regular time, which that year was on 29 October.\\r\\nIn 2006, all states that followed daylight-saving time (the above listed states plus South Australia) delayed the return to their respective Standard Times by a week, due to the 2006 Commonwealth Games in Melbourne. Daylight-saving time ended on 2 April 2006.\\r\\nDaylight saving was first used in Australia during World War I, and was applied in all states. It was used again during the Second World War. A drought in Tasmania in 1967 led to the reintroduction of daylight saving in that state during the summer, and this was repeated every summer since then. In 1971, New South Wales, Victoria,[16] Queensland, South Australia, and the Australian Capital Territory followed Tasmania by observing daylight saving. Western Australia and the Northern Territory did not. Queensland abandoned daylight saving time in 1972.[17]\\r\\nOriginally Tasmania alone commenced daylight saving on the first Sunday in October, while the other states began on the last Sunday in October and finished on the last Sunday in March, until 2008. From 2008/09 daylight saving has been extended another four weeks in NSW, Victoria, SA and the ACT, in addition to Tasmania, from the first Sunday in October to the first Sunday in April.\\r\\nQueensland again trialled daylight saving, for three years between 1989 and 1992, with a referendum on daylight saving held on 22 February 1992, which was defeated with a 54.5% no vote - with regional and rural areas strongly opposed, while those in the metropolitan South East Queensland were in favour.[18]\\r\\nIn December 2008, the Daylight Saving for South East Queensland (DS4SEQ) political party was officially registered, advocating the implementation of a dual-time zone arrangement for Daylight Saving in South East Queensland while the rest of the state maintains standard time.[19] The party contested the March 2009 Queensland State election with 32 candidates and received around one percent of the statewide primary vote, equating to around 2.5% across the 32 electorates contested.[20]\\r\\nOn 14 April 2010, and after being approached by the Daylight Saving for South East Queensland (DS4SEQ) political party, Queensland Independent member Peter Wellington, introduced the Daylight Saving for South East Queensland Referendum Bill 2010 into Queensland Parliament, calling for a referendum to be held at the next State election on the introduction of daylight saving into South East Queensland under a dual-time zone arrangement.[21] The Bill was defeated in Queensland Parliament on 15 June 2011.[22]\\r\\nIn Western Australia, four referendums in 1975, 1984, 1992 and 2009 have rejected DST.[23] In 2006, the Parliament of Western Australia approved a three-year daylight saving trial to be followed by a referendum to decide whether DST should be put in place permanently. However, public opposition mounted during the first year of the trial,[24] and the WA Nationals announced a public campaign to bring the referendum forward to 2007.[25] The trial continued until the referendum, held on 16 May 2009.[26] The result was another rejection of DST, by a larger margin compared to the three previous referendums. Although as previously the suburbs of the state capital, Perth, supported the proposal, it was by a much narrower margin than before with significant swings against it in several areas, most notably in the East Metropolitan region. As a result, the Premier of Western Australia has said that the DST issue should not be considered for at least another 20 years.[27]\\r\\nDespite this, in September 2016 the Daylight Saving Party was established by Wilson Tucker to contest seats in the Legislative Council at the upcoming 2017 state election. Tucker argued that in the seven years since the last referendum there had been a generational shift in Western Australia and that the fifth referendum would be successful.[28] The party won 0.68% of the vote, or 9,209 votes statewide, but failed to win any seat in the Legislative Council.\\r\\nThe Northern Territory experimented with daylight saving in the early part of the 20th century. It was last used in 1944.","input":"When was daylight saving first introduced to australia?"},{"output":"Karikala Chola","context":"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe  Cholas of the pre and post Sangam period (400 BCE ÿ 200 CE) were one of the three main kingdoms of the ancient Tamil country. Their early capitals were Urayur and  Kaveripattinam. Along with Pandyas and Cheras, Chola history goes back to the period where the history is covered with the mists of time.\\r\\n\\r\\nAncient Tamil Nadu contained three monarchical states, headed by kings called Vendhar and several chieftaincies, headed by the chiefs called by the general denomination Vel or Velir.[1] Still lower at the local level there were clan chiefs called kizhar or mannar.[2] The Tamil area had an independent existence outside the control of these northern empires. The Tamil kings and chiefs were always in conflict with each other mostly over property. The royal courts were mostly places of social gathering rather than places of dispensation of authority; they were centres for distribution of resources.[3]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe names of the three dynasties, Cholas, Pandyas, and Cheras, are mentioned in the Pillars of Ashoka (inscribed 273ÿ232 BCE) inscriptions, among the kingdoms, which though not subject to Ashoka, were on friendly terms with him.[4][5] The king of Kalinga, Kharavela, who ruled around 150 BCE, mentioned in the famous Hathigumpha inscription of the confederacy of the Tamil kingdoms that had existed for over 100 years.[6] Karikala Chola was the most famous early Chola. He is mentioned in a number of poems in the Tamil Sangam literature.[7]\\r\\n\\r\\nAnother source for the available information of the early Cholas is the early Tamil literature of the Sangam Period. There are also brief notices on the Chola country and its towns, ports and commerce furnished by the Periplus of the Erythraean Sea (Periplus Maris Erythraei). Periplus is a work by an anonymous Alexandrian merchant, written in the time of Domitian (81 ÿ 96 CE) and contains precious information of the Chola country. Writing half a century later, the geographer Ptolemy has more to tell us about the Chola country, its port and its inland cities.\\r\\n\\r\\nMahavamsa, a Buddhist text, also recounts a number of conflicts between the inhabitants of Ceylon and the Tamil immigrants from Chola Country.\\r\\n\\r\\nChronicles such as the Yalpana Vaipava Malai and stone inscriptions like Konesar Kalvettu recount that Kulakkottan, an early Chola king and descendant of Manu Needhi Cholan, was the restorer of the ruined Koneswaram temple and tank at Trincomalee in 438 CE, the Munneswaram temple of the west coast, and as the royal who settled ancient Vanniar (not to confuse with present-day Vanniar or Palli caste .[8][9]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe inscriptions of the Medieval Cholas are replete with history about the Early Chola kings. The Cholas were looked upon as descended from the sun. These historic incidents speak of the Chola king Kantaman, supposed contemporary of the sage Agastya, whose devotion brought the river Kavery into existence. There is also the story of the king Manu who sentenced his son to death for having accidentally killed a calf. Mahavamasa portrays King Elara who was defeated by Duttha Gamini (c. 3rd century BCE) as the just king who '..had a bell with a rope attached at the head of his bed, so that all who sought redress might ring it..'. King Sibi who rescued a dove from a hawk by giving his own flesh to the hungry hawk was also part of the early Chola history. \\r\\n\\r\\nThese historic incidents received enormous emphasis in the later Chola period in the long mythical genealogies incorporated into the copper-plate charters of the 10th and 11th centuries. The earliest version of this is found in the Anbil Plates which gives fifteen names before Vijayalaya Cholan including the  historical ones of Karikala, Perunarkilli and Kocengannan. The Thiruvalangadu Plate swells this list to forty-four, and the Kanyakumari Plate runs up to fifty-two. There are other lists gathered from literary works such as Kalingathuparani. No two of these lists agree, although some names and details are common to all.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe earliest Chola kings of whom we have tangible evidence are those mentioned in the Sangam literature, written in the period 200 BCEÿ300 CE.[10][11] Unfortunately, it has not been possible to piece together an internal chronology of the Sangam works. Due to this, we know of several rulers, but not their chronology. All three kings have been portrayed as fighting the war or involved in feeding both the armies at that legendary war.\\r\\n\\r\\nKarikala Chola (c. 90 BCE) stands pre-eminent amongst all those mentioned in Pattinappaalai. Karikala's father was Ilamcetcenni, a brave king and a hard fighter. 'Karikala' means 'elephant feller' or 'charred leg', which is assumed to be a reference to an accident by fire which befell the prince early in his life. Pattinappaalai describes this accident and the enterprising way in which the prince escaped and established himself in the Chola throne. Pattinappalai is a long poem on the then Chola capital Kaveripattinam. This work also describes the numerous battles Karikala fought against the other two Tamil kings in one of which the Chera king was disgraced (received a wound on his back) and committed suicide. Karikala thus broke the confederacy that was formed against him and established hegemony over Pandyas and Cheras.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn later times Karikala was the subject of many legends found in the Cilappatikaram and in inscriptions and literary works of the 11th and 12th centuries. They attribute to him the conquest of the whole of India up to the Himalayas and the construction of the flood banks, Grand Anicut, of the Kaveri River with the aid of his feudatories. These legends however are conspicuous by their absence in the works of Sangam.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe poet Kovur Kilar mentions a protracted civil war between two Chola chieftains Nalankilli and Nedunkilli. Nedunkilli shut himself in a fort in Avur, which was being besieged by Mavalattan, Nalankilli's younger brother. The poet chided Nedunkilli to come out and fight like a man instead of causing untold misery to the people of the city.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn another poem, the poet begs both the princes to give up the civil war as whoever wins, the loser will be a Chola.\\r\\n\\r\\nKalavali by Poygayar mentions the Chola King Kocengannan and his battle with the Chera king Kanaikkal Irumporai. The Chera was taken prisoner and Poygayar, who was a friend of the Chera, sang a poem praising the Chola King Kochchenganan in 40 stanzas. The Chola king, pleased with the work, released the Chera. Kalavali describes the battle fought at Kalumalam, near the Chera capital. Kocengannan is one of the 63 nayanars.\\r\\n\\r\\nKocengannan became the subject of many instances in later times and is portrayed as a pious Siva devotee who built many fine temples for Siva along the banks of the river Kaveri.\\r\\n\\r\\nSangam literature gives an unusually complete and true picture of the social and economic conditions during the early chola period. The culture is best described as an amalgam of the Dravidian and Aryan. The stories of Mahabharata and Ramayana were well known to the Tamil people, shown by the claims of some kings to have fed both the opposing army in the Mahabharata War. The claim that Shibi, who gave his own flesh to save a dove, as a Chola is obviously influenced by northern legends.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe land of the Cholas was fertile and there was ample food. Sangam poems say that in the Chola country watered by the river Kaveri, in a space in which an elephant could lie, one can produce enough grain to feed seven.\\r\\n\\r\\nHereditary monarchy was the prevailing form of government. Disputed succession and civil war was not uncommon. The sphere of the state activity was limited. In a society steeped in respect for custom, even the most perverse dictator could not have done much harm.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Chola monarchs were approachable by subjects and justice was meted out directly by the king in most occasions. This is in marked contrast to the magnificent empires of the later Cholas where the Emperor was kept much away from contact with the lay people. The kings often took the field in person in battles and if the kings was killed or wounded in battle, his army immediately gave up the fight and surrendered.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe trade that flourished between the Chola country and the ancient Roman Empire is given in much detail by Periplus of the Erythraean Sea (c. 75 CE).","input":"Who is considered the greatest of the early chola kings?"},{"output":"One World Trade Center","context":"This list of the tallest buildings in the United States includes all buildings of 700?ft (213?m) or higher by architectural height, excluding antennas.

Since 1990, the prize is awarded on 10 December in Oslo City Hall each year.

As he was a trained chemical engineer, the categories for chemistry and physics were obvious choices. The reasoning behind the peace prize is less clear. According to the Norwegian Nobel Committee, his friendship with Bertha von Suttner, a peace activist and later recipient of the prize, profoundly influenced his decision to include peace as a category.[6] Some Nobel scholars suggest it was Nobel's way to compensate for developing destructive forces. His inventions included dynamite and ballistite, both of which were used violently during his lifetime. Ballistite was used in war[7] and the Irish Republican Brotherhood, an Irish nationalist organization, carried out dynamite attacks in the 1880s.[8] Nobel was also instrumental in turning Bofors from an iron and steel producer into an armaments company.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt is unclear why Nobel wished the Peace Prize to be administered in Norway, which was ruled in union with Sweden at the time of Nobel's death. The Norwegian Nobel Committee speculates that Nobel may have considered Norway better suited to awarding the prize, as it did not have the same militaristic traditions as Sweden.  It also notes that at the end of the 19th century, the Norwegian parliament had become closely involved in the Inter-Parliamentary Union's efforts to resolve conflicts through mediation and arbitration.[6]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Norwegian Parliament appoints the Norwegian Nobel Committee, which selects the Nobel Peace Prize laureate.\\r\\n\\r\\nEach year, the Norwegian Nobel Committee specifically invites qualified people to submit nominations for the Nobel Peace Prize.[9] The statutes of the Nobel Foundation specify categories of individuals who are eligible to make nominations for the Nobel Peace Prize.[10] These nominators are:\\r\\n\\r\\nNominations must usually be submitted to the Committee by the beginning of February in the award year.  Nominations by committee members can be submitted up to the date of the first Committee meeting after this deadline.[10]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 2009, a record 205 nominations were received,[11] but the record was broken again in 2010 with 237 nominations; in 2011, the record was broken once again with 241 nominations.[12] The statutes of the Nobel Foundation do not allow information about nominations, considerations, or investigations relating to awarding the prize to be made public for at least 50 years after a prize has been awarded.[13] Over time, many individuals have become known as \\"Nobel Peace Prize Nominees\\", but this designation has no official standing, and means only that one of the thousands of eligible nominators suggested the person's name for consideration.[14] Indeed, in 1939, Adolf Hitler received a satirical nomination from a member of the Swedish parliament, mocking the (serious but unsuccessful) nomination of Neville Chamberlain.[15] Nominations from 1901 to 1956, however, have been released in a database.[16]\\r\\n\\r\\nNominations are considered by the Nobel Committee at a meeting where a short list of candidates for further review is created.  This short list is then considered by permanent advisers to the Nobel institute, which consists of the Institute's Director and the Research Director and a small number of Norwegian academics with expertise in subject areas relating to the prize.  Advisers usually have some months to complete reports, which are then considered by the Committee to select the laureate.  The Committee seeks to achieve a unanimous decision, but this is not always possible. The Nobel Committee typically comes to a conclusion in mid-September, but occasionally the final decision has not been made until the last meeting before the official announcement at the beginning of October.[17]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Chairman of the Norwegian Nobel Committee presents the Nobel Peace Prize in the presence of the King of Norway on 10 December each year (the anniversary of Nobel's death). The Peace Prize is the only Nobel Prize not presented in Stockholm. The Nobel laureate receives a diploma, a medal, and a document confirming the prize amount.[18] As of  2013[update], the prize was worth 10 million SEK (about US$1.5 million). Since 1990, the Nobel Peace Prize Ceremony is held at Oslo City Hall.\\r\\n\\r\\nFrom 1947 to 1989, the Nobel Peace Prize ceremony was held in the Atrium of the University of Oslo Faculty of Law, a few hundred metres from Oslo City Hall. Between 1905 and 1946, the ceremony took place at the Norwegian Nobel Institute. From 1901 to 1904, the ceremony took place in the Storting (Parliament).[19]\\r\\n\\r\\nIt has been expressed that the Peace Prize has been awarded in politically motivated ways for more recent or immediate achievements,[20] or with the intention of encouraging future achievements.[20][21] Some commentators have suggested that to award a peace prize on the basis of unquantifiable contemporary opinion is unjust or possibly erroneous, especially as many of the judges cannot themselves be said to be impartial observers.[22]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 2011, a feature story in the Norwegian newspaper Aftenposten contended that major criticisms of the award were that the Norwegian Nobel Committee ought to recruit members from professional and international backgrounds, rather than retired members of parliament; that there is too little openness about the criteria that the committee uses when they choose a recipient of the prize; and that the adherence to Nobel's will should be more strict. In the article, Norwegian historian ?ivind Stenersen argues that Norway has been able to use the prize as an instrument for nation building and furthering Norway's foreign policy and economic interests.[23]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn another 2011 Aftenposten opinion article, the grandson of one of Nobel's two brothers, Michael Nobel, also criticised what he believed to be the politicisation of the award, claiming that the Nobel Committee has not always acted in accordance with Nobel's will.[24] Norwegian lawyer Fredrik S.

Gandhi could do without the Nobel Peace prize, whether Nobel committee can do without Gandhi is the question\\".[55] In 1948, following Gandhi's death, the Nobel Committee declined to award a prize on the ground that \\"there was no suitable living candidate\\" that year.

A Christmas with relatives is interrupted when Chuck is summoned to resolve a problem in Malaysia. While flying through a violent storm, his plane crashes into the Pacific Ocean. Chuck escapes the sinking plane and is saved by an inflatable life raft, but loses the emergency locator transmitter. He clings to the life raft, loses consciousness, and floats all night before being washed up on an island. After he awakens, he explores the island and soon discovers that it is uninhabited.\\r\\nSeveral FedEx packages from the crashed plane wash up on the shore, as well as the corpse of one of the pilots, which he buries. He initially tries to signal for rescue and makes an escape attempt with the remnants of his life raft, but cannot pass the powerful surf and the coral reefs surrounding the island. He searches for food, water, and shelter, and opens the packages, finding a number of potentially useful items. He leaves one package, which has a pair of angel wings stenciled on it, unopened. During a first attempt to make fire, Chuck receives a deep wound to his hand. In anger and pain, he throws several objects, including a Wilson volleyball from one of the packages. A short time later he draws a face in the bloody hand print on the ball, names it Wilson, and begins talking to it. One night, Chuck calculates that in order for the rescue workers to find the site of the plane crash, they will have to search an area twice the size of Texas, making him doubtful he will ever be found.\\r\\nFour years later, Chuck has adapted to the meager living conditions on the island, having become adept at spearing fish and making fires. He also has regular conversations and arguments with Wilson, which has become his only means of socialization. A large section from a portable toilet washes up on the island; Chuck uses it as a sail in the construction of a raft. After spending some time building and stocking the raft and deciding when the weather conditions will be optimal (using an analemma he has created in his cave to monitor the time of year), he launches, using the sail to overcome the powerful surf. After some time on the ocean, a storm nearly tears his raft apart. The following day, as Chuck sleeps, Wilson becomes untethered and floats away from the raft. Chuck is wakened by the spray of a sounding whale, sees Wilson, and swims after him, but Wilson has gone too far to safely retrieve. Chuck returns to the raft and collapses in tears. Later, a passing cargo ship finds him, drifting.\\r\\nUpon returning to civilization, Chuck learns that he has long been given up for dead; his family and acquaintances have held a funeral, and Kelly has since married Chuck's one-time dentist and has a daughter. After reuniting with Kelly, the pair profess their love for each other but, realizing they cannot be together because of her commitment to her new family, they sadly part. Kelly gives Chuck the keys to the car they once shared.\\r\\nSometime later, after buying a new volleyball, Chuck travels to Canadian, Texas, to return the unopened FedEx package with the angel wings to its sender, a woman named Bettina Peterson. The house at the address is empty, so he leaves the package at the door with a note saying that the package saved his life. He departs and stops at a remote crossroads. A friendly woman passing by in a pickup truck stops to explain where each road leads. As she drives away, Chuck notices the angel wings on the back of her truck are identical to those on the parcel. As Chuck is left standing at the crossroads he looks down each road, then smiles faintly as he looks in the direction of the woman's truck.\\r\\nThe film's shooting occurred between 1998 and 2000, but was not shot consecutively. Hanks gained 50 pounds (23?kg) during pre-production to make him look like a pudgy, middle-aged man. After a majority of the film was shot, production was halted for a year so that he could lose the weight and grow his hair and beard to look like he had been living on the island for years. During the year-long hiatus, Zemeckis used the same film crew to make another film, What Lies Beneath.[2]\\r\\nCast Away was filmed on Monuriki, one of the Mamanuca Islands in Fiji.[3] It is in a subgroup of the Mamanuca archipelago, which is sited off the coast of Viti Levu, Fiji's largest island. The island became a tourist attraction following the film's release. After Chuck's return, it is identified by Kelly as being \\"about 600 miles south of the Cook Islands,\\" but there is actually no land between the southernmost Cook Islands of Mangaia and Antarctica.\\r\\nThe film essentially begins and ends in the same location, on the Arrington Ranch in the Texas Panhandle south of the city of Canadian, Texas.[4]\\r\\nThe film's minimal score was composed by Alan Silvestri for which he won a Grammy Award in 2002. The film's soundtrack is most notable for its lack of score and creature sound effects (such as bird song or insect sounds) while Chuck is on the island, which is intended to reinforce the feeling of isolation.[5] Cast Away contains no original musical score until Chuck escapes the island. However, there is a Russian choral piece heard near the start of the film that was not composed or even recorded by Silvestri, so it does not appear on the film's soundtrack list. It is a traditional Russian song written by Lev Knipper called \\"Oh, My Field\\" (\\"Polyushko, Polye\\") and it is available on various collections of Red Army hymns. The tracks in Silvestri's score are as follows:\\r\\nThe official soundtrack CD is an anthology of musical pieces from all films up to that point directed by Zemeckis and scored by Silvestri. The only track from Cast Away itself is the theme from the end credits.[6]\\r\\nFedEx provided access to their facilities (Memphis, Los Angeles, and Moscow) as well as airplanes, trucks, uniforms, and logistical support. A team of FedEx marketers oversaw production through more than two years of filming.[7] FedEx CEO Fred Smith made an appearance as himself for the scene where Chuck is welcomed back, which was filmed on location at FedEx's home facilities in Memphis, Tennessee. The idea of a story based on a FedEx plane crashing gave the company \\"a heart attack at first,\\" but the overall story was seen as positive. FedEx, which paid no money for product placement in the film,[8] saw an increase in brand awareness in Asia and Europe following the film's release.[9]\\r\\nIn the film, Wilson the volleyball serves as Chuck Noland's personified friend and only companion during the four years that Noland spends alone on a deserted island.[10][11][12] Named after the volleyball's manufacturer, Wilson Sporting Goods, the character was created by screenwriter William Broyles, Jr.. While researching for the film, he consulted with professional survival experts, and then chose to deliberately strand himself for one week on an isolated beach in the Gulf of California, to force himself to search for water and food, and obtain his own shelter. During this time, a volleyball washed up on shore. This was the inspiration for the film's inanimate companion. From a screenwriting point of view, Wilson also serves to realistically allow dialogue in a one-person-only situation.[13][14]\\r\\nOne of the original volleyball props was sold at auction for $18,500 to the ex-CEO of FedEx Office, Ken May. At the time of the film's release, Wilson launched its own joint promotion centered on the fact that one of its products was \\"co-starring\\" with Tom Hanks. Wilson manufactured a volleyball with a reproduction of the bloodied handprint face on one side. It was sold for a limited time during the film's initial release and continues to be offered on the company's website.[15]\\r\\nOn Rotten Tomatoes, Cast Away has an approval rating of 90% based on 154 reviews, with an average rating of 7.4/10. The site's critical consensus reads, \\"Flawed but fascinating, Cast Away offers an intelligent script, some of Robert Zemeckis' most mature directing, and a showcase performance from Tom Hanks.\\"[16] On Metacritic the film has a score of 73 out of 100, based on 32 critics, indicating \\"generally favorable reviews\\".[17]\\r\\nCast Away opened in 2,774 theaters in North America and grossed $28,883,406 with an average of $10,412 per theater on its opening weekend.[18] For the four-day Christmas long holiday weekend, it took in a total of $39,852,075.[19] The film kept performing well and ended up earning $233,632,142 domestically and $196,000,000 internationally for a total of $429,632,142, well above its production budget of $90 million.[1]\\r\\nThe film is recognized by American Film Institute in these lists:\\r\\nA FedEx commercial during the 2003 Super Bowl parodied the final scene of the film, in which Chuck returns a package to its sender. In this version, the woman answers the door, and when Chuck asks what was in the box, the woman replies: \\"Just a satellite phone, GPS locator, fishing rod, water purifier, and some seeds. Just silly stuff.\\"[26]\\r\\nMedia executive Lloyd Braun of ABC Studios first suggested the idea of a Cast Away-type television series at a dinner party in 2003.[27] Thom Sherman later pitched the idea for Cast Away ÿ The Series, but never developed the idea.[27] The concept was later developed and pitched with the title Nowhere, which later turned into the ABC show Lost.[27]","input":"How many years was he on the island in castaway?"},{"output":"Colorado's 2nd congressional district","context":"Colorado's 2nd congressional district is a congressional district in the U.S. state of Colorado.

Habitat has been devoted to building \\"simple, decent, and affordable\\" housing, a self-described \\"Christian housing ministry,\\" and has addressed the issues of poverty housing all over the world.[1] The international operational headquarters are located in Americus, Georgia, United States, with the administrative headquarters located in Atlanta.[2] There are five area offices located around the world: United States and Canada; Africa and the Middle East (located in Pretoria, South Africa); Asia-Pacific (Bangkok, Thailand); Europe and Central Asia (Bratislava, Slovakia); and Latin America and the Caribbean (San Jose, Costa Rica).\\r\\nCommunity-level Habitat offices act in partnership with and on behalf of Habitat for Humanity International. In the United States, these local offices are called Habitat affiliates; outside the United States, Habitat operations are managed by national offices. Each affiliate and national office is an independently run, nonprofit organization. Affiliates and national offices coordinate all aspects of Habitat home building in their local area, including fundraising, building site selection, partner family selection and support, house construction, and mortgage servicing.\\r\\nThe mission statement of Habitat for Humanity is \\"Seeking to put Gods love into action, Habitat for Humanity brings people together to build homes, communities and hope\\".[3] Homes are built using volunteer labor and Habitat makes no profit on the sales.[2] In some locations outside the United States, Habitat for Humanity charges interest to protect against inflation. This policy has been in place since 1986. Habitat has helped more than 4 million people construct, rehabilitate or preserve more than 800,000 homes since its founding in 1976, making Habitat the largest not-for-profit builder in the world.[4][5]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nHabitat for Humanity traces its origins to the time Millard Fuller spent at Koinonia Farm in 1965.\\r\\nAccording to the official website,\\r\\nThe affiliates family selection committee chooses homeowners based on their level of need, their willingness to become partners in the program and their ability to repay the loan. Every affiliate follows a nondiscriminatory policy of family selection. Neither race nor religion is a factor in choosing the families who receive Habitat houses.[1]\\r\\nThere are several checks and balances in place to protect both Habitat and the potential homeowner:\\r\\nHabitat for Humanity performs an extensive background check on potential homeowners, including character references, employer interviews, and audit of finances. The applicants are required to sign release forms authorizing Habitat for Humanity to perform this background check. This ensures that Habitat's risk is reasonable when selling a home and that the applicant family is in a suitable financial position to take on the responsibility of a mortgage.\\r\\nThere are typically a First and a Second Mortgage. The Second Mortgage is put in place to protect any equity that is left that is not captured in the first mortgage. The homeowners pay down the first mortgage, and after a stated period of time (which varies from affiliate to affiliate) of living in the same home, the Second Mortgage is forgiven (however, it is not always forgiven). However, The Right of First Refusal stays in force until the mortgage is paid in full.\\r\\nHomeowners are usually expected to put approximately 500?hours of \\"sweat equity\\" into their own or other project homes, although this amount may vary by location, the number of wage-earning adults in each family, and the recipients' health issues. This sweat equity acts as the down payment on the home. Every hour spent earning this sweat equity must be approved and signed off on by an official Habitat for Humanity representative. Sweat equity has no monetary value and cannot be 'refunded'.\\r\\nOnce construction on the home is finished and the sweat equity is completed in full, the homeowner purchases the home with a 0% to 2% interest mortgage (in the United States). With monthly payments (including taxes and insurance) that do not exceed 30% of the household's monthly income.\\r\\nMortgage payments from homeowners are deposited into a locally administered \\"Fund for Humanity\\", the proceeds of which go toward future construction. In an effort to discourage predatory lenders from targeting Habitat homeowner families, mortgage agreements require the Habitat for Humanity affiliate the right of first refusal. Until the mortgage is paid in full, a Habitat home has no equity and can only be sold back to Habitat for Humanity. Should a homeowner family decide to sell their home during the period of their mortgage, the affiliate will buy it back at market value. Often affiliates will have a shared appreciation model that will allow the affiliate to recapture a portion of the equity in the home depending on the time the family lived in the home and paid on the mortgage.[6]\\r\\nThe typically no interest mortgage payments permit a family the freedom to manage their finances more effectively, the end goal being to provide a 'hand up' and not a 'hand out' as it were. In some locations, attendance at money management courses is mandatory for potential homeowners.\\r\\nHabitat relies on volunteer labor in order to construct simple and affordable homes with its partner families, as well as to build community and civil society in the areas in which it works. Many churches and other houses of worship (synagogues, temples, mosques etc.) sponsor houses and provide a large amount of the volunteers from their congregations. Some corporations and businesses who value good corporate citizenship provide financial support to the projects and/or donate materials for use in construction. Many politicians and celebrities have volunteered with Habitat, reflecting its profile as a highly regarded non-profit.\\r\\nHabitat builds simple houses with locally appropriate materials. In many communities, Habitat affiliates and national offices are exploring areas of green building, including energy efficiency and sustainability. In the United States, many affiliates are building homes that are LEED certified.[7] In 2010, Habitat for Humanity Tajikistan won a national Global Energy Award for their resource-saving bio-sand water filter project.[8]\\r\\nHabitat affiliates and national offices contribute a percentage of the unrestricted funds they raise locally to be used in building homes by a Habitat national office overseas. For instance, Habitat New Zealand's tithe helps to support an equal number of housing outcomes abroad, predominantly in the Pacific region.\\r\\nHabitat homeowners in the United States and Canada pay no interest on their no-profit mortgages. Some Habitat for Humanity affiliates outside the United States adjust the no-profit loans to compensate for the inflation rate in their area, with the goal that \\"the repayments from one house should ideally build another house of the same design\\".[9]\\r\\nHabitat ReStores are retail outlets that sell new and used building and household materials donated by small businesses, large companies, job sites, and individuals. Proceeds from ReStores help local affiliates fund the construction of Habitat houses within the community. Many affiliates across the United States, Canada, Australia and New Zealand operate successful ReStores??some of which raise enough funds to build an additional 10 or more houses per year.[10] Many ReStores cover the administrative costs of the Habitat affiliate so that 100% of donor funds can be put toward home construction and rehabilitation projects.\\r\\nHabitat for Humanity International develops and supports special programs to engage volunteers from all walks of life in Habitat's mission and work.\\r\\nHabitat for Humanity's A Brush With Kindness is a locally operated program serving low-income homeowners who struggle to maintain the exterior of their homes. The program is a holistic approach to providing affordable housing and assisting communities as well as families. Groups of volunteers help homeowners with exterior maintenance. This typically includes painting, minor exterior repairs, landscaping, weatherization and exterior clean-up.[11]\\r\\nAs suggested by the name, Habitat for Humanity International places a strong emphasis on building homes around the world. Volunteers today can build with Habitat affiliates in many locations on Global Village Trips.[12] After having gone through training, trip leaders organize travel plans with the support of the Americus-headquartered Global Village Department, first formally established in 1988. Participants from all over are then able to register for trips to their destination of choice. Teams generally number between eight and fifteen, with trips usually lasting between nine and fourteen days.\\r\\nAccording to the website, Global Village Trips offer volunteers the opportunity:\\r\\nto experience another culture while making a difference in the lives of others...work alongside members of the host community in building decent, affordable housing... [and]help raise awareness of the burden of poverty housing and create a true global village of love, community, homes and hope.[13]\\r\\nNational Service refers to national service programs that are funded by the Corporation for National and Community Service. The goal of the Habitat for Humanity National Service program is to help local Habitat affiliates operate more efficiently and effectively by maximizing existing volunteers, increasing capacity for new volunteers and most importantly, meeting the housing needs of communities by building more houses for low-income families.[citation needed]\\r\\nAmeriCorps is a network of national service programs that engage more than 75,000?Americans each year in intensive service to meet critical needs in education, public safety, health and the environment. Habitat for Humanity International was one of the first nonprofits contacted by the Corporation for National and Community Service when AmeriCorps was being formed in 1993. In the 2008ÿ2009 program year, over 500?AmeriCorps members at affiliates all over the country will help build nearly 2,000?houses and recruit and retain nearly 200,000?community volunteers. Those volunteers will provide an estimated 1,600,000?volunteer hours. The members themselves will contribute 850,000?hours.[14]\\r\\nRV Care-A-Vanners is a volunteer program in which volunteers travel in their personal recreational vehicles, making stops at local Habitat affiliates to assist in house construction and renovations. RV Care-A-Vanner volunteers each pay their own expenses, which may be tax deductible.\\r\\nMany RV Care-A-Vanners help local Habitat affiliates raise the awareness of poverty housing and homelessness by speaking to churches, civic groups and local media. Individual Care-A-Vanners often make donations to their local Habitat affiliate and some even organize fund-raising teams and sponsor entire houses.[15]\\r\\nOriginating in 1991 with a Charlotte, North Carolina home built entirely by a crew of female volunteers, Habitat's Women Build program encourages women to make a difference by building homes and communities. Women Build projects provide an environment in which women can feel comfortable learning construction skills they might not otherwise have the opportunity to learn. Globally, more than?1,400 homes have been completed by Women Build volunteers.[16]\\r\\nWomen all over the United States participate in National Women Build Week. The week-long build leading up to Mother's Day is designed to showcase the skills of Women Build volunteers and to motivate new volunteers to help families and change communities.\\r\\nLowe's is a major sponsor and underwriter of Women Build, and has generously supported each National Women Build Week. In addition to competitive grant opportunities, Lowes offers a series of free how-to clinics for U.S. Women Build affiliates.[17]\\r\\nHabitat for Humanity's Youth Programs seek to involve young people, ages?5 to 25, in Habitat's mission and work. In accordance with U.S. federal guidelines, youth must be at least 16?years old to be on an active construction site, and must be 18?years old to engage in certain build activities.[18]\\r\\nHabitat's Youth Programs include programs such as:\\r\\nA campus chapter is a student-led, student-initiated organization on a high school or college campus that partners with the local Habitat affiliate to fulfill the four functions of a campus chapter. The four functions of a campus chapter are: building, fundraising, advocating and educating.[19]\\r\\nHabitat for Humanity runs a year-round alternative break program known as Collegiate Challenge for student groups age?16 to 25.[20] Although summer, fall, and winter break trips are available, most participants go during their spring break. Collegiate Challenge participants travel to host sites throughout the United States and spend one week working in partnership with the local Habitat affiliate, the local community, and partner families to help eliminate poverty housing in the area. Host affiliates provide housing for the groups, as well as a place to shower and cook meals for the week. More than 14,000?volunteers took part in Collegiate Challenge in 2011, making it one of the world's largest alternative break programs. Since its inception in 1989, nearly 240,000 students have participated in Collegiate Challenge and have donated more than $25 million to Habitat for Humanity affiliates.[21]\\r\\nFor one week during the summer, students ages?16 to 18 can experience Habitats work outside of their communities. In addition to a week of building, students also learn about the need for Habitat through educational activities.[22]\\r\\nYouth United is a Habitat for Humanity program run by youth and for youth ages?5 to 25. It brings young people together from all walks of life to play active roles in transforming their communities. Youth United mobilizes young people to sponsor and build a house with their local Habitat affiliate.[23]\\r\\nFormer U.S. President Jimmy Carter became involved with Habitat for Humanity in 1984 and has since become its highest profile proponent. He has been involved in fund-raising and publicity as well as actual homebuilding, taking part in the annual Jimmy Carter Work Project \\"blitz build\\".[24]\\r\\nIn 2008, Habitat for Humanity celebrated the 25th annual building project with the Carters and renamed it to include Mrs. Carter. The Jimmy & Rosalynn Carter Work Project focused on supporting the Gulf Coast community seeking to rebuild after hurricanes Katrina and Rita. Despite periodic downpours, volunteers got most of the work done during one week in June to finish building and fixing 60?houses and frame 48?more.[25]\\r\\nIn November 2009, volunteers joined Jimmy and Rosalynn Carter in the Mekong River region of Southeast Asia. Houses were built in the countries of Vietnam, Cambodia, Laos, Thailand and Yunnan Province in China. The week-long project served nearly 166?families.[26] It also began a five-year Habitat for Humanity initiative to work with 50,000?families across the five countries.[26]\\r\\nDuring Home Builders Blitz 2008, more than 1,000?building industry professionals in 110?Habitat for Humanity affiliates built 263?new homes across the United States. This was the second national Home Builders Blitz program, which was begun on the local level in 2002 in Raleigh, North Carolina. Since then, the professional homebuilders industry has supported Habitat by building more than 800?homes.\\r\\nTom Gipson, a Habitat volunteer and professional homebuilder who started the Home Builder's Blitz program, was named the \\"Ultimate Volunteer\\" in a 2009 contest by ABC's \\"The View\\".[27]\\r\\nThe AmeriCorps Build-a-Thon is an annual signature event that brings together AmeriCorps members and alumni in a week long blitz build. The Build-a-Thon provides the host affiliate an opportunity to advance and highlight local house-building efforts. It also serves as an annual meeting of AmeriCorps volunteers who might otherwise lack any opportunity to meet.\\r\\nThe event is held across the United States and highlights a different Habitat affiliate each year. In the past, Build-a-Thons have occurred in Cedar Rapids, Iowa; the Gulf Coast; Dallas, Texas; Mobile County, Alabama; and Jacksonville, Florida.\\r\\nThe 2010, Habitat AmeriCorps Build-a-Thon was held in Cedar Rapids, Iowa, hosted by Cedar Valley Habitat for Humanity. This was the second consecutive year that Cedar Valley Habitat hosted the event. More than 500 Habitat for Humanity AmeriCorps National and AmeriCorps VISTA members from across the country came together to build, rehabilitate and repair more than 20 homes. In 2015, the Build-a-Thon was held in New Orleans in remembrance of Hurricane Katrina.\\r\\nHabitat initiated a special program to help restore housing to the areas affected by Hurricanes Katrina and Rita. The effort was focused on getting local affiliates in the area back on their feet and prepared to build for their communities. It also became a catalyst for other organizations, like the St. Bernard Project, corporations and the government to provide help and support in rebuilding the area and has received considerable national media attention. Habitat restored around 300 homes for Katrina efforts.\\r\\nAs part of Operation Home Delivery, housing components were assembled in nearby less-affected locations such as Jackson, Mississippi, allowing much of the construction to be accomplished while basic infrastructure was being restored. Pre-constructed components were then shipped to the affected areas and built at a faster rate. Within two months of the time of the disaster, construction had begun on houses in the Louisiana cities of Covington and Slidell, near New Orleans.\\r\\nHarry Connick Jr., and Branford Marsalis served as honorary chairs of Habitat's hurricane rebuilding program, and one of the many projects along the Gulf Coast is the Musicians' Village at New Orleans Habitat for Humanity.[28]\\r\\nOn 12 January 2010, a magnitude 7.0 earthquake struck Haiti just 10 miles west of the capital, Port-au-Prince. The earthquake damaged almost 190,000 houses, of which 105,000 were entirely devastated. Of the more than two million affected survivors, 500,000 are still displaced today. Soon after the earthquake, Habitat set a goal of serving 50,000 families over five years, helping them move toward safe, secure and permanent places to call home.\\r\\nHabitat has reached numerous milestones after the earthquake including over 155 houses as well as another 100 houses planned to be built starting 23 November of this year. Aside from direct building of housing, more than 4,000 families received transitional or upgraded shelters, more than 350 houses were repaired and rehabilitated, more than 24,500 emergency shelter kits were distributed, and more than 12,000 damage assessments were conducted (Habitat For Humanity International). During this time, an entire community was transformed and lives were changed. More than 4,450 Haiti citizens were trained in construction techniques, financial literacy, disaster risk reduction and business development, which resulted in job opportunities for over 700 Haitians (Habitat For Humanity International).\\r\\nHabitat played an integral in the restoration of Bangladesh after Cyclone Sidr devastated 31 districts. A partnership with Japan Platform to help build transitional shelters was on-going when the disaster hit in November 2007. All phases of this project completed at the end of February 2009.\\r\\nHabitat responded to the cyclone by pledging $250000 to provide technical assistance. Prior to the construction of transitional homes, immediate necessities such as food, water and medicine were distributed to affected families.\\r\\nA Habitat Resource Center was built in phase one for technical planning, coordination and management of the entire project. It also served as the manufacturing and storage center for construction materials. A total of 480 houses were built at the end of a 3 phase construction process. Each house was provided with proper sanitation using contributions from UNICEF Bangladesh and HFH Great Britain. These transitional shelters were designed to be built by volunteers and unskilled workers in about eight hours on an area that had been prepared by families. This shelter provides a strong and cyclone-resistant core structure to protect residents from severe weather. Extensions to the home when the family has the financial means can be done by adding walling to the existing structure.\\r\\nIn bid to raise the local awareness of these transitional homes, HFH Bangladesh organized a series of training and familiarisation workshops for locals. 16 sessions were held between March and December 2008.\\r\\nIn total, 12 communities were worked on by HFH Bangladesh. Structures had been built in the regions of Ghotoker Andua, Andua, Kalagachiya, Pipra Khali and Mirzaganj villages in Mirzaganj Union. In the Amragachia Union the regions of Uttar Amragachia, Dakkhin Amragachia, Shoilabunia, Kismat Shoilabunia and Amragachi villages also had structures built there.[29]\\r\\nThere are many projects that go hand in hand with the house building projects that allow these homes to supply their own electricity through the use of Solar energy. U.S. companies such as Pacific Gas and Electric (PG&E) have partnered with Habitat for Humanity to provide complete solar grids for a few homes.[30] Other solar projects, mostly in the U.S., like one in San Francisco,[31] as well as efforts of individual citizens are trying to make a difference by raising funds to get more solar homes built.[32]\\r\\nThe video for rock band Bon Jovi's song \\"Who Says You Can't Go Home\\" features Habitat for Humanity volunteers as well as the band building homes as part of Habitat for Humanity in Philadelphia, close to Bon Jovi's native New Jersey. It reflects Jon Bon Jovi's dedication to the organization and highlights the importance of community unity, faith, and involvement. The popularity of Bon Jovi increased Habitat's exposure and influenced new volunteers to donate their time and money to Habitat.\\r\\nThe Habitat Bicycle Challenge (HBC), a nine-week, coast-to-coast bicycle trip undertaken to raise funds for Habitat for Humanity of Greater New Haven and to increase awareness of Habitat for Humanity in general, took place annually from 1995 to 2007. Prior to embarking in June on the 4,000-mile (6,400?km) trek, participants engaged in a seven-month fundraising campaign for Habitat for Humanity of Greater New Haven. Once on the road, they served as roaming advertisements for Habitat and gave nightly presentations explaining Habitat's mission to their hosts, usually church congregations. They also took part in builds with local Habitat chapters along the way. At its height, HBC attracted about 90?participants a year, all aged 18 to 24 and about half coming from Yale University. Each rider traveled one of three routes: New Haven to San Francisco, New Haven to Portland, or New Haven to Seattle. By 2004 HBC had become the single largest yearly fundraiser for any Habitat affiliate in the world, raising about $400,000 a year. However, amid growing safety concerns, Habitat for Humanity of Greater New Haven was forced to announce the cancellation of HBC in September 2007.[33]\\r\\nBike and Build, a similar program, was founded in 2002 by a former HBC rider. Though not directly affiliated with Habitat for Humanity, it carries on the legacy of the Habitat Bicycle Challenge.\\r\\nIn the fall of 2007, alternative rock bands Switchfoot and Relient K went on the Appetite for Construction Tour, partnering with Habitat while raising awareness for the organization and donating a dollar per ticket sold. The tour was highly successful, raising over US$100,000 for donation to the cause.[34]\\r\\nWesley College, Melbourne is carrying out a joint fundraising and awareness program through theatrical production and is aiming to raise money to build education facilities in Afghanistan.\\r\\nLike much construction activity, which carries inherent risk, Habitat for Humanity construction has led to some serious injuries or deaths to volunteers.[35][36][37][38] Consequently, safety is a priority and important consideration on Habitat construction sites, and volunteers are given safety orientations and they are required to work with skilled construction supervisors on the build sites.[39][40] Depending on the type of operation, OSHA rules may be generally applicable to Habitat construction sites, similar to for-profit builders. In some cases, Habitat affiliates have local partnerships with OSHA on safety programs.[41]\\r\\nAn article in the Weekly Standard, an American conservative opinion magazine, questioned the cost-effectiveness of Habitat building projects. To estimate cost effectiveness, all costs associated with building a Habitat home must be used, including the cost of volunteer time and training.[42] For houses constructed by foreign volunteers, travel and associated costs paid by the volunteers are also significant. Including these costs raises the question whether building a house this way is an efficient use of resources. Particularly in developing countries where labor is relatively inexpensive, unemployment is high, and local currency is cheap, purchasing local labor and supplies may result in an increase in the number of houses built.\\r\\nCost-effectiveness, however, is not Habitat for Humanitys only concern, and additional benefits arise from the Habitat model that differentiate it from other low-cost housing. For example, involving volunteers in the construction of houses not only makes the homes more affordable, but it also builds community understanding, awareness and support for affordable housing and generates revenue for local Habitat organizations. Focusing solely on cost effectiveness also does not address another important aspectthe education and training of the homebuyers. Habitats homebuyers are also involved in the construction of their home and the homes of others in the program.[43] Many Habitat organizations also provide training in budget management and other skills. These requirements, known as sweat equity, teach low-income homebuyers valuable construction and other skills that help them to maintain their home over the long-term. Another major aspect of Habitats program is Habitats revolving Fund for Humanity. Habitat does not give homes away; rather, in addition to contributing sweat equity, Habitat homebuyers pay an affordable no-profit mortgage based on their ability to pay. These mortgage payments are used to support building additional homes in partnership with low-income families, thus contributing to the sustainability of Habitats homebuilding program.[44]\\r\\nHabitat has been criticized for its slow and inefficient rebuilding efforts along the Gulf Coast after Hurricanes Katrina and Rita.[45] After 18?months, Habitat had completed under 500?homes. A major factor was Habitat's reliance on working through local affiliates, who are not equipped to undertake large-scale rebuilding efforts.\\r\\nWork continued and Habitat completed its 1,000th hurricane-response home by May 2007. By the fifth anniversary of Katrina, more than 2,716 homes had been completed. In total, Habitats Gulf Coast affiliates built, repaired or rehabbed more than 5,400 houses as part of the hurricanes Katrina and Rita effort.[46]\\r\\nHabitat affiliates in the region have remained some of the largest homebuilders in their areas and have received numerous awards and acknowledgements for their work in building quality homes.[47][48][49][50]\\r\\nFamilies are required to show an ability to pay for their home in addition to the need for housing. With these requirements, homeless and low-income families may fail to qualify for a Habitat home. Most American Habitat affiliates perform credit checks and criminal record checks on applicants before partnering with them for the construction of a home. Some critics therefore allege that Habitat misrepresents the nature of its work by partnering with families that might be considered nearly \\"middle-income.\\"[42] To address this, many Habitat affiliates in the United States partner only with families that fall below the government-set \\"poverty line\\" for their area. The current poverty rate is measured according to the United States Department of Health and Human Services Poverty Guidelines.[51]\\r\\nThe credit and income requirements help ensure that Habitat applicants are able to maintain their houses. Foreclosure rates on Habitat houses are hard to measure. While Habitat claims a foreclosure rate of less than 2%, this number is unsubstantiated due to the fact that Habitat properties are not initially deeded to the buyer, and revert to the local Habitat chapter if a buyer defaults. The homeowners' monthly mortgage payments are used to build more Habitat homes.[1]\\r\\nHabitat's founder, Millard Fuller, and his wife were dismissed by the Habitat board of directors on 31 January 2005, citing a pattern of ongoing public comments and communications by the Fullers that have been divisive and disruptive to the organizations work[52] after Fuller was accused by a former female employee of \\"suggestive comments and inappropriate touching\\" during a ride to the Atlanta airport in 2003. The Habitat board investigated Fuller for sexual harassment but found \\"insufficient proof of inappropriate conduct\\". Some Fuller supporters claim that the firing was due to a change in corporate culture.[53]\\r\\nBefore Fuller's termination, attempts were made by former President Jimmy Carter to broker an agreement that would allow Fuller to retire with his $79,000 salary intact; when Fuller was found to have violated the non-disclosure portion of this agreement, he was subsequently fired.[54]\\r\\nIn January 2008 a dispute arose between the parent organization and an unspecified number of local Habitat for Humanity affiliate organizations over the terms of their cooperation agreement. These local affiliates contended that the agreement gave the international organization too much power over the assets and operations of the local chapters. One of the affiliates, Habitat for Humanity of San Antonio, reached an agreement with HFHI in July 2008 to \\"continue working together in their efforts to make affordable housing possible\\".[55]\\r\\nBy the end of 2008, the overwhelming majority of Habitats U.S. affiliates had signed the agreement.","input":"What type of organization is habitat for humanity?"},{"output":"October 20, 1944","context":"?United States\\r\\n?Australia (air and naval support)\\r\\n?Mexico (air support)\\r\\nNon-government militias\\r\\n?Japan\\r\\n Douglas MacArthur\\r\\n Sergio Osme?a\\r\\n Tomoyuki Yamashita\\r\\n Jos P.

The Japanese Army overran all of the Philippines during the first half of 1942. The liberation of the Philippines commenced with amphibious landings on the eastern Philippine island of Leyte on October 20, 1944. United States and Philippine Commonwealth military forces were progressing in liberating territory and islands when the Japanese forces in the Philippines were ordered to surrender by Tokyo on August 15, 1945, after the dropping of the atomic bombs on mainland Japan and the Soviet invasion of Manchuria.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nBy mid-1944, American forces were only 300 nautical miles (560?km) southeast of Mindanao, the largest island in the southern Philippines ÿ and able to bomb Japanese positions there using long-range bombers. American forces under Fleet Admiral Chester W. Nimitz had advanced across the Central Pacific Ocean, capturing the Gilbert Islands, some of the Marshall Islands, and most of the Marianas Islands, bypassing many Japanese Army garrisons and leaving them behind, with no source of supplies and militarily impotent.\\r\\nAircraft carrier-based warplanes were already conducting air strikes and fighter sweeps against the Japanese in the Philippines, especially their military airfields. U.S. Army and Australian Army troops under the American General Douglas MacArthur, the Supreme Commander of the Southwest Pacific Theater of Operations, had either overrun, or else isolated and bypassed, all of the Japanese Army on New Guinea and the Admiralty Islands. Before the invasion of the Philippines, MacArthur's northernmost conquest had been at Morotai in the Dutch East Indies on September 15ÿ16, 1944. This was MacArthur's one base that was within bomber range of the southern Philippines.\\r\\nU.S. Navy, Marine Corps, and Army as well as Australian and New Zealand forces under the command of Admiral Nimitz and Admiral William F. Halsey, Jr. had isolated the large Japanese South Pacific base at Rabaul, New Britain, by capturing a ring of islands around Rabaul, and then building air bases on them from which to bomb and blockade the Japanese forces at Rabaul into military impotence.\\r\\nWith victories in the Marianas campaign (on Saipan, on Guam, and on Tinian, during June and July 1944), American forces were getting close to Japan itself. From the Marianas, the very long-range B-29 Superfortress heavy bombers of the U.S. Army Air Forces (USAAF) could bomb the Japanese home islands from well-supplied air bases ÿ ones with direct access to supplies via cargo ships and tankers. (The earlier B-29 bombing campaign against Japan had been from the end of a very long and tortuous supply line via British India and British Burma ÿ one that proved to be woefully inadequate. All B-29s were transferred to the Marianas during the fall of 1944.)\\r\\nAlthough Japan was obviously losing the war, the Japanese Government, and the Imperial Japanese Army and Navy, showed no sign of capitulation, collapse or surrender.\\r\\nThere had been a close relationship between the people of the Philippines and the United States since 1898, with the Philippines becoming the Commonwealth of the Philippines in 1935, and promised their independence in mid-1946. Furthermore, an extensive series of air attacks by the American Fast Carrier Task Force under Admiral William F. Halsey against Japanese airfields and other bases on the Philippines had drawn little Japanese opposition, such as interceptions by Japanese Army fighter planes. Upon Admiral Halsey's recommendation, the Combined Chiefs of Staff, meeting in Canada, approved a decision to not only move up the date for the first landing in the Philippines, but also to move it north from the southernmost island of Mindanao to the central island of Leyte, Philippines. The new date set for the landing on Leyte, October 20, 1944, was two months before the previous target date to land on Mindanao.\\r\\nThe Filipino people were ready and waiting for the invasion. After General MacArthur had been evacuated from the Philippines in March 1942, all of its islands fell to the Japanese. The Japanese occupation was harsh, accompanied by atrocities and with large numbers of Filipinos pressed into slave labor. From mid-1942 through mid-1944, MacArthur and Nimitz supplied and encouraged the Filipino guerrilla resistance by U.S. Navy submarines and a few parachute drops, so that the guerrillas could harass the Japanese Army and take control of the rural jungle and mountainous areas ÿ amounting to about half of the archipelago. While remaining loyal to the United States, many Filipinos hoped and believed that liberation from the Japanese would bring them freedom and their already-promised independence.\\r\\nThe Australian government offered General MacArthur the use of the First Corps of the Australian Army for the Liberation of the Philippines. MacArthur suggested that two Australian infantry divisions be employed, each of them attached to a different U.S. Army Corps, but this idea was not acceptable to the Australian Cabinet, which wanted to have significant operational control within a certain area of the Philippines, rather than simply being part of a U.S. Army Corps.[16] No agreement was ever reached between the Australian Cabinet and MacArthur ÿ who might have wanted it that way. As a result, the Australian Army played virtually no part in the Philippines. However, units from the Royal Australian Air Force and the Royal Australian Navy, such as the heavy cruiser HMAS?Australia, were involved.\\r\\nDuring the American re-conquest of the Philippines, the guerrillas began to strike openly against Japanese forces, carried out reconnaissance activities ahead of the advancing regular troops, and took their places in battle beside the advancing American divisions.[17][18]\\r\\nOn October 20, 1944, the U.S. Sixth Army, supported by naval and air bombardment, landed on the favorable eastern shore of Leyte, one of the islands of the Visayas island group, northeast of Mindanao. The Japanese miscalculated the relative strength of the naval and air forces, and they attempted to destroy the landing. This brought about the massive sequence of battles called the Battle of Leyte Gulf, fought on October 23 through October 26. This decisive victory by the U.S. Navy, its Fast Carrier Task Force, its surface fleet, and its submarines effectively destroyed the remainder of the Imperial Japanese Navy (IJN), which had already lost all of its effective aircraft carrier forces. The IJN had four of its carriers sunk (ships with depleted air squadrons ÿ which were used only as decoys), numerous battleships and heavy cruisers, and a large number of light cruisers and destroyers. The IJN was never able to fight a major battle after this.\\r\\nThe U.S. Sixth Army continued its advance from the east, as the Japanese rushed reinforcements to the Ormoc Bay area on the western side of the island. While the Sixth Army was continually reinforced, the U.S. Fifth Air Force was able to devastate the Japanese attempts at air attacks, and also provide much support to the Army's ground troops.\\r\\nThe Filipino guerrillas also performed valuable service in maintaining public order and in keeping the roads and highways free of congestion. After the American beachheads were established, the Leyte guerrilla groups were attached directly to the Sixth Army corps and divisions to assist in scouting, intelligence, and combat operations.[19][not in citation given] With the initial U.S. Sixth Army landings on the beaches at Tacloban and Dulag, Colonel Ruperto Kangleon's units went into action. They dynamited key bridges to block Japanese displacement toward the target area; they harassed enemy patrols; and they sabotaged supply and ammunition depots. Information on enemy troop movements and dispositions sent from guerrilla outposts to Kangleon's Headquarters was dispatched immediately to Sixth Army.[20]\\r\\nDuring many torrential rains and over difficult terrain, the advance continued across Leyte and onto the major island of Samar, just north of Leyte. On December 7, 1944, the U.S. Army units made another amphibious landing at Ormoc Bay and, after a major land and air battle, the landing force cut off all Japanese ability to reinforce and resupply their troops on Leyte. Although fierce fighting continued on Leyte for months, the U.S. Army was always in control.\\r\\nThe U.S. 6th Army's second major target to attack was Mindoro. This large island is directly south of Luzon and Manila Bay, and MacArthur's main goal in taking it was to be able to construct airfields on it for fighter planes that could dominate the sky over the most-important island of Luzon, with its major seaport and capital city of Manila.[21]\\r\\nThe Seventh Fleet's large invasion convoy from Leyte to Mindoro came under strong attack by kamikazes, but they could not delay the American invasion of Mindoro.[22] Mindoro was only lightly occupied by the Japanese Army, and much of it was held by Filipino guerrillas, so Mindoro was quickly overrun. U.S. Army engineers set about rapidly constructing a major air base at San Fabian. Besides being close to Luzon, Mindoro has another advantage: good flying weather nearly all the time, because this is a part of the Philippines that is relatively dry ÿ quite unlike Leyte which receives torrential rains most of the year, not only giving it poor flying weather, but making it very muddy and difficult to construct airfields.\\r\\nSan Fabian was also the location of another breakthrough: the first appearance during the War in the Pacific of USAAF squadrons flying the fast, long-range P-51B Mustang fighters ÿ far superior to anything that the Imperial Japanese Army or Navy had.\\r\\nMindoro was a major victory for the 6th Army and the USAAF, and it also provided the major base for the next move of MacArthur's 6th Army: the invasion of Luzon, especially at Lingayen Gulf on its western coast.\\r\\nOn December 15, 1944, landings against minimal resistance were made on the southern beaches of the island of Mindoro, a key location in the planned Lingayen Gulf operations, in support of major landings scheduled on Luzon. On January 9, 1945, on the south shore of Lingayen Gulf on the western coast of Luzon, General Krueger's Sixth Army landed his first units. Almost 175,000 men followed across the twenty-mile (32?km) beachhead within a few days. With heavy air support, Army units pushed inland, taking Clark Field, 40 miles (64?km) northwest of Manila, in the last week of January.\\r\\nTwo more major landings followed, one to cut off the Bataan Peninsula, and another, that included a parachute drop, south of Manila. Pincers closed on the city and, on February 3, 1945, elements of the U.S. 1st Cavalry Division pushed into the northern outskirts of Manila and the 8th Cavalry Regiment (organized as infantry) passed through the northern suburbs and into the city itself.\\r\\nAs the advance on Manila continued from the north and the south, the Bataan Peninsula was rapidly secured. On February 16, paratroopers and amphibious units simultaneously assaulted the islet of Corregidor. It was necessary to take this stronghold because troops there can block the entrance of Manila Bay. The Americans needed to establish a major harbor base at Manila Bay to support the expected invasion of Japan, planned to begin on November 1, 1945. Resistance on Corregidor ended on February 27, and then all resistance by the Japanese Empire ceased on August 15, 1945, obviating the need for an invasion of the Japanese Home Islands.\\r\\nDespite initial optimism, fighting in Manila was harsh. It took until March 3 to clear the city of all Japanese troops, and the Japanese Marines, who fought on stubbornly and refused to either surrender or to evacuate as the Japanese Army had done. Fort Drum, a fortified island in Manila Bay near Corregidor, held out until April 13, when a team of Army troops went ashore and pumped 3,000 gallons of diesel fuel into the fort, then set off incendiary charges. No Japanese soldiers in Fort Drum survived the blast and fire.\\r\\nIn all, ten U.S. divisions and five independent regiments battled on Luzon, making it the largest American campaign of the Pacific war, involving more troops than the United States had used in North Africa, Italy, or southern France.\\r\\nPalawan Island, between Borneo and Mindoro, the fifth largest and western-most island of the Philippines, was invaded on February 28, with landings of the Eighth United States Army at Puerto Princesa. The Japanese put up little direct defense of Palawan, but cleaning up pockets of Japanese resistance lasted until late April, with the Japanese using their common tactic of withdrawing into the mountains and jungles, dispersed as small units. Throughout the Philippines, U.S. forces were aided by Filipino guerrillas to find and dispatch the holdouts,[23] the last of whom, Hiroo Onoda, did not surrender until 1974, in the mountains of Lubang Island in Mindoro.\\r\\nThe U.S. Eighth Army then moved on to its first landing on Mindanao (April 17), the last of the major islands of the Philippines to be taken. Mindanao was followed by invasion and occupation of Panay, Cebu, Negros and several islands in the Sulu Archipelago. These islands provided bases for the U.S. Fifth and Thirteenth Air Forces to attack targets throughout the Philippines and the South China Sea.\\r\\nFollowing additional landings on Mindanao, U.S. Eighth Army troops continued their steady advance against stubborn resistance. By the end of June, the enemy pockets were compressed into isolated pockets on Mindanao and Luzon where fighting continued until the Japanese surrender on August 15, 1945. However, some units of the Japanese Army were out of radio contact with Tokyo, and it was difficult to convince some of them that Japan had surrendered. As at many Pacific Islands, major Japanese officials, including members of the Imperial Family, visited in person to convince the soldiers that they must surrender by order of the Emperor.[24]","input":"When did the us invaded the philippines in ww2?"},{"output":"Daniel","context":"The story of Daniel in the lions' den (chapter 6 in the Book of Daniel) tells how Daniel is raised to high office by his royal master Darius the Mede, but jealous rivals trick Darius into issuing a decree which condemns Daniel to death.

Daniel's jealous rivals trick Darius into issuing a decree that for thirty days no prayers should be addressed to any god or man but Darius himself; any who break this are to be thrown to the lions. Daniel continues to pray to the God of Israel, and the king, although deeply distressed, must condemn Daniel to death, for the edicts of the Medes and Persians cannot be altered. Hoping for Daniel's deliverance, he has him cast into the pit. At daybreak the king hurries to the place and cries out anxiously, asking if God had saved his friend. Daniel replies that his God had sent an angel to close the jaws of the lions, \\"because I was found blameless before him.\\" The king commands that those who had conspired against Daniel should be thrown to the lions in his place, along with their wives and children, and writes to all the people of the whole world commanding that all should tremble and fear before the God of Daniel.[3]\\r\\nIt is generally accepted that the Book of Daniel originated as a collection of folktales among the Babylonian diaspora, the Jewish community living in Babylon and Mesopotamia in the Persian and Hellenistic periods (5th to 2nd centuries BC).[8] Chapters 4ÿ6, which includes the tale of Daniel in the lions' den, may belong to the earliest stage, as these differ quite markedly in the oldest texts.[9] Although the entire book is traditionally ascribed to Daniel the seer, the tales of chapters 1-6, including the story of the lion's den, are the voice of an anonymous narrator (except for chapter 4 which is in the form of a letter from king Nebuchadnezzar).[10] It is possible that the name of Daniel was chosen for the hero because of his reputation as a wise seer in Hebrew tradition.[11]\\r\\nChapters 2-7 are in Aramaic, and are in the clear form of a chiasm (a poetic structure in which the main point or message of a passage is placed in the centre and framed by further repetitions on either side):[12]\\r\\nThe story of Daniel in the lions' den in chapter 6 is paired with the story of Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego and the \\"fiery furnace\\" in Daniel 3. The parallels include the jealousy of non-Jews, an imperial edict requiring Jews to compromise their religion on pain of death, and divine deliverance. Each story climaxes with the king confessing the greatness of the God of the Jews and issuing an edict of royal protection. In each case life is preserved through divine presence in the fire or the pit.[7]\\r\\nThe structure of Daniel 6 itself is also in the form of a chiasm:[13]\\r\\nAccording to Josippon, \\"the beasts in the den received Daniel as faithful dogs might receive their returning master, wagging their tails and licking him.\\" The Midrash Tehillim says that \\"the mouth of the den was closed with a huge stone, which had rolled of itself from Palestine to Babylon for that purpose\\" and that \\"upon this stone sat an angel in the shape of a lion, so that Daniel's enemies might not harass him.\\"[14]\\r\\n Although Daniel is sometimes depicted as a young man in illustrations of the incident, James Montgomery Boice points out that he would have been over eighty years old at the time.[15]\\r\\nPainters who have depicted this incident include:","input":"Who was thrown into the lion's den?"},{"output":"The Avengers (2012)","context":"\\r\\n\\r\\nThanos (UK: /?Ĳ?n?s/, US: /-o?s/) is a fictional character appearing in American comic books published by Marvel Comics.

The character has appeared in various comic adaptations, including animated television series, arcade, and video games.\\r\\n\\r\\nWriter-artist Jim Starlin originally conceived of Thanos of Titan during college psychology classes. As Starlin described:\\r\\n\\r\\nI went to college between doing U.S. military service and getting work in comics, and there was a psych class and I came up with Thanos?... and Drax the Destroyer, but I'm not sure how he fit into it, just anger management probably. So I came up to Marvel and [editor] Roy [Thomas] asked if I wanted to do an issue of Iron Man. I felt that this may be my only chance ever to do a character, not having the confidence that my career was going to last anything longer than a few weeks. So they got jammed into it. Thanos was a much thinner character and Roy suggested beefing him up, so he's beefed up quite a bit from his original sketches?... and later on I liked beefing him up so much that he continued to grow in size.[1]\\r\\n\\r\\nStarlin has admitted the character's look was influenced by Jack Kirby's Darkseid:\\r\\n\\r\\nKirby had done the New Gods, which I thought was terrific. He was over at DC at the time. I came up with some things that were inspired by that. You'd think that Thanos was inspired by Darkseid, but that was not the case when I showed up. In my first Thanos drawings, if he looked like anybody, it was Metron. I had all these different gods and things I wanted to do, which became Thanos and the Titans. Roy took one look at the guy in the Metron-like chair and said: \\"Beef him up! If you're going to steal one of the New Gods, at least rip off Darkseid, the really good one!\\"[2]\\r\\n\\r\\nThanos' first appearance was in The Invincible Iron Man #55 (February 1973), featuring a story by Jim Starlin that was co-scripted by Mike Friedrich. The storyline from that issue continued through Captain Marvel #25ÿ33 (bi-monthly: March 1973 ÿ Jan. 1974), Marvel Feature #12 (Nov. 1973), Daredevil #107 (Jan. 1974), and Avengers #125 (July 1974). He returned in an extended storyline that spanned Strange Tales #178ÿ181 (Feb.ÿAug. 1975), Warlock #9-11 (Oct. 1975 ÿ Jan. 1976), Marvel Team Up #55 (March 1977), and the 1977 Annuals for Avengers and Marvel Two-in-One (Thanos does not actually appear until the end of Warlock #9). He was also featured in a short backup story in Logan's Run #6 (June 1977) and had a small role in the Death of Captain Marvel graphic novel (April 1982).\\r\\n\\r\\nThe character was revived in Silver Surfer vol. 3, #34 (Feb. 1990) and guest-starred until issue #59 (November 1991), while simultaneously appearing  in The Thanos Quest #1ÿ2 (Sept.ÿOct. 1990) and The Infinity Gauntlet #1ÿ6 (JulyÿDec. 1991). After an appearance in Spider-Man #17 (Dec. 1991), Thanos had a recurring role in Warlock and the Infinity Watch #1ÿ42 (Feb. 1992 ÿ Aug. 1995). This was followed by crossover appearances in Infinity War #1ÿ6 (June?ÿ Nov. 1992), Infinity Crusade #1ÿ6 (June?ÿ Nov. 1993), Silver Surfer vol. 3, #86ÿ88 (Nov. 1993?ÿ Jan. 1994), Warlock Chronicles #6ÿ8, Thor #468ÿ471 (Nov. 1993?ÿ Feb. 1994), Namor The Sub-Mariner #44 (Nov. 1993), Secret Defenders #11ÿ14 (Jan.ÿApril 1994), Cosmic Powers #1ÿ6 (MarchÿJuly 1994), and Cosmic Powers Unlimited #1 (May 1995).\\r\\n\\r\\nThanos appeared in a connected storyline in Ka-Zar vol. 2, #4ÿ11 (Aug. 1997?ÿ March 1998), Ka-Zar Annual (1997), and the X-Man and Hulk Annual (1998), before featuring in Thor vol. 2, #21ÿ25 (MarchÿJuly 2000) and the 2000 Annual.

The character was re-introduced in Guardians of the Galaxy vol. 2, #24ÿ25 (AprilÿMay 2010) and played a major role in The Thanos Imperative: Ignition (June 2010) and The Thanos Imperative #1ÿ6 (JulyÿDec. 2010).\\r\\n\\r\\nThe character returned in Avengers Assemble #1 (March 2012).[3] A mini-series titled Thanos: Son of Titan by Joe Keatinge was planned for publication in August 2012, but was cancelled.[4]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe character's origin was expanded in the five-issue Thanos Rising miniseries by Jason Aaron and Simone Bianchi which was published monthly beginning in April 2013.[5] Later that same year, Thanos played a central role in the Infinity miniseries written by Jonathan Hickman and drawn by Jim Cheung, Jerome Ope?a, and Dustin Weaver.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn May 2014, Jim Starlin and Ron Lim worked together on the one-shot Thanos Annual, which is a prelude to a new trilogy of original graphic novels. The first, Thanos: The Infinity Revelation, was released the following August.[6][7] Beginning in February 2015, Starlin also penned a four-issue miniseries titled Thanos vs. Hulk, which was set prior to the graphic novels. The second installment in the trilogy, Thanos: The Infinity Relativity, was released in June, 2015.[8] The third graphic novel, Thanos: The Infinity Finale, as well as the connected mini-series The Infinity Entity were published in 2016.[9]\\r\\n\\r\\nAt the same time Starlin was writing these graphic novels and tie-ins, the character also appeared in New Avengers #23ÿ24 (OctÿNov 2014),[10] Guardians of the Galaxy vol. 3, #18ÿ20 (OctÿDec 2014), Legendary Star-Lord #4 (Dec 2014), a six-issue miniseries titled Thanos: A God Up There Listening (Dec 2014), Avengers vol. 5, #40ÿ41 (MarÿApr 2015), and Deadpool vol. 3, #45 (\\"#250\\") (Jun 2015). Thanos also played a major role in the five-issue miniseries The Infinity Gauntlet vol. 2, (July 2015 ÿ Jan 2016), a tie-in of the cross-over Secret Wars (2015).\\r\\n\\r\\nThanos was born on Saturn's moon Titan as the son of Eternals Mentor and Sui-San, and his brother is Eros of Titan, also known as Starfox. Thanos carries the Deviants gene, and as such, shares the physical appearance of the Eternals' cousin race. At birth, his mother was shocked by his appearance and attempted to kill him, due to believing that her son would annihilate all life in the universe, but was stopped by A'Lars, Thanos' father. During his school years, Thanos was a pacifist[11] and would only play with his brother Eros (Starfox) and pets. By adolescence, Thanos had become fascinated with nihilism and death, worshipping and eventually falling in love with the physical embodiment of death, Mistress Death.[12] As an adult, Thanos augmented his physical strength and powers through his superior scientific knowledge. He also attempted to create a new life for himself by siring many children as well as becoming a pirate. He finds no fulfillment in either until he is visited again by Mistress Death, for whom he murders his offspring and his pirate captain.[13]\\r\\n\\r\\nWishing to impress Mistress Death, Thanos gathers an army of villainous aliens and begins a nuclear bombardment of Titan that kills millions of his race.[14] Seeking universal power in the form of the Cosmic Cube, Thanos travels to Earth. Prior to landing, his vessel destroys a nearby car as a family witnesses his arrival.[15] Unbeknownst to Thanos, two of the family members in the vehicle survive: the father's spirit is preserved by the Titanian cosmic entity Kronos and is given a new form as Drax the Destroyer while the daughter is found by Thanos' father, Mentor, and is raised to become the heroine Moondragon. Thanos eventually locates the Cube, and also attracts the attention of Mistress Death. Willing the Cube to make him omnipotent, Thanos then discards the Cube. He imprisons Kronos and taunts Kree hero Captain Marvel, who, with the aid of superhero team the Avengers and ISAAC (a super-computer based on Titan), is eventually able to defeat Thanos by destroying the Cube.[16]\\r\\n\\r\\nThanos later comes to the aid of Adam Warlock in a war against the Magus and his religious empire.[17][18] During this alliance Thanos cultivates a plan to reunite with Mistress Death, and secretly siphons off the energies of Warlock's Soul Gem, combining these with the power of the other Infinity Gems to create a weapon capable of destroying a star. Warlock summons the Avengers and Captain Marvel to stop Thanos, although the plan is foiled when Thanos kills Warlock. The Titan regroups and captures the heroes, who are freed by Spider-Man and the Thing. Thanos is finally stopped by Warlock, whose spirit emerges from the Soul Gem and turns the Titan to stone.[14][19] Thanos's spirit eventually reappears to accompany a dying Captain Marvel's soul into the realm of Death.[20]\\r\\n\\r\\nThanos is eventually resurrected,[21] and collects the Infinity Gems once again.[22] He uses the gems to create the Infinity Gauntlet, making himself omnipotent, and erases half the living things in the universe to prove his love to Death.[23] This act and several other acts are soon undone by Nebula and Adam Warlock.[24] Warlock reveals that Thanos has always allowed himself to be defeated because the Titan secretly knows he is not worthy of ultimate power. Thanos joins Warlock as part of the Infinity Watch and helps him to defeat first his evil[25] and then good[26] personas, and cure Thor of \\"warrior Madness\\".[27]\\r\\n\\r\\nThanos later recruits a team of Earth-bound super-villains and puts them under the field leadership of Geatar in a mission to capture an ancient robot containing the obscure knowledge of a universal library and extract its data.[28] Thanos uses information from the robot to plot against and battle Tyrant, the first creation of Galactus turned destroyer.[29] When trapped in an alternate dimension, Thanos employs the aid of the brother of Ka-Zar, Parnival Plunder[30] and later the Hulk[31] to escape, although both attempts are unsuccessful. Thanos is eventually freed and comes into conflict with Thor, aligning himself with Mangog in a scheme to obtain powerful mystical and cosmic talismans which will allow him to destroy all life in the universe,[32] and during their battles Thanos decimates the planet Rigel-3.[33]\\r\\n\\r\\nThanos then uses the heroes Thor and Genis-Vell (Captain Marvel's son) against the death god Walker, who attempts to woo Mistress Death and then destroy the entity after being rejected.[34] Thanos then devises a plan to become the All-Father of a new pantheon of gods created by himself. Thanos, however, finds himself opposed by the Avengers' former member Mantis and her son Quoi, who apparently is destined to be the Celestial Messiah. Thanos abandons this plan after having to unite with Mistress Death to destroy the \\"Rot\\", a cosmic aberration in deep space caused by Thanos's incessant love for Death.[35] Thanos also once conducted extensive research on genetics, studying many of the universe's heroes and villains before Cloning them, and gene-spliced his own DNA into the subjects. Although he later abandons the project, five clones survive, being versions of Professor X, Iron Man, Gladiator, Doctor Strange, and Galactus respectively. A sixth and unnamed version of Thanos also appears, and it is revealed the incarnations of Thanos encountered in the past by Thor and Ka-Zar were actually clones. The true Thanos?ÿ with the aid of Adam Warlock, Gamora, Pip the Troll, Spider-Man, Captain Marvel, and Dr. Strange?ÿ destroys the remaining clones.[36]\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen the ancient Egyptian pharaoh Akhenaten uses a source of cosmic power, the Heart of the Universe, to seize power in present-day Earth (killing most of Earth's heroes in the process), Thanos uses a time-travel stratagem to defeat him. Thanos then uses the Heart of the Universe to reverse Akhenaten's actions and was also compelled to correct a flaw in the universe, for which Mistress Death kisses him, and speaks to him for the first time. Changed by the experience, Thanos advises confidant Adam Warlock he will no longer seek universal conquest.[37]\\r\\n\\r\\nThanos decides to atone for the destruction of Rigel-3, and agrees to aid a colony of Rigellians in evacuating their planet before Galactus can consume it. During the course of this mission Thanos learns Galactus is collecting the Infinity Gems in an effort to end his unyielding hunger. Thanos later learns Galactus is being manipulated into releasing a multiversal threat called Hunger, which feeds on entire universes. Despite opposition from Thanos, Galactus unwittingly frees the entity, and when its intentions are revealed, the pair team up and attempt to destroy it.[38]\\r\\n\\r\\nEn route to the Kyln, an intergalactic prison, Thanos meets Death for the first time since re-building existence with the Heart of the Universe. Death claims to be worth wooing, but says Thanos must offer something other than death. At the Kyln Thanos encounters Peter Quill, who has retired himself from the role of Star-Lord, and the Strontian warrior Gladiator of the Shi'ar Empire, who are both prisoners, as well as the Beyonder, who has been rendered amnesiac by its choice to assume a humanoid female form. Thanos battles the Beyonder, causing its mind to shut down and leaving its power trapped within a comatose physical form. Thanos then instructs the Kyln officers to keep the Beyonder on life support indefinitely in order to prevent the entity from being reborn.[39] The destruction frees Thanos and his fellow inmates, and he finds himself accompanied by the chaos-mite Skreet in his plans to leave the remains of the prison. He discovers, however, that the destruction wrought by the battle with the Beyonder has freed the last prisoner brought in by Peter Quill before he gave up the title of Star-Lord: the Fallen One, revealed to be the true first Herald of Galactus, who had been held in a container deep in the Kyln. Thanos defeats the former Herald and places him under complete mental control.[40] He later appears in Wisconsin attempting to charge a weapon called the Pyramatrix with the life force of everyone on Earth until he is defeated by Squirrel Girl. After the battle, Uatu the Watcher appears and confirms to Squirrel Girl that she defeated the real Thanos, not a clone or copy.[41]\\r\\n\\r\\nDuring the Annihilation War Thanos allies himself with the genocidal villain Annihilus. When the Annihilation Wave destroys the Kyln, Thanos sends the Fallen to check on the status of the Beyonder, whose mortal form he finds has perished. Before the Fallen can report back to Thanos it encounters Tenebrous and Aegis: two of Galactus's ancient foes. Thanos convinces Tenebrous and Aegis to join the Annihilation Wave in order to get revenge on Galactus, and they subsequently defeat the World Devourer and the Silver Surfer. Annihilus desires the secret of the Power Cosmic and asks Thanos to study Galactus. Once Thanos learns Annihilus's true goal is to use the Power Cosmic to destroy all life and remain the sole survivor, he decides to free Galactus. Drax the Destroyer kills Thanos before he can do so but discovers that Thanos had placed a failsafe device to allow Silver Surfer to free Galactus in the event that Annihilus betrayed him.[42] During a climactic battle with Annihilus, Nova is near death and sees Thanos standing with Mistress Death.[43]\\r\\n\\r\\nA cocoon protected by the Universal Church of Truth is revealed to be hiding Thanos, who has been chosen by Oblivion to be the new Avatar of Death.[44] Resurrected before his mind could be fully formed, Thanos goes on a mindless rampage before being captured by the Guardians of the Galaxy.[45]  Thanos pretends to aid the Guardians against the invading Cancerverse, and after discovering its origin kills an alternate version of Mar-Vell, the self-proclaimed Avatar of Life. This causes the collapse of the Cancerverse, and Nova sacrifices himself in an attempt to contain Thanos inside the imploding reality.[46] Thanos escapes[47] and returns to Earth seeking an artificial cosmic cube. He forms an incarnation of the criminal group Zodiac to retrieve it, but he is defeated by the Avengers and the Guardians of the Galaxy and remanded to the custody of the  Elders of the Universe.[48]\\r\\n\\r\\nThanos soon invades Earth again after being informed that most of the Avengers have temporarily left the planet.[49] He launches an assault on Attilan, which he offers to spare in exchange for the deaths of all Inhumans between the ages of 16 and 22. Black Bolt later informs the Illuminati that the true purpose of the invasion is to find and kill Thane, an Eternal/Inhuman hybrid that Thanos had secretly fathered years earlier.[50] Thanos is trapped in a pocket limbo of stasis by his son.[51] Thanos is freed by Namor and was among the villains that joined his Cabal to destroy other worlds.[52] Thanos later meets his end on Battleworld, where he is easily killed by God Emperor Doom during an attempted insurrection.[53]\\r\\n\\r\\nThanos is unintentionally brought back to life by Galactus.[54] When Thanos prepares to raid a Project Pegasus facility to steal a Cosmic Cube, he is ambushed and defeated by a team of Avengers. During their battle, he mortally wounds War Machine and critically injures She-Hulk.[55][56][57] After his defeat, he is imprisoned in the Triskelion,[58] and manipulates Anti-Man into facilitating his escape.[59] Thanos goes on a killing spree, but Black Panther, Blue Marvel and Monica Rambeau are able to stop him by devising a device that blocks the electrical synapses in his brain.[60]\\r\\n\\r\\nThanos somehow later recovers and escapes captivity, and reclaims his Black Order forces from Corvus Glaive. After retaking command of his Black Quadrant outpost, Thanos discovers that he is dying.[61] Thanos tries to force Mentor to find a cure for his malady, but kills him when he is unable to.[62] Soon after Thanos would be battered and detained by the Shi'ar Imperial Guard after he invaded the very planet station of his father's facility sitting in their territory.[63] A quick jump into the future shows Thanos' estranged son Thane having bested his mad father with the personification of death at his side.[64]\\r\\n\\r\\nPresently locked within a maximum security cosmic Alcatraz, Thanos sits alone within a cell as his sickness ravages his body. All while being mocked by its prison warden whom he lured into a false sense of security in order to escape; ripping off his arm for escape access and murdering half his personal staff in a bid for freedom.[65] Having narrowly escaped his imprisonment before its self-destruction, Thanos retreats to a hidden outpost where a roving mercenary colony loyal only to him was once stationed. Only to find it decimated at the hand of the new lover of Mistress Death; who reveals that she'd stricken her former avatar with his fatal sickness, being his son Thane, now boasting the power of the Phoenix Force. Whom under her coaxing, had banished the mad titan back to the decimated Moon of Titan now entirely stripped of his godlike powers.[66]\\r\\n\\r\\nFor the next few months, Thanos would survive alone and all but powerless in the ruins of his home city. Surviving off the flesh of mutated vermin and being accosted by local scavengers who preyed upon him in his weakened condition, he is soon picked up by the unlikely crew of Thane's betrayed cohorts Tryco Slatterus, his adopted daughter Nebula and his brother Eros of Titan.[67] Having heard of their plight, the three were dismayed to find Thanos stripped of all he was and had ever been; his second daughter only agreeing to come along so she could kill her father, immediately assaulted him.[volume?&?issue?needed]\\r\\n\\r\\nStarfox was able to preempt her attempt at patricide while inviting his wayward tyrant of a brother aboard their vessel. Thanos mentioned the only way for him to be relieved of his mortality was to seek out the God Quarry heralded by The Witches of Infinity. Starfox initially wrote this off as fable and folklore. Now on the path to the cosmic coven set at the edge of the known universe, Thanos and crew stop short of a black hole, knowing full well that it is where the witches make their home. The Mad Titan jumps into the pinhole of nothingness alongside his brother, whom not trusting his butcherous sibling with the supposed infinite power of said collective; having survived the crushing force of the singularity they dove into, Thanos and Eros are greeted by the Coven at the godly graveyard.[68]\\r\\n\\r\\nThanos demands the three that are one to return his godhood to him. Starfox tries his best charm the enchantresses only to be rebuked by them, much to Thanos's joy when they prematurely aged him. Seeing as it was neither their place to destroy nor turn away those seeking them, The Witches profess the only way for the warlord to be made whole again was to climb down into the God Quarry and await a trial that would test his soul. Immediately after setting foot within the graveyard of old gods, Thanos is subsumed into the bedrock within which they rest.[69]\\r\\n\\r\\nAs his journey of the core being commenced, Thanos's trial began with him as leader of earth and the universes greatest champions, the Avengers. But he's unable to escape the nagging feeling he's forgotten something, till the quarry itself wearing the guise of Falcon reminds him of who he used to be; tempting him to live as a hero and a man at peace for the first time in his immortal life. But Thanos laughs maniacally as he coldly rebukes such a path, ruthlessly killing his would be friends and allies while choosing to remain whom he always was. His cosmic might returned to him, Thanos is freed from the God Quarry, wherein he immediately accosts his brother Eros and threatens the coven to release him from their domain so that he might do away with Thane once and for all.[70]\\r\\n\\r\\nAround the time of the New Thor's appearance, Thanos is approached by a mysterious hooded woman, who proposes an alliance. He tasks her with bringing him the hammer of the deceased Ultimate Thor.[71] The woman fails, but removes her disguise to reveal herself as Hela, the Norse goddess of death. She tells Thanos that she needs his help to reclaim Hel, and in exchange, offers to give him the one thing he has been searching for his entire life: death. After this, the two kiss.[72]\\r\\n\\r\\nSome time after his battle with Thane, Thanos travels to the Chitauri homeworld. However, upon subjugating the planet, he is attacked by a being identified only as The Rider, who captures Thanos and uses a piece of the fractured Time Stone to bring Thanos millions of years into the future, where he encounters an elderly version of himself who has destroyed nearly all life in the universe.[73] At first, Thanos believes it to be some sort of trick, but is convinced once the future Thanos utters the name Dione, which Thanos's mother had planned to name him before she went insane.[74] King Thanos reveals he needs his younger self's assistance to defeat the Fallen One, the last being left in the Universe, so that he may finally reunite with Death.[75] The Fallen One soon arrives, revealed to be a darkened Silver Surfer armed with the hordes of Annihilus and the deceased Thor's Mjolnir, using the latter to swiftly kill the Rider. The Surfer is distracted by the feral Hulk that Thanos kept chained in his basement, allowing the two Thanos to kill him using Surtur's Twilight Sword.[76] Upon the Surfer's death, Death arrives, and Thanos realizes the true reason that King Thanos brought him into the future: so that King Thanos can finally die, reasoning that if he must die, it can only be at the hands of himself. At first, Thanos is more than happy to oblige his future counterpart's request, but quickly stops, disappointed at how pathetic and submissive his older self has become. Resolving to never become as pathetic and complacent as King Thanos has become, Thanos uses the fragment of the Time Stone and the Power Cosmic left in the Surfer's corpse to return to the present day. As the future begins to crumble around him, King Thanos realizes that his younger self has taken the steps necessary to ensure that this timeline will never take place. As he fades into nothingness, King Thanos asks Death what his younger self did, to which she simply responds \\"he won.\\"[77]\\r\\n\\r\\nThanos later discovers that the Infinity Stones are being collected once again and begins plotting to reassemble his gauntlet, however he is assaulted by Requiem, whom he apparently recognizes, and is quickly killed. She then destroys the Infinity Gauntlet and also commands the Chitauri loyal to Thanos to die.[78]\\r\\n\\r\\nThanos is a mutant member of the race of superhumans known as the Titanian Eternals. The character possesses abilities common to the Eternals, but amplified to a higher degree through a combination of his mutantÿEternal heritage, bionic amplification, mysticism, and power bestowed by the abstract entity, Death. Demonstrating enormous superhuman strength, speed, stamina, immortality and invulnerability among other qualities, Thanos can absorb and project vast quantities of cosmic energy, and is capable of telekinesis and telepathy. He can manipulate matter and live indefinitely without food, air or water, cannot die of old age, is immune to all terrestrial diseases, and has high resistance to psychic assaults. Thanos is also an accomplished hand-to-hand combatant, having been trained in the art of war on Titan.\\r\\n\\r\\nThanos has proven himself capable of briefly holding his own in battle against Odin,[79] and of blasting Galactus off his feet.[80]\\r\\n\\r\\nThanos is a supergenius in virtually all known fields of advanced science and has created technology far exceeding that which is found on contemporary Earth. He often employs a transportation chair capable of space flight, force field projection, teleportation, time travel, and movement through alternate universes. Thanos is also a master strategist and uses several space vessels, at least three under the name \\"Sanctuary\\", as a base of operations.\\r\\n\\r\\nDuring the 1996 Amalgam Comics crossover between DC Comics and Marvel, Thanos merged with Darkseid to become \\"Thanoseid\\".[81]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the alternate universe limited series Earth X, Thanos dwelled in the Realm of the Dead with the entity Death.[82] It is revealed his mother was a Skrull and Death used her secret to make him believe that Death was his mother. When the deception is revealed, he uses the Ultimate Nullifier on Death.[83]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Ultimate Marvel imprint title Ultimate Fantastic Four features an alternate universe version of Thanos who is the ruler of Acheron (and has a son called Ronan the Accuser, who is in possession of a Cosmic Cube[84]), a vast empire consisting of thousands of worlds on another plane of existence.[85]\\r\\n\\r\\nThanos features in the limited series Marvel Zombies 2, set in the alternate universe of Earth-2149. Having been \\"zombified\\" and recruited into the cosmically powered Galacti, the character is killed by the cosmic-powered Hulk after an altercation over food.[86]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn an unnamed alternate reality, the Rider is revived here by a variation of Odin where he plans to dispose of Thanos before he grows up to become a villain. When his Penance Stare doesn't work since the baby Thanos hasn't committed any sins yet, the Rider takes the Baby Thanos under his wing and plans to change his future this way.[87]\\r\\n\\r\\nA number of the stories featuring Thanos have been republished into trade paperbacks and other collected editions:\\r\\n\\r\\nThanos was ranked number 47 on IGN's top 100 comic book villains of all time,[117] 22nd on Wizard's Top 100 Greatest Villains list,[citation needed] and number 21 on Complex's 25 Greatest Comic Book Villains List.[118]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Reddit forum /r/ThanosDidNothingWrong dedicated to sharing theories and memes about the character became very popular in July 2018 when the anticipated biggest banning in Reddit's history became viral.

Nelson, Sr. (July 8, 1895 ÿ January 9, 2007) was, at age 111, the oldest living man in the United States and the second-oldest man in the world from December 7, 2006 (the death of Moses Hardy), for one month until his own death, aged 111 years, 185 days.\\r\\nHe had been living in Port Arthur, Texas, since the early 1930s. He opened a candy shop in the mid-1930s, and worked there for more than 60 years.[80][81]\\r\\nArbella Ewing (ne Perkins) (March 13, 1894 ÿ March 22, 2008)[30][82] was, at the time of her death at age 114, the third-oldest living person in the world behind Edna Parker of United States and Maria de Jesus of Portugal, the second-oldest person in the United States and the oldest living African American.[83]\\r\\nEwing, the fourth of 12 children, grew up in Streetman, Texas, and married Frank Ewing in 1915, after which she moved to South Dallas. Her former house is still located in South Dallas today. She had a sister named Annie, who was born in 1904 and was 103 at the time of her death. When she was an adult, she worked in a local bikeshop in Streetman. Her great-grandparents were slaves in Mississippi. After marrying Frank Ewing, they had a daughter, named Claudia, who died in 1970. The Ewing family stated she was a gem in the family according to The Dallas Morning News. She lived in her own home in Dallas until the age of 113, after breaking her hip at her birthday party, she was moved into a personal care home, where she eventually died nine days after having reached the age of 114. The people close to her attributed her longevity to positive thinking.[83][84][85]\\r\\nGeorge Rene Francis (June 6, 1896 ÿ December 27, 2008)[86][87][88] was an American supercentenarian and the joint second-oldest living man in the world, together with Englishman Henry Allingham, until Francis's death aged 112 years, 204 days. He was also the oldest living man in the United States, following the death of Antonio Pierro on February 8, 2007. Francis was from New Orleans, Louisiana, but since 1949 lived in Sacramento, California, where a local newspaper published a poem that Francis enjoyed reciting to friends and the public throughout his life.[89] He credited his longevity to nature, and enjoyed a rich diet of pork, eggs, milk and lard. He gave up smoking cigars at the age of 75.[90]\\r\\nFrancis attempted to join the army in World War I but was rejected for service in 1918 as being too short and small (he weighed only about 100 pounds (45.35?kg)). Despite this, he later was a boxer before becoming a barber and then a chauffeur.[86] Francis claimed to have met Louis Armstrong and Booker T. Washington and to have seen Babe Ruth hit a home run. His wife died in 1964.\\r\\nShelby Harris (March 31, 1901?ÿ July 25, 2012),[91] an African American, was oldest verified man in the United States (since the death of Walter Breuning on April 14, 2011), the third-oldest man in the world and Illinois's oldest living person at the time of his death.[91][92][93]\\r\\nA native of Ayrshire, Indiana, Harris worked in coal mines and a foundry. At 41 he joined the Army for World War II, but a broken ankle ended his training. A deacon of his church until he was 102, Harris entered a Rock Island nursing home at 105. At his death he was a great-great-great-grandfather, his youngest grandson 57 years old.[94] Harris died on July 25, 2012, aged 111 years, 116 days.[91]","input":"Who is the oldest living person in america?"},{"output":"prosecution","context":"Criminal procedure is the adjudication process of the criminal law. While criminal procedure differs dramatically by jurisdiction, the process generally begins with a formal criminal charge with the person on trial either being free on bail or incarcerated, and results in the conviction or acquittal of the defendant. Criminal procedure can be either in form of inquisitorial or adversarial criminal procedure.\\r\\n\\r\\nCurrently, in many countries with a democratic system and the rule of law, criminal procedure puts the burden of proof on the prosecution ÿ that is, it is up to the prosecution to prove that the defendant is guilty beyond any reasonable doubt, as opposed to having the defense prove that s/he is innocent, and any doubt is resolved in favor of the defendant. This provision, known as the presumption of innocence, is required, for example, in the 46 countries that are members of the Council of Europe, under Article 6 of the European Convention on Human Rights, and it is included in other human rights documents. However, in practice it operates somewhat differently in different countries.  Such basic rights also include the right for the defendant to know what offence he or she has been arrested for or is being charged with, and the right to appear before a judicial official within a certain time of being arrested.  Many jurisdictions also allow the defendant the right to legal counsel and provide any defendant who cannot afford their own lawyer with a lawyer paid for at the public expense.\\r\\n\\r\\nMost countries make a rather clear distinction between civil and criminal procedures. For example, an English criminal court may force a defendant to pay a fine as punishment for his crime, and he may sometimes have to pay the legal costs of the prosecution. But the victim of the crime pursues his claim for compensation in a civil, not a criminal, action.[1] In France, Italy, and many countries besides, the victim of a crime (known as the \\"injured party\\") may be awarded damages by a criminal court judge.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe standards of proof are higher in a criminal action than in a civil one since the loser risks not only financial penalties but also being sent to prison (or, in some countries, execution). In English law the prosecution must prove the guilt of a criminal beyond reasonable doubt; but the plaintiff in a civil action is required to prove his case on the balance of probabilities.[1] \\"Beyond reasonable doubt\\" is not defined for the jury which decides the verdict, but it has been said by appeal courts that proving guilt beyond reasonable doubt requires the prosecution to exclude any reasonable hypothesis consistent with innocence: Plomp v. R. In a civil case, however, the court simply weighs the evidence and decides what is most probable.\\r\\n\\r\\nCriminal and civil procedure are different. Although some systems, including the English, allow a private citizen to bring a criminal prosecution against another citizen, criminal actions are nearly always started by the state. Civil actions, on the other hand, are usually started by individuals.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn Anglo-American law, the party bringing a criminal action (that is, in most cases, the state) is called the prosecution, but the party bringing a civil action is the plaintiff. In both kinds of action the other party is known as the defendant. A criminal case against a person called Ms. Sanchez would be described as United States vs. (=versus, or against) Sanchez in the United States if initiated by the federal government; if initiated by a state, it would typically be called \\"[Name of the State] vs. Sanchez\\" or \\"The People vs. Sanchez.\\"  In England, it would be styled R. (Regina, that is, the Queen) vs. Sanchez. But a civil action between Ms. Sanchez and a Mr. Smith would be Sanchez vs. Smith if started by Sanchez, and Smith vs. Sanchez if started by Mr. Smith.\\r\\n\\r\\nEvidence given at a criminal trial is not necessarily admissible in a civil action about the same matter, just as evidence given in a civil cause is not necessarily admissible on a criminal trial. For example, the victim of a road accident does not directly benefit if the driver who injured him is found guilty of the crime of careless driving. He still has to prove his case in a civil action.[1] In fact he may be able to prove his civil case even when the driver is found not guilty in the criminal trial. If the accused has given evidence on his trial he may be cross-examined on those statements in a subsequent civil action regardless of the criminal verdict.\\r\\n\\r\\nOnce the plaintiff has shown that the defendant is liable, the main argument in a civil court is about the amount of money, or damages, which the defendant should pay to the plaintiff.[1]\\r\\n\\r\\nProponents of either system tend to consider that their system defends best the rights of the innocent. There is a tendency in common law countries to believe that civil law / inquisitorial systems do not have the so-called \\"presumption of innocence\\", and do not provide the defence with adequate rights. Conversely, there is a tendency in countries with an inquisitorial system to believe that accusatorial proceedings unduly favour rich defendants who can afford large legal teams, and are very harsh on poorer defendants.","input":"What are the parties in a criminal case?"},{"output":"Coolio","context":"(pilot only)\\r\\n\\r\\n(season 4)\\r\\n\\r\\n (co-producer) (season 4)\\r\\n\\r\\n (co-producer) (season 4)\\r\\n\\r\\nKenan & Kel is an American teen sitcom created by Kim Bass for Nickelodeon.

The first two seasons were filmed at Nickelodeon Studios in Orlando, Florida, and the remaining two were filmed at the Nick on Sunset theater in Hollywood.\\r\\n\\r\\nKenan & Kel received critical acclaim, with praise of the performance of the title characters. It won the \\"Favorite TV Show\\" award at the 1998 Kids Choice Awards, and Thompson and Mitchell were ranked No. 40 and No. 39, respectively, on VH1's 100 Greatest Kid Stars. Reruns of the show are currently shown on TeenNick, as part of their programming block NickSplat, as well as MTV2, a sister channel of TeenNick under Viacom.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe show was set in Chicago, Illinois, and centered on the antics of two mischievous teenagers, Kenan Rockmore (Kenan Thompson) and Kel Kimble (Kel Mitchell). Kenan is a high school student with a job at a local grocery store, while Kel is his clumsy, orange soda-loving best friend.\\r\\n\\r\\nEpisodes of the series always open and closed with Kenan and Kel breaking the fourth wall by interacting with the studio audience, standing in front of a red curtain that is placed in front of the main set while they are still in character. A frequent running gag of the openings is Kel never knowing what the night's episode would be about and Kenan refusing to tell him. The closings would frequently feature Kenan coming up with a new scheme, often asking Kel to get various assorted items and meet him somewhere. Frazzled, Kel would exclaim his catchphrase, \\"Aww, here it goes!\\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAnother catchphrase commonly heard throughout the series is \\"WHYYYYYYY!?!?\\", usually screamed by Kenan after Kel does something stupid.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe theme song, entitled \\"Aw, Here It Goes\\", is performed by rapper Coolio. He is featured in the opening credits of the show along with Kenan and Kel. The lyrics describe the show and reference other famous duos such as Siegfried & Roy, Abbott & Costello, Penn & Teller, and former Los Angeles Lakers teammates Magic Johnson and Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, as well as Nancy Drew and The Hardy Boys.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe series was created by Kim Bass (who also co-created the teen sitcom Sister, Sister). It was reminiscent of the classic comedic duo stylings of Laurel and Hardy, Martin and Lewis or Abbott and Costello (who were actually mentioned in the theme song), with Kenan being the straight man and Kel his comedic foil.[2]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe show was taped in front of a live-studio audience and ran from August 17, 1996[3] to May 3, 2000[4], totaling 62 episodes. One full-length TV movie was created, entitled Two Heads Are Better Than None, which aired on July 15, 2000, thus ending the series serving as its finale.

This includes both manned and unmanned (robotic) missions. The first human-made object to reach the surface of the Moon was the Soviet Union's Luna 2 mission, on 13 September 1959.[3]\\r\\nThe United States' Apollo 11 was the first manned mission to land on the Moon, on 20 July 1969.[4] There have been six manned U.S. landings (between 1969 and 1972) and numerous unmanned landings, with no soft landings happening from 22 August 1976 until 14 December 2013.\\r\\nTo date, the United States is the only country to have successfully conducted manned missions to the Moon, with the last departing the lunar surface in December 1972.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter the unsuccessful attempt by the Luna 1 to land on the moon in 1959, the Soviet Union performed the first hard (unpowered) moon landing later that same year with the Luna 2 spacecraft, a feat the U.S. duplicated in 1962 with Ranger 4. Since then, twelve Soviet and U.S. spacecraft have used braking rockets to make soft landings and perform scientific operations on the lunar surface, between 1966 and 1976. In 1966 the USSR accomplished the first soft landings and took the first pictures from the lunar surface during the Luna 9 and Luna 13 missions. The U.S. followed with five unmanned Surveyor soft landings.\\r\\nThe Soviet Union achieved the first unmanned lunar soil sample return with the Luna 16 probe on 24 September 1970. This was followed by Luna 20 and Luna 24 in 1972 and 1976, respectively. Following the failure at launch in 1969 of the first Lunokhod, Luna E-8 No.201, the Luna 17 and Luna 21 were successful unmanned lunar rover missions in 1970 and 1973.\\r\\nMany missions were failures at launch. In addition, several unmanned landing missions achieved the Lunar surface but were unsuccessful, including: Luna 15, Luna 18, and Luna 23 all crashed on landing; and the U.S. Surveyor 4 lost all radio contact only moments before its landing.\\r\\nMore recently, other nations have crashed spacecraft on the surface of the Moon at speeds of around 8,000 kilometres per hour (5,000?mph), often at precise, planned locations. These have generally been end-of-life lunar orbiters that, because of system degradations, could no longer overcome perturbations from lunar mass concentrations (\\"masscons\\") to maintain their orbit. Japan's lunar orbiter Hiten impacted the Moon's surface on 10 April 1993. The European Space Agency performed a controlled crash impact with their orbiter SMART-1 on 3 September 2006.\\r\\nIndian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) performed a controlled crash impact with its Moon Impact Probe (MIP) on 14 November 2008. The MIP was an ejected probe from the Indian Chandrayaan-1 lunar orbiter and performed remote sensing experiments during its descent to the lunar surface.\\r\\nThe Chinese lunar orbiter Chang'e 1 executed a controlled crash onto the surface of the Moon on 1 March 2009. The rover mission Chang'e 3 was launched on 1 December 2013 and soft-landed on 14 December.\\r\\nA total of twelve men have landed on the Moon. This was accomplished with two US pilot-astronauts flying a Lunar Module on each of six NASA missions across a 41-month period starting on 20 July 1969 UTC, with Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin on Apollo 11, and ending on 14 December 1972 UTC with Gene Cernan and Jack Schmitt on Apollo 17. Cernan was the last to step off the lunar surface.\\r\\nAll Apollo lunar missions had a third crew member who remained on board the Command Module. The last three missions had a rover for increased mobility.\\r\\nIn order to go to the Moon, a spacecraft must first leave the gravity well of the Earth. The only practical way of accomplishing this currently is with a rocket. Unlike other airborne vehicles such as balloons or jets, a rocket is the only known form of propulsion which can continue to increase its speed at high altitudes in the vacuum outside the Earth's atmosphere.\\r\\nUpon approach of the target moon, a spacecraft will be drawn ever closer to its surface at increasing speeds due to gravity. In order to land intact it must decelerate to less than about 160 kilometres per hour (99?mph) and be ruggedized to withstand a \\"hard landing\\" impact, or it must decelerate to negligible speed at contact for a \\"soft landing\\" (which is the only viable option with human occupants). The first three attempts by the U.S. to perform a successful hard moon landing with a ruggedized seismometer package in 1962 all failed.[5] The Soviets first achieved the milestone of a hard lunar landing with a ruggedized camera in 1966, followed only months later by the first unmanned soft lunar landing by the U.S.\\r\\nThe speed of a crash landing on its surface is typically between 70 and 100% of the escape velocity of the target moon, and thus this is the total velocity which must be shed from the target moon's gravitational attraction for a soft landing to occur. For Earth's Moon, the escape velocity is 2.38 kilometres per second (1.48?mi/s).[6] The change in velocity (referred to as a delta-v) is usually provided by a landing rocket, which must be carried into space by the original launch vehicle as part of the overall spacecraft. An exception is the soft moon landing on Titan carried out by the Huygens probe in 2005. As the moon with the thickest atmosphere, landings on Titan may be accomplished by using atmospheric entry techniques that are generally lighter in weight than a rocket with equivalent capability.\\r\\nThe Soviets succeeded in making the first crash landing on the Moon in 1959.[7] Crash landings[8] may occur because of malfunctions in a spacecraft, or they can be deliberately arranged for vehicles which do not have an onboard landing rocket. There have been many such moon crashes, often with their flight path controlled to impact at precise locations on the lunar surface. For example, during the Apollo program the S-IVB third stage of the Saturn V moon rocket as well as the spent ascent stage of the lunar module were deliberately crashed on the Moon several times to provide impacts registering as a moonquake on seismometers that had been left on the lunar surface. Such crashes were instrumental in mapping the internal structure of the Moon.\\r\\nTo return to Earth, the escape velocity of the Moon must be overcome for the spacecraft to escape the gravity well of the Moon. Rockets must be used to leave the Moon and return to space. Upon reaching Earth, atmospheric entry techniques are used to absorb the kinetic energy of a returning spacecraft and reduce its speed for safe landing.[citation needed] These functions greatly complicate a moon landing mission and lead to many additional operational considerations. Any moon departure rocket must first be carried to the Moon's surface by a moon landing rocket, increasing the latter's required size. The Moon departure rocket, larger moon landing rocket and any Earth atmosphere entry equipment such as heat shields and parachutes must in turn be lifted by the original launch vehicle, greatly increasing its size by a significant and almost prohibitive degree.\\r\\nThe intense efforts devoted in the 1960s to achieving first an unmanned and then ultimately a manned moon landing become easier to understand in the political context of its historical era. World War II had introduced many new and deadly innovations including blitzkrieg-style surprise attacks used in the invasion of Poland and in the attack on Pearl Harbor; the V-2 rocket, a ballistic missile which killed thousands in attacks on London and Antwerp; and the atom bomb, which killed hundreds of thousands in the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. In the 1950s, tensions mounted between the two ideologically opposed superpowers of the United States and the Soviet Union that had emerged as victors in the conflict, particularly after the development by both countries of the hydrogen bomb.\\r\\nWilly Ley wrote in 1957 that a rocket to the Moon \\"could be built later this year if somebody can be found to sign some papers\\".[9] On 4 October 1957, the Soviet Union launched Sputnik 1 as the first artificial satellite to orbit the Earth and so initiated the Space Race. This unexpected event was a source of pride to the Soviets and shock to the U.S., who could now potentially be surprise attacked by nuclear-tipped Soviet rockets in under 30 minutes.[citation needed] Also, the steady beeping of the radio beacon aboard Sputnik 1 as it passed overhead every 96 minutes was widely viewed on both sides[citation needed] as effective propaganda to Third World countries demonstrating the technological superiority of the Soviet political system compared to that of the U.S. This perception was reinforced by a string of subsequent rapid-fire Soviet space achievements. In 1959, the R-7 rocket was used to launch the first escape from Earth's gravity into a solar orbit, the first crash impact onto the surface of the Moon and the first photography of the never-before-seen far side of the Moon. These were the Luna 1, Luna 2 and Luna 3 spacecraft.\\r\\nThe U.S. response to these Soviet achievements was to greatly accelerate previously existing military space and missile projects and to create a civilian space agency, NASA. Military efforts were initiated to develop and produce mass quantities of intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs) that would bridge the so-called missile gap and enable a policy of deterrence to nuclear war with the Soviets known as mutual assured destruction or MAD. These newly developed missiles were made available to civilians of NASA for various projects (which would have the added benefit of demonstrating the payload, guidance accuracy and reliabilities of U.S. ICBMs to the Soviets).\\r\\nWhile NASA stressed peaceful and scientific uses for these rockets, their use in various lunar exploration efforts also had secondary goal of realistic, goal-oriented testing of the missiles themselves and development of associated infrastructure,[citation needed] just as the Soviets were doing with their R-7.\\r\\nAfter the fall of the Soviet Union in 1991, historical records were released to allow the true accounting of Soviet lunar efforts. Unlike the U.S. tradition of assigning a particular mission name in advance of a launch, the Soviets assigned a public \\"Luna\\" mission number only if a launch resulted in a spacecraft going beyond Earth orbit. The policy had the effect of hiding Soviet Moon mission failures from public view. If the attempt failed in Earth orbit before departing for the Moon, it was frequently (but not always) given a \\"Sputnik\\" or \\"Cosmos\\" Earth-orbit mission number to hide its purpose. Launch explosions were not acknowledged at all.\\r\\nIn contrast to Soviet lunar exploration triumphs in 1959, success eluded initial U.S. efforts to reach the Moon with the Pioneer and Ranger programs. Fifteen consecutive U.S. unmanned lunar missions over a six-year period from 1958 to 1964 all failed their primary photographic missions;[10][11] however, Rangers 4 and 6 successfully repeated the Soviet lunar impacts as part of their secondary missions.[12][13]\\r\\nFailures included three U.S. attempts[5][12][14] in 1962 to hard land small seismometer packages released by the main Ranger spacecraft. These surface packages were to use retrorockets to survive landing, unlike the parent vehicle, which was designed to deliberately crash onto the surface. The final three Ranger probes performed successful high altitude lunar reconnaissance photography missions during intentional crash impacts between 2.62 and 2.68 kilometres per second (9,400 and 9,600?km/h).[15][16][17]\\r\\nThree different designs of Pioneer lunar probes were flown on three different modified ICBMs. Those flown on the Thor booster modified with an Able upper stage carried an infrared image scanning television system with a resolution of 1 milliradian to study the Moon's surface, an ionization chamber to measure radiation in space, a diaphragm/microphone assembly to detect micrometeorites, a magnetometer, and temperature-variable resistors to monitor spacecraft internal thermal conditions. The first, a mission managed by the United States Air Force, exploded during launch; all subsequent Pioneer lunar flights had NASA as the lead management organization. The next two returned to Earth and burned up upon reentry into the atmosphere after achieved maximum altitudes of around 110,000 kilometres (68,000?mi) and 1,450 kilometres (900?mi), far short of the roughly 400,000 kilometres (250,000?mi) required to reach the vicinity of the Moon.\\r\\nNASA then collaborated with the United States Army's Ballistic Missile Agency to fly two extremely small cone-shaped probes on the Juno ICBM, carrying only photocells which would be triggered by the light of the Moon and a lunar radiation environment experiment using a Geiger-Mller tube detector. The first of these reached an altitude of only around 100,000 kilometres (62,000?mi), serendipitously gathering data that established the presence of the Van Allen radiation belts before reentering Earth's atmosphere. The second passed by the Moon at a distance of more than 60,000 kilometres (37,000?mi), twice as far as planned and too far away to trigger either of the on-board scientific instruments, yet still becoming the first U.S. spacecraft to reach a solar orbit.\\r\\nThe final Pioneer lunar probe design consisted of four \\"paddlewheel\\" solar panels extending from a one-meter diameter spherical spin-stabilized spacecraft body that was equipped to take images of the lunar surface with a television-like system, estimate the Moon's mass and topography of the poles, record the distribution and velocity of micrometeorites, study radiation, measure magnetic fields, detect low frequency electromagnetic waves in space and use a sophisticated integrated propulsion system for maneuvering and orbit insertion as well. None of the four spacecraft built in this series of probes survived launch on its Atlas ICBM outfitted with an Able upper stage.\\r\\nFollowing the unsuccessful Atlas-Able Pioneer probes, NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory embarked upon an unmanned spacecraft development program whose modular design could be used to support both lunar and interplanetary exploration missions. The interplanetary versions were known as Mariners; lunar versions were Rangers. JPL envisioned three versions of the Ranger lunar probes: Block I prototypes, which would carry various radiation detectors in test flights to a very high Earth orbit that came nowhere near the Moon; Block II, which would try to accomplish the first Moon landing by hard landing a seismometer package; and Block III, which would crash onto the lunar surface without any braking rockets while taking very high resolution wide-area photographs of the Moon during their descent.\\r\\nThe Ranger 1 and 2 Block I missions were virtually identical.[18][19] Spacecraft experiments included a Lyman-alpha telescope, a rubidium-vapor magnetometer, electrostatic analyzers, medium-energy-range particle detectors, two triple coincidence telescopes, a cosmic-ray integrating ionization chamber, cosmic dust detectors, and scintillation counters. The goal was to place these Block I spacecraft in a very high Earth orbit with an apogee of 110,000 kilometres (68,000?mi) and a perigee of 60,000 kilometres (37,000?mi).[18]\\r\\nFrom that vantage point, scientists could make direct measurements of the magnetosphere over a period of many months while engineers perfected new methods to routinely track and communicate with spacecraft over such large distances. Such practice was deemed vital to be assured of capturing high-bandwidth television transmissions from the Moon during a one-shot fifteen-minute time window in subsequent Block II and Block III lunar descents. Both Block I missions suffered failures of the new Agena upper stage and never left low Earth parking orbit after launch; both burned up upon reentry after only a few days.\\r\\nThe first attempts to perform a Moon landing took place in 1962 during the Rangers 3, 4 and 5 missions flown by the United States.[5][12][14] All three Block II missions basic vehicles were 3.1?m high and consisted of a lunar capsule covered with a balsa wood impact-limiter, 650?mm in diameter, a mono-propellant mid-course motor, a retrorocket with a thrust of 5,050 pounds-force (22.5?kN),[12] and a gold- and chrome-plated hexagonal base 1.5?m in diameter. This lander (code-named Tonto) was designed to provide impact cushioning using an exterior blanket of crushable balsa wood and an interior filled with incompressible liquid freon. A 42?kg (56 pounds) 30-centimetre-diameter (0.98?ft) metal payload sphere floated and was free to rotate in a liquid freon reservoir contained in the landing sphere[citation needed].\\r\\nThis payload sphere contained six silver-cadmium batteries to power a fifty-milliwatt radio transmitter, a temperature sensitive voltage controlled oscillator to measure lunar surface temperatures, and a seismometer that was designed with sensitivity high enough to detect the impact of a 5?lb (2.3?kg) meteorite on the opposite side of the Moon. Weight was distributed in the payload sphere so it would rotate in its liquid blanket to place the seismometer into an upright and operational position no matter what the final resting orientation of the external landing sphere. After landing, plugs were to be opened allowing the freon to evaporate and the payload sphere to settle into upright contact with the landing sphere. The batteries were sized to allow up to three months of operation for the payload sphere. Various mission constraints limited the landing site to Oceanus Procellarum on the lunar equator, which the lander ideally would reach 66 hours after launch.\\r\\nNo cameras were carried by the Ranger landers, and no pictures were to be captured from the lunar surface during the mission. Instead, the 3.1 metres (10?ft) Ranger Block II mother ship carried a 200-scan-line television camera which was to capture images during the free-fall descent to the lunar surface. The camera was designed to transmit a picture every 10 seconds.[12] Seconds before impact, at 5 and 0.6 kilometres (3.11 and 0.37?mi) above the lunar surface, the Ranger mother ships took picture (which may be viewed here).\\r\\nOther instruments gathering data before the mother ship crashed onto the Moon were a gamma ray spectrometer to measure overall lunar chemical composition and a radar altimeter. The radar altimeter was to give a signal ejecting the landing capsule and its solid-fueled braking rocket overboard from the Block II mother ship. The braking rocket was to slow and the landing sphere to a dead stop at 330 metres (1,080?ft) above the surface and separate, allowing the landing sphere to free fall once more and hit the surface[citation needed].\\r\\nOn Ranger 3, failure of the Atlas guidance system and a software error aboard the Agena upper stage combined to put the spacecraft on a course that would miss the Moon. Attempts to salvage lunar photography during a flyby of the Moon were thwarted by in-flight failure of the onboard flight computer. This was probably because of prior heat sterilization of the spacecraft by keeping it above the boiling point of water for 24 hours on the ground, to protect the Moon from being contaminated by Earth organisms. Heat sterilization was also blamed for subsequent in-flight failures of the spacecraft computer on Ranger 4 and the power subsystem on Ranger 5. Only Ranger 4 reached the Moon in an uncontrolled crash impact on the far side of the Moon.[citation needed]\\r\\nHeat sterilization was discontinued for the final four Block III Ranger probes.[citation needed] These replaced the Block II landing capsule and its retrorocket with a heavier, more capable television system to support landing site selection for upcoming Apollo manned Moon landing missions. Six cameras were designed to take thousands of high-altitude photographs in the final twenty-minute period before crashing on the lunar surface. Camera resolution was 1,132 scan lines, far higher than the 525 lines found in a typical U.S. 1964 home television. While Ranger 6 suffered a failure of this camera system and returned no photographs despite an otherwise successful flight, the subsequent Ranger 7 mission to Mare Cognitum was a complete success.\\r\\nBreaking the six-year string of failures in U.S. attempts to photograph the Moon at close range, the Ranger 7 mission was viewed as a national turning point and instrumental in allowing the key 1965 NASA budget appropriation to pass through the United States Congress intact without a reduction in funds for the Apollo manned Moon landing program. Subsequent successes with Ranger 8 and Ranger 9 further buoyed U.S. hopes.\\r\\nThe Luna 9 spacecraft, launched by the Soviet Union, performed the first successful soft Moon landing on 3 February, 1966. Airbags protected its 99 kilograms (218?lb) ejectable capsule which survived an impact speed of over 15 metres per second (54?km/h).[20] Luna 13 duplicated this feat with a similar Moon landing on 24 December 1966. Both returned panoramic photographs that were the first views from the lunar surface.[21]\\r\\nLuna 16 was the first robotic probe to land on the Moon and safely return a sample of lunar soil back to Earth.[22] It represented the first lunar sample return mission by the Soviet Union, and was the third lunar sample return mission overall, following the Apollo 11 and Apollo 12 missions. This mission was later successfully repeated by Luna 20 (1972) and Luna 24 (1976).\\r\\nIn 1970 and 1973 two Lunokhod (\\"Moonwalker\\") robotic lunar rovers were delivered to the Moon, where they successfully operated for 10 and 4 months respectively, covering 10.5?km (Lunokhod 1) and 37?km (Lunokhod 2). These rover missions were in operation concurrently with the Zond and Luna series of Moon flyby, orbiter and landing missions.\\r\\nThe U.S. robotic Surveyor program was part of an effort to locate a safe site on the Moon for a human landing and test under lunar conditions the radar and landing systems required to make a true controlled touchdown. Five of Surveyor's seven missions made successful unmanned Moon landings. Surveyor 3 was visited two years after its Moon landing by the crew of Apollo 12. They removed parts of it for examination back on Earth to determine the effects of long-term exposure to the lunar environment.\\r\\nWithin four months of each other in early 1966 the Soviet Union and the United States had accomplished successful Moon landings with unmanned spacecraft. To the general public both countries had demonstrated roughly equal technical capabilities by returning photographic images from the surface of the Moon. These pictures provided a key affirmative answer to the crucial question of whether or not lunar soil would support upcoming manned landers with their much greater weight.\\r\\nHowever, the Luna 9 hard landing of a ruggedized sphere using airbags at a 50 kilometres (31?mi)-per-hour ballistic impact speed had much more in common with the failed 1962 Ranger landing attempts and their planned 160 kilometres (99?mi)-per-hour impacts than with the Surveyor 1 soft landing on three footpads using its radar-controlled, adjustable-thrust retrorocket. While Luna 9 and Surveyor 1 were both major national accomplishments, only Surveyor 1 had reached its landing site employing key technologies that would be needed for a manned flight. Thus as of mid-1966, the United States had begun to pull ahead of the Soviet Union in the so-called Space Race to land a man on the Moon.\\r\\nAdvances in other areas were necessary before manned spacecraft could follow unmanned ones to the surface of the Moon. Of particular importance was developing the expertise to perform flight operations in lunar orbit. Ranger, Surveyor and initial Luna Moon landing attempts all utilized flight paths from Earth that traveled directly to the lunar surface without first placing the spacecraft in a lunar orbit. Such direct ascents use a minimum amount of fuel for unmanned spacecraft on a one-way trip.\\r\\nIn contrast, manned vehicles need additional fuel after a lunar landing to enable a return trip back to Earth for the crew. Leaving this massive amount of required Earth-return fuel in lunar orbit until it is used later in the mission is far more efficient than taking such fuel down to the lunar surface in a Moon landing and then hauling it all back into space yet again, working against lunar gravity both ways. Such considerations lead logically to a lunar orbit rendezvous mission profile for a manned Moon landing.\\r\\nAccordingly, beginning in mid-1966 both the U.S. and U.S.S.R. naturally progressed into missions which featured lunar orbit operations as a necessary prerequisite to a manned Moon landing. The primary goals of these initial unmanned orbiters were extensive photographic mapping of the entire lunar surface for the selection of manned landing sites and, for the Soviets, the checkout of radio communications gear that would be used in future soft landings.\\r\\nAn unexpected major discovery from initial lunar orbiters were vast volumes of dense materials beneath the surface of the Moon's maria. Such mass concentrations (\\"mascons\\") can send a manned mission dangerously off course in the final minutes of a Moon landing when aiming for a relatively small landing zone that is smooth and safe. Mascons were also found over a longer period of time to greatly disturb the orbits of low-altitude satellites around the Moon, making their orbits unstable and forcing an inevitable crash on the lunar surface in the relatively short period of months to a few years.\\r\\nControlling the location of impact for spent lunar orbiters can have scientific value. For example, in 1999 the NASA Lunar Prospector orbiter was deliberately targeted to impact a permanently shadowed area of Shoemaker Crater near the lunar south pole. It was hoped that energy from the impact would vaporize suspected shadowed ice deposits in the crater and liberate a water vapor plume that would be detectable from Earth. No such plume was observed. However, a small vial of ashes from the body of pioneer lunar scientist Eugene Shoemaker was delivered by the Lunar Prospector to the crater named in his honor ÿ currently the only human remains on the Moon.\\r\\nLuna 10 became the first spacecraft to orbit the Moon on 3 April 1966.\\r\\nIt is possible to aim a spacecraft from Earth so that it will loop around the Moon and return to Earth without entering lunar orbit, following the so-called free return trajectory. Such circumlunar loop missions are simpler than lunar orbit missions because rockets for lunar orbit braking and Earth return are not required. However, a manned circumlunar loop trip poses significant challenges above and beyond those found in a manned low-Earth-orbit mission, offering valuable lessons in preparation for a manned Moon landing. Foremost among these are mastering the demands of re-entering the Earth's atmosphere upon returning from the Moon.\\r\\nManned Earth-orbiting vehicles such as the Space Shuttle return to Earth from speeds of around 17,000 miles per hour (27,000?km/h; 7,600?m/s). Due to the effects of gravity, a vehicle returning from the Moon hits Earth's atmosphere at a much higher speed of around 25,000 miles per hour (40,000?km/h; 11,000?m/s). The g-loading on astronauts during the resulting deceleration can be at the limits of human endurance even during a nominal reentry. Slight variations in the vehicle flight path and reentry angle during a return from the Moon can easily result in fatal levels of deceleration force.\\r\\nAchieving a manned circumlunar loop flight prior to a manned lunar landing became a primary goal of the Soviets with their Zond spacecraft program. The first three Zonds were unmanned planetary probes; after that, the Zond name was transferred to a completely separate manned program. The initial focus of these later Zonds was extensive testing of required high-speed reentry techniques. This focus was not shared by the U.S., who chose instead to bypass the stepping stone of a manned circumlunar loop mission and never developed a separate spacecraft for this purpose.\\r\\nInitial manned spaceflights in the early 1960s placed a single person in low Earth orbit during the Soviet Vostok and U.S. Mercury programs. A two-flight extension of the Vostok program known as Voskhod effectively used Vostok capsules with their ejection seats removed to achieve Soviet space firsts of multiple person crews in 1964 and spacewalks in early 1965. These capabilities were later demonstrated by the U.S. in ten Gemini low Earth orbit missions throughout 1965 and 1966, using a totally new second-generation spacecraft design that had little in common with the earlier Mercury. These Gemini missions went on to prove critical techniques for orbital rendezvous and docking that were crucial to a manned lunar landing mission profile.\\r\\nAfter the end of the Gemini program, the Soviets Union began flying their second-generation Zond manned spacecraft in 1967 with the ultimate goal of looping a cosmonaut around the Moon and returning him immediately to Earth. The Zond spacecraft was launched with the simpler and already operational Proton launch rocket, unlike the parallel Soviet manned Moon landing effort also underway at the time based on third-generation Soyuz spacecraft requiring development of the advanced N-1 booster. The Soviets thus believed they could achieve a manned Zond circumlunar flight years before a U.S. manned lunar landing and so score a propaganda victory. However, significant development problems delayed the Zond program and the success of the U.S. Apollo lunar landing program led to the eventual termination of the Zond effort.\\r\\nLike Zond, Apollo Moon flights were generally launched on a free return trajectory that would return them to Earth via a circumlunar loop in the event that a Service Module malfunction failed to place them in lunar orbit as planned. This option was implemented after an explosion aboard the Apollo 13 mission in 1970, which is the only manned circumlunar loop mission flown to date.\\r\\nZond 5 was the first spacecraft to carry life from Earth to the vicinity of the Moon and return, initiating the final lap of the Space Race with its payload of turtles, insects, plants and bacteria. Despite the failure suffered in its final moments, the Zond 6 mission was reported by Soviet media as being a success as well. Although hailed worldwide as remarkable achievements, both of these Zond missions flew off-nominal reentry trajectories resulting in deceleration forces that would have been fatal to human crewmembers had they been aboard.\\r\\nAs a result, the Soviets secretly planned to continue unmanned Zond tests until their reliability to support manned flight had been demonstrated. However, due to NASA's continuing problems with the lunar module, and because of CIA reports of a potential Soviet manned circumlunar flight in late 1968, NASA fatefully changed the flight plan of Apollo 8 from an Earth-orbit lunar module test to a lunar orbit mission scheduled for late December 1968.\\r\\nIn early December 1968 the launch window to the Moon opened for the Soviet launch site in Baikonur, giving the USSR their final chance to beat the US to the Moon. Cosmonauts went on alert and asked to fly the Zond spacecraft then in final countdown at Baikonur on the first manned trip to the Moon. Ultimately, however, the Soviet Politburo decided the risk of crew death was unacceptable given the combined poor performance to that point of Zond/Proton and so scrubbed the launch of a manned Soviet lunar mission. Their decision proved to be a wise one, since this unnumbered Zond mission was destroyed in another unmanned test when it was finally launched several weeks later.\\r\\nBy this time flights of the third generation U.S. Apollo spacecraft had begun. Far more capable than the Zond, the Apollo spacecraft had the necessary rocket power to slip into and out of lunar orbit and to make course adjustments required for a safe reentry during the return to Earth. The Apollo 8 mission carried out the first manned trip to the Moon on 24 December 1968, certifying the Saturn V booster for manned use and flying not a circumlunar loop but instead a full ten orbits around the Moon before returning safely to Earth. Apollo 10 then performed a full dress rehearsal of a manned Moon landing in May 1969. This mission orbited within 47,400 feet (14.4?km) altitude above the lunar surface, performing necessary low-altitude mapping of trajectory-altering mascons using a factory prototype lunar module that was too overweight to allow a successful landing. With the failure of the unmanned Soviet sample return Moon landing attempt Luna 15 in July 1969, the stage was set for Apollo 11.\\r\\nPlans for manned Moon exploration originated during the Eisenhower administration. In a series of mid-1950s articles in Collier's magazine, Wernher von Braun had popularized the idea of a manned expedition to the Moon to establish a lunar base. A manned Moon landing posed several daunting technical challenges to the US and USSR. Besides guidance and weight management, atmospheric re-entry without ablative overheating was a major hurdle. After the Soviet Union's launch of Sputnik, von Braun promoted a plan for the United States Army to establish a military lunar outpost by 1965.\\r\\nAfter the early Soviet successes, especially Yuri Gagarin's flight, US President John F. Kennedy looked for a US project that would capture the public imagination. He asked Vice President Lyndon Johnson to make recommendations on a scientific endeavor that would prove US world leadership. The proposals included non-space options such as massive irrigation projects to benefit the Third World. The Soviets, at the time, had more powerful rockets than the United States, which gave them an advantage in some kinds of space mission.\\r\\nAdvances in US nuclear weapon technology had led to smaller, lighter warheads, and consequently, rockets with smaller payload capacities. By comparison, Soviet nuclear weapons were much heavier, and the powerful R-7 rocket was developed to carry them. More modest potential missions such as flying around the Moon without landing or establishing a space lab in orbit (both were proposed by Kennedy to von Braun) were determined to offer too much advantage to the Soviets, since the US would have to develop a heavy rocket to match the Soviets. A Moon landing, however, would capture world imagination while functioning as propaganda.\\r\\nJohnson had championed the US manned space program ever since the Sputnik scare, sponsoring the legislation which created NASA when he was in the Senate in 1958. When Kennedy asked him in 1961 to research the best manned space achievement to counter the Soviets' lead, Johnson responded that the US had an even chance of beating the USSR to a manned lunar landing, but not for anything less. Kennedy seized on Apollo as the ideal focus for efforts in space. He ensured continuing funding, shielding space spending from the 1963 tax cut, but diverting money from other NASA scientific projects. This last dismayed NASA's leader, James E. Webb, who perceived the need for NASA's support from the scientific community.\\r\\nThe Moon landing required development of the large Saturn V launch vehicle, which achieved a perfect record of zero catastrophic failures or launch vehicle-caused mission failures, in thirteen launches.\\r\\nFor the program to succeed, its proponents would have to defeat criticism from politicians on the left, who wanted more money spent on social programs, and on those on the right, who favored a more military project. By emphasizing the scientific payoff and playing on fears of Soviet space dominance, Kennedy and Johnson managed to swing public opinion: by 1965, 58 percent of Americans favored Apollo, up from 33 percent two years earlier. After Johnson became President in 1963, his continuing defense of the program allowed it to succeed in 1969, as Kennedy planned.\\r\\nSoviet leader Nikita Khrushchev said in October 1963 that the USSR was \\"not at present planning flight by cosmonauts to the Moon,\\" while insisting that the Soviets had not dropped out of the race. Only after another year would the USSR fully commit itself to a Moon-landing attempt, which ultimately failed.\\r\\nAt the same time, Kennedy had suggested various joint programs, including a possible Moon landing by Soviet and U.S. astronauts and the development of better weather-monitoring satellites. Khrushchev, sensing an attempt by Kennedy to steal Russian space technology, rejected the idea: if the USSR went to the Moon, it would go alone. Sergey Korolev, the Soviet space program's chief designer, had started promoting his Soyuz craft and the N1 launcher rocket that would have the capability of carrying out a manned Moon landing.\\r\\nKhrushchev directed Korolev's design bureau to arrange further space firsts by modifying the existing Vostok technology, while a second team started building a completely new launcher and craft, the Proton booster and the Zond, for a manned cislunar flight in 1966. In 1964 the new Soviet leadership gave Korolev the backing for a Moon landing effort and brought all manned projects under his direction.\\r\\nWith Korolev's death and the failure of the first Soyuz flight in 1967, the co-ordination of the Soviet Moon landing program quickly unraveled. The Soviets built a landing craft and selected cosmonauts for the mission that would have placed Aleksei Leonov on the Moon's surface, but with the successive launch failures of the N1 booster in 1969, plans for a manned landing suffered first delay and then cancellation.\\r\\nIn total, twenty-four U.S. astronauts have traveled to the Moon. Three have made the trip twice, and twelve have walked on its surface. Apollo 8 was a lunar-orbit-only mission, Apollo 10 included undocking and Descent Orbit Insertion (DOI), followed by LM staging to CSM redocking, while Apollo 13, originally scheduled as a landing, ended up as a lunar fly-by, by means of free return trajectory; thus, none of these missions made landings. Apollo 7 and Apollo 9 were Earth-orbit-only missions. Apart from the inherent dangers of manned Moon expeditions as seen with Apollo 13, one reason for their cessation according to astronaut Alan Bean is the cost it imposes in government subsidies.[23]\\r\\nUnlike other international rivalries, the Space Race has remained unaffected in a direct way regarding the desire for territorial expansion. After the successful landings on the Moon, the U.S. explicitly disclaimed the right to ownership of any part of the Moon.\\r\\nPresident Richard Nixon had speechwriter William Safire prepare a condolence speech for delivery in the event that Armstrong and Aldrin became marooned on the Moon's surface and could not be rescued.[24]\\r\\nIn 1951, science fiction writer Arthur C. Clarke forecast that man would reach the Moon by 1978.[25]\\r\\nOn 16 August 2006, the Associated Press reported that NASA is missing the original Slow-scan television tapes (which were made before the scan conversion for conventional TV) of the Apollo 11 Moon walk. Some news outlets have mistakenly reported that the SSTV tapes were found in Western Australia, but those tapes were only recordings of data from the Apollo 11 Early Apollo Surface Experiments Package.[26]\\r\\nScientists believe the six American flags planted by astronauts have been bleached white because of more than 40 years of exposure to solar radiation.[27] Using LROC images, five of the six American flags are still standing and casting shadows at all of the sites, except Apollo 11.[28] Astronaut Buzz Aldrin reported that the flag was blown over by the exhaust from the ascent engine during liftoff of Apollo 11.[28]\\r\\nLaunched on 24 January 1990, 11:46 UTC. At the end of its mission, the Japanese lunar orbiter Hiten was commanded to crash into the lunar surface and did so on 10 April 1993 at 18:03:25.7 UT (11 April 03:03:25.7 JST).[29]\\r\\nLunar Prospector was launched on 7 January 1998. The mission ended on 31 July 1999, when the orbiter was deliberately crashed into a crater near the lunar south pole after the presence of water ice was successfully detected.[30]\\r\\nLaunched 27 September 2003, 23:14 UTC from the Guiana Space Centre in Kourou, French Guiana. At the end of its mission, the ESA lunar orbiter SMART-1 performed a controlled crash into the Moon, at about 2?km/s. The time of the crash was 3 September 2006, at 5:42 UTC.[31]\\r\\nSELENE or Kaguya was launched on 14 September 2007. After successfully orbiting the Moon for a year and eight months, the main orbiter was instructed to impact on the lunar surface near the crater Gill at 18:25 UTC on 10 June 2009.[32]\\r\\nThe Chinese lunar orbiter Chang'e 1, launched 24 October 2007, 10:05 UTC, executed a controlled crash onto the surface of the Moon on 1 March 2009, 20:44 GMT, after a 16-month mission.[33]\\r\\nChandrayaan-1 was launched on 22 October 2008, 00:52 UTC. The impactor, the Moon Impact Probe, impacted near Shackleton Crater at the south pole of the lunar surface at 14 November 2008, 20:31 IST.[34] Chandrayaan-2 is scheduled for launch in 2018.\\r\\nThe LCROSS data collecting shepherding spacecraft was launched together with the Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter (LRO) on 18 June 2009 on board an Atlas V rocket with a Centaur upper stage. On 9 October 2009, at 11:31 UTC, the Centaur upper stage impacted the lunar surface, releasing the kinetic energy equivalent of detonating approximately 2 tons of TNT (8.86 GJ).[35] Six minutes later at 11:37 UTC, the LCROSS shepherding spacecraft also impacted the surface.[36]\\r\\nThe GRAIL mission consisted of two small spacecraft: GRAIL A (Ebb), and GRAIL B (Flow). They were launched on 10 September 2011 on board a Delta II rocket. GRAIL A separated from the rocket about nine minutes after launch, and GRAIL B followed about eight minutes later.[37][38] The first probe entered orbit on 31 December 2011 and the second followed on 1 January 2012.[39] The two spacecraft impacted the Lunar surface on 17 December 2012.[40]\\r\\nLADEE was launched on 7 September 2013.[41] The mission ended on 18 April 2014, when the spacecraft's controllers intentionally crashed LADEE into the far side of the Moon,[42][43] which, later, was determined to be near the eastern rim of Sundman V crater.[44][45]\\r\\nOn 14 December 2013 at 13:12 UTC[46] Chang'e 3 soft-landed a rover on the Moon. This was the first lunar soft landing since Luna 24 on 22 August 1976.[47]\\r\\nProgress in space exploration has recently broadened the phrase moon landing to include other moons in the Solar System as well. The Huygens probe of the CassiniÿHuygens mission to Saturn performed a successful unmanned moon landing on Titan in 2005. Similarly, the Soviet probe Phobos 2 came within 120?mi (190?km) of performing an unmanned moon landing on Mars' moon Phobos in 1989 before radio contact with that lander was suddenly lost. A similar Russian sample return mission called Fobos-Grunt (\\"grunt\\" means \\"soil\\" in Russian) launched in November 2011, but stalled in low Earth orbit. There is widespread interest in performing a future moon landing on Jupiter's Europa moon to drill down and explore the possible liquid water ocean beneath its icy surface.\\r\\nChina is planning to land another rover and collect samples in the Chang'e 4 mission and return lunar soil samples by 2018 in the Chang'e 5 mission.[48]\\r\\nISRO, the Indian National Space agency, is planning a second version of Chandrayaan named Chandrayaan 2. According to former ISRO Chairman G. Madhavan Nair, \\"The Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) hopes to land two rovers ÿ one Indian and another Russian ÿ on the Moon in 2018, as a part of its second Chandrayaan mission. The rover will be designed to move on wheels on the lunar surface, pick up samples of soil or rocks, do on-site chemical analysis and send the data to the mother-spacecraft Chandrayaan II, which will be orbiting above. Chandrayaan II will transmit the data to Earth.\\" The payloads have already been finalized.[49][50] ISRO has mentioned that due to weight restrictions it will not be carrying any overseas payloads on this mission. The lander weight is projected to be 1,250?kg, and the spacecraft will be launched by the Geosynchronous Satellite Launch Vehicle.\\r\\nRussia's Luna-Glob 1 is expected to be launched in 2018.[51] In 2007 the head of the Russian Space Agency announced plans to send cosmonauts to the Moon by 2025 and establish a permanent robotically operated base there in 2027ÿ2032.[52] In 2015, Roscosmos stated that Russia plans to place a cosmonaut on the Moon by 2030, leaving Mars to NASA. The purpose is to work jointly with NASA and avoid another Space Race.[53]\\r\\nThe Lunar Precursor Robotic Program (LPRP) is a program of robotic spacecraft missions which NASA will use to prepare for future Moon landings.[54] Three orbiters have been launched in the program, the Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter (LRO), the Lunar Crater Observation and Sensing Satellite (LCROSS), and the Lunar Atmosphere and Dust Environment Explorer (LADEE), launched in 2013, but no Moon landings are scheduled yet.\\r\\nThe Google Lunar X Prize competition offers a $20?million award for the first privately funded team to land a robotic probe on the Moon. Like the Ansari X Prize before it, the competition aims to advance the state of the art in private space exploration.[55] Of the several competing teams, Puli Space Technologies at one time (2012) planned to launch in 2014[56][needs update] and Astrobotic Technology plans to launch in the second half of 2016 with their own rover plus another team's lunar rovers from Hakuto.[57][58]\\r\\nIn 2019, a consortium of Vodafone, Audi and PT Scientists are planning a moon landing. The mission is to launch a lander and two small rovers to the moon from Cape Canaveral, Florida on a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket during the 50th-anniversary year of NASA's Apollo 11 moon landing.[59] Nokia will assist to setup a LTE network in moon to manage lunar terrestrial communication system of the mission.[60]\\r\\nMany conspiracy theorists hold that the Apollo Moon landings were a hoax;[61] however, empirical evidence is readily available to show that manned moon landings did indeed occur. Anyone on Earth with an appropriate laser and telescope system can bounce laser beams off three retroreflector arrays left on the Moon by Apollo 11,[62] 14 and 15, verifying deployment of the Lunar Laser Ranging Experiment at historically documented Apollo Moon landing sites and so proving equipment constructed on Earth was successfully transported to the surface of the Moon. In addition, in August 2009 NASA's Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter began to send back high resolution photos of the Apollo landing sites. These photos show not only the large Descent Stages of the lunar landers left behind but also tracks of the astronauts' walking paths in the lunar dust.[63]","input":"When did the last manned moon landing occur?"},{"output":"the 1980s","context":"The social model of disability is a reaction to the dominant medical model of disability which in itself is a functional analysis of the body as machine to be fixed in order to conform with normative values.[1] The social model of disability identifies systemic barriers, negative attitudes and exclusion by society (purposely or inadvertently) that mean society is the main contributory factor in disabling people. While physical, sensory, intellectual, or psychological variations may cause individual functional limitation or impairments, these do not have to lead to disability unless society fails to take account of and include people regardless of their individual differences. The origins of the approach can be traced to the 1960s; the specific term emerged from the United Kingdom in the 1980s.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1975, the UK organization Union of the Physically Impaired Against Segregation (UPIAS) claimed: \\"In our view it is society which disables physically impaired people. Disability is something imposed on top of our impairments by the way we are unnecessarily isolated and excluded from full participation in society.\\"[2][3]\\r\\nIn 1983, the disabled academic Mike Oliver coined the phrase \\"social model of disability\\" in reference to these ideological developments.[4] Oliver focused on the idea of an individual model (of which the medical was a part) versus a social model, derived from the distinction originally made between impairment and disability by the UPIAS.[5]\\r\\nThe \\"social model\\" was extended and developed by academics and activists in Australia, the UK, US and other countries, and extended to include all disabled people, including those who have learning difficulties / learning disabilities / or who are mentally handicapped, or people with emotional, mental health or behavioural problems.[6][7]\\r\\nOliver did not intend the \\"social model of disability\\" to be an all encompassing theory of disability, rather a starting point in reframing how society views disability.[8]\\r\\nA fundamental aspect of the social model concerns equality. The struggle for equality is often compared to the struggles of other socially marginalized groups. Equal rights are said to give empowerment and the \\"ability\\" to make decisions and the opportunity to live life to the fullest. A related phrase often used by disability rights campaigners, as with other social activism, is \\"Nothing About Us Without Us.\\"[9]\\r\\nThe social model of disability focuses on changes required in society. These might be in terms of:\\r\\nThe social model of disability implies that attempts to change, \\"fix\\" or \\"cure\\" individuals, especially when used against the wishes of the patient, can be discriminatory and prejudiced. This attitude, which may be seen as stemming from a medical model and a subjective value system, can harm the self-esteem and social inclusion of those constantly subjected to it (e.g. being told they are not as good or valuable, in an overall and core sense, as others). Some communities have actively resisted \\"treatments\\", while, for example, defending a unique culture or set of abilities. In the deaf community, sign language is valued even if most people do not know it and some parents argue against cochlear implants for deaf infants who cannot consent to them.[11] People diagnosed as being on the autism spectrum may argue against efforts to change them to be more like others. They argue instead for acceptance of neurodiversity and accommodation to different needs and goals.[12] Some people diagnosed with a mental disorder argue that they are just different and don't necessarily conform. The biopsychosocial model of disease/disability is a holistic attempt by practitioners to address this.[13]\\r\\nThe social model implies that practices such as eugenics are founded on social values and a prejudiced understanding of the potential and value of those labeled disabled. \\"Over 200,000 disabled people were the first victims of the Holocaust.\\"[14]\\r\\nA 1986 article stated: \\"It is important that we do not allow ourselves to be dismissed as if we all come under this one great metaphysical category 'the disabled'. The effect of this is a depersonalization, a sweeping dismissal of our individuality, and a denial of our right to be seen as people with our own uniqueness, rather than as the anonymous constituents of a category or group. These words that lump us all together -'the disabled', 'spina bifida', 'tetraplegic', 'muscular dystrophy, - are nothing more than terminological rubbish bins into which all the important things about us as people get thrown away.\\"[15]\\r\\nThe social model of disability is based on a distinction between the terms \\"impairment\\" and \\"disability.\\" Impairment is used to refer to the actual attributes (or lack of attributes), the abnormality, of a person, whether in terms of limbs, organs or mechanisms, including psychological. Disability is used to refer to the restrictions caused by society when it does not give equivalent attention and accommodation to the needs of individuals with impairments.[16]\\r\\nThe social model also relates to economics. It proposes that people can be disabled by a lack of resources to meet their needs. It addresses issues such as the under-estimation of the potential of people to contribute to society and add economic value to society, if given equal rights and equally suitable facilities and opportunities as others. Economic research on companies that attempt to accommodate disability in their workforce suggest they outperform competitors.[17]\\r\\nIn Autumn 2001, the UK Office for National Statistics identified that approximately one fifth of the working age population was disabled - 7.1 million disabled people as opposed to 29.8 million able people - and in this analysis also provided insight into some of the reasons why disabled people were unwilling to enter the labour market, such as that the reduction in disability benefits in entering the labour market would not make it worthwhile to enter into employment. A three-pronged approach was suggested: \\"incentives to work via the tax and benefit system, for example through the Disabled Persons Tax Credit; helping people back into work, for example via the New Deal for Disabled People; and tackling discrimination in the workplace via anti-discrimination policy. Underpinning this are the Disability Discrimination Act (DDA) 1995 and the Disability Rights Commission.\\"[18]\\r\\nIn the United Kingdom, the Disability Discrimination Act defines disability using the medical model - disabled people are defined as people with certain conditions, or certain limitations on their ability to carry out \\"normal day-to-day activities.\\" But the requirement of employers and service providers to make \\"reasonable adjustments\\" to their policies or practices, or physical aspects of their premises, follows the social model.[19] By making adjustments, employers and service providers are removing the barriers that disable - according to the social model, they are effectively removing the person's disability. In 2006, amendments to the act called for local authorities and others to actively promote disability equality. This enforcement came in the shape of the Disability Equality Duty in December 2006.[20] In 2010, The Disability Discrimination Act (1995) was amalgamated into the Equality Act 2010 along with other pertinent discrimination legislation. It extends the law on discrimination to indirect discrimination. For example, if a carer of a person with a disability is discriminated against, this is now also unlawful.[21] Since October 2010, when it came into effect, employers may not legally ask questions about illness or disability at interview for a job or for a referee to comment on such in a reference, except where there is a need to make reasonable adjustments for an interview to proceed. Following an offer of a job, an employer can lawfully ask such questions.[22]\\r\\nIn the United States, the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (ADA), revision of 2008 effective in January 2009, is a wide-ranging civil rights law that prohibits discrimination based on disability.[23] It affords similar protections against discrimination to Americans with disabilities as the Civil Rights Act of 1964, which made discrimination based on race, religion, sex, national origin, and other characteristics illegal. Certain specific conditions are excluded, such as alcoholism and transsexualism.\\r\\nIn 2007, the European Court of Justice in the Chacon Navas v Eurest Colectividades SA court case, defined disability narrowly according to a medical definition that excluded temporary illness, when considering the Directive establishing a general framework for equal treatment in employment and occupation (Council Directive 2000/78/EC). The directive did not provide for any definition of disability, despite discourse in policy documents previously in the EU about endorsing the social model of disability. This allowed the Court of Justice to take a narrow medical definition.[citation needed]","input":"When was the social model of disability developed?"},{"output":"Traveler","context":"Traveler is a horse who is the mascot of the University of Southern California. Traveler appears at all USC home football games in the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum as well as many other outdoor events, including numerous Rose Parades. The current horse is Traveler IX. Although the Traveler web site describes Traveler as \\"pure white,\\" most of the horses who have served as Traveler are actually gray horses whose hair coats have become completely white. (Truly white horses are quite uncommon.) The rider, dressed as an idealized Trojan warrior, is often mistaken for Tommy Trojan, the Trojan portrayed in USC's famous Trojan Shrine statue; however, the rider is unnamed and simply designated as a Trojan warrior with the horse as the official mascot. On November 6, 2013, the costumed version of Tommy and Traveler were introduced for men's and women's basketball games.[1]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nUntil it was renovated in the 1990s, the Coliseum included an Olympic running track going around the football field. This proved to be useful for Traveler, who would gallop around the track after every USC score and pump up the crowd. Once the track was removed, Traveler still made its way around the field but had to move cautiously to avoid people on the sidelines. The horse had a minor collision with a person in 2000, and afterwards had human spotters running in front to clear a path.\\r\\nBefore Traveler, USC used another mascot, a series of canines known as George Tirebiter. There had also been several previous, unofficial horse mascots making appearances on USC sidelines since 1927, but none were permanent. The idea for the current mascot began during the 1961 Rose Parade, when a USC events director spotted Richard Saukko and his white horse, Traveler, marching in the parade. The university persuaded Saukko to ride his horse during USC football games.\\r\\nTraveler was introduced in the autumn of 1961, during the USC Trojans football team's home opener at the Coliseum, against the Georgia Tech Yellow Jackets. To dress Saukko as a Trojan warrior, USC used its connections to the film industry to procure the costume worn by Charlton Heston in Ben Hur two years earlier. The costume proved to be too heavy for extended use, so Saukko made his own leather uniform for the 1962 season and the same costume has been used since. The name was believed to have been inspired by the gray horse Traveller, ridden by Civil War Confederate general Robert E. Lee,[2] In August 2017 concerns that the horse's name had a connection to Lee led to further research, which revealed that the first Traveler was acquired with his name, spelled with one L, in 1958 after he had become unreliable as a movie horse.Cl[3] On Equinespot.com, Traveler is listed as one of the six most common horse names to begin with the letter T. [4]\\r\\nAfter Saukko retired from riding the horse in 1988, his family continued to provide the successive horses acting as Traveler until 2002. All of Saukko's successors as rider have been USC alumni, including Cass Dabbs, Rick Oas, Tom Nolan, Ardeshir Radpour, Brent Dahlgren, and current riders Chuck O'Donnell and Hector Aguilar.\\r\\nSeveral horses have been \\"Traveler\\" over the years, of breeds ranging from Tennessee Walking horses, to Arabian horses and some crossbred animals. The current mascot, Traveler IX, is a purebred Andalusian horse, owned by Joanne Asman. An eighth Traveler was in training, but according to a post on the Spirit of Troy Facebook account, Traveler 8 died on or about October 8, 2013. \\"It is with Sadness that I let you all know that Traveler number 8 who many of you did not have the opportunity to meet passed away. He was only 14 years old. For those who had the opportunity to see this bold, arched neck, beautiful creature run on the field for some of the games last year, he will be missed. Most of the fans did not realize when we switched Traveler 7 & Traveler 8 out, but for those who did know, he will be missed. Traveler 7 continues forward for his 11th year as Traveler.\\" Traveler VII was retired as the mascot following the 2017 Rose Bowl Game, with Traveler IX being introduced at the first USC home game of the 2017 season against Western Michigan.","input":"What's the name of the usc horse?"},{"output":"local law enforcement","context":"\\r\\nA sex offender registry is a system in various countries designed to allow government authorities to keep track of the activities of sex offenders including those who have completed their criminal sentences. In some jurisdictions, where sex offender registration can, registration is accompanied by residential address notification requirements. In many jurisdictions, registered sex offenders are subject to additional restrictions, including on housing. Those on parole or probation may be subject to restrictions that do not apply to other parolees or probationers. Sometimes, these include (or have been proposed to include) restrictions on being in the presence of underage persons (under the age of majority), living in proximity to a school or day care center, owning toys or items targeted towards children, or using the Internet. Sex offender registries exist in many English-speaking countries, including Australia, Canada, New Zealand, the United States, Trinidad and Tobago, Jamaica, South Africa, the United Kingdom, Israel and the Republic of Ireland. The United States is the only country with a registry that is publicly accessible; all other countries in the English-speaking world have sex offender registries only accessible by law enforcement.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn offense-based systems, registration is required when a person is convicted under one of the listed offenses requiring registration.  In the US Federal system, persons registered are put into a tier program based on their offense of conviction.  Risk based systems have been proposed but not implemented as of print.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the United States, the vast majority of the states are applying offense-based registries, leaving the actual risk level of the offender and severity of the offense uncertain. The few U.S. states applying risk-based systems are pressured by the U.S. federal government to adopt offense-based systems in accordance with Adam Walsh Child Protection and Safety Act. Studies have shown that actuarial risk assessment instruments consistently outperform the offense-based system mandated by federal law.[1] Consequently, the effectiveness of offense-based registries have been questioned by professionals, and evidence exists suggesting that such registries are counterproductive.\\r\\n\\r\\nSome aspects of the current sex offender registries in the United States have been widely criticized by civil rights organizations Human Rights Watch[2][3] and the ACLU,[4] professional organizations Association for the Treatment of Sexual Abusers[5][6] and Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers,[7] reformist groups Reform Sex Offender Laws, Inc.,[8] Women Against Registry[9] and  USA FAIR,[10] and by child safety advocate Patty Wetterling, the Chair of National Center for Missing & Exploited Children.[11][12][13][14][15][16] Virtually no studies exist finding U.S. registries effective, prompting some researchers to call them pointless, many even calling them counterproductive, arguing that they increase the rate of re-offense.[17]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Australian National Child Offender Register (ANCOR) is a web-based system used in all jurisdictions. Authorized police use ANCOR to monitor persons convicted of child sex offences and other specified offences once they have served their sentence. Offenders are monitored for eight years, 15 years or the remainder of their life (four years or 7? years for juvenile offenders). On 1 March 2011, there were 12,596 registered offenders across Australia.\\r\\n\\r\\nCanada's National Sex Offender Registry (NSOR) came into force on 15 December 2004, with the passing of the Sex Offender Information Registration Act (SOIR Act).[18] The public does not have access to the registry.\\r\\n\\r\\nSince 2001, the Province of Ontario operates its own sex offender registry concurrently with the federal registry.  Unlike the federal registry which has an opt-out provision if an offender can convince a judge they are not a threat, the Ontario registry has no such provision.  As a result, individuals who have been convicted of a designated offence at any time after 2001, and relocate to Ontario, are obligated to register for a period of at least 10 years.  The registration period begins on the day the ex-offender relocates to Ontario.[19]\\r\\n\\r\\nUnder the 2001 Sexual Offenders Act, all those convicted of certain sexual offenses are obliged to notify the police within 7 days their name and address. They must also notify the police of any changes to this information or if they intend to stay somewhere other than their registered address for more than 7 days (including if they are traveling abroad). Individuals are subject to these registration requirements for varying durations, based on a sliding scale of the severity of the sentence they received. This scale is as follows:\\r\\n\\r\\nThe New Zealand government has plans to introduce a sex offenders register by the end of 2014. It will be managed by the New Zealand Police and information will be shared between the Police, Child, Youth and Family,  the Department of Corrections, the Ministry of Social Development, and the Department of Building and Housinggovernment agencies which deal with child safety. Like the Australian and British registers, the New Zealand sex offenders register will not be accessible to the general public but only to officials with security clearance.  It will also include individuals who have been granted name suppression. This proposed register has received support from both the ruling National Party and the opposition Labour Party. However political lobby group the Sensible Sentencing Trust has criticised the proposed register for its lack of public access.[20][21][22]\\r\\n\\r\\nOn 4 August 2014, the New Zealand Cabinet formally approved the establishment of a sex offenders register.[23] According to the Minister of Police and Corrections Anne Tolley, Cabinet has agreed to allocate $35.5 million over the next ten years for the technology component of the register and initial ICT work is underway as of 14 August 2014. The sex offenders' register is expected to be operational by 2016 once enabling legislation is passed and changes are made to the Corrections Act to enable information sharing.[24]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe National Register for Sex Offenders was established in terms of the Criminal Law (Sexual Offences and Related Matters) Amendment Act, 2007. It records the details of anyone convicted of a sexual offence against a child or a mentally disabled person. The public does not have access to the registry; it is available to employers of people who work with children or mentally disabled people, to authorities responsible for licensing institutions that care for children or mentally disabled people, and to those responsible for approving foster care and adoptions. People listed on the register are prohibited from working with children or mentally disabled people, from managing institutions that care for children or mentally disabled people, and from being foster parents or adoptive parents.[25]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Sexual Offences Act Chapter 11:28 Part III provides for Notification Requirements for Sex Offenders. This Sex Offenders Registry is only accessible to the Police Service and other branches of government.  There are several gaps in this policy noted by members of the Caribbean Committee against Sex Crimes, most notably that the registry only deals with offenses committed within the Jurisdiction of Trinidad and Tobago. Persons who are registered Sex Offenders from other jurisdictions are not registered when they immigrate or are deported to Trinidad and Tobago.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the United Kingdom, the Violent and Sex Offender Register (ViSOR) is a database of records of those required to register with the Police under the Sexual Offences Act 2003, those jailed for more than 12 months for violent offences, and unconvicted people thought to be at risk of offending. The Register can be accessed by the Police, National Probation Service and HM Prison Service personnel. It is managed by the National Policing Improvement Agency of the Home Office.\\r\\n\\r\\nSex offender registries in the United States consist of federal and state level systems designed to collect information of convicted sex offenders for law  enforcement and public notification purposes. All 50 states and District of Columbia maintain registries that are open to public via sex offender registration websites, although some registered sex offenders are visible to law enforcement only. According to NCMEC, as of 2015 there were 843,260 registered sex offenders in the United States.[26] Registrants have to periodically appear in person to their local law enforcement for purposes of collecting their personal information, such as photograph, fingerprints, name, scars, tattoos, living address, place of employment and vehicle information.\\r\\n\\r\\nInformation pertaining to names, addresses, physical description and vehicles are made public via official websites. In addition, registrants are often subject to restrictions that bar loitering, working or living within exclusion zones that sometimes cover entire cities and have forced registrants into encampments, such as the Julia Tuttle Causeway sex offender colony.[27][28]\\r\\n\\r\\nAnthropology professor Roger Lancaster has called the restrictions \\"tantamount to practices of banishment\\" that he deems disproportional, noting that registries include not just the \\"worst of the worst\\", but also \\"adults who supplied pornography to teenage minors; young schoolteachers who foolishly fell in love with one of their students; men who urinated in public, or were caught having sex in remote areas of public parks after dark.\\" In many instances, individuals have pleaded guilty to an offense like urinating in public decades ago, not realizing the result would be their placement on a sex offender registry, and all of the restrictions that come with it.[29]\\r\\n\\r\\nDepending on jurisdiction, offenses requiring registration range in their severity from public urination or children and teenagers experimenting with their peers, to violent predatory sexual offenses. In some states non-sexual offenses such as unlawful imprisonment may require sex offender registration.[30] According to Human Rights Watch, children as young as 9 have been placed on the registry for sexually experimenting with their peers.[3][31] Juvenile convicts account for as much as 25 percent of the registrants.[32] Federal Adam Walsh Act pressured states to register juveniles by tying federal funding to the degree to which state registries comply with the federal laws classification system for sex offenders.[32]\\r\\n\\r\\nStates apply differing sets of criteria dictating which offenders are made visible to public. Some states scientifically evaluate the future risk of the offender and hide low-risk offenders from public. In other states, offenders are categorized according to the tier level related to statute of conviction. Duration of registration vary usually from 10 years to life depending on the state legislation and tier/risk category. Some states exclude low tier offenders from public registries while in others, all offenders are publicly listed.[33] Some states offer possibility to petition to be removed from the registry under certain circumstances.\\r\\n\\r\\nA majority of states apply systems based on conviction offenses only, where sex offender registration is mandatory if person pleads or is found guilty of violating any of the listed offenses. Under these systems, the sentencing judge does not sentence the convict into sex offender registry and cannot usually use judicial discretion to forgo registration requirement, even if s/he thinks the registration would be unreasonable, taking into account mitigating factors pertaining to individual cases. Instead, registration is a mandatory collateral consequence of criminal conviction.[34] Due to this feature, laws target a wide range of behaviors and tend to treat all offenders the same. Civil right groups,[3][4] law reform activists,[10][35][36] academics,[37][38] some child safety advocates,[11][12][13][14][15][39] politicians[40] and law enforcement officials[41] think that current laws often target the wrong people, swaying attention away from high-risk sex offenders, while severely impacting lives of all registrants,[42][43][44][45] and their families,[46][47] attempting to re-integrate to society.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Supreme Court of the United States has upheld sex offender registration laws twice, in two respects. Several challenges to some parts of state level sex offender laws have succeeded, however.\\r\\n\\r\\nSex offender registration has been applied to crimes other than rape, child molestation, and child pornography offenses and is sometimes applied to certain non-sexual offenses.[48]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn Connecticut, those with state convictions for certain misdemeanors have to register, including: Public Indecency, in violation of C.G.S.  53a-186, provided the court finds the victim was under 18; and Sexual Assault, 4th Degree, in violation of C.G.S.  53a-73a.[49]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn New York and various other states, crimes that society does not necessarily view as sexual in nature are also considered to be registerable sex offenses, such as kidnapping, \\"sexual misconduct\\", unlawful imprisonment, and in some cases \\"sexually motivated offenses\\" (such as assault, burglary, etc.) that are not categorized as sexual offenses unless the court determines that the offense was committed pursuant to the offender's own sexual gratification. In New York specifically, kidnapping and unlawful imprisonment are registerable offenses only if the victim is under 17 and the offender is not a parent of the victim.[50]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn Kentucky, all sex offenders who move into the state and are required to register in their previous home states are required to register with Kentucky for life, even if they were not required to register for life in their previous residence.[51]\\r\\n\\r\\nA few states have also created separate online registries for crimes other than sex offenses. Montana, for example, has a publicly accessible violent offender registry that includes crimes such as aggravated assault, robbery, assaulting a police officer, both deliberate and non-deliberate homicide and a third conviction for domestic violence. Kansas has publicly accessible registries of people convicted of both serious drug offenses and people convicted of crimes involving a weapon. Indiana, Illinois, Kansas, Oklahoma, and Montana all have publicly accessible registries for those convicted of murder. Florida requires all felons, regardless of the crime, to register with law enforcement for 5 years after release, although the Florida felon registry is not available to the general public. If a felon in Florida is convicted of enough non-sexual felonies in a certain period of time, however, they are required to register for the rest of their life on a \\"Habitual Offender\\" registry that is available to the general public. Ohio has a publicly accessible registry for people convicted five or more times of drunken driving.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 2014, a murder registry was proposed in Rhode Island and an animal abuser registry was proposed in Pennsylvania. A bill to create a publicly accessible registry for domestic violence offenders passed the Texas House of Representatives in 2013, but was not voted on in the Texas Senate.\\r\\n\\r\\nCurrently, only the United States allows, and more often than not requires public disclosure of offender information, regardless of individual risk. Other countries do not make sex offender information public, unless the risk assessment has been conducted and the offender has been determined to pose a high risk of re-offending.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn some localities in the United States, the lists of all sex offenders are made available to the public: for example, through the newspapers, community notification, or the Internet. However, in other localities, the complete lists are not available to the general public but are known to the police. In the United States offenders are often classified in three categories: Level (Tier) I,  Level II,  and Level III offenders, information is usually accessible related to that level (information being more accessible to the public for higher level offenders). In some US jurisdictions, the level of offender is reflecting the evaluated recidivism risk of the individual offender, while in others, the level is designated merely by the virtue of conviction, without assessing the risk level posed by the offender.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn general, in states applying risk-based registry schemes, low-risk (Tier I) offenders are often excluded from the public disclosure. In some states only the highest risk (Tier III) offenders are subject to public disclosure, while some states also include moderate-risk (Tier II) offenders in public websites.[33]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn SORNA compliant states, only Tier I registrants may be excluded from public disclosure, but since SORNA merely sets the minimum set of rules that states must follow, many SORNA compliant states have adopted stricter system and have opted to disclose information of all tiers. Some states have disclosed some of Tier I offenders,[52] while in some states all Tier I offenders are excluded from public disclosure.[33]\\r\\n\\r\\nJust like states differ with respect to disclosure of information regarding different Tiers/Levels, they also differ with respect to classifying offenses into tiers. Thus, identical offenses committed in different states could produce very different outcomes in terms of public disclosure and registration period. Offense classified as Tier I offense in one state with no public disclosure, might be classified as Tier II or Tier III offense in another, leading to considerably longer registration period and public disclosure. These disparities in state legislation have caused unexpected problems to some registrants when moving from state to another, finding themselves subject to public disclosure on their destination state's sex offender website, and longer registration periods (sometimes for life), even though they originally were excluded from public registry and required to register for a shorter period. Some states appear to apply \\"catch-all\\" statutes for former registrants moving into their jurisdiction, requiring registration and public posting of information, even when the person has completed their original registration period. At least one state (Illinois) reclassifies all registrants moving in the state into the highest possible tier (Sexual Predator), regardless of the original tier of the person, leading to a lifetime registration requirement and being publicly labelled as a \\"Sexual Predator\\".[53] As noted previously, Kentucky requires lifetime registration for all currently registered individuals who move into the state.\\r\\n\\r\\nDetermining the tier level and whether or not a person would be subject to public disclosure, when relocating to another state, can be close to impossible without consulting an attorney or officials responsible for managing registration in the destination state, due to constantly changing laws and vagueness in some states legislative language.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhile these disparities in level of public disclosure among different states might cause unexpected problems after registration, they have also caused some registrants to move into locations where public disclosure of lower level offenders is not permitted, in order to avoid public persecution and other adverse effects of public disclosure they were experiencing in their original location.[54]\\r\\n\\r\\nSex offenders on parole or probation are generally subject to the same restrictions as other parolees and probationers.\\r\\n\\r\\nSex offenders who have completed probation or parole may also be subject to restrictions above and beyond those of most felons. In some jurisdictions, they cannot live within a certain distance of places children or families gather. Such places are usually schools, worship centers, and parks, but could also include public venues (stadiums), airports, apartments, malls, major retail stores, college campuses, and certain neighborhoods (unless for essential business). In some states, they may also be barred from voting after a sentence has been completed and, at the federal level, barred from owning firearms, like all felons.\\r\\n\\r\\nSome states have Civic Confinement laws, which allow very-high-risk sex offenders to be placed in secure facilities, \\"in many ways like prisons\\", where they are supposed to be offered treatment and regularly reevaluated for possible release. In practice, most states with Civil Commitment centers rarely release anyone. Texas has not released anyone in the 15 years since the program was started.[55] In 2015, in response to a class action lawsuit, a Federal judge ruled Minnesota's Civil Commitment program to be unconstitutional, both for not providing effective treatment and for not fully releasing anyone since the program was started in 1994.[56]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe state of Missouri now restricts the activities of registered sex offenders on Halloween, requiring them to avoid Halloween-related contact with children and remain at their registered home address from 5 p.m. to 10:30?p.m., unless they are required to work that evening. Regardless of whether they are at work, offenders must extinguish all outside residential lighting and post a sign stating, \\"No candy or treats at this residence - sex offender at this residence\\".[57]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the United Kingdom, anyone convicted of any criminal offense cannot work in the legal, medical, teaching, or nursing professions.[citation needed] List 99 includes people convicted of sex offenses barred from working in education and social work, though it also includes people convicted of theft, fraud, corruption, assault, and drugs offenses.\\r\\n\\r\\nFacebook and Instagram prohibit any convicted sex offender from accessing or contributing to their websites.[58]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe vast majority of sexual offense victims are known to the offender -- including friends, family, or other trusted adults such as teachers. This is contrary to media depictions of stranger assaults or child molesters who kidnap children unknown to them.[59] Thus, despite the public awareness of the whereabouts of convicted sex offenders, there has been little evidence to back the claim that mandatory registration has made society safer. According to ATSA, only in the states that utilize empirically derived risk assessment procedures and publicly identify only high risk offenders, has community notification demonstrated some effectiveness.[38][60] The majority of U.S states do not utilize risk assessment tools when determining ones inclusion on the registry, although studies have shown that actuarial risk assessment instruments, which are created by putting together risk factors found by research to correlate with re-offending, consistently outperform the offense based systems.[61]\\r\\n\\r\\nStudies almost always show that residency restrictions increase offender's recidivism rates by increasing offender homelessness and increasing instability in a sex offender's life. According to a Department of Justice study, 5.3% of sex offenders who were released from prison in 1994 were arrested for a new sex offense after 3 years.[62] Robbers, arsonists and property crime committers (all of which have a recidivism rate of 60ÿ70 percent after 3 years) were the most likely to re-offend group. Despite the public perception of sex offenders as having high recidivism, sex offenders had the second lowest recidivism rate, after only murderers, but sex offenders were about four times more likely than non-sex offenders to be arrested for another sex crime after their discharge from prison.[63] A later study done by the Department of Justice showed an even lower sex offender recidivism rate of about 2.1 percent after 3 years. However, since sex crimes are the most under-reported crimes,[64] whether or not the Department of Justice's 5.3% sex offender recidivism rate is deceptively low is unclear. Recidivism rates only measure how many people return to prison or are arrested for a new offense and do not measure how many people actually commit a new criminal offense (some criminals commit new offenses after release from prison but do not get caught.) In the late 2000s, a study showed that Indiana sex offenders have recidivism of about 1.03% after 3 years.[65] Studies consistently show sex offender recidivism rates of 1ÿ4% after 3 years, recividism is usually at about 5ÿ10% after a long follow up (such as a 10ÿ25 year follow up).\\r\\n\\r\\nA study by professors from Columbia University and the University of Michigan found that having police-only sex offender registries (e.g., Britain, Canada, Australia) significantly reduces sex offender recidivism, but making information about sex offenders publicly available significantly increases recidivism rates.[66] This is because making sex offender information public increases offender stress and also makes the thought of returning to prison less threatening, as some sex offenders may feel returning to prison is not significantly worse than being on the public registry. Some sex offenders may come to view their central identity as being that of a sex offender due to the registry, and the more a sex offender views themselves as being a criminal the more likely they are to reoffend. However, the study also found that making sex offender registration publicly available may deter some potential first time sex offenders from committing an offense that would get them on the registry in the first place. The thought of getting on the sex offender registry may or may not deter non-sex offenders from committing sex crimes.\\r\\n\\r\\nA 2008 study found no evidence that New York's registry or notification laws reduced sexual offenses by rapists, child molesters, sexual recidivists, or first-time sex offenders.[67]\\r\\n\\r\\nA study by University of Chicago graduate student Amanda Agan compared sex offender recidivism rates in states where sex offenders were required to register in 1994 with states where they were not required to register in 1994. The results of the study were that sex offender recidivism was, in fact, slightly lower in states where sex offenders were not required to register. This made Agan question whether creating sex offender registries was a rational idea. The study also showed that blocks in Washington DC where sex offenders lived did not have higher molestation rates than blocks where sex offenders did not live.[68][tone]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn at least two instances, convicted sex offenders were murdered after their information was made available over the Internet.[69] The spouse, children and other family members of a sex offender often have negative consequences as a result of having a family member on the registry. For example, residency restrictions will make it harder for a sex offender's spouse and children, not just a sex offender themselves, to find housing. Residency restrictions may even cause a sex offender's family to be homeless. Sex offenders' spouses and children can also face harassment and financial hardship as a result of their loved one's sex offender status. More than half of the children of sex offenders say that fellow students treat them worse due to a parent's RSO status.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Human Rights Watch organization criticized these laws in a 146-page report published in 2007,[2] and in another report in 2013.[3]\\r\\n\\r\\nPeople who are registered in offender databases are usually required to notify the government when they change their place of residence.[citation needed] This notification requirement is problematic in cases where the registered offender is homeless.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe state of Washington is among those that have special provisions in their registration code covering homeless offenders, but not all states have such provisions. A November 2006 Maryland Court of Appeals ruling exempts homeless persons from that state's registration requirements, which has prompted a drive to compose new laws covering this contingency.\\r\\n\\r\\nNews reports in 2007 revealed that some registered sex offenders were living outside or under the Julia Tuttle Causeway in Miami, Florida because Miami-Dade County ordinances, which are more restrictive than Florida's state laws, made it virtually impossible for them to find housing.[70][71][72] The colony at the causeway grew to as many as 140 registrants living there as of July 2009, but eventually became a political embarrassment and was disbanded in April 2010, when the residents moved into acceptable housing in the area. However, many have lapsed back into homelessness, sleeping alongside railroad tracks.[73]\\r\\n\\r\\nAs of 2013 Suffolk County, New York, which had imposed onerous restrictions on sex offenders exceeding those required by New York state law, was faced with a situation where 40 sex offenders were living in two cramped trailers located in isolated locations.[74] This situation had been created by the county in 2007 as a solution to the problem of housing sex offenders.[75]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe question of how to appropriately deal with underage sex assault perpetrators has led to some of the most emotional appeals against sex offender registries.[according to whom?]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 2017, an Associated Press investigation found that for every adult-on-child offence, there are seven child-on-child sex offences. These crimes are rarely reported in the media or prosecuted.[76] However, in Human Rights Watch's 2013 investigation of strict[clarification needed] U.S. laws, it was found that child perpetrators as young as 11 have, at times, been forced to register on long-term publicly searchable databases. In some U.S. jurisdictions, consenting teenage couples in possession of each other's nude photographs have also been charged with possessing child pornography and forced to register as sex offenders under mandatory sentencing requirements.[77]","input":"Where do you register as a sex offender?"},{"output":"antipsychotic","context":"Chlorpromazine (CPZ), marketed under the trade names Thorazine and Largactil among others, is an antipsychotic medication.[2] It is primarily used to treat psychotic disorders such as schizophrenia.[2] Other uses include the treatment of bipolar disorder, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, nausea and vomiting, anxiety before surgery, and hiccups that do not improve following other measures.[2] It can be given by mouth, by injection into a muscle, or into a vein.[2]\\r\\nCommon side effects include movement problems, sleepiness, dry mouth, low blood pressure upon standing, and increased weight.[2] Serious side effects may include the potentially permanent movement disorder tardive dyskinesia, neuroleptic malignant syndrome, and low white blood cell levels.[2] In older people with psychosis as a result of dementia it may increase the risk of death.[2] It is unclear if it is safe for use in pregnancy.[2] Chlorpromazine is in the typical antipsychotic class.[2] Its mechanism of action is not entirely clear but believed to be related to its ability as a dopamine antagonist.[2] It also has anti-serotonergic and antihistaminergic properties.[2]\\r\\nChlorpromazine was discovered in 1950 and was the first antipsychotic.[3][4] It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines, the most effective and safe medicines needed in a health system.[5] Its introduction has been labeled as one of the great advances in the history of psychiatry.[6][7] It is available as a generic medication.[2] The wholesale cost in the developing world is between US$0.02 and US$0.12 per day.[8] In the United States it costs about US$2 per day.[2]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nChlorpromazine is classified as a low-potency typical antipsychotic and in the past was used in the treatment of both acute and chronic psychoses, including schizophrenia and the manic phase of bipolar disorder, as well as amphetamine-induced psychoses. Low-potency antipsychotics have more anticholinergic side effects, such as dry mouth, sedation, and constipation, and lower rates of extrapyramidal side effects, while high-potency antipsychotics (such as haloperidol) have the reverse profile.[9]\\r\\nIn a 2013 comparison of 15 antipsychotics in schizophrenia, chlorpromazine demonstrated mild-standard effectiveness. It was 13% more effective than lurasidone and iloperidone, approximately as effective as ziprasidone and asenapine, and 12-16% less effective than haloperidol, quetiapine, and aripiprazole.[10]\\r\\nChlorpromazine has also been used in porphyria and as part of tetanus treatment. It still is recommended for short-term management of severe anxiety and psychotic aggression. Resistant and severe hiccups, severe nausea/emesis, and preanesthetic conditioning are other uses.[9][11] Symptoms of delirium in medically-hospitalized AIDS patients have been effectively treated with low doses of chlorpromazine.[12]\\r\\nChlorpromazine is occasionally used off-label for treatment of severe migraine.[13][14] It is often, particularly as palliation, used in small doses to reduce nausea suffered by opioid-treated cancer patients and to intensify and prolong the analgesia of the opioids as well.[13][15]\\r\\nIn Germany, chlorpromazine still carries label indications for insomnia, severe pruritus, and preanesthesia.[16]\\r\\nThere appears to be a dose-dependent risk for seizures with chlorpromazine treatment.[18] Tardive dyskinesia and akathisia are less commonly seen with chlorpromazine than they are with high potency typical antipsychotics such as haloperidol[19] or trifluoperazine, and some evidence suggests that, with conservative dosing, the incidence of such effects for chlorpromazine may be comparable to that of newer agents such as risperidone or olanzapine.[20]\\r\\nChlorpromazine may deposit in ocular tissues when taken in high dosages for long periods of time.\\r\\nAbsolute contraindications include:[1]\\r\\nRelative contraindications include:[1]\\r\\nVery rarely, elongation of the QT interval may occur, increasing the risk of potentially fatal arrhythmias.[21]\\r\\nConsuming food prior to taking chlorpromazine orally limits its absorption, likewise cotreatment with benztropine can also reduce chlorpromazine absorption.[1] Alcohol can also reduce chlorpromazine absorption.[1] Antacids slow chlorpromazine absorption.[1] Lithium and chronic treatment with barbiturates can increase chlorpromazine clearance significantly.[1] Tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs) can decrease chlorpromazine clearance and hence increase chlorpromazine exposure.[1] Cotreatment with CYP1A2 inhibitors like ciprofloxacin, fluvoxamine or vemurafenib can reduce chlorpromazine clearance and hence increase exposure and potentially also adverse effects.[1] Chlorpromazine can also potentiate the CNS depressant effects of drugs like barbiturates, benzodiazepines, opioids, lithium and anesthetics and hence increase the potential for adverse effects such as respiratory depression and sedation.[1]\\r\\nIt is also a moderate inhibitor of CYP2D6 and also a substrate for CYP2D6 and hence can inhibit its own metabolism.[9] It can also inhibit the clearance of CYP2D6 substrates such as dextromethorphan and hence also potentiate their effects.[9] Other drugs like codeine and tamoxifen which require CYP2D6-mediated activation into their respective active metabolites may have their therapeutic effects attenuated.[9] Likewise CYP2D6 inhibitors such as paroxetine or fluoxetine can reduce chlorpromazine clearance and hence increase serum levels of chlorpromazine and hence potentially also its adverse effects.[1] Chlorpromazine also reduces phenytoin levels and increases valproic acid levels.[1] It also reduces propranolol clearance and antagonizes the therapeutic effects of antidiabetic agents, levodopa (a Parkinson's medication. This is likely due to the fact that chlorpromazine antagonizes the D2 receptor which is one of the receptors dopamine, a levodopa metabolite, activates), amphetamines and anticoagulants.[1] It may also interact with anticholinergic drugs such as orphenadrine to produce hypoglycaemia (low blood sugar).[1]\\r\\nChlorpromazine may also interact with epinephrine (adrenaline) to produce a paradoxical fall in blood pressure.[1] Monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs) and thiazide diuretics may also accentuate the orthostatic hypotension experienced by those receiving chlorpromazine treatment.[1] Quinidine may interact with chlorpromazine to increase myocardialdepression.[1] Likewise it may also antagonize the effects of clonidine and guanethidine.[1] It also may reduce the seizure threshold and hence a corresponding titration of anticonvulsant treatments should be considered.[1] Prochlorperazine and desferrioxamine may also interact with chlorpromazine to produce transient metabolic encephalopathy.[1]\\r\\nOther drugs that prolong the QT interval such as quinidine, verapamil, amiodarone, sotalol and methadone may also interact with chlorpromazine to produce additive QT interval prolongation.[1]\\r\\nThe British National Formulary recommends a gradual withdrawal when discontinuing antipsychotic treatment to avoid acute withdrawal syndrome or rapid relapse.[22] While withdrawal symptoms can occur, there is no evidence that tolerance develops to the drug's antipsychotic effects. A patient can be maintained for years on a therapeutically effective dose without any decrease in effectiveness being reported. Tolerance appears to develop to the sedating effects of chlorpromazine when it is first administered. Tolerance also appears to develop to the extrapyramidal, parkinsonian and other neuroleptic effects, although this is debatable.[23]\\r\\nA failure to notice withdrawal symptoms may be due to the relatively long half life of the drug resulting in the extremely slow excretion from the body. However, there are reports of muscular discomfort, exaggeration of psychotic symptoms and movement disorders, and difficulty sleeping when the antipsychotic drug is suddenly withdrawn, but after years of normal doses these effects are not normally seen.[23]\\r\\nChlorpromazine is a very effective antagonist of D2 dopamine receptors and similar receptors, such as D3 and D5. Unlike most other drugs of this genre, it also has a high affinity for D1 receptors. Blocking these receptors causes diminished neurotransmitter binding in the forebrain, resulting in many different effects. Dopamine, unable to bind with a receptor, causes a feedback loop that causes dopaminergic neurons to release more dopamine. Therefore, upon first taking the drug, patients will experience an increase in dopaminergic neural activity. Eventually, dopamine production of the neurons will drop substantially and dopamine will be removed from the synaptic cleft. At this point, neural activity decreases greatly; the continual blockade of receptors only compounds this effect.[9]\\r\\nChlorpromazine acts as an antagonist (blocking agent) on different postsynaptic and presynaptic receptors:\\r\\nThe presumed effectiveness of the antipsychotic drugs relied on their ability to block dopamine receptors. This assumption arose from the dopamine hypothesis that maintains that both schizophrenia and bipolar disorder are a result of excessive dopamine activity. Furthermore, psychomotor stimulants like cocaine that increase dopamine levels can cause psychotic symptoms if taken in excess.[27]\\r\\nChlorpromazine and other typical antipsychotics are primarily blockers of D2 receptors. In fact an almost perfect correlation exists between the therapeutic dose of a typical antipsychotic and the drug's affinity for the D2 receptor. Therefore, a larger dose is required if the drugs affinity for the D2 receptor is relatively weak. A correlation exists between average clinical potency and affinity of the antipsychotics for dopamine receptors.[23] Chlorpromazine tends to have greater effect at serotonin receptors than at D2 receptors, which is notably the opposite effect of the other typical antipsychotics. Therefore, chlorpromazine with respect to its effects on dopamine and serotonin receptors is more similar to the atypical antipsychotics than to the typical antipsychotics.[23]\\r\\nChlorpromazine and other antipsychotics with sedative properties such as promazine and thioridazine are among the most potent agents at ϫ-adrenergic receptors. Furthermore, they are also among the most potent antipsychotics at histamine H1 receptors. This finding is in agreement with the pharmaceutical development of chlorpromazine and other antipsychotics as anti-histamine agents. Furthermore, the brain has a higher density of histamine H1 receptors than any body organ examined which may account for why chlorpromazine and other phenothiazine antipsychotics are as potent at these sites as the most potent classical antihistamines.[28]\\r\\nIn addition to influencing the neurotransmitters dopamine, serotonin, epinephrine, norepinephrine, and acetylcholine it has been reported that antipsychotic drugs could achieve glutamanergic effects. This mechanism involves direct effects on antipsychotic drugs on glutamate receptors. By using the technique of functional neurochemical assay chlorpromazine and phenothiazine derivatives have been shown to have inhibitory effects on NMDA receptors that appeared to be mediated by action at the Zn site. It was found that there is an increase of NMDA activity at low concentrations and suppression at high concentrations of the drug. No significant difference in glutamate and glycine activity from the effects of chlorpromazine were reported. Further work will be necessary to determine if the influence in NMDA receptors by antipsychotic drugs contributes to their effectiveness.[29]\\r\\nChlorpromazine does also act as FIASMA (functional inhibitor of acid sphingomyelinase).[30]\\r\\nChlorpromazine is an antagonist to H1 receptors (provoking antiallergic effects), H2 receptors (reduction of forming of gastric juice), M1 and M2 receptors (dry mouth, reduction in forming of gastric juice) and some 5-HT receptors (different anti-allergic/gastrointestinal actions).\\r\\nBecause it acts on so many receptors, chlorpromazine is often referred to as a \\"dirty drug\\".[31]\\r\\nIn 1933, the French pharmaceutical company Laboratoires Rh?ne-Poulenc began to search for new anti-histamines. In 1947, it synthesized promethazine, a phenothiazine derivative, which was found to have more pronounced sedative and antihistaminic effects than earlier drugs.[33] A year later, the French surgeon Pierre Huguenard used promethazine together with pethidine as part of a cocktail to induce relaxation and indifference in surgical patients. Another surgeon, Henri Laborit, believed the compound stabilized the central nervous system by causing \\"artificial hibernation\\", and described this state as \\"sedation without narcosis\\". He suggested to Rh?ne-Poulenc that they develop a compound with better stabilizing properties.[34] In December 1950, the chemist Paul Charpentier produced a series of compounds that included RP4560 or chlorpromazine.[3] Simone Courvoisier conducted behavioural tests and found chlorpromazine produced indifference to aversive stimuli in rats. Chlorpromazine was distributed for testing to physicians between April and August 1951. Laborit trialled the medicine on at the Val-de-Grace military hospital in Paris, using it as an anaesthetic booster in intravenous doses of 50 to 100?mg on surgery patients and confirming it as the best drug to date in calming and reducing shock, with patients reporting improved well being afterwards. He also noted its hypothermic effect and suggested it may induce artificial hibernation. Laborit thought this would allow the body to better tolerate major surgery by reducing shock, a novel idea at the time. Known colloquially as \\"Laborit's drug\\", chlorpromazine was released onto the market in 1953 by Rh?ne-Poulenc and given the trade name Largactil, derived from large \\"broad\\" and acti* \\"activity.[3]\\r\\nFollowing on, Laborit considered whether chlorpromazine may have a role in managing patients with severe burns, Raynaud's phenomenon, or psychiatric disorders. At the Villejuif Mental Hospital in November 1951, he and Montassut administered an intravenous dose to psychiatrist Cornelia Quarti who was acting as a volunteer. Quarti noted the indifference, but fainted upon getting up to go to the toilet, and so further testing was discontinued (orthostatic hypotension is a possible side effect of chlorpromazine). Despite this, Laborit continued to push for testing in psychiatric patients during early 1952. Psychiatrists were reluctant initially, but on January 19, 1952, it was administered (alongside pethidine, pentothal and ECT) to Jacques Lh. a 24-year-old manic patient, who responded dramatically, and was discharged after three weeks having received 855?mg of the drug in total.[3]\\r\\nPierre Deniker had heard about Laborit's work from his brother-in-law, who was a surgeon, and ordered chlorpromazine for a clinical trial at the Sainte-Anne Hospital Center in Paris where he was Men's Service Chief.[3] Together with the Director of the hospital, Professor Jean Delay, they published their first clinical trial in 1952, in which they treated 38 psychotic patients with daily injections of chlorpromazine without the use of other sedating agents.[35] The response was dramatic; treatment with chlorpromazine went beyond simple sedation with patients showing improvements in thinking and emotional behaviour.[36] They also found that doses higher than those used by Laborit were required, giving patients 75ÿ100?mg daily.[3]\\r\\nDeniker then visited America, where the publication of their work alerted the American psychiatric community that the new treatment might represent a real breakthrough. Heinz Lehmann of the Verdun Protestant Hospital in Montreal trialled it in 70 patients and also noted its striking effects, with patients' symptoms resolving after many years of unrelenting psychosis.[citation needed] By 1954, chlorpromazine was being used in the United States to treat schizophrenia, mania, psychomotor excitement, and other psychotic disorders.[9][37][38] Rh?ne-Poulenc licensed chlorpromazine to Smith Kline & French (today's GlaxoSmithKline) in 1953. In 1955 it was approved in the United States for the treatment of emesis (vomiting). The effect of this drug in emptying psychiatric hospitals has been compared to that of penicillin and infectious diseases.[35] But the popularity of the drug fell from the late 1960s as newer drugs came on the scene. From chlorpromazine a number of other similar antipsychotics were developed. It also led to the discovery of antidepressants.[39]\\r\\nChlorpromazine largely replaced electroconvulsive therapy, hydrotherapy,[40] psychosurgery, and insulin shock therapy.[36] By 1964, about 50 million people worldwide had taken it.[41] Chlorpromazine, in widespread use for 50 years, remains a \\"benchmark\\" drug in the treatment of schizophrenia, an effective drug although not a perfect one.[17] The relative strengths or potencies of other antipsychotics are often ranked or measured against chlorpromazine in aliquots of 100?mg, termed chlorpromazine equivalents or CPZE.[42]\\r\\nBrand names include Thorazine, Largactil, Hibernal, and Megaphen (sold by Bayer in West-Germany since July 1953[43]).\\r\\nThe veterinary use of chlorpromazine has generally been superseded by use of acepromazine.[44]\\r\\nChlorpromazine may be used as an antiemetic in dogs and cats, or, less often, as sedative prior to anesthesia.[45] In horses, it often causes ataxia and lethargy, and is therefore seldom used.[44][45]\\r\\nIt is commonly used to decrease nausea in animals that are too young for other common anti-emetics.[citation needed] It is also sometimes used as a preanesthetic and muscle relaxant in cattle, swine, sheep, and goats.[citation needed]\\r\\nThe use of chlorpromazine in food-producing animals is not permitted in the EU, as a maximum residue limit could not be determined following assessment by the European Medicines Agency.[46]\\r\\nChlorpromazine has tentative benefit in animals infected with Naegleria fowleri.[47]","input":"Phenothiazines such as chlorpromazine were the first type of?"},{"output":"May 29, 2008","context":"Republic Day (Nepali: ?? ?) is a special day in the history of Nepal that commemorates the inception of the Federal Democratic Republic of Nepal on May 29, 2008.

These were charter colonies, proprietary colonies, and royal colonies. A group of 13 British American colonies collectively broke from the British Empire in the 1770s through a successful revolution, establishing the modern United States. After the end of the Napoleonic Wars (1803ÿ15), the remaining British territories in North America were slowly granted more responsible government. In 1838 the Durham Report recommended full responsible government for Canada, but this was not fully implemented for another decade. Eventually, with the Confederation of Canada, the Canadian colonies were granted significant autonomy and became a self-governing Dominion in 1867. Other colonies in the Americas followed at a much slower pace. In this way, two countries in North America, ten in the Caribbean, and one in South America have received their independence from Great Britain or the later United Kingdom. All of these, except the United States, are members of the Commonwealth of Nations and nine are Commonwealth realms.

With New Netherland, the English also came to control the former New Sweden (in what is now Delaware), which the Dutch had conquered earlier. This later became part of Pennsylvania after that was established in 1680.\\r\\nThe Kingdom of Scotland tried unsuccessfully to establish a colony at Darin, and the Scottish colonization of Nova Scotia (New Scotland) lasted from 1629 to 1632.

Citizens volunteered to enroll in the Home Defense League to aid police in patrolling duties and be on hand in case of emergencies.[4] In a matter of months, 22,000 people had volunteered for the Home Defense League. They were required to attend trainings on handling prisoners, protecting themselves, and using weapons. They received no pay. If the need arose (as it did in 1917 when armed forces were mobilized), they could be called into service to guard armories, subway stations, and other areas of the city.[5]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1918, the Home Defense League changed its name to the New York Reserve Police Force, as proposed by Commissioner Richard Enright, in addition to undergoing higher-caliber training under Special Deputy Police Commissioner Lewis Rodman Wanamaker.[6] Over 3,000 women joined the Police Reserve, serving under Captain Mary Noonan, primarily to provide eyes and ears for the police, look out for children's safety, and give first aid if necessary.[7][8] Governor Alfred E. Smith signed a new state law in 1920 that established the permanency of a reserve force as an adjunct of the police department.[9] By the mid-1920s, however, the Police Reserve had gradually stopped functioning as an active part of the Police Department, due to political disputes in a high-crime period.

In 1951, the New York State Legislature enacted the \\"Defense Emergency Act\\" requiring New York City to recruit, train, and equip volunteer Civil Defense wardens, who would provide traffic and crowd control and other assistance to police officers in the event of an emergency or natural disaster.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe New York Penal Law provided peace officer status for the Civil Defense wardens during the event of an actual natural or man-made disaster or attack or during training drills. In 1967, a Mayoral Executive Order closed the Civil Defense Headquarters and placed full responsibility of the Civil Defense wardens with the NYPD. The NYPD retitled the division Auxiliary Police, changed the uniform to reflect police officer uniforms, and revised the duties of Auxiliary Police. During the 1960s when crime was on the rise, uniformed Auxiliary Police patrols were one means to deter crime.\\r\\n\\r\\nAuxiliary Police recruits must pass an 18-week, 140 hour \\"Auxiliary Police Basic Training Course\\" which is classified as \\"Peace Officer Training\\".[11]\\r\\n\\r\\nAuxiliary recruits are required by the New York State Municipal Police Training Council to undergo and pass this training course before they become Auxiliary Police officers. The training given in this course includes training in penal law, police science, discipline, powers of a peace officer, radio use, defensive tactics, unarmed self-defense, self-defense with a straight wood baton, physical training, chemical training, first aid, handcuffing techniques, and arrest procedures.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 2008, the NYPD revised the training course to include training in location and use of pressure points, dealing with domestic violence situations, firearm safety, and terrorism awareness. A written and physical exam is given at the end of training.\\r\\n\\r\\nUpon the completion of the Basic Training Course, the physical exam, and the written exam, probationary Auxiliary Police officers are issued their shield and police identification card along with their baton and initial uniform allowance voucher. Probationary Auxiliary Police officers must patrol with a field training officer.\\r\\n\\r\\nAll Auxiliary Police officers are required by New York State to pass an annual refresher course in the use of force with the straight baton, arrest procedures, and law in order to maintain their status.\\r\\n\\r\\nAuxiliary Police officers are certified as \\"Peace Officers without Firearms Training\\" by the New York State Division of Criminal Justice Services - Municipal Police Training Council, and are registered as peace officers in the NYS DCJS registry of peace officers.\\r\\n\\r\\nAlthough volunteers, Auxiliary Police officers are city employees while on duty and may be eligible for Workers' Compensation in the event of injury while on duty.\\r\\n\\r\\nAuxiliary Police officers must purchase and maintain equipment at their own expense. Officers who work the minimum required hours per fiscal year receive an annual uniform allowance check to help pay for new and replacement equipment and uniforms.\\r\\n\\r\\nAuxiliary Police officers duties fall into four broad categories:[12]\\r\\n\\r\\nAuxiliary Police officers increase the public's perception of police \\"omnipresence\\" by patrolling in police cars, on foot and on bicycle. The police cars, known as RMPs or Radio Motor Patrols, are dark blue or black with white decals or white with light blue decals. Auxiliary Police officers wear virtually the same uniform as regular officers, and are equipped with straight wood batons; asp batons; bullet resistant vests; police radios directly linked to the Central Dispatcher, other Auxiliary officers, and regular officers; flashlights; whistles; handcuffs; memo books; and reflective traffic vests. Their badge is a seven-point star, in contrast to the shield worn by regular officers.[13]\\r\\n\\r\\nAuxiliary Police officers in New York City are not permitted to carry a side arm at any time on duty, even if independently licensed to carry a firearm. In other jurisdictions within New York State, some police departments do allow their Auxiliary Police officers to carry a firearm.\\r\\n\\r\\nAuxiliary Police officers patrol presence, observations and reporting of incidents requiring regular police response.\\r\\nThe Auxiliary Police officers may be involved in life or death situations, as the Regular Officer but do not have the option to the use of a firearm.  If involved in a threat brought by a firearm they will respond with their wooden baton.\\r\\n\\r\\nAuxiliary Police officers can:\\r\\n\\r\\nAuxiliary Police officers cannot:\\r\\n\\r\\nPrecinct Patrol: Officers patrol their respective precinct. When performing foot patrol, the area of the precinct that the officer patrols is called a Patrol Area, which are divided into \\"Foot Posts\\". RMP and bike patrol are also performed. Officers under age 18 cannot perform patrol.[15]\\r\\n\\r\\nHousing Bureau: Officers patrol their respective Housing (Police Service Area) precinct, mainly being a uniformed presence within the NYC housing projects. When performing foot patrol, the area of the precinct that the officer patrols is called Patrol Areas, which are divided into \\"Foot Posts\\". RMP and bike patrol are also performed.[15]\\r\\n\\r\\nTransit Bureau: Officers patrol their respective Transit District precinct. When performing foot patrol, the area of the precinct that the officer patrols is called a Patrol Area, which are divided into \\"Foot Posts\\". RMP patrol is also performed.[15]\\r\\n\\r\\nTwo weeks after the 2005 London bombings, a new directive stated that New York City would institute a citywide transit Auxiliary program with the intent of reducing crime and fighting terrorism in the city's transit system. Transit Auxiliary officers work out of Transit Bureau precincts known as Districts and carry Transit portable radios. Unlike a precinct, the transit districts cover miles of underground subway. Transit Auxiliary Police officers go through additional training by the Transit Bureau Vandals Squad as well as the Counter-Terrorism Division to build vandalism and terrorism awareness within the Transit System. Transit Auxiliary officers are paired with either a regular police officer or Auxiliary police officer. Transit Auxiliary Police periodically perform inspections of the subway station(s) and platforms which they are assigned to, taking note of any suspicious occurrences, and set up a fixed post at the subway turnstiles, token booths, mezzanines, or platforms. Transit Auxiliary officers also conduct subway train inspections as well as train runs to/from stations that which assignment is given. Due to the common medical emergency calls in Transit, if medically qualified, Transit Auxiliary Police officers can respond to medical emergencies if they are near to the transit location. The main function of the NYPD Transit Auxiliary Police, like the NYPD Transit Police, is to primarily remain within the subway system.[16]\\r\\n[17][18][19]\\r\\n\\r\\nHighway Patrol: Officers patrol highways, parkways, and main thoroughfares throughout the City of New York. Auxiliary Highway Patrol officers wear the same uniform as regular Highway Patrol officers and patrol in regular officers RMPs in Auxiliary Police Highway Patrol RMPs with AUXILIARY decals on each side. All applicants to this unit are required to have a minimum of five years experience as a patrol officer with the NYPD Auxiliary Police, must be mature, and have exceptional discipline and service records. Officers will be required to attend an Advanced Vehicle Operation Course before they may operate a Highway Patrol Vehicle. See article: New York City Police Department Highway Patrol[20]\\r\\n\\r\\nHarbor Unit: Officers patrol New York City's waterways. A marine background such as one obtained through the U.S. Coast Guard, military, or other marine background is required.[20]\\r\\n\\r\\nCitywide Traffic Task Force (CTTF): Officers patrol in areas all over the city that need special attention and extra patrol. However, more typical of this unit is performing duty during special events such as concerts, marathons, parades, etc. to increase the police presence. They are involved in both vehicular and pedestrian traffic control.  They do not confine themselves to one location or precinct.[21]\\r\\n\\r\\nUndercover Vice Ops: Officers that have not reached the age of 20 years and 6 months old can be utilized to assist the NYPD Vice Unit Narcotics Division for \\"Quality of Life enforcement\\" stings which address illegal alcohol, knife, and spray paint sales. Other than this exception, NYPD Auxiliary Police officers are never undercover (*unless authorized by the Police Commissioner or Commanding Officer of the Auxiliary Police) and always patrol in uniform. Officers who have received the necessary \\"Vice Training\\" may be used by their command in  surveillance operations.\\r\\n\\r\\nCeremonial Unit: The Auxiliary Police also has a ceremonial unit made up of a small group of Auxiliary officers.[22]\\r\\n\\r\\nPatrol is one of the most important duties Auxiliary officers can perform. Various types of patrols are possible within different precincts. Almost all precincts perform foot patrol. Other types of patrol include:\\r\\n\\r\\nIn most cases, Auxiliary Police vehicles are retired vehicles that were once used by regular officers. Once the vehicle attains a certain amount of mileage, it is taken out of service and is either redecaled and given to a command for the Auxiliary Police, or is sold. Auxiliary Highway Patrol RMPs are retired RMPs previously used by regular Highway Patrol officers. Most commands only have one Auxiliary vehicle, but some have 2 or more. The number of Auxiliary vehicles per command is based on how many Auxiliary officers are working there and how many extra vehicles the NYPD has available. It should also be noted that older Auxiliary vehicles are painted either dark blue or black with white decals in contrast to the vehicles used by regular officers, which are white with light blue decals. In 2008, the NYPD changed the paint and decal color of Auxiliary vehicles to white with light blue decals in order to look like vehicles used by regular officers and as an economy measure to save money by not having to repaint the vehicles.[24]\\r\\n\\r\\nOfficers wishing to operate a bicycle, RMP, or van need special training before they are allowed to operate them. Training is done by the Police Academy Driver Training Unit (PADT) which is located at Floyd Bennett Field in Brooklyn. The golf cart, which is special to the Central Park Precinct, also requires special training to operate.[25]\\r\\n\\r\\nAuxiliary Police officers are not issued, and are not permitted to carry firearms while on duty, even if otherwise authorized/licensed to carry when off-duty. Seven officers have been killed in the line of duty.\\r\\n\\r\\nRisks are involved, On March 14, 2007, two Auxiliary Police officersEugene Marshalik and Nicholas Pekearowere killed in a shootout in Greenwich Village.[26]\\r\\n\\r\\nUp until March 26, 2007, the NYPD did not issue or subsidize ballistic vests to Auxiliary officers. But after the shootings of Pekearo and Marshalik, Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg and Commissioner Raymond W. Kelly asked the New York City Council to earmark more than 3.3 million dollars to provide all Auxiliary Police officers with Level IIIA Vests, the same used by full-time officers. On March 27, 2007, the City Council approved this bill, which had all Auxiliary officers equipped with vests. Since then, in 2010, funding for vest for Auxiliary Police Officers has run out of the NYPD City Budget. Every Police Precinct, Housing Police Service Area and Transit District has a pool of \\"loaner\\" vest for new Auxiliary Police Officers to use while on patrol. Afterwards, they are returned and secured by the Auxiliary Coordinator.[27]\\r\\n\\r\\nNew York City Auxiliary Police Officers of all ranks have been represented since 1965 by the Auxiliary Police Benevolent Association of the City of New York (APBA).[28] While Auxiliary Police Officers are not full-time employees of the NYPD, they face many of the issues regular Police Officers face regarding working conditions, including safety, disciplinary actions, and uniform allowance reimbursement. Membership is voluntary.\\r\\n\\r\\nSince the establishment of the New York City Police Department Auxiliary Police, seven officers have died in the line of duty.[29]\\r\\n\\r\\n(Solid green bar speckled tiny gold stars) is awarded for:","input":"What is an auxiliary police officer in ny?"},{"output":"the art of agriculture","context":"In Greek mythology, Triptolemus /?tr?p?t?l?m?s/ (Greek: ??, Tript܇lemos, lit. \\"threefold warrior\\"; also known as Buzyges) is a figure connected with the goddess Demeter of the Eleusinian Mysteries. He was either a mortal prince, the eldest son of King Celeus of Eleusis, or, according to Pseudo-Apollodorus' Bibliotheca (I.V.2), the son of Gaia and Oceanus. \\r\\n\\r\\nWhile Demeter (in the guise of an old woman named Doso) was searching for her daughter Persephone, who had been abducted by Hades, she received a hospitable welcome from Celeus. He asked her to nurse Demophon\\"killer of men\\", a counterpart to Triptolemus and Triptolemus, his sons by Metanira. Demeter saw Triptolemus was sick and fed him her breast milk. Not only did he recover his strength but he instantly became an adult.[1] As another gift to Celeus, in gratitude for his hospitality, Demeter secretly planned to make Demophon immortal by burning away his mortal spirit in the family hearth every night. She was unable to complete the ritual because Metanira walked in on her one night. Instead, Demeter chose to teach Triptolemus the art of agriculture and, from him, the rest of Greece learned to plant and reap crops.  He flew across the land on a chariot drawn by dragons while Demeter and Persephone, once restored to her mother, cared for him, and helped him complete his mission of educating the whole of Greece in the art of agriculture. Triptolemus was equally associated with the bestowal of hope for the afterlife associated with the expansion of the Eleusinian Mysteries (Kerenyi 1967 p 123).\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen Triptolemus taught King Lyncus of the Scythians, the arts of agriculture, Lyncus refused to teach it to his people and then tried to murder Triptolemus. As punishment, Demeter turned Lyncus into a lynx. King Charnabon of the Getae also made an attempt on Triptolemus' life, killing one of his dragons to prevent his escape. Demeter intervened again, replacing the dragon and condemning Charnabon to a life of torment. Upon his death, Charnabon was placed in the stars as the constellation Ophiuchus, said to resemble a man trying to kill a serpent, as a warning to mortals who would think to betray those favoured by the gods.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the archaic Homeric Hymn to Demeter, Triptolemus is briefly mentioned as one of the original priests of Demeter, one of the first men to learn the secret rites and mysteries of Eleusinian Mysteries: Diocles, Eumolpos, Celeus and Polyxeinus were the others mentioned of the first priests. The role of Triptolemus in the Eleusinian mysteries was exactly defined: \\"he had a cult of his own, apart from the Mysteries. One entered his temple on the way to the closed-off sacred precinct, before coming to the former Hekataion, the temple of Artemis outside the great Propylaia.\\" (Kerenyi).  In the 5th-century bas-relief in the National Museum, Athens (illustration), which probably came from his temple, the boy Triptolemus stands between the two Goddesses, Demeter and the Kore, and receives from Demeter the ear of grain (of gold, now lost).\\r\\n\\r\\nPorphyry (On Abstinence IV.22) ascribes to Triptolemus three commandments for a simple, pious life: \\"Honor your parents\\", \\"Honor the gods with fruits\\"for the Greeks, \\"fruits\\" would include the grainand \\"Spare the animals\\" (Kerenyi, p128).\\r\\n\\r\\nTriptolemus is also depicted as a young man with a branch or diadem placed in his hair, usually sitting on his chariot, adorned with serpents.  His attributes include a plate of grain, a pair of wheat or barley ears and a scepter.\\r\\n\\r\\nCeleus or the peasant Dysaules may be substituted for Triptolemus as the primordial Eleusinian recipient of the first gifts of the Mysteries.","input":"What is the gift of triptolemus to humankind?"},{"output":"February 19, 1880","context":"The photophone is a telecommunications device that allows transmission of speech on a beam of light. It was invented jointly by Alexander Graham Bell and his assistant Charles Sumner Tainter on February 19, 1880, at Bell's laboratory at 1325 L Street in Washington, D.C.[1][2] Both were later to become full associates in the Volta Laboratory Association, created and financed by Bell.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn June 3, 1880, Bell's assistant transmitted a wireless voice telephone message from the roof of the Franklin School to the window of Bell's laboratory, some 213 meters (about 700?ft.) away.[3][4][5][6]\\r\\n\\r\\nBell believed the photophone was his most important invention. Of the 18 patents granted in Bell's name alone, and the 12 he shared with his collaborators, four were for the photophone, which Bell referred to as his \\"greatest achievement\\", telling a reporter shortly before his death that the photophone was \\"the greatest invention [I have] ever made, greater than the telephone\\".[7][8]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe photophone was a precursor to the fiber-optic communication systems that achieved worldwide popular usage starting in the 1980s.[9][10][11] The master patent for the photophone (U.S. Patent 235,199 Apparatus for Signalling and Communicating, called Photophone) was issued in December 1880,[5] many decades before its principles came to have practical applications.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe photophone was similar to a contemporary telephone, except that it used modulated light as a means of wireless transmission while the telephone relied on modulated electricity carried over a conductive wire circuit.\\r\\n\\r\\nBell's own description of the light modulator:[12]\\r\\n\\r\\n We have found that the simplest form of apparatus for producing the effect consists of a plane mirror of flexible material against the back of which the speaker's voice is directed. Under the action of the voice the mirror becomes alternately convex and concave and thus alternately scatters and condenses the light.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe brightness of a reflected beam of light, as observed from the location of the receiver, therefore varied in accordance with the audio-frequency variations in air pressurethe sound waveswhich acted upon the mirror.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn its initial form, the photophone receiver was also non-electronic, using the photoacoustic effect. Bell found that many substances could be used as direct light-to-sound transducers. Lampblack proved to be outstanding. Using a fully modulated beam of sunlight as a test signal, one experimental receiver design, employing only a deposit of lampblack, produced a tone that Bell described as \\"painfully loud\\" to an ear pressed close to the device.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn its ultimate electronic form, the photophone receiver used a simple selenium cell photodetector at the focus of a parabolic mirror.[5] The cell's electrical resistance (between about 100 and 300 ohms) varied inversely with the light falling upon it, i.e., its resistance was higher when dimly lit, lower when brightly lit. The selenium cell took the place of a carbon microphonealso a variable-resistance devicein the circuit of what was otherwise essentially an ordinary telephone, consisting of a battery, an electromagnetic earphone, and the variable resistance, all connected in series. The selenium modulated the current flowing through the circuit, and the current was converted back into variations of air pressuresoundby the earphone.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn his speech to the American Association for the Advancement of Science in August 1880, Bell gave credit for the first demonstration of speech transmission by light to Mr. A.C. Brown of London in the Fall of 1878.[5][13]\\r\\n\\r\\nBecause the device used radiant energy, the French scientist Ernest Mercadier suggested that the invention should not be named 'photophone', but 'radiophone', as its mirrors reflected the Sun's radiant energy in multiple bands including the invisible infrared band.[14] Bell used the name for a while but it should not be confused with the later invention \\"radiophone\\" which used radio waves.[15]\\r\\n\\r\\nWhile honeymooning in Europe with his bride Mabel Hubbard, Bell likely read of the newly discovered property of selenium having a variable resistance when acted upon by light, in a paper by Robert Sabine as published in Nature on 25 April 1878. In his experiments, Sabine used a meter to see the effects of light acting on selenium connected in a circuit to a battery. However Bell reasoned that by adding a telephone receiver to the same circuit he would be able to hear what Sabine could only see.[16]\\r\\n\\r\\nAs Bell's former associate, Thomas Watson, was fully occupied as the superintendent of manufacturing for the nascent Bell Telephone Company back in Boston, Massachusetts, Bell hired Charles Sumner Tainter, an instrument maker who had previously been assigned to the U.S. 1874 Transit of Venus Commission, for his new 'L' Street laboratory in Washington, at the rate of $15 per week.[17]\\r\\n\\r\\nOn February 19, 1880 the pair had managed to make a functional photophone in their new laboratory by attaching a set of metallic gratings to a diaphragm, with a beam of light being interrupted by the gratings movement in response to spoken sounds. When the modulated light beam fell upon their selenium receiver Bell, on his headphones, was able to clearly hear Tainter singing Auld Lang Syne.[18]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn an April 1, 1880 Washington, D.C. experiment, Bell and Tainter communicated some 79 metres (259?ft) along an alleyway to the laboratory's rear window. Then a few months later on June 21 they succeeded in communicating clearly over a distance of some 213 meters (about 700?ft.), using plain sunlight as their light source, practical electrical lighting having only just been introduced to the U.S. by Edison. The transmitter in their latter experiments had sunlight reflected off the surface of a very thin mirror positioned at the end of a speaking tube; as words were spoken they cause the mirror to oscillate between convex and concave, altering the amount of light reflected from its surface to the receiver. Tainter, who was on the roof of the Franklin School, spoke to Bell, who was in his laboratory listening and who signaled back to Tainter by waving his hat vigorously from the window, as had been requested.[6]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe receiver was a parabolic mirror with selenium cells at its focal point.[5] Conducted from the roof of the Franklin School to Bell's laboratory at 1325 'L' Street, this was the world's first formal wireless telephone communication (away from their laboratory), thus making the photophone the world's earliest known voice wireless telephone systems[citation needed], at least 19 years ahead of the first spoken radio wave transmissions. Before Bell and Tainter had concluded their research in order to move on to the development of the Graphophone, they had devised some 50 different methods of modulating and demodulating light beams for optical telephony.[19]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe telephone itself was still something of a novelty, and radio was decades away from commercialization. The social resistance to the photophone's futuristic form of communications could be seen in an August 1880 New York Times commentary:[20][21]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe ordinary man ... will find a little difficulty in comprehending how sunbeams are to be used. Does Prof. Bell intend to connect Boston and Cambridge ... with a line of sunbeams hung on telegraph posts, and, if so, what diameter are the sunbeams to be ....[and] will it be necessary to insulate them against the weather ... until (the public) sees a man going through the streets with a coil of No. 12 sunbeams on his shoulder, and suspending them from pole to pole, there will be a general feeling that there is something about Professor Bell's photophone which places a tremendous strain on human credulity.\\r\\n\\r\\nHowever at the time of their February 1880 breakthrough, Bell was immensely proud of the achievement, to the point that he wanted to name his new second daughter \\"Photophone\\", which was subtly discouraged by his wife Mabel Bell (they instead chose \\"Marian\\", with \\"Daisy\\" as her nickname).[22] He wrote somewhat enthusiastically:[4][23]\\r\\n\\r\\nI have heard articulate speech by sunlight! I have heard a ray of the sun laugh and cough and sing! ...I have been able to hear a shadow and I have even perceived by ear the passage of a cloud across the sun's disk. You are the grandfather of the Photophone and I want to share my delight at my success.\\r\\nBell transferred the photophone's intellectual property rights to the American Bell Telephone Company in May 1880.[24] While Bell had hoped his new photophone could be used by ships at sea and to also displace the plethora of telephone lines that were blooming along busy city boulevards,[25] his design failed to protect its transmissions from outdoor interferences such as clouds, fog, rain, snow and such, that could easily disrupt the transmission of light.[26] Factors such as the weather and the lack of light inhibited the use of Bell's invention.[27] Not long after its invention laboratories within the Bell System continued to improve the photophone in the hope that it could supplement or replace expensive conventional telephone lines. Its earliest non-experimental use came with military communication systems during World War I and II, its key advantage being that its light-based transmissions could not be intercepted by the enemy.\\r\\n\\r\\nBell pondered the photophone's possible scientific use in the spectral analysis of artificial light sources, stars and sunspots. He later also speculated on its possible future applications, though he did not anticipate either the laser or fiber-optic telecommunications:[23]\\r\\n\\r\\nCan Imagination picture what the future of this invention is to be!.... We may talk by light to any visible distance without any conduction wire.... In general science, discoveries will be make by the Photophone that are undreamed of just now.\\r\\n\\r\\nAlthough Bell Telephone researchers made several modest incremental improvements on Bell and Tainter's design, Marconi's radio transmissions started to far surpass the maximum range of the photophone as early as 1897[8] and further development of the photophone was largely arrested until German-Austrian experiments began at the turn of the 20th century.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe German physicist Ernst Ruhmer believed that the increased sensitivity of his improved selenium cells, combined with the superior receiving capabilities of professor H. T. Simon's \\"speaking arc\\", would make the photophone practical over longer signalling distances. Ruhmer carried out a series of experimental transmissions along the Havel river and on Lake Wannsee from 1901 to 1902. He reported achieving sending distances under good conditions of 15 kilometers (9 miles),[29] with equal success during the day and at night. He continued his experiments around Berlin through 1904, in conjunction with the German Navy, which supplied high-powered searchlights for use in the transmissions.[30]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe German Siemens & Halske Company boosted the photophone's range by utilizing current-modulated carbon arc lamps which provided a useful range of approximately 8 kilometres (5.0?mi). They produced units commercially for the German Navy, which were further adapted to increase their range to 11 kilometres (6.8?mi) using voice-modulated ship searchlights.[5]\\r\\n\\r\\nBritish Admiralty research during WWI resulted in the development of a vibrating mirror modulator in 1916. More sensitive molybdenite receiver cells, which also had greater sensitivity to infra-red radiation, replaced the older selenium cells in 1917.[5] The United States and German governments also worked on technical improvements to Bell's system.[31]\\r\\n\\r\\nBy 1935 the German Carl Zeiss Company had started producing infra-red photophones for the German Army's tank battalions, employing tungsten lamps with infra-red filters which were modulated by vibrating mirrors or prisms. These also used receivers which employed lead sulfide detector cells and amplifiers, boosting their range to 14 kilometres (8.7?mi) under optimal conditions. The Japanese and Italian armies also attempted similar development of lightwave telecommunications before 1945.[5]\\r\\n\\r\\nSeveral military laboratories, including those in the United States, continued R&D efforts on the photophone into the 1950s, experimenting with high-pressure vapour and mercury arc lamps of between 500 and 2,000 watts power.[5]\\r\\n\\r\\nFROM THE TOP FLOOR OF THIS BUILDING\\r\\nWAS SENT ON JUNE 3, 1880\\r\\nOVER A BEAM OF LIGHT TO 1325 'L' STREET\\r\\nTHE FIRST WIRELESS TELEPHONE MESSAGE\\r\\nIN THE HISTORY OF THE WORLD.\\r\\nTHE APPARATUS USED IN SENDING THE MESSAGE\\r\\nWAS THE PHOTOPHONE INVENTED BY\\r\\nALEXANDER GRAHAM BELL\\r\\nINVENTOR OF THE TELEPHONE\\r\\nTHIS PLAQUE WAS PLACED HERE BY\\r\\nALEXANDER GRAHAM BELL CHAPTER\\r\\nTELEPHONE PIONEERS OF AMERICA\\r\\nMARCH 3, 1947\\r\\nTHE CENTENNIAL OF DR.

The marker did not acknowledge Tainter's scientific and engineering contributions.[original research?]\\r\\n\\r\\nOn February 19, 1980, exactly 100 years to the day after Bell and Tainter's first photophone transmission in their laboratory, staff from the Smithsonian Institution, the National Geographic Society and AT&T's Bell Labs gathered at the location of Bells former 1325 'L' Street Volta Laboratory in Washington, D.C. for a commemoration of the event.[11][32]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Photophone Centenary commemoration had first been proposed by electronics researcher and writer Forrest M. Mims, who suggested it to Dr. Melville Bell Grosvenor, the inventor's grandson, during a visit to his office at the National Geographic Society. The historic grouping later observed the centennial of the photophone's first successful laboratory transmission by using Mims hand-made demonstration photophone, which functioned similar to Bell and Tainter's model.[19][Note 1]\\r\\n\\r\\nMims also built and provided a pair of modern hand-held battery-powered LED transceivers connected by 100 yards (91?m) of optical fiber. The Bell Labs' Richard Gundlach and the Smithsonian's Elliot Sivowitch used the device at the commemoration to demonstrate one of the photophone's modern-day descendants. The National Geographic Society also mounted a special educational exhibit in its Explorer's Hall, highlighting the photophone's invention with original items borrowed from the Smithsonian Institution.[33]\\r\\n\\r\\n Footnotes \\r\\n\\r\\n Citations \\r\\n\\r\\n Bibliography","input":"When did alexander graham bell invented the photophone?"},{"output":"a state government","context":"State defense forces (SDF; also known as state military, state guards, or state military reserves) in the United States are military units that operate under the sole authority of a state government; they are partially regulated by the National Guard Bureau but they are not a part of the Army National Guard of the United States.[1] State defense forces are authorized by state and federal law and are under the command of the governor of each state.\\r\\nState defense forces are distinct from their state's National Guard in that they cannot become federal entities. All state National Guard personnel (to include the National Guard of the District of Columbia, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico and the territories of Guam and the Virgin Islands) can be federalized under the National Defense Act of 1933 with the creation of the National Guard of the United States. This provides the basis for integrating units and personnel of the Army National Guard into the U.S. Army and, since 1947, units and personnel of the Air National Guard into the U.S. Air Force.[2]\\r\\nThe federal government recognizes state defense forces, as per the Compact Clause of the U.S. Constitution, under 32 U.S.C.??109 which provides that state defense forces as a whole may not be called, ordered, or drafted into the armed forces of the United States, thus preserving their separation from the National Guard. However, under the same law, individual members serving in the state defense force are not exempt from service in the armed forces (i.e., they are not excluded from the draft). Under 32 USC  109(e), \\"A person may not become a member of a defense force ... if he is a member of a reserve component of the armed forces.\\"\\r\\nNearly every state has laws authorizing state defense forces, and 22 states, plus the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, have active SDFs with different levels of activity, support, and strength. State defense forces generally operate with emergency management and homeland security missions. Most SDFs are organized as army units, but air and naval units also exist.[3][4] As governors often use state defense forces to augment their state's Army National Guard and Air National Guard units, state defense forces have been both officially and informally called National Guard Reserves.[5]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nFrom its founding until the early 1900s, the United States maintained only a minimal army and relied on state militias to supply the majority of its troops, with the training and readiness of the latter varying widely.[6] As a result of the SpanishÿAmerican War and the performance of the militias and other volunteer units during that conflict, Congress was called upon to reform and regulate the training and qualification of state militias. In 1903, with passage of the Militia Act of 1903, the predecessor to the modern-day National Guard was formed. It required the states to divide their militias into two sections. The law recommended the title \\"National Guard\\" for the first section, known as the organized militia, and \\"Reserve Militia\\" for all others.[7]\\r\\nDuring World War I, Congress authorized the states to maintain Home Guards, which were reserve forces outside the National Guard forces that were then being deployed by the Federal Government as part of the National Army. The Secretary of War was authorized to furnish these Home Guard units with rifles, ammunition, and supplies.[8]\\r\\nIn 1933, Congress finalized the split between the National Guard and the traditional state militias by mandating that all federally funded soldiers take a dual enlistment/commission and thus enter both the state National Guard and the newly created National Guard of the United States, a federal reserve force. In 1940, with the onset of World War II and as a result of its federalizing the National Guard, Congress amended the National Defense Act of 1916, and authorized the states to maintain \\"military forces other than National Guard.\\"[9] This law authorized the War Department to train and arm the new military forces that would come to be known as State Guards. Many states took advantage of this law and maintained distinct state military forces throughout the war to defend their own territories, shorelines, and air spaces. In 1947, with the establishment of an independent U.S. Air Force, Congress directed yet another reorganization of the National Guard into a separate Army National Guard and a separate Air National Guard. The former would continue to be composed of traditional Army ground units and those aviation assets (certain helicopters and observation/liaison aircraft) unique to Army Aviation, while the latter would consist of those National Guard units that had heretofore been part of the former U.S. Army Air Forces and would now be operationally gained by the newly established Air Force.\\r\\nIn 1950, with the outbreak of the Korean War and at the urging of the National Guard, Congress reauthorized the separate state military forces for a time period of two years. These state military forces were authorized military training at federal expense, as well as \\"arms, ammunition, clothing, and equipment,\\" as deemed necessary by the Secretary of the Army.[10] At the end of the two years, however, they were not reauthorized under federal law.\\r\\nIn 1956, Congress finally revised the law and authorized \\"State defense forces\\" permanently under Title 32, Section 109, of the United States Code.[11] Two years later, Congress amended the law and changed the name from \\"State defense forces\\" to \\"defense forces.\\"[12] Still, it was not until the early Ronald Reagan administration that many states developed their defense forces into elements that existed beyond paper, when the U.S. Department of Defense actively encouraged states to create and maintain SDF units.[13]\\r\\nBy the late 1980s, however, a series of high-profile reports caused several states to shut down or significantly restructure their forces. In 1987, the governor of Utah removed all but 31 officers from its state defense force, the Utah State Guard, after a probe revealed that its ranks were \\"peppered with neo-Nazis, felons and mental patients.\\"[14] Meanwhile, in 1990, the Virginia General Assembly launched an investigation and subsequent overhaul of its state's force after receiving tips that the volunteers were \\"saving money to buy a tank.\\"[15]\\r\\nWith the end of the Cold War came a general decrease of interest in state defense forces. The attacks of September 11, 2001, however, generated additional attention and, with it, greater scrutiny from some in the United States military who questioned the training and equipment of the units and whether they provided an outlet for \\"warrior wannabes\\" who would not otherwise qualify for service in the armed forces.[16] In 2008, Alaska disarmed its state defense force after an investigation concluded the lack of training intensity or standardization was a potential legal liability to the state.[17] By 2010 the status of the force had been downgraded even further, with the Adjutant-General of the Alaska National Guard informing volunteers that they would only be called upon as a \\"reserve of last resort to be used only in the most extreme emergencies.[18] The ASDF remained deliberately hamstrung for over half a decade, until Governor Bill Walker overruled the Adjutant-General in 2016 when he announced his intention to reform the Alaska State Defense Force by expanding it further into rural Alaska and improving training standards.[19]\\r\\nFurther controversy was stoked by a New York Times report which found many senior officers in the New York Guard had little or no formal military training despite holding, in some cases, general officer ranks. The former commander of the force, Pierre David Lax, noted that, \\"if you are friendly with the governor and you always wanted to be a general, you ask the governor to make you a general, and poof, you are a brigadier general.\\" Another former commander asserted he regularly awarded titles to members of the New York legislature in exchange for their support of budgetary allocations to the force. The report also noted that a majority of the unit's rare deployments involved providing ceremonial support, such as bands and color guards, to the state government.[20]\\r\\nAn April 2014 Department of Defense report by the Inspector General's office reported confusion and inconsistency among state adjutant generals as to the use and status of state defense forces. The IG's office reported an under-utilization of state defense force capabilities due to a lack of clarity in US code regarding the use of SDFs, fueling fear that using funds and assets acquired through the federal government for state defense forces could run afoul of regulations. (While the National Guard is operated by the states, most of their equipment and funding comes from the federal government.) This fear of violating regulations also inhibited their use and integration with their National Guard counterparts, preventing them from conducting joint operations alongside one another, and also from volunteering in support of federally run missions. Other problems cited by the Inspector General's office were a lack of standardization in training and physical fitness, raising questions as to the ability of SDFs to work alongside their National Guard counterparts, and a lack of coordination with and support from the Department of Defense. During a survey conducted by the Inspector General of SDF commanders and adjutant generals, 18 of 19 considered their SDFs to be part of the organized militia and subject to the Code of Military Justice, 14 of 18 considered the members of SDFs to be \\"soldiers\\", 14 of 18 considered SDF personnel to be \\"lawful belligerents\\" under the rules of war, and only 4 of 19 authorized their personnel to conduct firearms training. Almost all of the missions reported to the IG's office were non-military in nature, including small-scale search and rescue, disaster management, and other unarmed, homeland security related-tasks.[21]\\r\\nDue to public fears over the Jade Helm 15 exercises held throughout a number of southwestern states, on April 28, 2015, Gov. Greg Abbott of Texas ordered a call-up of the Texas State Guard to monitor the exercises and facilitate communication between US special operations forces conducting training and the governor's office.[22]\\r\\nA 2003 article in the United States Army War College's Parameters journal recommended that \\"United States Northern Command (NORTHCOM) should ensure that future contingency planning efforts for homeland security operations fully incorporate the valuable capabilities that State Defense Forces can provide.\\" [23] In the decade following that article, however, no significant action has been taken on the recommendation.\\r\\nSeveral bills have been unsuccessfully introduced in Congress since the early 1990s seeking to improve the readiness of state defense forces. The most recent, H.R. 206, introduced in 2009 by Rep. Joe Wilson of South Carolina, would have allowed the U.S. Secretary of Defense to transfer surplus U.S. military equipment to state defense forces. Co-sponsors of the bill included Jim Marshall and Frank Wolf. Congress took no action on the measure before adjourning.[24]\\r\\nIn recent years, state defense forces have focused on retooling their capabilities to be better prepared for future missions by improving their professionalism and interoperability with other agencies. In July 2015, the Virginia Defense Force headed a multi-state communications exercise, the first ever of its kind, where the VDF practiced long-distance radio communications with the Tennessee State Guard, Indiana Guard Reserve, Texas State Guard, and the California State Military Reserve.[25] Further efforts at standardizing training between state defense forces by setting competency requirements have been undertaken by the State Guard Association, which followed its Military Emergency Management Specialist training program with a JAG Academy[26] and an Engineer Specialty Qualification Badge[27], and plans for a Medical Academy in the future.[28]\\r\\nIndividual state defense forces have made efforts to increase their capabilities to be prepared to take on relevant future missions. In March 2017, the California State Military Reserve activated its Maritime Component to lead and assist in future homeland security missions while working in conjunction with other agencies, including the Coast Guard Auxiliary, the California Department of Fish and Wildlife, CalTrans, and other civilian departments.[29] As of May 2017, the Maryland Defense Force has significantly reorganized; the number of available officer billets has been shrunk, and the job descriptions reorganized, in order to avoid having a top-heavy organizational structure. New units, including the Maryland Emergency Management Agency (MEMA) Support Unit, have been approved, and others, such as the MDDF Cyber Unit, have planned expansions. Training standards were also heightened, with the MDDF requiring that drill participation, age, height, and weight requirements be more strictly enforced. Further, all new soldiers are currently required to earn their Military Emergency Management Specialist Badge. These changes were made with the goal that the future MDDF would be able to \\"seamlessly integrate into missions with the National Guard.\\"[30]\\r\\nThere are currently 21 active state defense forces. A 2005 Department of Defense report reported twenty-three active SDFs in the United States and Puerto Rico.[31] Since this time, New Jersey has suspended its State Defense Force.[32] Per Chief National Guard Bureau Instruction 5500.01: \\"The NG will not spend Federal funds, to include pay and allowances, subsistence, transportation, medical care and treatment, or use of Federal equipment for activities with the primary purpose of training or otherwise for the support of SDFs IAW section 109 of reference a.\\"[33]\\r\\nThe Puerto Rico State Guard includes an air support component, the 1st Air Base Group, that support the operations of the Puerto Rico Air National Guard.\\r\\nThe Texas State Guard's Air Component Command supports the Texas Air National Guard and provides Defense Support to Civil Authorities, (DSCA).[34]\\r\\nThe following is a list of active SDFs in the United States and Puerto Rico:\\r\\n* Colorado does not operate an active state defense force, but rather has a statutory state defense force staffed by one individual appointed by the governor.\\r\\nSome state defense forces have minimal enlistment requirements, permitting virtually any citizen under a prescribed age (usually 66) to join, even if they have no previous military experience, or don't meet conventional military physical standards (California, for instance, requires no physical fitness test prior to entry and has weight/height standards significantly more relaxed than the U.S. military).[117] Others, such as Tennessee, will, for certain positions, require an applicant to have been honorably discharged from the U.S. military, or have a professional background in a critical skill such as engineering or medicine.[102]\\r\\nMany state defense forces allow enlistment \\"at will\\" and personnel are under no termed service obligation, unlike most conventional military forces, meaning they can simply quit at any time without facing charges of desertion or Absence Without Leave.\\r\\nTraining standards vary widely, but usually require 15 days of annual drill, compared to the absolute minimum of 38 days (if not more) required of most federal military reserve forces. Unlike the U.S. military, there is generally only a limited period of basic training, often as few as four days for persons with no prior military experience, significantly less than the ten weeks of basic training required, for instance, by the United States Army.\\r\\nThe Military Emergency Management Specialist Badge[118], created by the State Guard Association of the United States has become a common training focal point among state defense forces. Alabama, California, Indiana, Ohio and others have adopted the MEMS Badge as a basic qualification required of all members desiring promotion. Training is conducted both online, and through MEMS academies in each state, and includes course material provided by FEMA and other agencies, as well as practical experience in local disaster planning and exercise management.\\r\\nCommunity Emergency Response Teams (CERTs) are being organized by several SDFs by utilizing training offered by the Federal Emergency Management Agency's Citizen Corps. Some states follow the lead of the Army and offer a permanent tab (worn in a similar manner as the Army's Ranger and Sapper tabs) as an incentive to become certified as part of the local or unit CERT team.\\r\\nState defense forces may incorporate Medical Reserve Corps units into their organizational structure. The 47th Medical Company of the New Mexico State Guard,[119] the 10th Medical Regiment of the Maryland Defense Force,[120] and the Medical Brigade of the Texas State Guard[121] receive training and recognition from the Medical Reserve Corps program sponsored by the Office of the Surgeon General of the United States through the Citizen Corps program, and are simultaneously organized as units of their respective state defense force.\\r\\nWeapons qualification and training is provided in some SDFs. However, most SDFs do not require weapons proficiency. A 2006 report by the U.S. Freedom Foundation, an organization affiliated with the State Guard Association of the United States,[122] recommended minimum standards for state defense forces, including weapons training, but the report has been largely ignored. Some SDFs have laws that in the event of deployment by order of the state legislature and/or governor, they will become armed.\\r\\nMany states organize their state defense force parallel to their National Guard (both Air and Army), having them report to the governor through the state's adjutant general. State defense forces are not funded by the federal government, and in most states members are unpaid. Volunteers have to purchase their own uniforms and most, if not all, of their own equipment.[citation needed]\\r\\nBecause many members of state defense forces are veterans who have retained ranks received from service in the armed forces, some state defense forces have an inflated grade structure. Advocates reply that the grades worn by state defense force members accurately reflect the many years of experience that veterans (often military or naval retirees) bring to the state forces. Some SDF soldiers use the two-letter state abbreviation in parenthesis after their rank to indicate the origin of their grade. For example, a major in the California State Military Reserve would give his or her rank as \\"MAJ (CA).\\" However, numerous states do not practice this notation because many senior commissioned and noncommissioned officers earned their rank while serving at the federal level. Moreover, Army regulations require the service branch title to appear after the rank and name (e.g., COL John S. Smith, CSMR).[citation needed]\\r\\nWhile in the past, many state defense forces were organized as military police brigades or infantry brigades, the experiences of recent events such as Hurricane Katrina has changed attitudes and plans. Civil affairs units and medical units now predominate in some states. Organization levels may be inflated: a battalion may have less than 100 members, and a state defense force brigade may have less than 300 members.\\r\\nAs a general rule, state defense forces wear standard U.S. military uniforms with insignia closely matching those of their federal counterparts. SDF units generally wear red name tags on service uniforms (as specifically prescribed by AR 670-1[123] for SDF units when adopting the Army Service Uniform or Battle Dress Uniform (BDU), and name tapes on Army Combat Uniform (ACU) or BDU uniforms use the state defense force name or state name rather than \\"U.S. Army.\\" Standard U.S. Army branch insignia are often used or a unique \\"state guard\\" branch insignia consisting of a crossed musket and sword is alternatively used.\\r\\nWhere berets are worn, some state defense forces use a beret flash similar to the one the U.S. Army uses, but in bright red thread instead of the Army's blue. Other states have beret flashes based on the state flag. State soldiers in the New York Guard formerly wore a grey beret flash. (Wear of the beret by New York Guard soldiers has been discontinued, replaced by a black patrol cap.)[124]\\r\\nUniforms vary from state to state and tend to have only subtle differences. For example, the Texas State Guard wears standard U.S. Army camouflage uniforms, a state guard unit patch, and the \\"U.S. Army\\" name tape replaced with one reading \\"Texas State Guard.\\" Similarly, the California State Military Reserve wears a uniform identical to their National Guard counterparts except for the unit patch, beret flash, and the \\"California\\" name tape. Outer garments such as a Gore-Tex jacket have a subdued \\"CA\\" beneath the rank insignia.[125] A similar pattern can be found in the New York Guard. The Georgia State Defense Force often works in tandem with and support of federal troops. The Georgia State Defense Force wears the ACU with a unique Georgia SDF red flash on the U.S. Army's black beret and \\"Georgia\\" in place of the \\"U.S. Army\\" uniform name tape. The Tennessee State Guard and Alabama State Defense Force can wear either BDU's or the \\"tactical response uniform\\" (TRU)[126] in the Woodland pattern but whose cut and accouterments match the ACU but cannot mix pieces. The Alabama State Defense Force has also recently introduced a new \\"Standard Service Uniform\\" composed of a blue \\"tactical\\" shirt, and khaki \\"tactical\\" pants.[127]\\r\\nThe few states with both SDF air and naval units wear modified USAF and USN/USMC uniforms. Currently, only Ohio, Alaska and New York have uniformed naval militias. Only California, Texas, Vermont, and Puerto Rico have an air wing, though Indiana formerly had an Air Guard Reserve. In all cases, the state adjutant general has final say on uniforms worn by state defense forces, though federal service regulations generally shape the policies of each state.\\r\\nSDFs include a variety of special units including medical, aviation, and ceremonial units. The following are examples:\\r\\nThe U.S. Constitution, coupled with several statutes and cases, details the relationship of state defense forces to the federal government. Outside of 32 USC 109, the U.S. Supreme Court noted: \\"It is true that the state defense forces 'may not be called, ordered, or drafted into the armed forces.' 32 U.S.C. 109(c). It is nonetheless possible that they are subject to call under 10 U.S.C. 331ÿ333, which distinguish the 'militia' from the 'armed forces,' and which appear to subject all portions of the 'militia' ÿ organized or not ÿ to call if needed for the purposes specified in the Militia Clauses\\" (Perpich v. Department of Defense, 496 U.S. 334 (1990)). The Court, however, explicitly noted that it was not deciding this issue.[142] The following is an extract of the laws which the Court cited as possibly giving the federal government authority to activate the state defense forces:\\r\\n10 USC 331 ÿ \\"Federal aid for State governments\\"\\r\\nWhenever there is an insurrection in any State against its government, the President may, upon the request of its legislature or of its governor if the legislature cannot be convened, call into Federal service such of the militia of the other States, in the number requested by that State, and use such of the armed forces, as he considers necessary to suppress the insurrection.\\r\\n10 USC 332 ÿ \\"Use of militia and armed forces to enforce Federal authority\\"\\r\\nWhenever the President considers that unlawful obstructions, combinations, or assemblages, or rebellion against the authority of the United States, make it impracticable to enforce the laws of the United States in any State or Territory by the ordinary course of judicial proceedings, he may call into Federal service such of the militia of any State, and use such of the armed forces, as he considers necessary to enforce those laws or to suppress the rebellion.\\r\\n10 USC 333 ÿ \\"Interference with State and Federal law\\"\\r\\nThe President, by using the militia or the armed forces, or both, or by any other means, shall take such measures as he considers necessary to suppress, in a State, any insurrection, domestic violence, unlawful combination, or conspiracy, if it -\\r\\n\\r\\n(1) so hinders the execution of the laws of that State, and of the United States within the State, that any part or class of its people is deprived of a right, privilege, immunity, or protection named in the Constitution and secured by law, and the constituted authorities of that State are unable, fail, or refuse to protect that right, privilege, or immunity, or to give that protection; or\\r\\n\\r\\n(2) opposes or obstructs the execution of the laws of the United States or impedes the course of justice under those laws.\\r\\nSome states have state defense forces which are not recognized by their state or the State Guard Association of the United States, but are attempting to receive recognition. These include: the Pennsylvania Military Reserve, which is attempting to reactivate the Pennsylvania State Guard; the North Carolina State Defense Force,[143] as well as the North Carolina State Guard Association,[144][145] the latter being part of the SGAUS North Carolina Chapter which is attempting to reactivate the currently defunct North Carolina State Defense Militia; and also the Florida State Defense Force Reactivation Group,[146] which is attempting to reactivate the Florida State Guard.[147]","input":"Who controls the state police and state militia?"},{"output":"environmental treaty","context":"The Air Quality Agreement is an environmental treaty between Canada and the United States.

Between then and its own merger with Boeing in 1997, it produced a number of well-known commercial and military aircraft such as the DC-10 airliner and F-15 Eagle air-superiority fighter.\\r\\nThe corporation was based at LambertÿSt. Louis International Airport near St. Louis, Missouri, while the headquarters for its subsidiary, the McDonnell Douglas Technical Services Company (MDTSC), were established in unincorporated St. Louis County, Missouri.[2]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe company was formed from the firms of James Smith McDonnell and Donald Wills Douglas in 1967. Both men were of Scottish ancestry, graduates of MIT and had worked for the aircraft manufacturer Glenn L. Martin Company.[3]\\r\\nDouglas had been chief engineer at Martin before leaving to establish Davis-Douglas Company in early 1920 in Los Angeles. He bought out his backer and renamed the firm the Douglas Aircraft Company in 1921.[4]\\r\\nMcDonnell founded J.S. McDonnell & Associates in Milwaukee, Wisconsin in 1926. His idea was to produce a personal aircraft for family use. The economic depression from 1929 ruined his ideas and the company collapsed. He worked at three companies with the final being Glenn Martin Company in 1933. He left Martin in 1938 to try again with his own firm, McDonnell Aircraft Corporation, this time based at Lambert Field, outside St. Louis, Missouri.[5]\\r\\nWorld War II was a major earner for Douglas. The company produced almost 30,000 aircraft (Douglas DC-3) from 1942 to 1945 and the workforce swelled to 160,000. Both companies suffered at the end of hostilities, facing an end of government orders and a surplus of aircraft.\\r\\nAfter the war Douglas continued to develop new aircraft, including the DC-6 in 1946 and the DC-7 in 1953.[6][7] The company moved into jet propulsion, producing its first for the military ÿ the conventional F3D Skyknight in 1948 and then the more 'jet age' F4D Skyray in 1951.[8] In 1955, Douglas introduced the first attack jet of the United States Navy with the A4D Skyhawk.[9] Designed to operate from the decks of the World War II Essex class aircraft carriers, the Skyhawk was small, reliable, and tough. Variants of it continued in use in the Navy for almost 50 years,[10] finally serving in large numbers in a two-seat version as a jet trainer.[11]\\r\\nDouglas also made commercial jets, producing the DC-8 in 1958 to compete with the Boeing 707.[12][13] McDonnell was also developing jets, but being smaller it was prepared to be more radical, building on its successful FH-1 Phantom to become a major supplier to the Navy with the F2H Banshee and F3H Demon; and producing the F-101 Voodoo for the United States Air Force (USAF).[14][15] The Korean War-era Banshee and later the F-4 Phantom II produced during the Vietnam War helped push McDonnell into a major military fighter supply role.[16] Douglas created a series of experimental high-speed jet aircraft in the Skyrocket family, with the Skyrocket DB-II being the first aircraft to travel at twice the speed of sound in 1953.\\r\\nBoth companies were eager to enter the new missile business, Douglas moving from producing air-to-air rockets and missiles to entire missile systems under the 1956 Nike program and becoming the main contractor of the Skybolt ALBM program and the Thor ballistic missile program.[17][18] McDonnell made a number of missiles, including the unusual ADM-20 Quail,[19] as well as experimenting with hypersonic flight, research that enabled it to gain a substantial share of the NASA projects Mercury and Gemini. Douglas also gained contracts from NASA, notably for part of the enormous Saturn V rocket.[20][21]\\r\\nThe two companies were now major employers, but both were having problems. Douglas was strained by the cost of the DC-8 and DC-9, while McDonnell suffered lean times during any downturns in military procurement. The two companies began to sound each other out about a merger. Inquiries began in 1963; Douglas offered bid invitations from December 1966 and accepted that of McDonnell.[22] The two firms were officially merged on April 28, 1967 as the McDonnell Douglas Corporation (MDC).[23] The two companies seemed to be a good fit for each other; McDonnell was primarily a defense contractor while Douglas sold mostly civil aircraft.\\r\\nMcDonnell Douglas retained McDonnell Aircraft's headquarters location at Lambert-St. Louis International Airport, in Berkeley, Missouri,[24][25][26][27] near St. Louis.\\r\\nIn 1967, with the merger of McDonnell and Douglas Aircraft, David Lewis, then president of McDonnell, was named chairman of what was called the Long Beach, Douglas Aircraft Division. At the time of the merger, Douglas Aircraft was estimated to be less than a year from bankruptcy. Flush with orders, the DC-8 and DC-9 aircraft were 9 to 18 months behind schedule, incurring stiff penalties from the airlines. Lewis was active in DC-10 sales in an intense competition with Lockheed's L-1011, a rival tri-jet aircraft.[28][29][30] In two years, Lewis had the operation back on track and in positive cash flow. He returned to the company's St. Louis headquarters where he continued sales efforts on the DC-10 and managed the company as a whole as President and chief operating officer through 1971.\\r\\nThe DC-10 began production in 1968 with the first deliveries in 1971.[31] Several artists impressions exist of an aircraft named the \\"DC-10 Twin\\" or DC-X which McDonnell Douglas considered in the early 1970s but never built.[32][33] This would have been an early twinjet similar to the later Airbus A300, but never progressed to a prototype. This could have given McDonnell Douglas an early lead in the huge twinjet market that subsequently developed, as well as commonality with much of the DC-10's systems.[34]\\r\\nIn 1977, the next generation of DC-9 variants, dubbed the \\"Super 80\\" (later renamed the MD-80) series, was launched.[35]\\r\\nIn 1977, the KC-10 Extender was the second McDonnell Douglas transport aircraft to be selected for use by the US Air Force;[36] the first being the C-9 Nightingale/Skytrain II.\\r\\nThrough the years of the Cold War McDonnell Douglas had introduced and manufactured dozens of successful military aircraft, including the F-15 Eagle in 1974,[37] the F/A-18 Hornet in 1978,[38] and other products such as the Harpoon and Tomahawk missiles. The oil crisis of the 1970s was a serious shock to the commercial aviation industry, as a major manufacturer of commercial aircraft at the time, McDonnell Douglas was hit by the economic shift and forced to contract heavily while diversifying into new areas to reduce the impact of potential future downturns.[citation needed]\\r\\nIn 1984, McDonnell Douglas expanded into helicopters by purchasing Hughes Helicopters from the Summa Corporation for $470?million.[39] Hughes Helicopters was made a subsidiary initially and renamed McDonnell Douglas Helicopter Systems in August 1984.[40] McDonnell Douglas Helicopters's most successful product was the Hughes-designed AH-64 Apache attack helicopter.[41][42]\\r\\nIn 1986, MD-11 was launched, an improved and upgraded version of DC-10.[43][44][45][46] The MD-11 was the most advanced trijet aircraft to be developed. It sold 200 units, but was discontinued in 2001 after the merger with Boeing as it competed with the Boeing 777.[43][47][48][49] The final commercial aircraft design to be made by McDonnell Douglas came in 1988. The MD-90 was a stretched version of the MD-80,[45] equipped with International Aero Engines V2500 turbofans, the largest rear-mounted engines ever on a commercial jet. The MD-95, a modern regional airliner closely resembling the DC-9-30, was the last McDonnell Douglas designed commercial jet produced.[50][51]\\r\\nOn January 13, 1988, McDonnell Douglas and General Dynamics won the US Navy Advanced Tactical Aircraft (ATA) contract. The US$4.83?billion contract was to develop the A-12 Avenger II, a stealth, carrier-based, long-range flying wing attack aircraft that would replace the A-6 Intruder.\\r\\nIn January 1989 Robert Hood was appointed to lead McDonnell Douglas, replacing retiring Worsham. McDonnell Douglas then introduced a major reorganization called the Total Quality Management System (TQMS). TQMS ended the functional setup where engineers with specific expertise in aerodynamics, structural mechanics, materials, and other technical areas worked on several different aircraft. This was replaced by a product-oriented system where they focus on one specific airplane. As part of reorganization, 5,000 managerial and supervisory positions were eliminated at Douglas. The former managers could apply for 2,800 newly created posts; the remaining 2,200 would lose their managerial responsibilities.[52] The reorganization reportedly led to widespread loss of morale at the company and TQMS was nicknamed \\"Time to Quit and Move to Seattle\\" by employees referring to the competitor Boeing headquartered in Seattle, WA.[53]\\r\\nTechnical issues, development cost overruns, growing unit costs, and delays led to the termination of the A-12 Avenger II program on January 13, 1991 by Defense Secretary Dick Cheney. Years of litigation would proceed over the contract's termination: the government claimed that the contractors had defaulted on the contract and were not entitled to the final progress payments, while McDonnell Douglas and General Dynamics believed that the contract was terminated out of convenience and thus the money was owed.[54] The case was contested through litigation until a settlement was reached in January 2014. The chaos and financial stress created by the collapse of the A-12 program led to the layoff of 5,600 employees.[55] The advanced tactical aircraft role vacated by the A-12 debacle would be filled by another McDonnell Douglas program, the F/A-18E/F Super Hornet.[38][56]\\r\\nHowever the purchasing of aircraft was curtailed as the Cold War came to an abrupt end in the 1990s. This curtailment in military procurements combined with the loss of the contracts for two major projects, the Advanced Tactical Fighter and Joint Strike Fighter, severely hurt McDonnell Douglas.[47][57] McDonnell Douglas built only a small wind tunnel test model.[58][59]\\r\\nIn 1991, MD-11 was not quite a success, ongoing tests of the MD-11 revealed a significant shortfall in the aircraft's performance. An important prospective carrier, Singapore Airlines, required a fully laden aircraft that could fly from Singapore to Paris, against strong headwinds during mid-winter; the MD-11 did not have sufficient range for this at the time.[60] Due to the less-than-expected performance figures, Singapore Airlines cancelled its 20-aircraft MD-11 order on August 2, 1991, and ordered 20 A340-300s instead.[61]\\r\\nIn 1992, McDonnell Douglas unveiled a study of a double deck jumbo-sized aircraft designated MD-12.[34][62] Despite briefly leaving the market, the study was perceived as merely a public relations exercise to disguise the fact that MDC was struggling under intense pressure from Boeing and Airbus. It was clear to most in the industry that MDC had neither the resources nor the money to develop such a large aircraft,[63] and the study quickly sank without a trace. A similar double deck concept was used in Boeing's later Ultra-Large Aircraft study intended to replace the 747,[64][65] but ultimately the double deck concept would not see the light of day until the Airbus A380 in the 2000s.[66][67]\\r\\nFollowing Boeing's 1996 acquisition of Rockwell's North American division, McDonnell Douglas merged with Boeing in August 1997 in a US $13 billion stock swap, with Boeing as the surviving company.[1][57] Boeing adopted the McDonnell Douglas logo, which shows the globe being encircled in tribute to the first aerial circumnavigation which was accomplished in 1924 using Douglas aircraft.\\r\\nThe corporation also produced the Sovereign (later M7000) series of systems in the UK, which used the Sovereign operating system developed in the UK and which was not based on Pick, unlike the \\"Reality\\" family of systems listed above. Sovereign, largely a Data Entry solution, had a reasonable market in the United States supporting data entry shops.[68]","input":"When did mcdonnell douglas go out of business?"},{"output":"bio-energy with carbon capture and storage","context":"Carbon dioxide removal (CDR) refers to a number of technologies, the objective of which is the large-scale removal of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere.[1] Among such technologies are bio-energy with carbon capture and storage, biochar, ocean fertilization, enhanced weathering, and direct air capture when combined with storage.[1] CDR is a different approach than removing CO2 from the stack emissions of large fossil fuel point sources, such as power stations. The latter reduces emission to the atmosphere but cannot reduce the amount of carbon dioxide already in the atmosphere. As CDR removes carbon dioxide from the atmosphere, it creates negative emissions, offsetting emissions from small and dispersed point sources such as domestic heating systems, airplanes and vehicle exhausts.[2][3] It is regarded by some as a form of climate engineering,[1] while other commentators describe it as a form of carbon capture and storage or extreme mitigation.[4] Whether CDR would satisfy common definitions of \\"climate engineering\\" or \\"geoengineering\\" usually depends upon the scale on which it would be undertaken.\\r\\nThe likely need for CDR has been publicly expressed by a range of individuals and organizations involved with climate change issues, including IPCC chief Rajendra Pachauri,[5] the UNFCCC executive secretary Christiana Figueres,[6] and the World Watch Institute.[7] Institutions with major programs focusing on CDR include the Lenfest Center for Sustainable Energy at the Earth Institute, Columbia University,[8] and the Climate Decision Making Center,[9] an international collaboration operated out of Carnegie-Mellon University's Department of Engineering and Public Policy.\\r\\nThe mitigation effectiveness of air capture is limited by societal investment, land use, availability of geologic reservoirs, and leakage. The reservoirs are estimated to be sufficient to for storing at least 545 GtC.[10] Storing 771 GtC would cause an 186 ppm atmospheric reduction.[11] In order to return the atmospheric CO2 content to 350 ppm we need atmospheric reduction of 50 ppm plus an additional 2 ppm per year of current emissions.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCarbon dioxide removal is different from reducing emissions, as the former produces an outlet of carbon dioxide from Earth's atmosphere, whereas the latter decreases the inlet of carbon dioxide to the atmosphere. Both have the same net effect, but for achieving carbon dioxide concentration levels below present levels, carbon dioxide removal is critical. Also for meeting higher concentration levels, carbon dioxide removal is increasingly considered to be crucial as it provides the only possibility to fill the gap between needed reductions to meet mitigation targets and global emission trends.\\r\\nIn the OECD Environmental Outlook to 2050 released at the 2011 United Nations Climate Change Conference, the authors commented on the need for negative emissions, stating \\"Achieving lower concentration targets (450 ppm) depends significantly on the use of BECCS\\".\\r\\nA carbon dioxide sink such as a concentrated group of plants or any other primary producer that binds carbon dioxide into biomass, such as within forests and kelp beds, is not carbon negative, as sinks are not permanent. A carbon dioxide sink of this type moves carbon, in the form of carbon dioxide, from the atmosphere or hydrosphere to the biosphere. This process could be undone, for example by wildfires or logging.\\r\\nCarbon dioxide sinks that store carbon dioxide in the Earth's crust by injecting it into the subsurface, or in the form of insoluble carbonate salts (mineral sequestration), are considered carbon negative. This is because they are removing carbon from the atmosphere and sequestering it indefinitely and presumably for a considerable duration (thousands to millions of years). However, Carbon Capture technology remains, at best, theoretical and is yet to reach more than 33% efficiency. Furthermore, this process could be rapidly undone, for example by earthquakes or mining.\\r\\nBio-energy with carbon capture and storage, or BECCS, uses biomass to extract carbon dioxide from the atmosphere, and carbon capture and storage technologies to concentrate and permanently store it in deep geological formations.\\r\\nBECCS is currently (as of October 2012) the only CDR technology deployed at full industrial scale, with 550 000 tonnes CO2/year in total capacity operating, divided between three different facilities (as of January 2012).[12][13][14][15][16]\\r\\nThe Imperial College London, the UK Met Office Hadley Centre for Climate Prediction and Research, the Tyndall Centre for Climate Change Research, the Walker Institute for Climate System Research, and the Grantham Institute for Climate Change issued a joint report on carbon dioxide removal technologies as part of the AVOID: Avoiding dangerous climate change research program, stating that \\"Overall, of the technologies studied in this report, BECCS has the greatest maturity and there are no major practical barriers to its introduction into todays energy system. The presence of a primary product will support early deployment.\\"[17]\\r\\nAccording to the OECD, \\"Achieving lower concentration targets (450 ppm) depends significantly on the use of BECCS\\".[18]\\r\\nBiochar is created by the pyrolysis of biomass, and is under investigation as a method of carbon sequestration. Biochar is a charcoal that is used for agricultural purposes which also aids in carbon sequestration, the capture or hold of carbon. It is created using a process called pyrolysis, which is basically the act of high temperature heating biomass in an environment with low oxygen levels. What remains is a material known as char, similar to charcoal but is made through a sustainable process, thus the use of biomass.[19] Biomass is organic matter produced by living organisms or recently living organisms, most commonly plants or plant based material.[20] The offset of GHG emission, if biochar were to be implemented, would be a maximum of 12%. This equates to about 106 metric tons of CO2 equivalents. On a medium conservative level, it would be 23% less than that, at 82 metric tons.[21] A study done by the UK Biochar Research Center has stated that, on a conservative level, biochar can store 1 gigaton of carbon per year. With greater effort in marketing and acceptance of biochar, the benefit would the storage of 5ÿ9 gigatons per year of carbon in biochar soils.[22]\\r\\nEnhanced weathering refers to chemical approach to remove carbon dioxide involving land or ocean based techniques. Examples of land based enhanced weathering techniques are in-situ carbonation of silicates. Ultramafic rock, for example, has the potential to store thousands of years worth of CO2 emissions according to one estimate.[citation needed] Ocean based techniques involve alkalinity enhancement, such as, grinding, dispersing and dissolving olivine, limestone, silicates, or calcium hydroxide to address ocean acidification and CO2 sequestration. Enhanced weathering is considered as one of the least expensive of geoengineering options. One example of a research project on the feasibility of enhanced weathering is the CarbFix project in Iceland.[citation needed]\\r\\nCarbon dioxide can be removed from ambient air through chemical processes, sequestered, and stored. Traditional modes of carbon capture such as precombustion and postcombustion CO2 capture from large point sources can help slow the rate of increase of the atmospheric CO2 concentration, but only the direct removal of CO2 from the air, or direct air capture (DAC), can actually reduce the global atmospheric CO2 concentration.\\r\\nA few engineering proposals have been made for the more difficult task of removing CO2 from the atmosphere ÿ a form of climate engineering ÿ but work in this area is still in its infancy. [23] Among the main technologies proposed, three of them stand out: Causticization with alkali and alkali-earth hydroxides; [24] Carbonation [25] and Organic?inorganic hybrid sorbents consisting of amines supported in poroous adsorbents. For a review on the most recent research on these areas, see [23]\\r\\nOne proposed method is by so-called artificial trees.[26][27] This concept, proposed by climate scientist Wallace S. Broecker and science writer Robert Kunzig,[28] imagines huge numbers of artificial trees around the world to remove ambient CO2. The technology is now being pioneered by Klaus Lackner, a researcher at the Earth Institute, Columbia University,[29] whose artificial tree technology can suck up to 1,000 times more CO2 from the air than real trees can,[citation needed] at a rate of about one ton of carbon per day if the artificial tree is approximately the size of an actual tree.[30][31] The CO2 would be captured in a filter and then removed from the filter and stored.\\r\\nThe chemistry used is a variant of that described below, as it is based on sodium hydroxide. However, in a more recent design proposed by Klaus Lackner, the process can be carried out at only 40?C by using a polymer-based ion exchange resin, which takes advantage of changes in humidity to prompt the release of captured CO2, instead of using a kiln. This reduces the energy required to operate the process.[32]\\r\\nAnother substance which can be used are Metal-organic frameworks (or MOF's).[33] A special MOF has been made specifically for locking CO2 by Joeri Denayer.[34]\\r\\nIn 2008, the Discovery Channel covered[35] the work of David Keith,[36] of University of Calgary, who built a tower, 4 feet wide and 20 feet tall (1.2G6.1 meters), with a fan at the bottom that sucks air in, which comes out again at the top. In the process, about half the CO2 is removed from the air.\\r\\nThis device uses the chemical process described in detail below. The system demonstrated on the Discovery Channel was a 1/90,000th scale test system of the capture section; the reagents are regenerated in a separate facility. The main costs of a full plant will be the cost to build it, and the energy input to regenerate the chemicals and produce a pure stream of CO2.\\r\\nTo put this into perspective, people in the U.S. emit about 20 tonnes of CO2 per person annually.[citation needed][37] In other words, each person in the U.S. would require a tower like the one featured by the Discovery Channel to remove this amount of CO2 from the air, requiring an annual 2 megawatt-hours of electricity to operate it. By comparison, a refrigerator consumes about 1.2 megawatt-hours annually (2001 figures).[38] But, by combining many small systems such as this into one large system, the construction costs and energy use can be reduced.\\r\\nIt has been proposed that the Solar updraft tower to generate electricity from thermal air currents also be used at the same time for amine gravity scrubbing of CO2.[39] Some heat would be required to regenerate the amine.\\r\\nA similar CO2 scrubber has also been built by Carbon Engineering. Besides simply focusing on capturing the CO2, the company also puts emphasis on reuse of the CO2, for example in the production of fuels, which would thus be carbon-neutral.[40][41]\\r\\nDirect air capture has been proposed as a way of generating carbon-neutral organic chemicals, by harvesting the atmospheric compounds and then using them in the production and synthesis of polymers and fuels.\\r\\nFinally the Swiss-based Climeworks is currently building the first industrial scale direct air capturing plant in Hinwil, Switzerland. Starting in May 2017, the plant is going to scrub about 900 metric tons of CO2 per year using heat from a local waste incineration plant. The CO2 should be sold to a local vegetable growing company.[42]\\r\\nOcean fertilization or ocean nourishment is a type of climate engineering based on the purposeful introduction of nutrients to the upper ocean to increase marine food production and to remove carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. A number of techniques, including fertilization by iron, urea and phosphorus have been proposed.\\r\\nCalcium oxide (quicklime) will absorb CO2 from atmospheric air mixed with steam at 400?C (forming calcium carbonate) and release it at 1,000?C. This process, proposed by A. Steinfeld, can be performed using renewable energy from thermal concentrated solar power.[43] Quicklime is made by heating limestone to release the CO2 within it. Quicklime is mixed with sand for brick building as mortar, where it hardens by absorption of CO2.\\r\\nZeman and Lackner outlined a specific method of air capture using sodium hydroxide.[44] Carbon Engineering, a Calgary, Alberta firm founded in 2009 and partially funded by Bill Gates, is developing a process to capture carbon dioxide using a solution of potassium hydroxide mixed with some water at their pilot plant . They hope to create and sell synthetic fuels at a cost of $100 a ton.[45]\\r\\nAmong the technologies studied for DAC, the use of aqueous hydroxide sorbents is one of the most interesting approaches.[23]\\r\\nThis processes is outlined by Figure 1.\\r\\nThe chemistry of this process is explained in the \\"Sodium Hydroxide\\" section in the carbon dioxide scrubber page. In short, CO2 from the air is chemically dissolved into NaOH(aq) solution as Na2CO3; the Na2CO3 is then reacted with solid Ca(OH)2, which regenerates the solvent and produces CaCO3 crystals; lastly, heat is applied to the CaCO3 crystals to produce pure CO2 gas.[46]\\r\\nAir is pumped through the CO2 absorber as the first step of this process.[46][47] CO2 absorber for DAC are designed either as a counter-current spray tower or as a counter-current thin-falling-film contractor to maximize the contact area between the air and the solvent and thus maximize the absorption driving force.[46][47] The solvent is regenerated in the causticization unit by reacting the Na2CO3 with Ca(OH)2, which also transfers the captured CO2 to the form of CaCO3 solid crystals.[46] A mechanical filter is then used to separate the CaCO3 crystals form the water.[46] Since the crystals come out wet from the filter, they are dried in a steam dryer.[46] Then the dry crystals are heated in a furnace to produce CaO and pure CO2 gas.[46] The CaO is then hydrated to regenerate the Ca(OH)2 used for the causticization reaction.[46] The pure CO2 stream is then compressed and ready to be transported for geologic sequestration, EOR, or other commercial applications.\\r\\n1 M NaOH (aq) is a typical solvent concentration because this concentrations is limited by the causticization reaction that regenerates the solvent it is not too far from the practical maximum of 2 M NaOH.[46] The furnace/kiln can be powered renewably or by burning fuel on-site with pure oxygen produces in an on-site air separation unit.\\r\\nNaOH is economically competitive with other absorbents (e.g. Amines) used for DAC processes.[46] DAC processes are energy intensive.[46][47] Calcination (at the furnace) is the most energy intensive step of this process.[46][47]\\r\\nA crucial issue for CDR methods is their cost, which differs substantially among the different technologies: some of these are not sufficiently developed to perform cost assessments. The American Physical Society estimates the costs for direct air capture to be $600/tonne with optimistic assumptions.[48] The IEA Greenhouse Gas R&D Programme and Ecofys provides an estimate that 3.5 billion tonnes could be removed annually from the atmosphere with BECCS (Bio-Energy with Carbon Capture and Storage) at carbon prices as low as ?50 per tonne,[49] while a report from Biorecro and the Global Carbon Capture and Storage Institute estimates costs \\"below ?100\\" per tonne for large scale BECCS deployment.[4]\\r\\nCDR is slow to act, and requires a long-term political and engineering program to effect.[50] CDR is even slower to take effect on acidified oceans. In a Business as usual concentration pathway, the deep ocean will remain acidified for centuries, and as a consequence many marine species are in danger of extinction.[51]","input":"How to get carbon out of the atmosphere?"},{"output":"Strasbourg, which had the status of a free imperial city in the Holy Roman Empire of the German Nation","context":"Johann Carolus (1575?1634) was a German publisher of the first newspaper, called Relation aller Frnemmen und gedenckwrdigen Historien (Account of all distinguished and commemorable news).

The German-language newspaper was published in Strasbourg, which had the status of a free imperial city in the Holy Roman Empire of the German Nation.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nJohann Carolus was born in 1575 in Muhlbach-sur-Munster in the Holy Roman Empire of the German Nation. He was the son of a priest and his wife.

The test was initially voluntary to avoid a rush of candidates until 1 June 1935 when all people who had started to drive on or after 1 April 1934 needed to have passed the test.[9]\\r\\nTesting was suspended during World War II,[9] and was suspended again during the Suez Crisis in 1956 to allow examiners help to administer petrol rations.[9]\\r\\nThe driving theory test was introduced in July 1996 as a written examination, which was updated to computerised format in 2000.[9]\\r\\nThe hazard perception segment of the theory test, was introduced in November 2002.\\r\\nIn January 2015, new CGI clips replaced the real-life video clips in the Hazard Perception Test.[10]\\r\\nCurrently, there are two tests (for a car licence) that need to be passed in order to obtain a full driving licence. First the theory test and then, within two years of passing this, the practical test.\\r\\nThe theory test is made up of two parts, both of which differ according to the type of vehicle licence the candidate is pursuing:\\r\\nBoth parts must be passed in order to obtain a theory test pass certificate. This enables the candidate to book a practical driving test.[6] Candidates have two years from the date that they passed the first part of their theory test to take their practical test, or they will have to pass both parts of the theory test once again before they can book a practical test.\\r\\nThis part of the theory test is performed on a computer system. The test has 50 multiple choice questions and the candidate must answer at least 43 of them correctly to pass.[11] All questions are randomly selected from a bank of just under one thousand on a selection of topics.\\r\\nThe test lasts for 57 minutes although candidates with certain special needs can apply for more time.[12] All 50 questions must be answered. The test allows 15 minutes practice time at the start of the exam to get used to answering the questions and how to use the system. To answer a question the candidate simply touches their choice of answer from the listed answers on the computer screen. If a mistake is made the candidate can deselect a choice and reselect a different option. The candidate is allowed to go back to a question at any time and can also flag questions they are unsure of in order to find and return to it quickly and easily later.[11] To pass the test, 43 of the 50 questions (86%) must be answered correctly.[6]\\r\\nFor lorry and bus drivers, 100 questions are asked over a 115-minute period, and 85 out of 100 must be answered correctly to pass.\\r\\nPrior to 3 September 2007, the car and motorcycle multiple-choice tests comprised 35 questions, with a pass mark of 30 within a 40-minute time limit.\\r\\nCandidates watch fourteen one-minute clips (nineteen clips for lorry and bus candidates) filmed from the perspective of a car driver or motorcyclist and have to indicate, usually by clicking a mouse button or touching the screen, when they observe a developing hazard.[13]\\r\\nUnless one is converting a foreign licence, it is necessary to have passed both components of the theory test before sitting this exam.[14] Passing the practical test then entitles one to hold a full UK driving licence.[1]\\r\\nThe test candidate must produce their provisional licence for the examiner before the test starts.\\r\\nThe practical car test can be taken in either a manual or an automatic car; if the test is passed in an automatic car, then the full licence granted will be restricted to automatic cars only.\\r\\nThe practical motorcycle test is split into two separate modules - the off-road module and the on-road module. To get a full motorcycle licence, the candidate needs to pass both modules. The target waiting time for a practical driving test is six weeks. However, in practice the waiting time can be considerably longer.[15]\\r\\nThe practical car test is taken on the road, with a professionally trained DVSA examiner directing the candidate around a pre-determined route. The examiner marks the candidate for driving faults, serious faults, and dangerous faults. A candidate will fail the test if he or she accumulates any serious or dangerous faults, or more than fifteen driving faults. If a candidate accumulates several driving faults in the same category, the examiner may consider the fault habitual and mark a serious fault in that category. The test usually lasts 38 to 40 minutes in a standard test, or approximately 70 minutes when the candidate is taking an extended test after having had their licence revoked.[16]\\r\\nBefore getting to the car, the examiner will ask the candidate to read a car's number plate at a distance. The distance required is 20.5 metres for an old-style plate (A123 ABC) and 20 metres for a new style plate (AB51 ABC).[17] If the candidate needs glasses to do this, then they must be worn during the test. If the candidate fails to read the first number plate correctly, then the examiner asks the candidate to read a second number plate. If the candidate cannot correctly read the second number plate, then the examiner must use a tape measure to measure the correct distance between the candidate and a third number plate. If the candidate cannot read the third number plate, then the candidate is deemed to have failed and the test will not continue.\\r\\nBefore the candidate is taken out onto the road, the examiner asks two questions about car maintenance and safety. These are phrased in the form \\"Show me...\\" and \\"Tell me...\\"; as such, this component of the test is often known as \\"Show me, tell me\\". For example:\\r\\nA failure to answer one or both of these questions correctly would result in a driving fault being marked against the candidate. The questions that may be asked are changed from time to time. From July 2008, there are 19 different questions which can be asked in 13 different combinations.[18]\\r\\nThe controlled stop, more commonly referred to as the \\"emergency stop\\", is an exercise which determines the ability of the candidate to stop the vehicle promptly yet under control during a simulated emergency. The simulation is performed by the examiner raising his or her hand and saying, \\"STOP!\\". A controlled stop exercise will be carried out on every extended test and one third of normal tests. This might be an emergency stop, or the candidate might be asked to make a controlled stop in a specific location.[16] During dangerous weather conditions, such as rain and snow, this test can be left out for safety reasons.\\r\\nDuring the test, the examiner will ask the candidate to carry out one manoeuvre from the following list:[19]\\r\\nThis change from two manoeuvres to one was introduced to allow time for the independent driving section of the test that was introduced on 4 October 2010.\\r\\nManoeuvres are selected at random by the examiner depending on the route chosen and conditions on the route.\\r\\nGenerally, the candidate must demonstrate an ability to drive in various road and traffic conditions [20] and react appropriately in actual risk situations.[19] The conditions typically encountered on test include driving in urban areas as well as higher speed limit roads where possible; this includes dual carriageways but not motorways as motorways in Britain can only be used by full licence holders. The object of the test is to ensure that the candidate is well grounded in the basic principles of safe driving, and is sufficiently practised in them to be able to show, at the time of the test, that they are a competent and considerate driver and are not a source of danger to themselves or to other road users. The drive will include two or three normal stops at (and moving away from) the side of the road on level roads as well as on gradients, in addition to a demonstration of moving away from behind a stationary vehicle.[16] The regulations state that the on-road driving time must be no less than 30 minutes.[21] If at any point during the test, the examiner has to intervene with any controls, this will usually result in failure and could be marked on the test report as a dangerous fault.\\r\\nThe test includes a 10-minute section of independent driving. It is included in the following practical driving tests:\\r\\nDuring the independent driving section, candidates have to drive by:\\r\\nTo help candidates understand where they are to go, the examiner may show them a route diagram. It does not matter if candidates do not remember every direction, nor if they deviate from the intended route unless they commit a driving fault.\\r\\nIf there are poor or obscured traffic signs, the examiner will give the candidate directions until they can see the next traffic sign. Candidates will not need to have a detailed knowledge of the area, but will not be allowed to use Automotive navigation system for this part of the test.\\r\\nIf the candidate has special needs, the examiner will be able to make reasonable adjustments. For the independent driving section, this could be asking the candidate which method they prefer - following signs, or a series of directions (a maximum of three) [22]\\r\\nAs of 4th December 2017\\r\\nThe U.K driving test will change, all the relevant changes can be found here driving test or read this article [23]on the new changes being made.","input":"When were driving licences introduced in the uk?"},{"output":"March 31, 1949","context":"","input":"When did newfoundland become a part of canada?"},{"output":"Jupiter and Saturn","context":"A gas giant is a giant planet composed mainly of hydrogen and helium. Jupiter and Saturn are the gas giants of the Solar System. The term \\"gas giant\\" was originally synonymous with \\"giant planet\\", but in the 1990s it became known that Uranus and Neptune are really a distinct class of giant planet, being composed mainly of heavier volatile substances (which are referred to as \\"ices\\"). For this reason, Uranus and Neptune are now often classified in the separate category of ice giants.\\r\\nJupiter and Saturn consist mostly of hydrogen and helium, with heavier elements making up between 3 and 13 percent of the mass.[1] They are thought to consist of an outer layer of molecular hydrogen surrounding a layer of liquid metallic hydrogen, with probably a molten rocky core. The outermost portion of their hydrogen atmosphere is characterized by many layers of visible clouds that are mostly composed of water and ammonia. The layer of metallic hydrogen makes up the bulk of each planet, and is referred to as \\"metallic\\" because the very large pressure turns hydrogen into an electrical conductor. The gas giants' cores are thought to consist of heavier elements at such high temperatures (20,000 K) and pressures that their properties are poorly understood.[1]\\r\\nThe defining differences between a very low-mass brown dwarf and a gas giant (estimated at about 13 Jupiter masses) are debated.[2] One school of thought is based on formation; the other, on the physics of the interior.[2] Part of the debate concerns whether \\"brown dwarfs\\" must, by definition, have experienced nuclear fusion at some point in their history.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe term gas giant was coined in 1952 by the science fiction writer James Blish[3] and was originally used to refer to all giant planets. It is, arguably, something of a misnomer because throughout most of the volume of all giant planets, the pressure is so high that matter is not in gaseous form.[4] Other than solids in the core and the upper layers of the atmosphere, all matter is above the critical point, where there is no distinction between liquids and gases. The term has nevertheless caught on, because planetary scientists typically use \\"rock\\", \\"gas\\", and \\"ice\\" as shorthands for classes of elements and compounds commonly found as planetary constituents, irrespective of what phase the matter may appear in. In the outer Solar System, hydrogen and helium are referred to as \\"gases\\"; water, methane, and ammonia as \\"ices\\"; and silicates and metals as \\"rock\\". Because Uranus and Neptune are primarily composed of, in this terminology, ices, not gas, they are increasingly referred to as ice giants and separated from the gas giants.\\r\\nGas giants can, theoretically, be divided into five distinct classes according to their modeled physical atmospheric properties, and hence their appearance: ammonia clouds (I), water clouds (II), cloudless (III), alkali-metal clouds (IV), and silicate clouds (V). Jupiter and Saturn are both class I. Hot Jupiters are class IV or V.\\r\\nA cold hydrogen-rich gas giant more massive than Jupiter but less than about 500?M? (1.6?MJ) will only be slightly larger in volume than Jupiter.[5] For masses above 500?M?, gravity will cause the planet to shrink (see degenerate matter).[5]\\r\\nKelvinÿHelmholtz heating can cause a gas giant to radiate more energy than it receives from its host star.[6][7]\\r\\nAlthough the words \\"gas\\" and \\"giant\\" are often combined, hydrogen planets need not be as large as the familiar gas giants from the Solar System. However, smaller gas planets and planets closer to their star will lose atmospheric mass more quickly via hydrodynamic escape than larger planets and planets farther out.[8][9]\\r\\nA gas dwarf could be defined as a planet with a rocky core that has accumulated a thick envelope of hydrogen, helium and other volatiles, having as result a total radius between 1.7 and 3.9 Earth-radii.[10][11]\\r\\nThe smallest known extrasolar planet that is likely a \\"gas planet\\" is Kepler-138d, which has the same mass as Earth but is 60% larger and therefore has a density that indicates a thick gas envelope.[12]\\r\\nA low-mass gas planet can still have a radius resembling that of a gas giant if it has the right temperature.[13]\\r\\nSolar System?L Local Interstellar Cloud?L Local Bubble?L Gould Belt?L Orion Arm?L Milky Way?L Milky Way subgroup?L Local Group?L Virgo Supercluster?L Laniakea Supercluster?L PiscesÿCetus Supercluster Complex?L Observable universe?L Universe\\r\\nEach arrow (L) may be read as \\"within\\" or \\"part of\\".","input":"What planet is the big blue gas planet?"},{"output":"510 BC","context":"Classical Greece was a period of around 200 years (5th and 4th centuries BC) in Greek culture.[1] This Classical period saw the annexation of much of modern-day Greece by the Persian Empire[2] and its subsequent independence. Classical Greece had a powerful influence on the Roman Empire and on the foundations of western civilization. Much of modern Western politics, artistic thought (architecture, sculpture), scientific thought, theatre, literature, and philosophy derives from this period of Greek history. In the context of the art, architecture, and culture of Ancient Greece, the Classical period[3] corresponds to most of the 5th and 4th centuries BC (the most common dates being the fall of the last Athenian tyrant in 510 BC and the death of Alexander the Great in 323 BC). The Classical period in this sense follows the Archaic period and is in turn succeeded by the Hellenistic period.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThis century is essentially studied from the Athenian outlook because Athens has left us more narratives, plays, and other written works than the other ancient Greek states. From the perspective of Athenian culture in Classical Greece, the period generally referred to as the 5th century BC extends slightly into the 4th century BC. In this context, one might consider that the first significant event of this century occurs in 508 BC, with the fall of the last Athenian tyrant and Cleisthenes' reforms. However, a broader view of the whole Greek world might place its beginning at the Ionian Revolt of 500 BC, the event that provoked the Persian invasion of 492 BC. The Persians were defeated in 490 BC. A second Persian attempt, in 481-479 BC, failed as well, despite having overrun much of modern-day Greece (north of the Isthmus of Corinth) at a crucial point during the war following the Battle of Thermopylae and the Battle of Artemisium.[2][4] The Delian League then formed, under Athenian hegemony and as Athens' instrument. Athens' excesses caused several revolts among the allied cities, all of which were put down by force, but Athenian dynamism finally awoke Sparta and brought about the Peloponnesian War in 431 BC. After both forces were spent, a brief peace came about; then the war resumed to Sparta's advantage. Athens was definitively defeated in 404 BC, and internal Athenian agitations mark the end of the 5th century BC in Greece.\\r\\nSince its beginning, Sparta had been ruled by a diarchy. This meant that Sparta had two kings ruling concurrently throughout its entire history. The two kingships were both hereditary, vested in the Agiad dynasty and the Eurypontid dynasty. According to legend, the respective hereditary lines of these two dynasties sprang from Eurysthenes and Procles, twin descendants of Hercules. They were said to have conquered Sparta two generations after the Trojan War.\\r\\nIn 510 BC, Spartan troops helped the Athenians overthrow their king, the tyrant Hippias, son of Peisistratos. Cleomenes I, king of Sparta, put in place a pro-Spartan oligarchy headed by Isagoras. But his rival Cleisthenes, with the support of the middle class and aided by democrats, took over. Cleomenes intervened in 508 and 506 BC, but could not stop Cleisthenes, now supported by the Athenians. Through Cleisthenes' reforms, the people endowed their city with isonomic institutions  equal rights for all citizens (though only men were citizens)and established ostracism.\\r\\nThe isonomic and isegoric (equal freedom of speech)[5] democracy was first organized into about 130 demes, which became the basic civic element. The 10,000 citizens exercised their power as members of the assembly (?ٰҿ?ϫ, ekklesia), headed by a council of 500 citizens chosen at random.\\r\\nThe city's administrative geography was reworked, in order to create mixed political groups: not federated by local interests linked to the sea, to the city, or to farming, whose decisions (e.g. a declaration of war) would depend on their geographical position. The territory of the city was also divided into thirty trittyes as follows:\\r\\nA tribe consisted of three trittyes, selected at random, one from each of the three groups. Each tribe therefore always acted in the interest of all three sectors.\\r\\nIt was this corpus of reforms that allowed the emergence of a wider democracy in the 460s and 450s BC.\\r\\nIn Ionia (the modern Aegean coast of Turkey), the Greek cities, which included great centres such as Miletus and Halicarnassus, were unable to maintain their independence and came under the rule of the Persian Empire in the mid-6th century BC. In 499 BC that region's Greeks rose in the Ionian Revolt, and Athens and some other Greek cities sent aid, but were quickly forced to back down after defeat in 494 BC at the Battle of Lade. Asia Minor returned to Persian control.\\r\\nIn 492 BC, the Persian general Mardonius led a campaign through Thrace and Macedonia. He was victorious and again subjugated the former and conquered the latter,[6] but he was wounded and forced to retreat back into Asia Minor. In addition, a fleet of around 1,200 ships that accompanied Mardonius on the expedition was wrecked by a storm off the coast of Mount Athos. Later, the generals Artaphernes and Datis led a successful naval expedition against the Aegean islands.\\r\\nIn 490 BC, Darius the Great, having suppressed the Ionian cities, sent a Persian fleet to punish the Greeks. (Historians are uncertain about their number of men; accounts vary from 18,000 to 100,000.) They landed in Attica intending to take Athens, but were defeated at the Battle of Marathon by a Greek army of 9,000 Athenian hoplites and 1,000 Plataeans led by the Athenian general Miltiades. The Persian fleet continued to Athens but, seeing it garrisoned, decided not to attempt an assault.\\r\\nIn 480 BC, Darius' successor Xerxes I sent a much more powerful force of 300,000 by land, with 1,207 ships in support, across a double pontoon bridge over the Hellespont. This army took Thrace, before descending on Thessaly and Boeotia, whilst the Persian navy skirted the coast and resupplied the ground troops. The Greek fleet, meanwhile, dashed to block Cape Artemision. After being delayed by Leonidas I, the Spartan king of the Agiad Dynasty, at the Battle of Thermopylae (a battle made famous by the 300 Spartans who faced the entire Persian army), Xerxes advanced into Attica, and captured and burned Athens. The subsequent Battle of Artemisium resulted in the capture of Euboea, bringing most of mainland Greece north of the Isthmus of Corinth under Persian control.[2][4] However, the Athenians had evacuated the city of Athens by sea before Thermopylae, and under the command of Themistocles, they defeated the Persian fleet at the Battle of Salamis.\\r\\nIn 483 BC, during the period of peace between the two Persian invasions, a vein of silver ore had been discovered in the Laurion (a small mountain range near Athens), and the hundreds of talents mined there were used to build 200 warships to combat Aeginetan piracy. A year later, the Greeks, under the Spartan Pausanias, defeated the Persian army at Plataea. The Persians then began to withdraw from Greece, and never attempted an invasion again.\\r\\nThe Athenian fleet then turned to chasing the Persians from the Aegean Sea, defeating their fleet decisively in the Battle of Mycale; then in 478 BC the fleet captured Byzantium. At that time Athens enrolled all the island states and some mainland ones into an alliance called the Delian League, so named because its treasury was kept on the sacred island of Delos. The Spartans, although they had taken part in the war, withdrew into isolation afterwards, allowing Athens to establish unchallenged naval and commercial power.\\r\\nIn 431 BC war broke out between Athens and Sparta. The war was a struggle not merely between two city-states but rather between two coalitions, or leagues of city-states:[7] the Delian League, led by Athens, and the Peloponnesian League, led by Sparta.\\r\\nThe Delian League grew out of the need to present a unified front of all Greek city-states against Persian aggression. In 481 BC, Greek city-states, including Sparta, met in the first of a series of \\"congresses\\" that strove to unify all the Greek city-states against the danger of another Persian invasion.[8] The coalition that emerged from the first congress was named the \\"Hellenic League\\" and included Sparta. Persia, under Xerxes, invaded Greece in September 481 BC, but the Athenian navy defeated the Persian navy. The Persian land forces were delayed in 480 BC by a much smaller force of 300 Spartans, 400 Thebans and 700 men from Boeotian Thespiae at the Battle of Thermopylae.[9] The Persians left Greece in 479 BC after their defeat at Plataea.[10]\\r\\nPlataea was the final battle of Xerxes' invasion of Greece. After this, the Persians never again tried to invade Greece. With the disappearance of this external threat, cracks appeared in the united front of the Hellenic League.[11] In 477, Athens became the recognised leader of a coalition of city-states that did not include Sparta. This coalition met and formalized their relationship at the holy city of Delos.[12] Thus, the League took the name \\"Delian League\\". Its formal purpose was to liberate Greek cities still under Persian control.[13] However, it became increasingly apparent that the Delian League was really a front for Athenian imperialism throughout the Aegean.[14]\\r\\nA competing coalition of Greek city-states centred around Sparta arose, and became more important as the external Persian threat subsided. This coalition is known as the Peloponnesian League. However, unlike the Hellenic League and the Delian League, this league was not a response to any external threat, Persian or otherwise: it was unabashedly an instrument of Spartan policy aimed at Sparta's security and Spartan dominance over the Peloponnese peninsula.[15] The term \\"Peloponnesian League\\" is a misnomer. It was not really a \\"league\\" at all. Nor was it really \\"Peloponnesian\\".[15] There was no equality at all between the members, as might be implied by the term \\"league\\". Furthermore, most of its members were located outside the Peloponnese Peninsula.[15] The terms \\"Spartan League\\" and \\"Peloponnesian League\\" are modern terms. Contemporaries instead referred to \\"Lacedaemonians and their Allies\\" to describe the \\"league\\".[15]\\r\\nThe league had its origins in Sparta's conflict with Argos, another city on the Peloponnese Peninsula. In the 7th century BC, Argos dominated the peninsula. Even in the early 6th century, the Argives attempted to control the northeastern part of the peninsula. The rise of Sparta in the 6th century brought Sparta into conflict with Argos. However, with the conquest of the Peloponnesian city-state of Tegea in 550 BC and the defeat of the Argives in 546 BC, the Spartans' control began to reach well beyond the borders of Laconia.\\r\\nAs the two coalitions grew, their separate interests kept coming into conflict. Under the influence of King Archidamus II (the Eurypontid king of Sparta from 476 BC through 427 BC), Sparta, in the late summer or early autumn of 446 BC, concluded the Thirty Years Peace with Athens. This treaty took effect the next winter in 445 BC[16] Under the terms of this treaty, Greece was formally divided into two large power zones.[17] Sparta and Athens agreed to stay within their own power zone and not to interfere in the other's. Despite the Thirty Years Peace, it was clear that war was inevitable.[18] As noted above, at all times during its history down to 221 BC, Sparta was a \\"diarchy\\" with two kings ruling the city-state concurrently. One line of hereditary kings was from the Eurypontid Dynasty while the other king was from the Agiad Dynasty. With the signing of the Thirty Years Peace treaty Archidamus II felt he had successfully prevented Sparta from entering into a war with its neighbours.[19] However, the strong war party in Sparta soon won out and in 431 BC Archidamus was forced to go to war with the Delian League. However, in 427 BC, Archidamus II died and his son, Agis II succeeded to the Eurypontid throne of Sparta.[20]\\r\\nThe immediate causes of the Peloponnesian War vary from account to account. However three causes are fairly consistent among the ancient historians, namely Thucydides and Plutarch. Prior to the war, Corinth and one of its colonies, Corcyra (modern-day Corfu), went to war in 435 BC over the new Corcyran colony of Epidamnus.[21] Sparta refused to become involved in the conflict and urged an arbitrated settlement of the struggle.[22] In 433 BC, Corcyra sought Athenian assistance in the war. Corinth was known to be a traditional enemy of Athens. However, to further encourage Athens to enter the conflict, Corcyra pointed out how useful a friendly relationship with Corcyra would be, given the strategic locations of Corcyra itself and the colony of Epidamnus on the east shore of the Adriatic Sea.[23] Furthermore, Corcyra promised that Athens would have the use of Corcyra's navy, the third-largest in Greece. This was too good of an offer for Athens to refuse. Accordingly, Athens signed a defensive alliance with Corcyra.\\r\\nThe next year, in 432 BC, Corinth and Athens argued over control of Potidaea (near modern-day Nea Potidaia), eventually leading to an Athenian siege of Potidaea.[24] In 434-433 BC Athens issued the \\"Megarian Decrees\\", a series of decrees that placed economic sanctions on the Megarian people.[25] The Peloponnesian League accused Athens of violating the Thirty Years Peace through all of the aforementioned actions, and, accordingly, Sparta formally declared war on Athens.\\r\\nMany historians consider these to be merely the immediate causes of the war. They would argue that the underlying cause was the growing resentment on the part of Sparta and its allies at the dominance of Athens over Greek affairs. The war lasted 27 years, partly because Athens (a naval power) and Sparta (a land-based military power) found it difficult to come to grips with each other.\\r\\nSparta's initial strategy was to invade Attica, but the Athenians were able to retreat behind their walls. An outbreak of plague in the city during the siege caused many deaths, including that of Pericles. At the same time the Athenian fleet landed troops in the Peloponnesus, winning battles at Naupactus (429) and Pylos (425). However, these tactics could bring neither side a decisive victory. After several years of inconclusive campaigning, the moderate Athenian leader Nicias concluded the Peace of Nicias (421).\\r\\nIn 418 BC, however, conflict between Sparta and the Athenian ally Argos led to a resumption of hostilities. Alcibiades was one of the most influential voices in persuading the Athenians to ally with Argos against the Spartans.[26] At the Mantinea Sparta defeated the combined armies of Athens and her allies. Accordingly, Argos and the rest of the Peloponnesus was brought back under the control of Sparta.[26] The return of peace allowed Athens to be diverted from meddling in the affairs of the Peloponnesus and to concentrate on building up the empire and putting their finances in order. Soon trade recovered and tribute began, once again, rolling into Athens.[26] A strong \\"peace party\\" arose, which promoted avoidance of war and continued concentration on the economic growth of the Athenian Empire. Concentration on the Athenian Empire, however, brought Athens into conflict with another Greek state.\\r\\nEver since the formation of the Delian League in 477 BC, the island of Melos had refused to join. By refusing to join the League, however, Melos reaped the benefits of the League without bearing any of the burdens.[27] In 425 BC, an Athenian army under Cleon attacked Melos to force the island to join the Delian League. However, Melos fought off the attack and was able to maintain its neutrality.[27] Further conflict was inevitable and in the spring of 416 BC the mood of the people in Athens was inclined toward military adventure. The island of Melos provided an outlet for this energy and frustration for the military party. Furthermore, there appeared to be no real opposition to this military expedition from the peace party. Enforcement of the economic obligations of the Delian League upon rebellious city-states and islands was a means by which continuing trade and prosperity of Athens could be assured. Melos alone among all the Cycladic Islands located in the south-west Aegean Sea had resisted joining the Delian League.[27] This continued rebellion provided a bad example to the rest of the members of the Delian League.\\r\\nThe debate between Athens and Melos over the issue of joining the Delian League is presented by Thucydides in his Melian Dialogue.[28] The debate did not in the end resolve any of the differences between Melos and Athens and Melos was invaded in 416 BC, and soon occupied by Athens. This success on the part of Athens whetted the appetite of the people of Athens for further expansion of the Athenian Empire.[29] Accordingly, the people of Athens were ready for military action and tended to support the military party, led by Alcibiades.\\r\\nThus, in 415 BC, Alcibiades found support within the Athenian Assembly for his position when he urged that Athens launch a major expedition against Syracuse, a Peloponnesian ally in Sicily.[30] Segesta, a town in Sicily, had requested Athenian assistance in their war with another Sicilian town? the town of Selinus. Although Nicias was a sceptic about the Sicilian Expedition, he was appointed along with Alcibiades to lead the expedition.[31]\\r\\nHowever, unlike the expedition against Melos, the citizens of Athens were deeply divided over Alcibiades' proposal for an expedition to far-off Sicily. In June 415 BC, on the very eve of the departure of the Athenian fleet for Sicily, a band of vandals in Athens defaced the many statues of the god Hermes that were scattered throughout the city of Athens.[32] This action was blamed on Alcibiades and was seen as a bad omen for the coming campaign.[33] In all likelihood, the coordinated action against the statues of Hermes was the action of the peace party.[34] Having lost the debate on the issue, the peace party was desperate to weaken Alcibiades' hold on the people of Athens. Successfully blaming Alcibiades for the action of the vandals would have weakened Alcibiades and the war party in Athens. Furthermore, it is unlikely that Alcibiades would have deliberately defaced the statues of Hermes on the very eve of his departure with the fleet. Such defacement could only have been interpreted as a bad omen for the expedition that he had long advocated.\\r\\nEven before the fleet reached Sicily, word arrived to the fleet that Alcibiades was to be arrested and charged with sacrilege of the statues of Hermes, prompting Alcibiades to flee to Sparta.[35] When the fleet later landed in Sicily and the battle was joined, the expedition was a complete disaster. The entire expeditionary force was lost and Nicias was captured and executed. This was one of the most crushing defeats in the history of Athens.\\r\\nMeanwhile, Alcibiades betrayed Athens and became a chief advisor to the Spartans and began to counsel them on the best way to defeat his native land. Alcibiades persuaded the Spartans to begin building a real navy for the first time? large enough to challenge the Athenian superiority at sea. Additionally, Alcibiades persuaded the Spartans to ally themselves with their traditional foes? the Persians. As noted below, Alcibiades soon found himself in controversy in Sparta when he was accused of having seduced Timaea, the wife of Agis II, the Eurypontid king of Sparta.[20] Accordingly, Alcibiades was required to flee from Sparta and seek the protection of the Persian Court.\\r\\nIn the Persian court, Alcibiades now betrayed both[clarification needed] by helping Sparta build a navy commensurate with the Athenian navy. Alcibiades advised that a victory of Sparta over Athens was not in the best interest of the Persian Empire. Rather, long and continuous warfare between Sparta and Athens would weaken both city-states and allow the Persians to dominate the Greek peninsula.\\r\\nAmong the war party in Athens, a belief arose that the catastrophic defeat of the military expedition to Sicily in 415 - 413 could have been avoided if Alcibiades had been allowed to lead the expedition. Thus, despite his treacherous flight to Sparta and his collaboration with Sparta and later with the Persian court, there arose a demand among the war party that Alcibiades be allowed to return to Athens without being arrested. Alcibiades negotiated with his supporters on the Athenian-controlled island of Samos. Alcibiades felt that \\"radical democracy\\" was his worst enemy. Accordingly, he asked his supporters to initiate a coup to establish an oligarchy in Athens. If the coup were successful Alcibiades promised to return to Athens In 411, a successful oligarchic coup was mounted in Athens, by a group which became known as \\"the 400\\". However, a parallel attempt by the 400 to overthrow democracy in Samos failed. Alcibiades was immediately made an admiral (navarch) in the Athenian navy. Later, due to democratic pressures, the 400 were replaced by a broader oligarchy called \\"the 5000\\". Alcibiades did not immediately return to Athens. In early 410, Alcibiades led an Athenian fleet of 18 triremes against the Persian-financed Spartan fleet at Abydos near the Hellespont. The Battle of Abydos had actually begun before the arrival of Alcibiades, and had been inclining slightly toward the Athenians. However, with the arrival of Alcibiades, the Athenian victory over the Spartans became a rout. Only the approach of nightfall and the movement of Persian troops to the coast where the Spartans had beached their ships saved the Spartan navy from total destruction.\\r\\nFollowing Alcibiades' advice, the Persian Empire had been playing Sparta and Athens off against each other. However, as weak as the Spartan navy was after the Battle of Abydos, the Persian navy directly assisted the Spartans. Alcibiades then pursued and met the combined Spartan and Persian fleets at the Battle of Cyzicus later in the spring of 410, achieving a significant victory.\\r\\nSparta then built a fleet, with the financial help of the Persians, to challenge Athenian naval supremacy, and found a new military leader in Lysander, who attacked Abydos and seized the strategic initiative by occupying the Hellespont, the source[clarification needed] of Athens' grain imports.[36] Threatened with starvation, Athens sent its last remaining fleet to confront Lysander, but he decisively defeated it at Aegospotami (405 BC). The loss of her fleet threatened Athens with bankruptcy. In 404 BC Athens sued for peace, and Sparta dictated a predictably stern settlement: Athens lost her city walls, her fleet, and all of her overseas possessions. Lysander abolished the democracy and appointed in its place an oligarchy called the \\"Thirty Tyrants\\" to govern Athens.\\r\\nMeanwhile, in Sparta, Timaea gave birth to a child. The child was given the name Leotychidas, after the great grandfather of Agis II? King Leotychidas of Sparta. However, because of Timaea's alleged affair with Alcibiades, it was widely rumoured that the young Leotychidas was fathered by Alcibiades.[20] Indeed, Agis II refused to acknowledge Leotychidas as his son until he relented, in front of witnesses, on his deathbed in 400 BC.[37]\\r\\nUpon the death of Agis II, Leotychidas attempted to claim the Eurypontid throne for himself, but this was met with an outcry, led by Lysander, who was at the height of his influence in Sparta.[37] Lysander argued that Leotychidas was a bastard and could not inherit the Eurypontid throne;[37] instead he backed the hereditary claim of Agesilaus, son of Agis by another wife. With Lysander's support, Agesilaus became the Eurypontid king as Agesilaus II, expelled Leotychidas from the country, and took over all of Agis' estates and property.\\r\\nThe end of the Peloponnesian War left Sparta the master of Greece, but the narrow outlook of the Spartan warrior elite did not suit them to this role.[38] Within a few years the democratic party regained power in Athens and in other cities. In 395 BC the Spartan rulers removed Lysander from office, and Sparta lost her naval supremacy. Athens, Argos, Thebes, and Corinth, the latter two former Spartan allies, challenged Sparta's dominance in the Corinthian War, which ended inconclusively in 387 BC. That same year Sparta shocked the Greeks by concluding the Treaty of Antalcidas with Persia. The agreement turned over the Greek cities of Ionia and Cyprus, reversing a hundred years of Greek victories against Persia. Sparta then tried to further weaken the power of Thebes, which led to a war in which Thebes allied with its old enemy Athens.\\r\\nThen the Theban generals Epaminondas and Pelopidas won a decisive victory at Leuctra (371 BC). The result of this battle was the end of Spartan supremacy and the establishment of Theban dominance, but Athens herself recovered much of her former power because the supremacy of Thebes was short-lived. With the death of Epaminondas at Mantinea (362 BC) the city lost its greatest leader and his successors blundered into an ineffectual ten-year war with Phocis. In 346 BC the Thebans appealed to Philip II of Macedon to help them against the Phocians, thus drawing Macedon into Greek affairs for the first time.[39]\\r\\nThe Peloponnesian War was a radical turning point for the Greek world. Before 403 BC, the situation was more defined, with Athens and its allies (a zone of domination and stability, with a number of island cities benefiting from Athens' maritime protection), and other states outside this Athenian Empire. The sources denounce this Athenian supremacy (or hegemony) as smothering and disadvantageous.[40]\\r\\nAfter 403 BC, things became more complicated, with a number of cities trying to create similar empires over others, all of which proved short-lived. The first of these turnarounds was managed by Athens as early as 390 BC, allowing it to re-establish itself as a major power without regaining its former glory.\\r\\nThis empire was powerful but short-lived. In 405 BC, the Spartans were masters of all - of Athens' allies and of Athens itself - and their power was undivided. By the end of the century, they could not even defend their own city. As noted above, in 400 BC, Agesilaus became king of Sparta.[41]\\r\\nThe subject of how to reorganize the Athenian Empire as part of the Spartan Empire provoked much heated debate among Sparta's full citizens. The admiral Lysander felt that the Spartans should rebuild the Athenian empire in such a way that Sparta profited from it. Lysander tended to be too proud to take advice from others.[42] Prior to this, Spartan law forbade the use of all precious metals by private citizens, with transactions being carried out with cumbersome iron ingots (which generally discouraged their accumulation) and all precious metals obtained by the city becoming state property. Without the Spartans' support, Lysander's innovations came into effect and brought a great deal of profit for him - on Samos, for example, festivals known as Lysandreia were organized in his honour. He was recalled to Sparta, and once there did not attend to any important matters.\\r\\nSparta refused to see Lysander or his successors dominate. Not wanting to establish a hegemony, they decided after 403 BC not to support the directives that he had made.\\r\\nAgesilaus came to power by accident at the start of the 4th century BC. This accidental accession meant that, unlike the other Spartan kings, he had the advantage of a Spartan education. The Spartans at this date discovered a conspiracy against the laws of the city conducted by Cinadon and as a result concluded there were too many dangerous worldly elements at work in the Spartan state.\\r\\nAgesilaus employed a political dynamic that played on a feeling of pan-Hellenic sentiment and launched a successful campaign against the Persian empire.[43] Once again, the Persian empire played both sides against each other. The Persian Court supported Sparta in the rebuilding of their navy while simultaneously funding the Athenians, who used Persian subsidies to rebuild their long walls (destroyed in 404 BC) as well as to reconstruct their fleet and win a number of victories.\\r\\nFor most of the first years of his reign, Agesilaus had been engaged in a war against Persia in the Aegean Sea and in Asia Minor.[44] In 394 BC, the Spartan authorities ordered Agesilaus to return to mainland Greece. While Agesilaus had a large part of the Spartan Army in Asia Minor, the Spartan forces protecting the homeland had been attacked by a coalition of forces led by Corinth.[45] At the Battle of Haliartus the Spartans had been defeated by the Theban forces. Worse yet, Lysander, Sparta's chief military leader, had been killed during the battle.[46] This was the start of what became known as the \\"Corinthian War\\" (395 BCE-387 BCE).[43] Upon hearing of the Spartan loss at Haliartus and of the death of Lysander, Agesilaus headed out of Asia Minor, back across the Hellespont, across Thrace and back towards Greece. At the Battle of Coronea, Agesilaus and his Spartan Army defeated a Theban force. During the war, Corinth drew support from a coalition of traditional Spartan enemies? Argos, Athens and Thebes.[47] However, when the war descended into guerilla tactics, Sparta decided that it could not fight on two fronts and so chose to ally with Persia.[47] The long Corinthian War finally ended with the Peace of Antalcidas or the King's Peace, in which the \\"Great King\\" of Persia, Artaxerxes II, pronounced a \\"treaty\\" of peace between the various city-states of Greece which broke up all \\"leagues\\" of city-states on Greek mainland and in the islands of the Aegean Sea. Although this was looked upon as \\"independence\\" for some city-states, the effect of the unilateral \\"treaty\\" was highly favourable to the interests of the Persian Empire.\\r\\nThe Corinthian War revealed a significant dynamic that was occurring in Greece. While Athens and Sparta fought each other to exhaustion, Thebes was rising to a position of dominance among the various Greek city-states.\\r\\nIn 387 BC, an edict was promulgated by the Persian king, preserving the Greek cities of Asia Minor and Cyprus as well as the independence of the Greek Aegean cities, except for Lymnos, Imbros and Skyros, which were given over to Athens.[48] It dissolved existing alliances and federations and forbade the formation of new ones. This is an ultimatum that benefited Athens only to the extent that Athens held onto three islands. While the \\"Great King,\\" Artaxerxes, was the guarantor of the peace, Sparta was to act as Persia's agent in enforcing the Peace.[49] To the Persians this document is known as the \\"King's Peace.\\" To the Greeks, this document is known as the Peace of Antalcidas, after the Antalcidas who was sent to Persia as negotiator. Sparta had been worried about the developing closer ties between Athens and Persia. Accordingly, Antalcidas was directed to get whatever agreement he could from the \\"Great King\\". Accordingly, the \\"Peace of Antalcidas\\" is not a negotiated peace at all. Rather it is a surrender to the interests of Persia, drafted entirely for its benefit.[49]\\r\\nOn the other hand, this peace had unexpected consequences. In accordance with it, the Boeotian League, or Boeotian confederacy, was dissolved in 386 BC.[50] This confederacy was dominated by Thebes, a city hostile to the Spartan hegemony. Sparta carried out large-scale operations and peripheral interventions in Epirus and in the north of Greece, resulting in the capture of the fortress of Thebes, the Cadmea, after an expedition in the Chalcidice and the capture of Olynthos. It was a Theban politician who suggested to the Spartan general Phoibidas that Sparta should seize Thebes itself. This act was sharply condemned, though Sparta eagerly ratified this unilateral move by Phoibidas. The Spartan attack was successful and Thebes was placed under Spartan control.[51]\\r\\nIn 378 BC, the reaction to Spartan control over Thebes was broken by a popular uprising within Thebes. Elsewhere in Greece, the reaction against Spartan hegemony began when Sphodrias, another Spartan general, tried to carry out a surprise attack on Piraeus.[52] Although the gates of Piraeus were no longer fortified, Sphodrias was driven off before Piraeus. Back in Sparta, Sphodrias was put on trial for the failed attack, but was acquitted by the Spartan court. Nonetheless, the attempted attack triggered an alliance between Athens and Thebes.[52] Sparta would now have to fight them both together. Athens was trying to recover from its defeat in the Peloponnesian War at the hands of Sparta's \\"navarch\\" Lysander in the disaster of 404 BC. The rising spirit of rebellion against Sparta also fueled Thebes' attempt to restore the former Boeotian confederacy.[53] In Boeotia, the Theban leaders Pelopidas and Epaminondas reorganized the Theban army and began to free the towns of Boeotia from their Spartan garrisons, one by one, and incorporated these towns into the revived Boeotian League.[49] Pelopidas won a great victory for Thebes over a much larger Spartan force in the Battle of Tegyra in 375 BC.[54]\\r\\nTheban authority grew so spectacularly in such a short time that Athens came to mistrust the growing Theban power. Athens began to consolidate its position again through the formation of a second Athenian League.[55] Attention was drawn to growing power of Thebes when it began interfering in the political affairs of its neighbor, Phocis, and, particularly, after Thebes razed the city of Plataea, a long-standing ally of Athens, in 375 BC.[56] The destruction of Plataea caused Athens to negotiate an alliance with Sparta against Thebes, in that same year.[56] In 371, the Theban army, led by Epaminondas, inflicted a bloody defeat on Spartan forces at Battle of Leuctra. Sparta lost a large part of its army and 400 of its 2,000 citizen-troops. The Battle of Leuctra was a watershed in Greek history.[56] Epaminondas' victory ended a long history of Spartan military prestige and dominance over Greece and the period of Spartan hegemony was over. However, Spartan hegemony was not replaced by Theban, but rather by Athenian hegemony.\\r\\nIt was important to erase the bad memories of the former league. Its financial system was not adopted, with no tribute being paid. Instead, syntaxeis were used, irregular contributions as and when Athens and its allies needed troops, collected for a precise reason and spent as quickly as possible. These contributions were not taken to Athens? unlike the 5th century BC system, there was no central exchequer for the league? but to the Athenian generals themselves.\\r\\nThe Athenians had to make their own contribution to the alliance, the eisphora. They reformed how this tax was paid, creating a system in advance, the Proseiphora, in which the richest individuals had to pay the whole sum of the tax then be reimbursed by other contributors. This system was quickly assimilated into a liturgy.\\r\\nThis league responded to a real and present need. On the ground, however, the situation within the league proved to have changed little from that of the 5th century BC, with Athenian generals doing what they wanted and able to extort funds from the league. Alliance with Athens again looked unattractive and the allies complained.\\r\\nThe main reasons for the eventual failure were structural. This alliance was only valued out of fear of Sparta, which evaporated after Sparta's fall in 371 BC, losing the alliance its sole 'raison d'etre'. The Athenians no longer had the means to fulfill their ambitions, and found it difficult merely to finance their own navy, let alone that of an entire alliance, and so could not properly defend their allies. Thus, the tyrant of Pherae was able to destroy a number of cities with impunity. From 360 BC, Athens lost its reputation for invincibility and a number of allies (such as Byzantium and Naxos in 364 BC) decided to secede.\\r\\nIn 357 BC the revolt against the league spread, and between 357 BC and 355 BC, Athens had to face war against its alliesa war whose issue was marked by a decisive intervention by the king of Persia in the form of an ultimatum to Athens, demanding that Athens recognise its allies' independence under threat of Persia's sending 200 triremes against Athens. Athens had to renounce the war and leave the confederacy, thereby weakening itself more and more, and signaling the end of Athenian hegemony.\\r\\nThis was not Thebes' first attempt at hegemony. It had been the most important city of Boeotia and the centre of the previous Boeotian confederacy of 447, resurrected since 386.\\r\\nThe 5th-century confederacy is well known to us from a papyrus found at Oxyrhynchus and known as \\"the Anonyme of Thebes\\". Thebes headed it and set up a system under which charges were divided up between the different cities of the confederacy. Citizenship was defined according to wealth, and Thebes counted 11,000 active citizens.\\r\\nThe confederacy was divided up into 11 districts, each providing a federal magistrate called a \\"boeotarch\\", a certain number of council members, 1,000 hoplites and 100 horsemen. From the 5th century BC the alliance could field an infantry force of 11,000 men, in addition to an elite corps and a light infantry numbering 10,000; but its real power derived from its cavalry force of 1,100, commanded by a federal magistrate independent of local commanders. It also had a small fleet that played a part in the Peloponnesian War by providing 25 triremes for the Spartans. At the end of the conflict, the fleet consisted of 50 triremes and was commanded by a \\"navarch\\".\\r\\nAll this constituted a significant enough force that the Spartans were happy to see the Boeotian confederacy dissolved by the king's peace. This dissolution, however, did not last, and in the 370s there was nothing to stop the Thebans (who had lost the Cadmea to Sparta in 382 BC) from reforming this confederacy.\\r\\nPelopidas and Epaminondas endowed Thebes with democratic institutions similar to those of Athens, the Thebans revived the title of \\"Boeotarch\\" lost in the Persian King's Peace and - with victory at Leuctra and the destruction of Spartan power - the pair achieved their stated objective of renewing the confederacy. Epaminondas rid the Peloponnesus of pro-Spartan oligarchies, replacing them with pro-Theban democracies, constructed cities, and rebuilt a number of those destroyed by Sparta. He equally supported the reconstruction of the city of Messene thanks to an invasion of Laconia that also allowed him to liberate the helots and give them Messene as a capital.\\r\\nHe decided in the end to constitute small confederacies all round the Peloponnessus, forming an Arcadian confederacy (the King's Peace had destroyed a previous Arcadian confederacy and put Messene under Spartan control).\\r\\nThe strength of the Boeotian League explains Athens' problems with her allies in the second Athenian League. Epaminondas succeeded in convincing his countrymen to build a fleet of 100 triremes to pressure cities into leaving the Athenian league and joining a Boeotian maritime league. Epaminondas and Pelopidas also reformed the army of Thebes to introduce new and more effective means of fighting. Thus, the Theban army was able to carry the day against the coalition of other Greek states at the battle of Leuctra in 371 BC and the battle of Mantinea in 362 BC.\\r\\nSparta also remained an important power in the face of Theban strength. However, some of the cities allied with Sparta turned against her, because of Thebes. In 367 BC, both Sparta and Athens sent delegates to Artaxerxes II, the Great King of Persia. These delegates sought to have the Artaxerxes, once again, declare Greek independence and a unilateral common peace, just as he had done in twenty years earlier in 387 BC. As noted above, this had meant the destruction of the Boeotian League in 387 BC. Sparta and Athens now hoped the same thing would happen with a new declaration of a similar \\"Kings Peace\\". Thebes sent Pelopidas to argue against them.[57] The Great King was convinced by Pelopidas and the Theban diplomats that Thebes and the Boeotian League would be the best agents of Persian interests in Greece, and, accordingly, did not issue a new \\"King's Peace.\\"[50] Thus, to deal with Thebes, Athens and Sparta were thrown back on their own resources. Thebes, meanwhile, expanded its influence beyond the bounds of Boeotia. In 364 BC, Pelopidas defeated the Alexander of Pherae in the Battle of Cynoscephalae, located in south-eastern Thessaly in northern Greece. However, during the battle, Pelopides was killed.[58]\\r\\nThe confederational framework of Sparta's relationship with her allies was really an artificial one, since it attempted to bring together cities that had never been able to agree on much at all in the past. Such was the case with the cities of Tegea and Mantinea, which re-allied in the Arcadian confederacy. The Mantineans received the support of the Athenians, and the Tegeans that of the Thebans. In 362 BC, Epaminondas led a Theban army against a coalition of Athenian, Spartan, Elisian, Mantinean and Achean forces. Battle was joined at Mantinea.[50] The Thebans prevailed, but this triumph was short-lived, for Epaminondas died in the battle, stating that \\"I bequeath to Thebes two daughters, the victory of Leuctra and the victory at Mantinea\\".\\r\\nDespite the victory at Mantinea, in the end, the Thebans abandoned their policy of intervention in the Peloponnesus. This event is looked upon as a watershed in Greek history. Thus, Xenophon concludes his history of the Greek world at this point, in 362 BC. The end of this period was even more confused than its beginning. Greece had failed and, according to Xenophon, the history of the Greek world was no longer intelligible.\\r\\nThe idea of hegemony disappeared. From 362 BC onward, there was no longer a single city that could exert hegemonic power in Greece. The Spartans were greatly weakened; the Athenians were in no condition to operate their navy, and after 365 no longer had any allies; Thebes could only exert an ephemeral dominance, and had the means to defeat Sparta and Athens but not to be a major power in Asia Minor.\\r\\nOther forces also intervened, such as the Persian king, who appointed himself arbitrator among the Greek cities, with their tacit agreement. This situation reinforced the conflicts and there was a proliferation of civil wars, with the confederal framework a repeated trigger for them. One war led to another, each longer and more bloody than the last, and the cycle could not be broken. Hostilities even took place during winter for the first time, with the invasion of Laconia in 370 BC.\\r\\nThebes sought to maintain its position until finally eclipsed by the rising power of Macedon in 346 BC. The energetic leadership within Macedon began in 359 BC when Philip of Macedon was made regent for his nephew, Amyntas. Within a short time, Philip was acclaimed king as Philip II of Macedonia in his own right, with succession of the throne established on his own heirs.[59] During his lifetime, Philip II consolidated his rule over Macedonia. This was done by 359 BC and Philip began to look toward expanding Macedonia's influence abroad. The dream of restoring Greece to its grandeur by liberating all Greek lands from Persian dominion was alive even in this early stage. This dream even included conquering Persia itself.[60]\\r\\nUnder Philip II, (359ÿ336 BC), Macedon expanded into the territory of the Paeonians, Thracians, and Illyrians.[61] In 358 BC, Philip allied with Epirus in its campaign against Illyria. In 357 BC, Philip came into direct conflict with Athens when he conquered the Thracian port city of Amphipolis, a city located at the mouth of the Strymon River to the east of Macedonia, and a major Athenian trading port. Conquering this city allowed Philip to subjugate all of Thrace. A year later in 356 BC, the Macedonians attacked and conquered the Athenian-controlled port city of Pydna. This brought the Macedonian threat to Athens closer to home to the Athenians. With the start of the Phocian War in 356 BC, the great Athenian orator and political leader of the \\"war party\\", Demosthenes, became increasingly active in encouraging Athens to fight vigorously against Philip's expansionist aims.[62] In 352 BC, Demosthenes gave many speeches against the Macedonian threat, declaring Philip II Athens' greatest enemy. The leader of the Athenian \\"peace party\\" was Phocion, who wished to avoid a confrontation that, Phocion felt, would be catastrophic for Athens. Despite Phocion's attempts to restrain the war party, Athens remained at war with Macedonia for years following the original declaration of war.[63] Negotiations between Athens and Philip II started only in 346 BC.[64] The Athenians successfully halted Philip's invasion of Attica at Thermopylae that same year in 352 BC. However, Philip defeated the Phocians at the Battle of the Crocus Field. The conflict between Macedonia and all the city-states of Greece came to a head in 338 BC,[65] at the Battle of Chaeronea.\\r\\nThe Macedonians became more politically involved with the south-central city-states of Greece, but also retained more archaic aspects harking back to the palace culture, first at Aegae (modern Vergina) then at Pella, resembling Mycenaean culture more than that of the Classical city-states. Militarily, Philip recognized the new phalanx style of fighting that had been employed by Epaminondas and Phielopidas in Thebes. Accordingly, he incorporated this new system into the Macedonian army. Philip II also brought a Theban military tutor to Macedon to instruct the future Alexander the Great in the Theban method of fighting.[66]\\r\\nPhilip's son Alexander the Great was born in Pella, Macedonia (356ÿ323 BC). Philip II brought Aristotle to Pella to teach the young Alexander.[67] Besides Alexander's mother, Olympias, Philip took another wife by the name of Cleopatra Eurydice.[68] Cleopatra had a daughter, Europa, and a son, Caranus. Caranus posed a threat to the succession of Alexander.[69] Cleopatra Eurydice was a Macedonian and, thus, Caranus was all Macedonian in blood. Olympias, on the other hand, was from Epicurus and, thus, Alexander was regarded as being only half-Macedonian (Cleopatra Eurydice should not be confused with Cleopatra of Macedon, who was Alexander's full-sister and thus daughter of Philip and Olympias).\\r\\nPhilip II was assassinated at the wedding of his daughter Cleopatra of Macedon with King Alexander I of Epirus in 336 BC.[70] Philip's son, the future Alexander the Great, immediately claimed the throne of Macedonia by eliminating all the other claimants to the throne, including Caranus and his cousin Amytas.[71] Alexander was only twenty (20) years of age when he assumed the throne.[72]\\r\\nThereafter, Alexander continued his father's plans to conquer all of Greece. He did this by both military might and persuasion. After his victory over Thebes, Alexander traveled to Athens to meet the public directly. Despite Demosthenes' speeches against the Macedonian threat on behalf of the war party of Athens, the public in Athens was still very much divided between the \\"peace party\\" and Demosthenes' \\"war party.\\" However, the arrival of Alexander charmed the Athenian public.[73] The peace party was strengthened and then a peace between Athens and Macedonia was agreed.[74] This allowed Alexander to move on his and the Greeks' long-held dream of conquest in the east, with a unified and secure Greek state at his back.\\r\\nIn 334 BC, Alexander with about 30,000 infantry soldiers and 5,000 cavalry crossed the Hellespont into Asia. He never returned.[75] Alexander managed to briefly extend Macedonian power not only over the central Greek city-states, but also to the Persian empire, including Egypt and lands as far east as the fringes of India.[61] He managed to spread Greek culture throughout the known world.[76] Alexander the Great died in 323 BC in Babylon during his Asian campaign of conquest.[77]\\r\\nThe Classical period conventionally ends at the death of Alexander the Great in 323 BC and the fragmentation of his empire, divided among the Diadochi,[78] which, in the minds of most scholars, marks the beginning of the Hellenistic period.\\r\\nThe legacy of Greece was strongly felt by post-Renaissance European elite, who saw themselves as the spiritual heirs of Greece. Will Durant wrote in 1939 that \\"excepting machinery, there is hardly anything secular in our culture that does not come from Greece,\\" and conversely \\"there is nothing in Greek civilization that doesn't illuminate our own\\".[79] Noted commentator Marianna de Marzi has also observed the extent to which Classical Greek thought has influenced the progression of Western civilization, writing: \\"The profundity of the knowledge gained through this period in history; in art, mathematics, music and more, is incomparable to almost any other chapter in human inquiry.\\"","input":"When did the classical period of ancient greece begin?"},{"output":"Nok culture","context":"","input":"What was west africas earliest known culture?"},{"output":"Nathan David Gerbe","context":"Nathan David Gerbe (born July 24, 1987) is an American professional ice hockey player currently playing for the Cleveland Monsters of the American Hockey League (AHL) while under contract to the Columbus Blue Jackets of the National Hockey League (NHL).

On 17 September 2008, a new website by ACK-media was launched.[2][3]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe comic series was started by Anant Pai in an attempt to teach Indian children about their cultural heritage. He was shocked that Indian students could answer questions on Greek and Roman mythology, but were ignorant of their own history, mythology and folklore.

Ananthram which led to the first Amar Chitra Katha comics being produced in 1965in Kannada, not English. \\"The English ACK titles begin from number eleven because the first ten were in Kannada,\\" clarifies Ananthram. To Anathram's satisfaction, the 1965 Kannada ACK venture was a great commercial success which led to Mirchandani in the head office in Mumbai pursuing the Amar Chitra Katha idea in English diligently. \\"They brought in Anant Pai\\" says Ananthram. \\"And he built a wonderful team and a great brand.\\"[6]\\r\\nWriters like Kamala Chandrakant, Margie Sastry, Subba Rao, Debrani Mitra and C.R Sharma joined the creative team of Amar Chitra Katha, with Anant Pai taking on the role of editor and co-writer on most scripts.

Subsequent issues, however, changed to full colour. All Amar Chitra Katha books stuck to a monthly (later fortnightly) 30-page format, with emphasis on lucid, entertaining storylines. In addition to the 'singles' format the stories are also available as hardcover 3-in-1 and 5-in-1 bundles. There are special editions of the epics like the Mahabharata which is available in a 3 volume 1300+ pages set.\\r\\nOccasionally there were \\"bumper\\" issues with 90 pages, most collecting stories of a similar type from individual issues (e.g. Monkey Stories From The Hitopadesha, Tales of Birbal and some being longer stories The Story of Rama). As the epic stories became more popular, the team began to publish stories based on Indian history, of men and women belonging to different regions and religions and also on stories based on Sanskrit as well as regional classics. The continuous popularity of the comics led to reprints being issued frequently, which ensured that the back-issues remained in print throughout the seventies and the eighties. At the height of its popularity, in the mid-eighties, it had been translated into Bengali, Marathi, Assamese, Gujarati, Punjabi, Sanskrit, Telugu, Tamil and Urdu and selling half a million copies a month.

Practices of sati and jauhar have been depicted without appropriate contextualisation or comment.[12] The Muslim heroes are invariably those who accommodated Hinduism in their belief systems, while Orthodox Muslims are presented as villains.[12] The creators have also been criticised for projecting the superiority of Brahminical or upper-caste Hindu culture over other viewpoints, presenting Indian caste hierarchies uncritically. However, Aruna Rao points out that India Book House responded to some of the criticism about the depiction of women and minorities, and attempted to make amends by adopting a broader perspective.[11]\\r\\nThe stories have often been criticised as distorted depictions of history, with characters being seen simplistically as 'good' and 'bad' ÿ brave Hindu kings and Muslim 'outsiders', and so on.[13] Also, the aim is often to create a hagiography and a lesson in character-building at the expense of authenticity and historical truth.[14] Another criticism is that comic books, by their very nature, do not reflect the richness and complexity of the oral tradition of Indian mythology in which multiple versions of a story can co-exist simultaneously.[15] One mainstream version is privileged over regional and folk versions, which the younger audience then comes to accept as the only 'truthful' version.\\r\\nThe following films were produced by Amar Chitra Katha under ACK Animation Studios banner","input":"Who was the comic book series amar chitra katha created?"},{"output":"bicanard biplane","context":"The Wright Flyer (often retrospectively referred to as Flyer I or 1903 Flyer) was the first successful heavier-than-air powered aircraft. It was designed and built by the Wright brothers. They flew it four times on December 17, 1903, near Kill Devil Hills, about four miles south of Kitty Hawk, North Carolina, US. Today, the airplane is exhibited in the National Air and Space Museum in Washington D.C. The U.S. Smithsonian Institution describes the aircraft as \\"the first powered, heavier-than-air machine to achieve controlled, sustained flight with a pilot aboard.\\"[2] The flight of Flyer I marks the beginning of the \\"pioneer era\\" of aviation.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Flyer was based on the Wrights' experience testing gliders at Kitty Hawk between 1900 and 1902. Their last glider, the 1902 Glider, led directly to the design of the Flyer.\\r\\nThe Wrights built the aircraft in 1903 using giant spruce wood as their construction material.[2] The wings were designed with a 1-in-20 camber. Since they could not find a suitable automobile engine for the task, they commissioned their employee Charlie Taylor to build a new design from scratch, effectively a crude gasoline engine.[3] A sprocket chain drive, borrowing from bicycle technology, powered the twin propellers, which were also made by hand.\\r\\nThe Flyer was a bicanard biplane configuration. As with the gliders, the pilot flew lying on his stomach on the lower wing with his head toward the front of the craft in an effort to reduce drag. He steered by moving a cradle attached to his hips. The cradle pulled wires which warped the wings and turned the rudder simultaneously.\\r\\nThe Flyer's \\"runway\\" was a track of 2x4s stood on their narrow edge, which the brothers nicknamed the \\"Junction Railroad.\\"\\r\\nUpon returning to Kitty Hawk in 1903, the Wrights completed assembly of the Flyer while practicing on the 1902 Glider from the previous season. On December 14, 1903, they felt ready for their first attempt at powered flight. With the help of men from the nearby government life-saving station, the Wrights moved the Flyer and its launching rail to the incline of a nearby sand dune, Big Kill Devil Hill, intending to make a gravity-assisted takeoff. The brothers tossed a coin to decide who would get the first chance at piloting, and Wilbur won. The airplane left the rail, but Wilbur pulled up too sharply, stalled, and came down in about three seconds with minor damage.\\r\\nRepairs after the abortive first flight took three days. When they were ready again on December 17, the wind was averaging more than 20?mph, so the brothers laid the launching rail on level ground, pointed into the wind, near their camp. This time the wind, instead of an inclined launch, provided the necessary airspeed for takeoff. Because Wilbur had already had the first chance, Orville took his turn at the controls. His first flight lasted 12 seconds for a total distance of 120?ft (36.5 m) ÿ shorter than the wingspan of a Boeing 747, as noted by observers in the 2003 commemoration of the first flight.[1][4]\\r\\nTaking turns, the Wrights made four brief, low-altitude flights that day. The flight paths were all essentially straight; turns were not attempted. Each flight ended in a bumpy and unintended \\"landing.\\" The last flight, by Wilbur, was 852 feet (260 m) in 59 seconds, much longer than each of the three previous flights of 120, 175 and 200 feet. The landing broke the front elevator supports, which the Wrights hoped to repair for a possible four-mile (6?km) flight to Kitty Hawk village. Soon after, a heavy gust picked up the Flyer and tumbled it end over end, damaging it beyond any hope of quick repair. It was never flown again.\\r\\nIn 1904, the Wrights continued refining their designs and piloting techniques in order to obtain fully controlled flight. Major progress toward this goal was achieved with a new Flyer in 1904 and even more decisively in 1905 with a third Flyer, in which Wilbur made a 39-minute, 24-mile (39?km) nonstop circling flight on October 5.[7] While the 1903 Flyer was clearly a historically important test vehicle, its hallowed status in the American imagination has obscured the role of its two successors in the continuing development that led to the Wrights' mastery of controlled powered flight in 1905.\\r\\nThe Flyer series of aircraft were the first to achieve controlled heavier-than-air flight, but some of the mechanical techniques the Wrights used to accomplish this were not influential for the development of aviation as a whole, although their theoretical achievements were. The Flyer design depended on wing-warping and a foreplane or \\"canard\\" for pitch control, features which would not scale and produced a hard-to-control aircraft. However, the Wrights' pioneering use of \\"roll control\\" by twisting the wings to change wingtip angle in relation to the airstream led directly to the more practical use of ailerons by their imitators, such as Curtiss and Farman. The Wrights' original concept of simultaneous coordinated roll and yaw control (rear rudder deflection), which they discovered in 1902, perfected in 1903ÿ1905, and patented in 1906, represents the solution to controlled flight and is used today on virtually every fixed-wing aircraft. The Wright patent included the use of hinged rather than warped surfaces for the forward elevator and rear rudder. Other features that made the Flyer a success were highly efficient wings and propellers, which resulted from the Wrights' exacting wind tunnel tests and made the most of the marginal power delivered by their early \\"homebuilt\\" engines; slow flying speeds (and hence survivable accidents); and an incremental test/development approach. The future of aircraft design, however, lay with rigid wings, ailerons and rear control surfaces. A British patent of 1868 for aileron technology[8] had apparently been completely forgotten by the time the 20th century dawned.\\r\\nAfter a single statement to the press in January 1904 and a failed public demonstration in May, the Wright Brothers did not publicize their efforts, and other aviators who were working on the problem of flight (notably Alberto Santos-Dumont) were thought by the press to have preceded them by many years. Indeed, several short heavier-than-air powered flights had been made by other aviators before 1903, leading to controversy about precedence (see Early flying machines). The Wrights, however, claimed to be the first of these which was \\"properly controlled.\\"\\r\\nThe issue of control was correctly seen as critical by the Wrights, and they acquired a wide American patent intended to give them ownership of basic aerodynamic control. This was fought in both American and European courts. European designers, however, were little affected by the litigation and continued their own development. The legal fight in the U.S., however, had a crushing effect on the nascent American aircraft industry, and by the time of World War I, the U.S. had no suitable military aircraft and had to purchase French and British models.\\r\\nThe Flyer was conceived as a control-canard, as the Wrights were more concerned with control than stability.[9] However, it was found to be so highly unstable that it was barely controllable.[10] During flight tests near Dayton the Wrights added ballast to the nose of the aircraft to move the center of gravity forward and reduce pitch instability. However the basics of pitch stability of the canard configuration were not understood by the Wright Brothers. F.E.C. Culick stated, \\"The backward state of the general theory and understanding of flight mechanics hindered them... Indeed, the most serious gap in their knowledge was probably the basic reason for their unwitting mistake in selecting their canard configuration.\\"[11]\\r\\nThe Wright Brothers returned home to Dayton for Christmas after the flights of the Kitty Hawk Flyer. While they had abandoned their other gliders, they realized the historical significance of the Flyer. They shipped the heavily damaged craft back to Dayton, where it remained stored in crates behind a Wright Company shed for 9 years. The Great Dayton Flood of March 1913 covered the flyer in mud and water for 11 days.[12]\\r\\nCharlie Taylor relates in a 1948 article that the Flyer nearly got disposed of by the Wrights themselves. In early 1912 Roy Knabenshue, The Wrights Exhibition team manager, had a conversation with Wilbur and asked Wilbur what they planned to do with the Flyer. Wilbur said they most likely will burn it, as they had the 1904 machine. According to Taylor, Knabenshue talked Wilbur out of disposing of the machine for historical purposes.[13]\\r\\nIn 1910 the Wrights first made attempts to exhibit the Flyer in the Smithsonian Institution but talks fell through with the ensuing lawsuits against Glenn Curtiss and the Flyer may have been needed as repeated evidence in court cases. Wilbur died in 1912, and in 1916, as the patent fights were ending, Orville brought the Flyer out of storage and prepared it for display at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. He replaced parts of the wing covering, the props, and the engine's crankcase, crankshaft, and flywheel. The crankcase, crankshaft and flywheel of the original engine had been sent to the Aero Club of America in New York for an exhibit in 1906 and were never returned to the Wrights. The replacement crankcase, crankshaft and flywheel came from the experimental engine Charlie Taylor had built in 1904 and used for testing in the bicycle shop. A replica crankcase of the flyer is on display at the visitor center at the Wright Brothers National Memorial.\\r\\nThe Smithsonian Institution, and primarily its then-secretary Charles Walcott, refused to give credit to the Wright Brothers for the first powered, controlled flight of an aircraft. Instead, they honored the former Smithsonian Secretary Samuel Pierpont Langley, whose 1903 tests of his own Aerodrome on the Potomac were not successful. Walcott was a friend of Langley and wanted to see Langley's place in aviation history restored. In 1914, Glenn Curtiss had recently exhausted the appeal process in a patent infringement legal battle with the Wrights. Curtiss sought to prove Langley's machine, which failed piloted tests nine days before the Wrights successful flight in 1903, capable of controlled, piloted flight in an attempt to invalidate the Wright's wide sweeping patents.\\r\\nThe Aerodrome was removed from exhibit at the Smithsonian and prepared for flight at Keuka Lake, New York. Curtis called the preparations \\"restoration\\" claiming that the only addition to the design was pontoons to support testing on the lake but critics including patent attorney Griffith Brewer called them alterations of the original design. Curtiss flew the modified Aerodrome, hopping a few feet off the surface of the lake for no more than 5 seconds at a time.[14]\\r\\nBetween 1916 and 1928 the Flyer was prepared and assembled for exhibition under the supervision of Orville by Wright Company mechanic Jim Jacobs several times. It was briefly exhibited at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in 1916, the New York Aero Shows in 1917 and 1919, a Society of Automotive Engineers meeting in Dayton, Ohio in 1918, and the National Air Races in Dayton in 1924.[15]\\r\\nIn 1925, Orville attempted to persuade the Smithsonian to recognize his and Wilbur's accomplishment by offering to send the Flyer to the Science Museum in London. This action did not have its intended effect, and the Flyer went on display in the London museum in 1928. It remained there in \\"the place of honour,\\"[16] except during World War II when it was moved to an underground storage facility 100 miles (160?km) from London, near the village of Corsham.[15]\\r\\nIn 1942 the Smithsonian Institution, under a new secretary, Charles Abbot, published a list of 35 Curtiss modifications to the Aerodrome and a retraction of its long-held claims for the craft. Abbot went on to list 4 regrets including the role the Institution played in supporting unsuccessful defendants in patent litigation by the Wrights, misinformation about modifications made to the Aerodrome after Wright Flyer's first flight and public statements attributing the \\"first aeroplane capable of sustained free flight with a man\\" to Secretary Langley. The entry in the 1942 Annual Report of Smithsonian Institution begins with the statement \\"It is everywhere acknowledged that the Wright brothers were the first to make sustained flights in a heavier-than-air machine at Kitty Hawk, North Carolina, on December 17, 1903\\" and closes with a promise that \\"Should Dr. Wright decide to deposit the plane ... it would be given the highest place of honor which it is due\\"[17]\\r\\nThe following year, Orville, after exchanging several letters with Abbott, agreed to return the Flyer to the United States. The Flyer stayed at the Science Museum until a replica could be built, based on the original. This change of heart by the Smithsonian is also mired in controversy ÿ the Flyer was sold to the Smithsonian under several contractual conditions, one of which reads:\\r\\nNeither the Smithsonian Institution or its successors, nor any museum or other agency, bureau or facilities administered for the United States of America by the Smithsonian Institution or its successors shall publish or permit to be displayed a statement or label in connection with or in respect of any aircraft model or design of earlier date than the Wright Aeroplane of 1903, claiming in effect that such aircraft was capable of carrying a man under its own power in controlled flight.[18][19]\\r\\nResearchers who promote the accomplishments of pioneer aviator Gustave Whitehead have commented that this agreement renders the Smithsonian unable to make properly unbiased academic decisions concerning any prior claims of 'first flight'.[20]\\r\\nIn 1948 the official handover of the Flyer was made to the American Civil Air Attach at a ceremony attended by representatives of the various flying organizations in the UK and by some British aviation pioneers such as Sir Alliott Verdon-Roe.[21] Later in 1948, the Flyer was returned to the United States on board the Mauretania. When the liner docked at Halifax, Nova Scotia, Paul E. Garber of the Smithsonian's National Air Museum met the aircraft and took command of the proceedings. The rest of the journey to Washington continued on flatbed truck. While in Halifax Garber met John A. D. McCurdy, at the time the Lieutenant Governor of Nova Scotia. McCurdy as a young man had been a member of Alexander Graham Bell's team Aerial Experiment Association, which included Glenn Curtiss, and later a famous pioneer pilot. During the stay at Halifax, Garber and McCurdy reminisced about the pioneer aviation days and the Wright Brothers. McCurdy also offered Garber any assistance he needed to get the Flyer home.[22]\\r\\nThe Flyer was put on display in the Arts and Industries Building of the Smithsonian on December 17, 1948, 45 years to the day after the aircraft's only flights. (Orville did not live to see this, as he died in January of that year.) In 1976, it was moved to the Milestones of Flight Gallery of the new National Air and Space Museum. Since 2003 it has resided in a special exhibit in the museum titled \\"The Wright Brothers and the Invention of the Aerial Age,\\" honoring the Wright Brothers in recognition of the 100th anniversary of their first flight.\\r\\nA piece of fabric and wood from the Wright Flyer was taken to the surface of the Moon by the crew of Apollo 11, the first lunar landing mission, in July 1969.[23]\\r\\nIn 1981, discussion began on the need to restore the Flyer from the aging it sustained after many decades on display. During the ceremonies celebrating the 78th anniversary of the first flights, Mrs. Harold S. Miller (Ivonette Wright, Lorin's daughter), one of the Wright brothers' nieces, presented the Museum with the original covering of one wing of the Flyer, which she had received in her inheritance from Orville. She expressed her wish to see the aircraft restored.\\r\\nThe fabric covering on the aircraft at the time, which came from the 1927 restoration, was discolored and marked with water spots. Metal fasteners holding the wing uprights together had begun to corrode, marking the nearby fabric.\\r\\nWork began in 1985. The restoration was supervised by Senior Curator Robert Mikesh and assisted by Wright Brothers expert Tom Crouch. Museum director Walter J. Boyne decided to perform the restoration in full view of the public.\\r\\nThe wooden framework was cleaned, and corrosion on metal parts removed. The covering was the only part of the aircraft replaced. The new covering was more accurate to the original than that of the 1927 restoration. To preserve the original paint on the engine, the restorers coated it in inert wax before putting on a new coat of paint.\\r\\nThe effects of the 1985 restoration were intended to last 75 years (to 2060) before another restoration would be required.[24]\\r\\nA number of individuals and groups have attempted to build reproductions of the Wright Flyer for demonstration or scientific purposes.\\r\\nIn 1978, 23-year-old Ken Kellett built a replica Flyer in Colorado and flew it at Kitty Hawk on the 75th and 80th anniversaries of the first flight there. Construction took a year and cost $3,000.[citation needed]\\r\\nAs the 100th anniversary on December 17, 2003 approached, the U.S. Centennial of Flight Commission along with other organizations opened bids for companies to recreate the original flight. The Wright Experience, led by Ken Hyde, won the bid and painstakingly recreated reproductions of the original Flyer, plus many of the prototype gliders and kites as well as several subsequent Wright aircraft. The completed Flyer reproduction was brought to Kitty Hawk and pilot Kevin Kochersberger attempted to recreate the original flight at 10:35 AM December 17, 2003 on level ground near the bottom of Kill Devil Hill.[25] Although the aircraft had previously made several successful test flights, sour weather, rain, and weak winds prevented a successful flight on the actual anniversary date. Hyde's reproduction is displayed at the Henry Ford Museum in Dearborn, Michigan.\\r\\nNumerous static display-only, nonflying reproductions are on display around the United States and across the world, making this perhaps the most reproduced single aircraft of the \\"pioneer\\" era in history, rivaling the number of copies  some of which are airworthy  of Louis Blriot's cross-Channel Bleriot XI from 1909.\\r\\nThe AIAA's Flyer reproduction undergoing testing in a NASA wind tunnel.\\r\\nWright Flyer Replica at the Henry Ford Museum\\r\\nFlyer replica at the Frontiers of Flight Museum\\r\\nWright 1903 Flyer replica at the Lysdale Historic Hangar [1]\\r\\nPortions of the original fabric and wood from the Flyer traveled to the surface of the moon aboard the Apollo 11 lunar module.

The detainees had been waging a hunger strike campaign, even resorting to physically sewing their lips closed. Nando's adverts proclaimed that the strikers \\"decided to unsew their lips after hearing the news that with every Nando's quarter chicken combo, Nando's are giving away an extra quarter chicken free\\". Melbourne's Sphere Advertising said that the ad was designed to spark controversy, saying that they knew that \\"there's a section of our audience that's going to be uncomfortable... but we want to evoke a response\\".[31]\\r\\nDuring the South African national elections of 2009, Nando's made an advert lampooning African National Congress Youth League then president Julius Malema by using a puppet that resembled him.

Musekiwa Kumbula, holder of the Nando's franchise in Zimbabwe, said his group \\"strongly feels the advertisement is insensitive and in poor taste\\". The advert also offended Chipangano, a Zimbabwean youth militia loyal to Mugabe, who then demanded an apology from Nando's, threatened to boycott the South Africa-based chain, and demanded the ad be withdrawn or the restaurant face retribution.[34] Nando's South Africa subsequently withdrew the advert citing threats to its staff in Zimbabwe from a youth group.[35]\\r\\nBoth The Guardian newspaper (UK) and the American non-profit publication ICIJ received documents in July 2014 revealing the details of past and present offshore clients of wealth managers Kleinwort Benson, including the Nando's restaurant group. The Guardian published its belief that, through the use of businesses in Malta, Guernsey and the Netherlands, Enthoven legally reduces the group's UK corporation tax bill by \\"up to a third\\". According to the British newspaper, Enthoven's profits eventually accumulate in the Kleinwort Benson-managed \\"Taro III Trust\\" that is based in Jersey and contains at least S750 million.[5]\\r\\nWhile no member of the Enthoven family agreed to speak with The Guardian, a company representative responded to the publication's invitation to respond and explained that UK tax laws are not applicable to Enthoven, as \\"He [Enthoven] is not resident in the US or the UK.\\" The spokesperson also stated that, in the UK, Nando's paid corporation tax of S12.6 million on a profit of S58.2 million for the year ending February 2013.[5]\\r\\nFor several years Nando's repeatedly denied that numerous celebrities were issued with a special 'Black Card' enabling free meals and soft drinks for five people at any time.

The company also maintains 31 field offices around the world[4] to promote social and economic development in Asia. The bank admits the members of the United Nations Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific (UNESCAP, formerly the Economic Commission for Asia and the Far East or ECAFE) and non-regional developed countries.[5] From 31 members at its establishment, ADB now has 67 members, of which 48 are from within Asia and the Pacific and 19 outside. The ADB was modeled closely on the World Bank, and has a similar weighted voting system where votes are distributed in proportion with members' capital subscriptions. ADB releases an annual report that summarizes its operations, budget and other materials for review by the public.[6] The ADB-Japan Scholarship Program (ADB-JSP) enrolls about 300 students annually in academic institutions located in 10 countries within the Region. Upon completion of their study programs, scholars are expected to contribute to the economic and social development of their home countries.[7] ADB is an official United Nations Observer.[8]\\r\\nAs of 31 December 2016, Japan and United States hold the largest proportion of shares at 15.607%.

The president has a term of office lasting five years, and may be reelected.

The bank employs about 3,000 people, representing 60 of its 67 members.[14]\\r\\nThe concept of a regional bank was formally proposed as an institution for developing intra-regional trade, at a trade conference organized by the Economic Commission for Asia and the Far East (ECAFE) in 1963 by a young Thai banker, Paul Sithi-Amnuai. (ESCAP, United Nations Publication March 2007, \\"The first parliament of Asia\\" pp.?65). The United States was initially opposed to the creation of another regional development bank following the establishment of the Inter-American Development Bank in 1959. However, with the escalation of the Vietnam War, U.S. President Lyndon B. Johnson was persuaded to support the establishment of the ADB in 1964 in an effort the mollify Senator J. William Fulbright (Chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee) who argued that the Vietnam War would not only bleed American blood and treasure, but would also be very bad for America's image in Asia. President Johnson pressed retired World Bank President Eugene R. Black, Sr. into organizing and establishing the new institution.[15]\\r\\nIn the process, U.S. Secretary of State Dean Rusk urged that Japan play an important role in the ADB. He argued that the biggest danger to American foreign policy in Asia was Japan's inability to integrate into the Asian society of nations following the animosities of World War II. Indeed, there was sharp Asian opposition to Japan's participation in the institution. After considerable diplomatic effort, Japan was eventually accepted into the organization by the majority of the participating nations, and Tokyo was selected as the site of the bank's headquarters. The Presidency was to rotate between the various countries of Asia. However, at the eleventh hour in a meeting of the delegates in Manila, Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos delivered a stinging tirade against the establishment of the ADB with Japanese participation. He threatened to personally travel to every Asian capital and scuttle the project. Eugene Black, with the assistance of President Johnson, was finally able to mollify President Marcos with the promise to locate the ADB in Manila. (In fact, Marcos eagerly volunteered to house the ADB in the newly constructed building on prestigious Roxas Boulevard, which had been designated for the Foreign Ministry.) As a concession to the Japanese, they were given the inaugural Presidency of the institution ÿ a position they have tenaciously held onto ever since.[15]\\r\\nOnce the ADB was founded in 1966, Japan took up the Presidency and some other crucial \\"reserve positions\\" such as the directorship of the all-powerful administration department known as BPMSD (Budget, Personnel, and Management Systems Department) through which they manage the institution. By the end of 1972, Japan had contributed $173.7 million (22.6% of the total) to the ordinary capital resources and $122.6 million (59.6% of the total) to the special funds. In contrast, the United States contributed only $1.25 million to the special fund.[5]\\r\\nAfter its creation in the 1960s, ADB focused much of its assistance on food production and rural development. At the time, Asia was one of the poorest regions in the world.[16]\\r\\nEarly loans went largely to Indonesia, Thailand, Malaysia, South Korea and the Philippines, the countries with which Japan had crucial trading ties; these nations accounted for 78.48% of the total ADB loans between 1967 and 1972. Moreover, Japan received tangible benefits, 41.67% of the total procurements between 1967 and 1976. Japan tied its special funds contributions to its preferred sectors and regions and procurements of its goods and services, as reflected in its $100 million donation for the Agricultural Special Fund in April 1968.[5]\\r\\nTakeshi Watanabe served as the first ADB president from 1966 to 1972.[17][18]\\r\\nIn the 1970s, ADB's assistance to developing countries in Asia expanded into education and health, and then to infrastructure and industry. The gradual emergence of Asian economies in the latter part of the decade spurred demand for better infrastructure to support economic growth. ADB focused on improving roads and providing electricity. When the world suffered its first oil price shock, ADB shifted more of its assistance to support energy projects, especially those promoting the development of domestic energy sources in member countries.[16]\\r\\nFollowing considerable pressure from the Reagan Administration in the 1980s, ADB reluctantly began working with the private sector in an attempt to increase the impact of its development assistance to poor countries in Asia and the Pacific. In the wake of the second oil crisis, ADB expanded its assistance to energy projects. In 1982, ADB opened its first field office, in Bangladesh, and later in the decade it expanded its work with non-government organizations (NGOs).[16]\\r\\nJapanese presidents Inoue Shiro (1972ÿ76) and Yoshida Taroichi (1976ÿ81) took the spotlight in the 1970s. Fujioka Masao, the fourth president (1981ÿ90), adopted an assertive leadership style, launching an ambitious plan to expand the ADB into a high-impact development agency.\\r\\nIn the 1990s, ADB began promoting regional cooperation by helping the countries on the Mekong River to trade and work together. The decade also saw an expansion of ADB's membership with the addition of several Central Asian countries following the end of the Cold War.[16]\\r\\nIn mid-1997, ADB responded to the financial crisis that hit the region with projects designed to strengthen financial sectors and create social safety nets for the poor. During the crisis, ADB approved its largest single loan ÿ a $4 billion emergency loan to the South Korea. In 1999, ADB adopted poverty reduction as its overarching goal.[16]\\r\\nThe early years of 2000s saw a dramatic expansion of private sector finance. While the institution had such operations since the 1980s (under pressure from the Reagan Administration) the early attempts were highly unsuccessful with low lending volumes, considerable losses and financial scandals associated with an entity named AFIC. However, beginning in 2002, the ADB undertook a dramatic expansion of private sector lending under a new team. Over the course of the next six years, the Private Sector Operations Department (PSOD) grew by a factor of 41 times the 2001 levels of new financings and earnings for the ADB. This culminated with the Board's formal recognition if these achievements in March 2008, when the Board of Directors formally adopted the Long Term Strategic Framework (LTSF). That document formally stated that assistance to private sector development was the lead priority of the ADB and that it should constitute 50% of the bank's lending by 2020.\\r\\nIn 2003, the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) epidemic hit the region and ADB responded with programs to help the countries in the region work together to address infectious diseases, including avian influenza and HIV/AIDS. ADB also responded to a multitude of natural disasters in the region, committing more than $850 million for recovery in areas of India, Indonesia, Maldives, and Sri Lanka which were impacted by the December 2004 Asian tsunami. In addition, $1 billion in loans and grants was provided to the victims of the October 2005 earthquake in Pakistan.[16]\\r\\nIn 2009, ADB's Board of Governors agreed to triple ADB's capital base from $55 billion to $165 billion, giving it much-needed resources to respond to the global economic crisis. The 200% increase is the largest in ADB's history, and was the first since 1994.[16]\\r\\nAsia moved beyond the economic crisis and by 2010 had emerged as a new engine of global economic growth though it remained home to two-thirds of the worlds poor. In addition, the increasing prosperity of many people in the region created a widening income gap that left many people behind. ADB responded to this with loans and grants that encouraged economic growth.[16]\\r\\nIn early 2012, the ADB began to re-engage with Myanmar in response to reforms initiated by the government. In April 2014, ADB opened an office in Myanmar and resumed making loans and grants to the country.[16]\\r\\nIn 2017, ADB combined the lending operations of its Asian Development Fund (ADF) with its ordinary capital resources (OCR). The result was to expand the OCR balance sheet to permit increasing annual lending and grants to $20 billion  50% more than the previous level.[16]\\r\\nThe ADB defines itself as a social development organization that is dedicated to reducing poverty in Asia and the Pacific through inclusive economic growth, environmentally sustainable growth, and regional integration. This is carried out through investments ÿ in the form of loans, grants and information sharing ÿ in infrastructure, health care services, financial and public administration systems, helping nations prepare for the impact of climate change or better manage their natural resources, as well as other areas.\\r\\nEighty percent of ADBs lending is concentrated public sector lending in five operational areas.[19]\\r\\nThe ADB offers \\"hard\\" loans on commercial terms primarily to middle income countries in Asia and \\"soft\\" loans with lower interest rates to poorer countries in the region. Based on a new policy, both types of loans will be sourced starting January 2017 from the banks ordinary capital resources (OCR), which functions as its general operational fund.[30]\\r\\nThe ADB's Private Sector Department (PSOD) can and does offer a broader range of financings beyond commercial loans. They also have the capability to provide guarantees, equity and mezzanine finance (a combination of debt and equity).\\r\\nIn 2014, ADB lent $11.2 billion to its member governments ÿ known as \\"sovereign\\" lending ÿ and invested another $1.7 billion in private enterprises, as part of its \\"nonsovereign\\" operations. ADBs operations in 2014, including grants and other assistance, totaled $22.93 billion.[31]\\r\\nADB obtains its funding by issuing bonds on the world's capital markets. It also relies on the contributions of member countries, retained earnings from lending operations, and the repayment of loans.[32]\\r\\nADB provides direct financial assistance, in the form of debt, equity and mezzanine finance to private sector companies, for projects that have clear social benefits beyond the financial rate of return. ADBs participation is usually limited but it leverages a large amount of funds from commercial sources to finance these projects by holding no more than 25% of any given transaction.[33]\\r\\nADB partners with other development organizations on some projects to increase the amount of funding available. In 2014, $9.2 billionor nearly halfof ADBs $22.9 billion in operations were financed by other organizations.[34] According to Jason Rush, Principal Communication Specialist, the Bank communicates with many other multilateral organizations.\\r\\nMore than 50 financing partnership facilities, trust funds, and other funds ÿ totalling several billion each year ÿ are administered by ADB and put toward projects that promote social and economic development in Asia and the Pacific.[35] ADB has raised Rs 5 billion or around Rs 500 crores from its issuance of 5-year offshore Indian rupee (INR) linked bonds. Also, plans to raise around $20 billion from the capital markets in 2016.[36]\\r\\nADB has an information disclosure policy that presumes all information that is produced by the institution should be disclosed to the public unless there is a specific reason to keep it confidential. The police calls for accountability and transparency in operations and the timely response to requests for information and documents.[37] ADB does not disclose information that jeopardizes personal privacy, safety and security, certain financial and commercial information, as well as other exceptions.[38]\\r\\nSince the ADB's early days, critics have charged that the two major donors, Japan and the United States, have had extensive influence over lending, policy and staffing decisions.[47]\\r\\nOxfam Australia has criticized the Asian Development Bank for insensitivity to local communities. \\"Operating at a global and international level, these banks can undermine people's human rights through projects that have detrimental outcomes for poor and marginalized communities.\\"[48] The bank also received criticism from the United Nations Environmental Program, stating in a report that \\"much of the growth has bypassed more than 70 percent of its rural population, many of whom are directly dependent on natural resources for livelihoods and incomes.\\"[49]\\r\\nThere had been criticism that ADB's large scale projects cause social and environmental damage due to lack of oversight. One of the most controversial ADB-related projects is Thailand's Mae Moh coal-fired power station. Environmental and human rights activists say ADB's environmental safeguards policy as well as policies for indigenous peoples and involuntary resettlement, while usually up to international standards on paper, are often ignored in practice, are too vague or weak to be effective, or are simply not enforced by bank officials.[50][51]\\r\\nThe bank has been criticized over its role and relevance in the food crisis. The ADB has been accused by civil society of ignoring warnings leading up the crisis and also contributing to it by pushing loan conditions that many say unfairly pressure governments to deregulate and privatize agriculture, leading to problems such as the rice supply shortage in Southeast Asia.[52]\\r\\nThe bank has also been criticized by Vietnam War veterans for funding projects in Laos, because of the United States' 15% stake in the bank, underwritten by taxes.[53] Laos became a communist country after the U.S. withdrew from Vietnam, and the Laotian Civil War was won by the Pathet Lao, which is widely understood to have been supported by the North Vietnamese Army.\\r\\nThere has been considerable criticism of management for its reluctance to implement the Long Term Strategic Framework (LTSF) which (as noted above) was formally adopted in March 2008. Indeed, whereas the Private Sector Operations Department (PSOD) closed out that year with financings of $2.4 billion, the ADB has significantly dropped below that level in the years since and is clearly not on the path to achieving its stated goal of 50% of financings to the private sector by 2020. Critics also point out that the PSOD is the only Department that actually makes money for the ADB. Hence, with the vast majority of loans going to concessionary (sub-market) loans to the public sector, the ADB is facing considerable financial difficulty and continuous operating losses.\\r\\nIn the final analysis, the core criticism of the ADB - as well as its sister multinational development banking (MDB) institutions, is that they are in their hearts statist organizations. That is true because they are inherently political institutions - first and foremost. While development is their facade, they exist to further the political aims of their members. The establishment of the rival AIIB underscores this fact. The argument for the creation on yet another regional MDB can not be made purely on development finance terms. However, it is clear that the AIIB represents Beijing's desire to field an institution of their own, especially as the ADB is clearly a creature of the United Srares and Japan.\\r\\nThe following table are amounts for 20 largest countries by subscribed capital and voting power at the Asian Development Bank as of December 2014.[54]\\r\\nADB has 67 members (as of 23 November 2017): 48 members from the Asian and Pacific Region, 19 members from Other Regions.[56] The non-member nations wholly or primarily in Asia are Bahrain, Iran, Iraq, Israel, Jordan, Kuwait, Lebanon, North Korea, Oman, Qatar, Russia, Saudi Arabia, Syria, the United Arab Emirates, and Yemen.

On that morning, 16 days after Germany invaded Poland from the west, the Soviet Union invaded Poland from the east. Subsequent military operations lasted for the following 20 days and ended on 6 October 1939 with the two-way division and annexation of the entire territory of the Second Polish Republic by both Germany and the Soviet Union.[7] The joint German-Soviet invasion of Poland was secretly agreed to following the signing of the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact on 23 August 1939.[8]\\r\\nThe Red Army, which vastly outnumbered the Polish defenders, achieved its targets by using strategic and tactical deception. Some 230,000 Polish prisoners of war had been captured.[4][9] The campaign of mass persecution in the newly acquired areas began immediately. In November 1939 the Soviet government ostensibly annexed the entire Polish territory under its control. Some 13.5 million Polish citizens who fell under the military occupation were made into new Soviet subjects following mock elections conducted by the NKVD secret police in the atmosphere of terror,[10][11] the results of which were used to legitimize the use of force. A Soviet campaign of political murders and other forms of repression, targeting Polish figures of authority, such as military officers, police and priests, began with a wave of arrests and summary executions.[Note 5][12][13] Over the next year and a half, the Soviet NKVD sent hundreds of thousands of people from eastern Poland to Siberia and other remote parts of the Soviet Union in four major waves of deportation between 1939 and 1941.[Note 6]\\r\\nSoviet forces occupied eastern Poland until the summer of 1941, when they were driven out by the invading German army in the course of Operation Barbarossa. The area was under German occupation until the Red Army reconquered it in the summer of 1944. An agreement at the Yalta Conference permitted the Soviet Union to annex almost all of their MolotovÿRibbentrop Pact portion of the Second Polish Republic, compensating the People's Republic of Poland with the southern half of East Prussia and territories east of the OderÿNeisse line.[16] The Soviet Union enclosed most of the annexed territories into the Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic and the Byelorussian Soviet Socialist Republic.[16]\\r\\nAfter the end of World War II in Europe, the USSR signed a brand new border agreement with the Polish communists on 16 August 1945. This agreement recognized the status quo as the new official border between the two countries with the exception of the region around Bia?ystok and a minor part of Galicia east of the San river around Przemy?l, which were returned to Poland later on.[17]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nSeveral months before the invasion, in early 1939 the Soviet Union began strategic alliance negotiations with the United Kingdom, France, Poland, and Romania against the crash militarization of Nazi Germany under Adolf Hitler. The USSR played a double game by secretly engaging in parallel talks with Germany. The negotiations with the Western democracies failed as expected, when the Soviet Union insisted that Poland and Romania give Soviet troops transit rights through their territory as part of a collective security arrangement.[18] The terms were rejected, thus giving Josef Stalin a free hand in pursuing the MolotovÿRibbentrop Pact with Adolf Hitler, signed on 23 August 1939. The non-aggression pact contained a secret protocol dividing Northern and Eastern Europe into German and Soviet spheres of influence in the event of war.[19] One week after the signing of the MolotovÿRibbentrop Pact, German forces invaded Poland from the west, north, and south on 1 September 1939. Polish forces gradually withdrew to the southeast where they prepared for a long defence of the Romanian Bridgehead and awaited the French and British support and relief that they were expecting. On 17 September 1939 the Soviet Red Army invaded the Kresy regions in accordance with the secret protocol.[20][Note 7]\\r\\nAt the opening of hostilities several Polish cities including Dubno, ?uck and W?odzimierz Wo?yski let the Red Army in peacefully, convinced that it was marching on in order to fight the Germans. General Juliusz R܇mmel of the Polish Army issued an unauthorised order to treat them like an ally before it was too late.[23] The Soviet government announced it was acting to protect the Ukrainians and Belarusians who lived in the eastern part of Poland, because the Polish state ÿ according to Soviet propaganda ÿ had collapsed in the face of the Nazi German attack and could no longer guarantee the security of its own citizens.[24][25][26][27] Facing a second front, the Polish government concluded that the defence of the Romanian Bridgehead was no longer feasible and ordered an emergency evacuation of all uniformed troops to then-neutral Romania.[1]\\r\\nThe result of the Paris Peace Conference (1919) did little to decrease the territorial ambitions of parties in the region. J܇zef Pi?sudski sought to expand the Polish borders as far east as possible in an attempt to create a Polish-led federation to counter any potential imperialist intentions on the part of Russia or Germany.[28] At the same time, the Bolsheviks began to gain the upper hand in the Russian Civil War and started to advance westward towards the disputed territories with the intent of assisting other Communist movements in Western Europe.[29] The border skirmishes of 1919 progressively escalated into the PolishÿSoviet War in 1920.[30] Following the Polish victory at the Battle of Warsaw, the Soviets sued for peace and the war ended with an armistice in October 1920.[31] The parties signed the formal peace treaty, the Peace of Riga, on 18 March 1921, dividing the disputed territories between Poland and Soviet Russia.[32] In an action that largely determined the Soviet-Polish border during the interwar period, the Soviets offered the Polish peace delegation territorial concessions in the contested borderland areas, closely resembling the border between the Russian Empire and the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth before the first partition of 1772.[33] In the aftermath of the peace agreement, Soviet leaders largely abandoned the cause of international revolution and did not return to the concept for approximately 20 years.[34] The Conference of Ambassadors and the international community (with the exception of Lithuania) recognized Poland's eastern frontiers in 1923.[35][36]\\r\\nGermany marched into Prague on 15 March 1939. In mid-April, the Soviet Union, Britain and France began trading diplomatic suggestions regarding a political and military agreement to counter potential further German aggression.[37][38] Poland did not participate in these talks.[39] The tripartite discussions focused on possible guarantees to participating countries should German expansionism continue.[40] The Soviets did not trust the British or the French to honour a collective security agreement, because they had already failed to react against the Nationalists during the Spanish Civil War and protect Czechoslovakia from dismemberment. The Soviet Union also suspected that Britain and France would seek to remain on the sidelines of any potential Nazi-Soviet conflict.[41] In reality however, Stalin had been conducting secret talks with Nazi Germany already since 1936 through his emissaries, and all along a deal with Hitler remained his first diplomatic choice, wrote Robert C. Grogin (author of Natural Enemies).[42] The Soviet Union sought nothing short of an ironclad guarantee against losing its sphere of influence,[43] and insisted on stretching the so-called buffer zone from Finland to Romania, in the event of an attack.[44][45] The Soviets demanded the right to enter these countries in the event of a security threat.[46] When the military talks began in mid-August, negotiations quickly stalled over the topic of Soviet troop passage through Poland if the Germans attacked. British and French officials pressured Polish government to agree to the Soviet terms.[18][47] However, Polish officials bluntly refused to allow Soviet troops in Poland. They believed that once the Red Army entered Poland it might never leave.[48] The Soviets suggested that Poland's wishes be ignored, and that the tripartite agreements be concluded despite its objections.[49] The British refused to do so because they believed that such a move would push Poland into establishing stronger bilateral relations with Germany.[50]\\r\\nMeanwhile, German officials secretly hinted to Soviet diplomats for months that it could offer better terms for a political agreement than Britain and France.[51] The Soviet Union began discussions with Nazi Germany regarding the establishment of an economic agreement while concurrently negotiating with those of the tripartite group.[51] In late July and early August 1939, Soviet and German officials agreed on most of the details for a planned economic agreement, and specifically addressed a potential political agreement.[52] On 19 August 1939, German and Soviet officials concluded the 1939 GermanÿSoviet Commercial Agreement, an economic mutual understanding that exchanged Soviet Union raw materials with Germany in exchange for weapons, military technology and civilian machinery. Two days later, the Soviets suspended the tripartite military talks.[51][53] On 24 August, the Soviet Union and Germany signed the political and military deal that accompanied the trade agreement, the MolotovÿRibbentrop Pact. This pact was an agreement of mutual non-aggression that contained secret protocols dividing the states of northern and eastern Europe into German and Soviet spheres of influence. The Soviet sphere initially included Latvia, Estonia and Finland.[Note 8] Germany and the Soviet Union would partition Poland; the areas east of the Pisa, Narev, Vistula, and San rivers going to the Soviet Union. The pact provided the Soviets with the chance of taking part in the invasion,[21] and offered an opportunity to regain territories ceded in the Peace of Riga of 1921. The Soviets would enlarge the Ukrainian and Belarusian republics to include the entire eastern half of Poland without the threat of disagreement with Adolf Hitler.[56][57]\\r\\nThe day after the Germans and Soviets signed the pact, the French and British military delegations urgently requested a meeting with Soviet military negotiator Kliment Voroshilov.[58] On 25 August, Voroshilov told them \\"[i]n view of the changed political situation, no useful purpose can be served in continuing the conversation.\\"[58] The same day, Britain and Poland signed the British-Polish Pact of Mutual Assistance.[59] In this accord, Britain committed itself to the defence of Poland, guaranteeing to preserve Polish independence.[59]\\r\\nHitler tried to dissuade the British and the French from interfering in the upcoming conflict and on 26 August 1939 proposed to make Wehrmacht forces available to Britain in the future.[60] At midnight on 29 August, German Foreign Minister Joachim von Ribbentrop handed British Ambassador Neville Henderson the list of terms that would allegedly ensure peace in regards to Poland.[61] Under the terms, Poland was to hand over Danzig (Gdask) to Germany, and there was to be a plebiscite (referendum) in the Polish Corridor within the year based on residency from 1919 (not after).[61] When the Polish Ambassador Lipski went to see Ribbentrop on 30 August and said that he did not have the power to sign anything of the sort, Ribbentrop dismissed him.[62] The Germans announced that Poland had rejected German offer and negotiations with Poland were finished.[63] On 31 August, German units posing as Polish troops staged the Gleiwitz incident near the border city of Gleiwitz.[64] The following morning Hitler ordered hostilities against Poland to start at 04:45 on 1 September.[62]\\r\\nThe Allied governments declared war on Germany on 3 September but failed to provide any meaningful support.[65] Despite some Polish successes in minor border battles, German technical, operational and numerical superiority forced the Polish armies to retreat from the borders towards Warsaw and Lw܇w. On 10 September, the Polish commander-in-chief, Marshal Edward Rydz-?mig?y, ordered a general retreat to the southeast towards the Romanian Bridgehead.[66] Soon after they began their invasion of Poland, the Nazi leaders began urging the Soviets to play their agreed part and attack Poland from the east. Soviet Foreign Minister Vyacheslav Molotov and German ambassador to Moscow Friedrich Werner von der Schulenburg exchanged a series of diplomatic messages on the matter but the Soviets nevertheless delayed their invasion of eastern Poland. The Soviets were distracted by crucial events relating to their ongoing border disputes with Japan. They needed time to mobilize the Red Army and they saw a diplomatic advantage in waiting until Poland had disintegrated before making their move.[67][68]\\r\\nOn 14 September, with Poland's collapse near, the Soviet press began making ominous statements about Poland.[69] The undeclared war between the Soviet Union and the Empire of Japan at the Battles of Khalkhin Gol (Nomonhan) in the Far East ended with the MolotovÿTojo agreement between the USSR and Japan which was signed on 15 September, with a ceasefire taking effect on 16 September.[70][69] On 17 September, Molotov delivered a declaration of war to Wac?aw Grzybowski, the Polish Ambassador in Moscow:\\r\\nWarsaw, as the capital of Poland, no longer exists. The Polish Government has disintegrated, and no longer shows any sign of life. This means that the Polish State and its Government have, in point of fact, ceased to exist. In the same way, the Agreements concluded between the U.S.S.R. and Poland have ceased to operate. Left to her own devices and bereft of leadership, Poland has become a suitable field for all manner of hazards and surprises, which may constitute a threat to the U.S.S.R. For these reasons the Soviet Government, who has hitherto been neutral, cannot any longer preserve a neutral attitude towards these facts... In these circumstances, the Soviet Government have directed the High Command of the Red Army to order troops to cross the frontier and to take under their protection the life and property of the population of Western Ukraine and Western Belarus.  People's Commissar for Foreign Affairs of the U.S.S.R. V. Molotov, September 17, 1939 [71]\\r\\nMolotov declared on the radio that all treaties between the Soviet Union and Poland were now void; the Polish government had abandoned its people and effectively ceased to exist.[27][72] On the same day, the Red Army crossed the border into Poland.[1][67]\\r\\nIn the morning of 17 September 1939, Polish administration was still active on the whole territory of six eastern voivodeships, plus on parts of territories of additional five voivodeships; in eastern Poland, schools were opened in mid-September 1939.[73] Polish Army units concentrated their activities in two areas ÿ southern (Tomasz܇w Lubelski, Zamo??, Lw܇w), and central (Warsaw, Modlin, and the Bzura river). Due to stubborn Polish defense and lack of fuel, the German advance stalled, and the situation stabilized for the areas east of the line August܇w ÿ Grodno ÿ Bia?ystok ÿ Kobry ÿ Kowel ÿ ?܇?kiew ÿ Lw܇w ÿ ?ydacz܇w ÿ Stryj ÿ Turka.[74] Rail connections were operating in approximately one-third of the territory of the country, and both passenger and cargo traffic was moving on the borders with five neighboring countries (Lithuania, Latvia, Soviet Union, Romania, and Hungary). In Pisk, assembly of PZL.37 ?o? planes was going on, in a PZL factory that had been moved from Warsaw.[75] A French Navy ship carrying Renault R35 tanks for Poland approached the Romanian port of Constanta.[76] Another ship, with artillery equipment, had just left Marseilles. Altogether, seventeen French ships with materiel were heading towards Romania, carrying fifty tanks, twenty airplanes, and large quantities of ammunition and explosives.[74] Several major cities were still in Polish hands, such as Warsaw, Lw܇w, Wilno, Grodno, ?uck, Tarnopol, and Lublin (captured by the Germans on 18 September). According to Leszek Moczulski, approximately 750,000 soldiers were still in the ranks of Polish Army (Polish historians Czes?aw Grzelak?(pl) and Henryk Staczyk?(pl) claim that the Polish Army still had 650,000 soldiers,[74]) including twenty six infantry divisions and two motorized brigades. (One of the latter, the Warsaw Armoured Motorized Brigade, had not yet taken part in combat, and on 14 September began to move southwards, to join Army Krak܇w.)[77]\\r\\nThe Polish Army, although weakened by weeks of fighting, still was a formidable force. As Moczulski wrote, on 17 September 1939, the Polish Army was still bigger than most European armies and strong enough to fight the Wehrmacht for a long time.[75] On the Baranowicze ÿ ?uniniec ÿ R܇wne line, rail transport of troops from the northeastern corner of the country towards the Romanian Bridgehead was going on day and night (among them were the 35th Reserve Infantry Division under Colonel Jaros?aw Szafran,[78] and the so-called \\"Grodno Group\\" (\\"Grupa grodzieska\\") of Colonel Bohdan Hulewicz?(pl)), and the second largest battle of the September Campaign ÿ Battle of Tomasz܇w Lubelski, started on the day of the Soviet invasion. According to Leszek Moczulski, around 250,000 Polish soldiers were fighting in central Poland, 350,000 were getting ready to defend the Romanian Bridgehead, 35,000 were north of Polesie, and 10,000 were fighting on the Baltic coast of Poland, in Hel and Gdynia. Due to the ongoing battles in the area of Warsaw, Modlin, the Bzura, Zamo??, Lw܇w and Tomasz܇w Lubelski, most German divisions were ordered to move back towards these locations. The area remaining in control of the Polish authorities was some 140,000 square kilometers ÿ approximately 200 kilometers wide and 950 kilometers long ÿ from the Daugava to the Carpathian Mountains.[74] Polish Radio Baranowicze and Polish Radio Wilno stopped working on 16 September, after having been bombed by the Luftwaffe, but Polish Radio Lw܇w and Polish Radio Warsaw II still worked on 17 September.[79]\\r\\nThe Red Army entered the eastern regions of Poland with seven field armies, containing between 450,000 and 1,000,000 troops, split between two fronts.[1] Comandarm 2nd rank Mikhail Kovalyov led the Red Army in the invasion on the Belarusian Front, while Comandarm 1st rank Semyon Timoshenko commanded the invasion on the Ukrainian Front.[1]\\r\\nUnder the Polish Plan West defensive plan, Poland assumed the Soviet Union would remain neutral during a conflict with Germany. As a result, Polish commanders deployed most of their troops to the west, to face the German invasion. By this time, no more than 20 under-strength battalions, consisting of about 20,000 troopers of the Border Protection Corps, defended the eastern border.[1][80] When the Red Army invaded Poland on 17 September, the Polish military was in the midst of a fighting retreat towards the Romanian Bridgehead whereupon they would regroup and await British and French relief.\\r\\nWhen the Soviet Union invaded, Rydz-?mig?y was initially inclined to order the eastern border forces to resist, but was dissuaded by Prime Minister Felicjan S?awoj Sk?adkowski and President Ignacy Mo?cicki.[1][80] At 04:00 on 17 September, Rydz-?mig?y ordered the Polish troops to fall back, stipulating that they only engage Soviet troops in self-defense.[1] However, the German invasion had severely damaged the Polish communication systems, causing command and control problems for the Polish forces.[81] In the resulting confusion, clashes between Polish and Soviet forces occurred along the border.[1][80] General Wilhelm Orlik-Rckemann, who took command of the Border Protection Corps on 30 August, received no official directives after his appointment.[7] As a result, he and his subordinates continued to engage Soviet forces proactively, before dissolving the group on 1 October.[7]\\r\\nThe Polish government refused to surrender or negotiate a peace and instead ordered all units to evacuate Poland and reorganize in France.[1] The day after the Soviet invasion started, the Polish government crossed into Romania. Polish units proceeded to manoeuvre towards the Romanian bridgehead area, sustaining German attacks on one flank and occasionally clashing with Soviet troops on the other. In the days following the evacuation order, the Germans defeated the Polish Krak܇w Army and Lublin Army at the Battle of Tomasz܇w Lubelski.[82]\\r\\nSoviet units often met their German counterparts advancing from the opposite direction. Notable examples of co-operation occurred between the two armies in the field. The Wehrmacht passed the Brest Fortress to the Soviet 29th Tank Brigade, which had been seized after the Battle of Brze?? Litewski on 17 September.[83] German General Heinz Guderian and Soviet Brigadier Semyon Krivoshein on 22 September held a joint parade in the town.[83] Lw܇w (now Lviv) surrendered on 22 September, days after the Germans had handed the siege operations over to the Soviets.[84] Soviet forces had taken Wilno (now Vilnius) on 19 September after a two-day battle, and they took Grodno on 24 September after a four-day battle. By 28 September, the Red Army had reached the line formed by the Narew, Western Bug, Vistula and San riversthe border agreed in advance with the Germans.\\r\\nDespite a tactical Polish victory on 28 September at the Battle of Szack, the outcome of the larger conflict was never in doubt.[85] Civilian volunteers, militias and reorganised retreating units held out against German forces in the Polish capital, Warsaw, until 28 September, and the Modlin Fortress, north of Warsaw, surrendered the next day after an intense sixteen-day battle. On 1 October, Soviet troops drove Polish units into the forests in the battle of Wytyczno, one of the last direct confrontations of the campaign.[86] Several isolated Polish garrisons managed to hold their positions long after being surrounded, such as those in the Volhynian Sarny Fortified Area which held out until 25 September. The last operational unit of the Polish Army to surrender was General Franciszek Kleeberg's Independent Operational Group Polesie. Kleeberg surrendered on 6 October after the four-day Battle of Kock, effectively ending the September Campaign. On 31 October, Molotov reported to the Supreme Soviet: \\"A short blow by the German army, and subsequently by the Red Army, was enough for nothing to be left of this bastard (ɶ) of the Treaty of Versailles\\".[87][88]\\r\\nThe response of non-ethnic Poles to the situation added a further complication. Many Ukrainians, Belarusians and Jews welcomed the invading troops.[89] Local Communists gathered people to welcome Red Army troops in the traditional Slavic way by presenting bread and salt in the eastern suburb of Brest. For this occasion a sort of triumphal arch was made of two poles, decked with spruce branches and flowers. A banner, a long strip of red cloth with a slogan in Russian, glorifying the USSR and welcoming the Red Army, crowned the arch.[90] The local reaction was mentioned by Lev Mekhlis, who told Stalin that the people of West Ukraine welcomed the Soviets \\"like true liberators\\".[91] The Organization of Ukrainian Nationalists rebelled against the Poles, and communist partisans organized local uprisings, such as that in Skidel.[1]\\r\\nThe reaction of France and Britain to the Soviet invasion and annexation of Eastern Poland was muted, since neither country expected or wanted a confrontation with the Soviet Union at that time.[92][93] Under the terms of the Polish-British Common Defence Pact of 25 August 1939, the British had promised assistance if a European power attacked Poland.[Note 9] A secret protocol of the pact, however, specified that the European power referred to Germany.[95] When Polish Ambassador Edward Raczyski reminded Foreign Secretary Edward Frederick Lindley Wood of the pact, he was bluntly told that it was Britain's business whether to declare war on the Soviet Union.[92] British Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain considered making a public commitment to restore the Polish state but in the end issued only general condemnations.[92] This stance represented Britain's attempt at balance: its security interests included trade with the Soviets that would support its war effort and the possibility of a future Anglo-Soviet alliance against Germany.[95] Public opinion in Britain was divided between expressions of outrage at the invasion and a perception that Soviet claims to the region were reasonable.[95]\\r\\nWhile the French had made promises to Poland, including the provision of air support, these were not honoured. A Franco-Polish Military Alliance was signed in 1921 and amended thereafter. The agreements were not strongly supported by the French military leadership, though; the relationship deteriorated during the 1920s and 1930s.[96] In the French view, the German-Soviet alliance was fragile and overt denunciation of, or action against, the Soviets would not serve either France's or Poland's best interests.[93] Once the Soviets moved into Poland, the French and the British decided there was nothing they could do for Poland in the short term and began planning for a long-term victory instead. The French had advanced tentatively into the Saar region in early September, but after the Polish defeat they retreated behind the Maginot Line on 4 October.[97] On 1 October 1939, Winston Churchillvia the radiostated:\\r\\n... That the Russian armies should stand on this line was clearly necessary for the safety of Russia against the Nazi menace. At any rate, the line is there, and an Eastern Front has been created which Nazi Germany does not dare assail. When Herr von Ribbentrop was summoned to Moscow last week it was to learn the fact, and to accept the fact, that the Nazi designs upon the Baltic States and upon the Ukraine must come to a dead stop.[98]\\r\\nIn October 1939, Molotov reported to the Supreme Soviet that the Soviets had suffered 737 deaths and 1,862 casualties during the campaign, although Polish specialists claim up to 3,000 deaths and 8,000ÿ10,000 wounded.[1] On the Polish side, 3,000ÿ7,000 soldiers died fighting the Red Army, with 230,000ÿ450,000 taken prisoner.[4] The Soviets often failed to honour the terms of surrender. In some cases, they promised Polish soldiers their freedom and then arrested them when they laid down their arms.[1]\\r\\nThe Soviet Union had ceased to recognise the Polish state at the start of the invasion. Neither side issued a formal declaration of war; this decision had significant consequences, and Smigly-Rydz would be criticised for it.[99] The Soviets killed tens of thousands of Polish prisoners of war, some during the campaign itself.[100] On 24 September, the Soviets killed 42 staff and patients of a Polish military hospital in the village of Grabowiec, near Zamo??.[101] The Soviets also executed all the Polish officers they captured after the Battle of Szack, on 28 September 1939.[85] Over 20,000 Polish military personnel and civilians perished in the Katyn massacre.[1][83] Torture was used by the NKVD on a wide scale in various prisons, especially those in small towns.[102]\\r\\nThe Poles and the Soviets re-established diplomatic relations in 1941, following the SikorskiÿMayski Agreement; but the Soviets broke them off again in 1943 after the Polish government demanded an independent examination of the recently discovered Katyn burial pits (Katyn massacre).[103][104] The Soviets then lobbied the Western Allies to recognise the pro-Soviet Polish government of Wanda Wasilewska in Moscow.[105][106]\\r\\nOn 28 September 1939, the Soviet Union and Germany signed the GermanÿSoviet Treaty of Friendship, Cooperation and Demarcation, changing the secret terms of the MolotovÿRibbentrop Pact. They moved Lithuania into the Soviet sphere of influence and shifted the border in Poland to the east, giving Germany more territory.[2] By this arrangement, often described as a fourth partition of Poland,[1] the Soviet Union secured almost all Polish territory east of the line of the rivers Pisa, Narew, Western Bug and San. This amounted to about 200,000?km2 of land, inhabited by 13.5 million Polish citizens.[81] The border created in this agreement roughly corresponded to the Curzon Line drawn by the British in 1919, a point that would successfully be used by Stalin during negotiations with the Allies at the Teheran and Yalta Conferences.[107] The Red Army had originally sown confusion among the locals by claiming that they were arriving to save Poland from the Nazis.[108] Their advance surprised Polish communities and their leaders, who had not been advised how to respond to a Soviet invasion. Polish and Jewish citizens may at first have preferred a Soviet regime to a German one.[109] However, the Soviets were quick to impose their ideology on the local ways of life. For instance, the Soviets quickly began confiscating, nationalising and redistributing all private and state-owned Polish property.[110] During the two years following the annexation, the Soviets also arrested approximately 100,000 Polish citizens.[111] Due to a lack of access to secret Soviet archives, for many years after the war the estimates of the number of Polish citizens deported to Siberia from the areas of Eastern Poland, as well as the number who perished under Soviet rule, were largely guesswork. A wide range of numbers was given in various works, between 350,000 and 1,500,000 for the number deported to Siberia and between 250,000 and 1,000,000 for the number who died, these numbers mostly included civilians.[112] With the opening of the Soviet secret archives after 1989, the lower range of these estimates has emerged as closer to the truth. In August 2009, on the occasion of the 70th anniversary of the Soviet invasion, the authoritative Polish Institute of National Remembrance announced that its researchers reduced the estimate of the number of people deported to Siberia from one million to 320,000, and estimated that 150,000 Polish citizens perished under Soviet rule during the war.[113]\\r\\nOf the 13.5 million civilians living in the newly annexed territories, according to the last official Polish census the population was over 38% Poles (5.1 million), 37% Ukrainians (4.7 million), 14.5% Belarusians, 8.4% Jews, 0.9% Russians and 0.6% Germans.[114]\\r\\nOn 26 October, elections to Belorussian and Ukrainian assemblies were held to give the annexation an appearance of validity.[Note 10] The Belarusians and Ukrainians in Poland had been increasingly alienated by the Polonization policies of the Polish government and its repression of their separatist movements, so they felt little loyalty towards the Polish state.[10][116] Not all Belarusians and Ukrainians, however, trusted the Soviet regime.[108] In practice, the poor generally welcomed the Soviets, and the elites tended to join the opposition, despite supporting the reunification itself.[117][118] The Soviets quickly introduced Sovietization policies in Western Belorussia and Western Ukraine, including compulsory collectivization of the whole region. In the process, they ruthlessly broke up political parties and public associations and imprisoned or executed their leaders as \\"enemies of the people\\".[108] The Soviet authorities also suppressed the anti-Polish Organization of Ukrainian Nationalists, which had actively resisted the Polish regime since the 1920s; aiming for an independent, undivided Ukrainian state.[118][119] The unifications of 1939 were nevertheless a decisive event in the history of Ukraine and Belarus, because they produced the two republics which eventually achieved independence in 1991 after the fall of the Soviet Union.[120]\\r\\nSoviet censors later suppressed many details of the 1939 invasion and its aftermath.[121][122] From the start The Politburo called the operation a \\"liberation campaign\\", and later Soviet statements and publications never wavered from that line.[123] Despite the publication of a recovered copy of the secret protocols of the MolotovÿRibbentrop Pact in the western media, for decades, it was the official policy of the Soviet Union to deny the existence of the protocols.[124] The existence of the secret protocol was officially denied until 1989. Censorship was also applied in the People's Republic of Poland, in order to preserve the image of \\"Polish-Soviet friendship\\" which was promoted by the two communist governments. Official policy only allowed accounts of the 1939 campaign that portrayed it as a reunification of the Belarusian and Ukrainian peoples and a liberation of the Polish people from \\"oligarchic capitalism.\\" The authorities strongly discouraged any further study or teaching of the subject.[83][86][125] Various underground publications addressed the issue, as did other media, such as the 1982 protest song Ballada wrze?niowa by Jacek Kaczmarski.[86][126]\\r\\nIn 2009, Russian Prime Minister Vladimir Putin wrote in the Polish daily Gazeta Wyborcza that the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact concluded in August 1939 was \\"immoral\\".[127] In 2015, then President of the Russian Federation, he commented: \\"In this sense I share the opinion of our culture minister (Vladimir Medinsky praising the pact as a triumph of Stalin's diplomacy) that this pact had significance for ensuring the security of the USSR\\".[128] In 2016 the Russian Supreme Court upheld the decision of a lower court, which had found a blogger, Vladimir Luzgin,[129] guilty of the \\"rehabilitation of Nazism\\" for reposting a text on social media that described the invasion of Poland in 1939 as a joint effort by Nazi Germany and the Soviet Union.[130]","input":"When did germany and the soviet union split poland?"},{"output":"4,700","context":"\\r\\n\\r\\nParliament House is the meeting place of the Parliament of Australia, located in Canberra, the capital of Australia. The building was designed by Mitchell/Giurgola & Thorp Architects and opened on 9 May 1988 by Elizabeth?II, Queen of Australia. It cost more than A$1.1 billion to build.\\r\\n\\r\\nFederal Parliament meetings were first held in Melbourne until 1927. Between 1927 and 1988, the Parliament of Australia met in the Provisional Parliament House, which is now known as \\"Old Parliament House\\". Construction of Australia's permanent Parliament House was delayed while its location was debated. Construction of the new building began in 1981. The principal design of the structure is based on the shape of two boomerangs and is topped by an 81-metre (266?ft) flagpole. \\r\\n\\r\\nParliament House contains 4,700 rooms, and many areas are open to the public. The main foyer contains a marble staircase and leads to the Great Hall, which has a large tapestry on display. The House of Representatives chamber is decorated green, while the Senate chamber has a red colour scheme. Between the two chambers is the Members' Hall, which has a water feature and is not open to the public. The Ministerial Wing houses the office of the prime minister and other ministers.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1901, when the six British colonies in Australia federated to form the Commonwealth of Australia, Melbourne and Sydney were the two largest cities in the country, but the long history of rivalry between them meant that neither could become the national capital. Section 125 of the Constitution of Australia therefore provided that:\\r\\n\\r\\nThe seat of Government of the Commonwealth shall be determined by the Parliament, and shall be within territory which shall have been granted to or acquired by the Commonwealth, and shall be vested in and belong to the Commonwealth, and shall be in the State of New South Wales, and be distant not less than one hundred miles from Sydney.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nSuch territory shall contain an area of not less than one hundred square miles, and such portion thereof as shall consist of Crown lands shall be granted to the Commonwealth without any payment therefor. The Parliament shall sit at Melbourne until it meet at the seat of Government.\\r\\nIn 1909, after much argument, the Parliament decided that the new capital would be in the southern part of New South Wales, on the site which is now Canberra. The Commonwealth acquired control over the land in 1911, but World War?I intervened, and nothing was done for some years to build the city. Federal Parliament did not leave Melbourne until 1927.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the meantime the Australian Parliament met in the 19th-century edifice of Parliament House, Melbourne,[1] while the Victorian State Parliament met in the nearby Royal Exhibition Building for 26 years.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter World War I the Federal Capital Advisory Committee was established to prepare Canberra to be the seat of government, including the construction of a Parliament House. The committee decided that it would be best to erect a \\"provisional\\" building, to serve for a predicted 50 years until a new, \\"permanent\\" House could be built. In the end, Old Parliament House was Parliament's home for 61 years. In the last decade of its use as a parliament the building had a chronic shortage of available space.[2] \\r\\nIn 1978 the Fraser government decided to proceed with a new building on Capital Hill, and the Parliament House Construction Authority was created.[2]  A two-stage competition was announced, for which the Authority consulted the Royal Australian Institute of Architects and, together with the National Capital Development Commission, made available to competitors a brief and competition documents. The design competition drew 329 entries from 29 countries.[3]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe competition winner was the Philadelphia-based architectural firm of Mitchell/Giurgola, with the on-site work directed by the Italian-born architect Romaldo Giurgola,[4][5] with a design which involved burying most of the building under Capital Hill, and capping the edifice with an enormous spire topped by a large Australian flag. The facades, however, included deliberate imitation of some of the patterns of the Old Parliament House, so that there is a slight resemblance despite the massive difference of scale.\\r\\n\\r\\nGiurgola placed an emphasis the visual aethestics of the building by using landscape architect Peter G. Rolland to direct civil engineers, a reversal of the traditional roles in Australia.[3] Rolland played a pivotal role in the design, development and coordination of all surface elements including pool design, paving, conceptual lighting and art work locations.[3]  Horticultural experts from the Australian National Botanic Gardens and a government nursery were consulted on plant selection.[3] Permanent irrigation has been limited to only the more formal areas.[3] Irwinconsult was commissioned to provide structural engineering, including quality assurance of all structural elements, to deliver a building with a designed life-span of 200 years.[6]\\r\\n\\r\\nConstruction began in 1981, and the House was intended to be ready by Australia Day, 26 January 1988, the 200th anniversary of European settlement in Australia.[3] It was expected to cost A$220 million. Neither the deadline nor the budget was met.[7]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe building was finally opened by Queen Elizabeth II, Queen of Australia on 9 May 1988,[8] the anniversary of the opening of both the first Federal Parliament in Melbourne on 9 May 1901 by the Duke of Cornwall and York (later King George?V),[9] and of the Provisional Parliament House in Canberra on 9 May 1927 by the Duke of York (later King George?VI).[10]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe flag flown from the 81 metres (266 feet) flagpole is 12.8 by 6.4?m (42 by 21?ft), about the size of half a tennis court.[11] The flagpole weighs 250?tonnes and is made of polished stainless steel from Wollongong. It was designed to be the pinnacle of Parliament House and is an easily recognisable symbol of national government. It is visible by day from outside and inside Parliament House and floodlit at night. The flag itself weighs approximately 15?kg (33?lb).\\r\\n\\r\\nThe site covers 80 acres (32 hectares).[3]  The building was designed to \\"sit above\\" Old Parliament House when seen from a distance. The building is four metres (13?feet) higher than the original height of the hill.[3] About one million cubic metres (35,000,000?cubic feet) of rock had to be excavated from the site. It was used to fill low-lying areas in the city.[3]  Most of the granite used was sourced from Australia. Twice the amount needed was quarried as a very high standard of granite was required particularly for the curved walls.[3]\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was proposed originally to demolish Old Parliament House so that there would be an uninterrupted vista from the New Parliament House to Lake Burley Griffin and the Australian War Memorial, but there were successful representations for preservation of the historic building, which now houses a parliamentary museum.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe original idea was for Parliament House to be open freely to the public, and the sweeping lawns leading up to the entrances[citation needed] were intended to symbolise this. The building is a major visitor attraction in Canberra with about 1 million visits each year.[12] With the increased risk of terrorist attacks in recent years, the security of Parliament House has been increased greatly. One result has been the construction of crash barriers blocking vehicular access to the lawns.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe public entrance to Parliament House opens into a main foyer leading into the Great Hall, which features a tapestry based on a painting by Arthur Boyd, the original of which is also displayed in the building. Functions that have parliamentary and federal relevance often take place here, but the Great Hall is also open to functions for the general public, such as weddings, and the nearby University of Canberra hosts graduation ceremonies here.\\r\\n\\r\\nBelow the tapestry of the Great Hall is a removable division which opens on to the Members' Hall, which has a water feature at its centre. This is an area restricted to security-classified occupants of the building and special visitors. Directly ahead of the Members' Hall is the Ministerial Wing, housing the office suites of the Prime Minister and government Ministers. The Members' Hall has access to the House of Representatives and the Senate buildings to the left and right of the main entrance to the halls respectively. Public access to the visitors' galleries and the Main Committee Room is via an upper level reached by impressive marble staircases ascending from the entrance foyer. There are also 19 committee rooms which are open to the public and a highly secure Cabinet Room on the ground floor.[12]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nIn commemoration of the colour scheme of the British House of Commons, the House of Representatives is decorated in green. However, the colour is muted to suggest the colour of eucalyptus leaves, or the Australian bush.\\r\\n\\r\\nFrom the perspective of the image, the press gallery is ahead, with public galleries containing 388 seats[14] to the left and right. Soundproofed galleries for school groups are directly above these, as no talking is permitted when the House members are present.\\r\\n\\r\\nFrontbench (Cabinet) members approach the table with the ornate box (pictured), known as the despatch box, to speak. Backbenchers have a microphone on their desk, and merely stand to speak (unless they cannot stand), in accordance with standing order 60.\\r\\n\\r\\nAlso on the table is a copy of Hansard and where the clerk and deputy clerk sit. The clerk needs to know all the rules of Parliament and is responsible for ringing the bells during a division (voting). In front of the clerk are the hour glasses. The outer glasses measure four minutes and the middle glass measures one minute. These glasses are turned when there is a division; one of the four-minute glasses is turned and the bells will ring and the clocks will flash green for the House of Representatives or red for the Senate for four minutes. After the hour glass stops, the house's attendants will lock the doors and the whips will count the votes. Members vote by either moving to the government side of the house for a vote for a bill or the opposition side for a vote against a bill. If there is successive divisions, and there is no debate after the first division, the middle one-minute hour glasses are turned and the bells are rung for one minute.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs is the custom with Westminster parliaments, members of the governing party sit to the Speaker's right, and the Opposition sits to the Speaker's left. Independents and minor parties sit on the cross-benches. The long benches (the front benches) closest to the despatch boxes are reserved for the Cabinet on the government's side and the \\"Shadow Cabinet\\" on the Opposition's side.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Senate chamber matches the colour scheme of the House of Lords, decorated in red, but muted to tints of ochre, suggesting the earth and the colours of the outback.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe gallery arrangement is almost identical to that of the House of Representatives. Unlike the House of Representatives, only the leader of the government or opposition in the Senate approaches the lectern; other frontbench senators and all backbench senators have a desk microphone. As can be seen from the illustrations, unlike the House of Representatives, there is no distinction between the front and back benches in the Senate chamber; Senate ministers and their opposition counterparts have the same two-seat benches as all other senators. The press gallery is located above the Senate chamber. The presiding officer of the Australian Senate is the President of the Senate, who occupies a position in the Senate chamber similar to that of the Speaker of the House of Representatives. Behind the seat of the President of the Senate are two large seats which are modern versions of thrones. The larger is used by the Governor-General or the monarch (when visiting) when they open Parliament at the start of a new parliamentary session. The vice-regal consort or the royal consort (when visiting) sits in the smaller throne.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Parliament House Art Collection of over 6,000 works includes commissioned (and purchased) portraits of every prime minister, governor-general, president of the senate and speaker of the house, as well as other works of art significant to Australia.[15][16]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe new Parliament House is a central hub for events in Canberra, hosting many of the nation's largest and most important function events. The Parliament House is a place for meetings, conferences (government, and private), celebrations, and other miscellaneous uses. The Parliament House is one of the few parliament houses in the world where private events are permitted.[17] The Parliament House has 14 event spaces that can be used for special events.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 2011, the Department of Parliamentary Services commissioned a pilot 43.3?kW photovoltaic system on the roof of Parliament House in Canberra. The system is split between two locations, with 192 panels installed on the Senate wing with the remaining 42 panels on the roof of the Gardeners' Compound.[18] At the time of construction, the system was one of the largest installed for solar power in Australia.\\r\\n\\r\\nAccording to the Department of Parliamentary Services, the system was switched on in June 2011 and has performed as expected by providing enough power for lighting in both the House of Representatives and the Senate.[18] This equates to an approximate saving of $9,000 which is expected to rise to $17,000 annually.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe system received an award from the Clean Energy Council in 2012 for 'Best design and installation of a grid-connect power system greater than 10?kW.'[19]\\r\\n\\r\\nCoordinates: 351829S 1490730E? / ?35.308S 149.125E? / -35.308; 149.125","input":"How many rooms are there in parliament house?"},{"output":"Daws Butler","context":"Yogi Bear is a cartoon character who has appeared in numerous comic books, animated television shows and films. He made his debut in 1958 as a supporting character in The Huckleberry Hound Show.\\r\\nYogi Bear was the first breakout character created by Hanna-Barbera and was eventually more popular than Huckleberry Hound.[1] In January 1961, he was given his own show, The Yogi Bear Show, sponsored by Kellogg's, which included the segments Snagglepuss and Yakky Doodle.[2] Hokey Wolf replaced his segment on The Huckleberry Hound Show.[3] A musical animated feature film, Hey There, It's Yogi Bear!, was produced in 1964.\\r\\nYogi was one of several Hanna-Barbera characters to have a collar. This allowed animators to keep his body static, redrawing only his head in each frame when he spoke  a method that reduced the number of drawings needed for a seven-minute cartoon from around 14,000 to around 2,000.[4]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nLike many Hanna-Barbera characters, Yogi's personality and mannerisms were based on a popular celebrity of the time. Art Carney's Ed Norton character on The Honeymooners was said to be Yogi's inspiration;[5][6] his voice mannerisms broadly mimic Carney as Norton.[7] Norton, in turn, received influence from the Borscht Belt and comedians of vaudeville.[6]\\r\\nYogi's name was similar to that of contemporary baseball star Yogi Berra, who was known for his amusing quotes, such as \\"half the lies they tell about me aren't true.\\" Berra sued Hanna-Barbera for defamation, but their management claimed that the similarity of the names was just a coincidence. Berra withdrew his suit, but the defense was considered implausible.[8] At the time Yogi Bear first hit TV screens, Yogi Berra was a household name.[9]\\r\\nThe plot of most of Yogi's cartoons centered on his antics in the fictional Jellystone Park, a variant of the real Yellowstone National Park. Yogi, accompanied by his constant companion Boo-Boo Bear, would often try to steal picnic baskets from campers in the park, much to the displeasure of Park Ranger Smith. Yogi's girlfriend, Cindy Bear, sometimes appeared and usually disapproved of Yogi's antics.\\r\\nBesides often speaking in rhyme, Yogi Bear had a number of catchphrases, including his pet name for picnic baskets (\\"pic-a-nic baskets\\") and his favorite self-promotion (\\"I'm smarter than the av-er-age bear!\\"),[10] although he often overestimates his own cleverness. Another characteristic of Yogi was his deep and silly voice. He often greets the ranger with a cordial, \\"Hello, Mr. Ranger, sir!\\" and \\"Hey there, Boo Boo!\\" as his preferred greeting to his sidekick, Boo Boo. Yogi would also often use puns in his speech, and had a habit of pronouncing large words with a long vocal flourish.\\r\\nAnimation historian Christopher P. Lehman considers the original concept of the Yogi Bear series to contain political symbolism relative to its era of production. During the late 1950s and early 1960s, racial segregation in the United States was still legally enforced, people were confined to living in their designated social \\"place\\", and attempts to venture outside it came with serious consequences.[11] Yogi also has a designated social place, restricted to spending his life in Jellystone Park, under an overseer in the form of a white park ranger.[11]\\r\\nYogi is living in social confinement, but tries to take advantage of his situation. People come to the Park to have picnics and bring with them picnic baskets. Yogi resorts to theft, stealing the picnic baskets, and enjoying their contents. Yogi's habitual criminality and preoccupation with his own nourishment and survival are not portrayed as negative traits. He is depicted as a sympathetic protagonist.[11]\\r\\nYogi never actually challenges the social hierarchy of the Park, does not seriously challenge the authority of the ranger over him, and does not seek more autonomy in his life. Lehman contrasts Yogi's acceptance of the way things are with the activists of the series' contemporary Civil Rights Movement who did challenge the way things were. They wanted to move beyond their designated place and integrate into wider society. The press and politicians of the time were portraying these activists as radicals and opposed their efforts.[11]\\r\\nFrom the time of the character's debut until 1988, Yogi was voiced by voice actor Daws Butler. Butler died in 1988; his last performance as Yogi was in the television film Yogi and the Invasion of the Space Bears.\\r\\nAfter Butler's death, Greg Burson stepped in to perform the role (Butler had taught Burson personally how to voice Yogi as well as his other characters). Greg Burson died in 2008.\\r\\nJeff Bergman and Billy West also performed the character throughout the 1990s and early 2000s for various Cartoon Network commercials and bumpers.\\r\\nIn the Yogi Bear film, the character is voiced by actor Dan Aykroyd.\\r\\nIn the animated stop motion sketch comedy show Robot Chicken created by Seth Green, Dan Milano voiced Yogi Bear.[12]\\r\\nScott Innes performed the voice of Yogi, along with Boo Boo, in At Picnic, Forest, and Honey Lesson.\\r\\nA live-action/computer-animated film titled Yogi Bear was released by Warner Bros. in December 2010. The movie featured Dan Aykroyd as the voice of Yogi Bear. The film, adapting the television series, follows the adventures of Yogi Bear and his pal Boo-Boo in Jellystone Park, as they avoid Ranger Smith who is trying to stop Yogi from stealing picnic baskets.\\r\\n\\"Yogi\\" by the Ivy Three (1960), sung in a voice mimicking Yogi Bear.

The Google Play store had over 82 billion app downloads in 2016 and has reached over 2.7 million apps published in 2017. It has been the subject of multiple issues concerning security, in which malicious software has been approved and uploaded to the store and downloaded by users, with varying degrees of severity.\\r\\nGoogle Play was launched on March 6, 2012, bringing together the Android Market, Google Music, and the Google eBookstore under one brand, marking a shift in Google's digital distribution strategy. The services operating under the Google Play banner are: Google Play Books, Google Play Games, Google Play Movies & TV, Google Play Music, and Google Play Newsstand. Following their rebranding, Google has gradually expanded the geographical support for each of the services.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nAs of February 2017[update], Google Play features over 2.7 million Android applications.[1] Users in over 145 countries can purchase apps, although Google notes on its support pages that \\"Paid content may not be available in some provinces or territories, even if the governing country is listed above.\\"[2] Developers in over 150 locations can distribute apps on Google Play, though not every location supports merchant registration.[3] To distribute apps, developers have to pay a one-time $25 registration fee for a Google Play Developer Console account.[4] App developers can control which countries an app is distributed to, as well as the pricing for the app and in-app purchases in each country.[5][6] Developers receive 70% of the application price, while the remaining 30% goes to the distribution partner and operating fees.[7] Developers can set up sales, with the original price striked out and a banner underneath informing users when the sale ends.[8][9][10] Google Play allows developers to release early versions of apps to a select group of users, as alpha or beta tests.[11] Developers can also release apps through staged rollouts, in which \\"your update reaches only a percentage of your users, which you can increase over time.\\"[12] Users can pre-order select apps (as well as movies, music, books, and games) to have the items delivered as soon as they are available.[13] Some network carriers offer billing for Google Play purchases, allowing users to opt for charges in the monthly phone bill rather than on credit cards.[14] Users can request refunds within 48 hours after a purchase if \\"something you bought isn't working, isn't what you expected, was bought by accident, or you changed your mind about the purchase\\".[15] Apps meeting specific usability requirements can qualify as an Android Wear app.[16]\\r\\nGoogle Play Games is an online gaming service for Android that features real-time multiplayer gaming capabilities, cloud saves, social and public leaderboards, and achievements. The service was introduced at the Google I/O 2013 Developer Conference,[17] and the standalone mobile app was launched on July 24, 2013.[18]\\r\\nGoogle Play Music is a music and podcast streaming service and online music locker. It features over 40?million songs,[19] and gives users free cloud storage of up to 50,000 songs.[20]\\r\\nAs of May 2017[update], Google Play Music is available in 64 countries.[21]\\r\\nGoogle Play Books is an ebook digital distribution service. Google Play offers over five million ebooks available for purchase,[22] and users can also upload up to 1,000 of their own ebooks in the form of PDF or EPUB file formats.[23]\\r\\nAs of January 2017[update], Google Play Books is available in 75 countries.[21]\\r\\nGoogle Play Movies & TV is a video on demand service offering movies and television shows available for purchase or rental, depending on availability.[24]\\r\\nAs of January 2017[update], movies are available in over 110 countries, while TV shows are available only in Australia, Austria, Canada, France, Germany, Japan, Switzerland, the United States and the United Kingdom.[21]\\r\\nGoogle Play Newsstand is a news aggregator and digital newsstand service offering subscriptions to digital magazines and topical news feeds.[25][26]\\r\\nAs of January 2017[update], the basic Newsstand service, with topical news feeds, is available worldwide. Paid Newsstand content is available in over 35 countries.[21]\\r\\nGoogle Play, before March 2015, had a Devices section for users to purchase Google Nexus devices, Chromebooks, Chromecasts, other Google-branded hardware, and accessories. A separate online hardware retailer called the Google Store was introduced on March 11, 2015, replacing the Devices section of Google Play.[27][28]\\r\\nGoogle Play originated from three distinct products: Android Market, Google Music and Google eBookstore.\\r\\nThe Android Market was announced by Google on August 28, 2008,[29][30] and was made available to users on October 22.[31][32] In December 2010, content filtering was added to the Android Market, each app's details page started showing a promotional graphic at the top, and the maximum size of an app was raised from 25?megabytes to 50?megabytes.[33][34][35] The Google eBookstore was launched on December 6, 2010, debuting with three million ebooks, making it \\"the largest ebooks collection in the world\\".[36] In November 2011, Google announced Google Music, a section of the Play Store offering music purchases.[37][38] In March 2012, Google increased the maximum allowed size of an app by allowing developers to attach two expansion files to an app's basic download; each expansion file with a maximum size of 2?gigabytes, giving app developers a total of 4?gigabytes.[39][40] Also in March, the Android Market was re-branded as Google Play.[41][42][43]\\r\\nIn May 2016, it was announced that the Google Play Store, including all Android apps, would be coming to Chrome OS in September 2016.[44][45]\\r\\nApart from searching for content by name, apps can also be searched through keywords provided by the developer.[46] When searching for apps, users can press on suggested search filters, helping them to find apps matching the determined filters.[47] For the discoverability of apps, Play Store consists of lists featuring top apps in each category, including \\"Top Free\\", a list of the most popular free apps of all time; \\"Top Paid\\", a list of the most popular paid apps of all time; \\"Top Grossing\\", a list of apps generating the highest amounts of revenue; \\"Trending Apps\\", a list of apps with recent installation growth; \\"Top New Free\\", a list of the most popular new free apps; \\"Top New Paid\\", a list of the most popular new paid apps; \\"Featured\\", a list of new apps selected by the Google Play team; \\"Staff Picks\\", a frequently-updated list of apps selected by the Google Play team; \\"Editors' Choice\\", a list of apps considered the best of all time; and \\"Top Developer\\", a list of apps made by developers considered the best.[48] In March 2017, Google added a \\"Free App of the Week\\" section, offering one normally-paid app for free.[49][50] In July 2017, Google expanded its \\"Editors' Choice\\" section to feature curated lists of apps deemed to provide good Android experiences within overall themes, such as fitness, video calling and puzzle games.[51][52]\\r\\nGoogle Play enables users to know the popularity of apps, by displaying the number of times the app has been downloaded. The download count is a color-coded badge, with special color designations for surpassing certain app download milestones, including grey for 100, 500, 1,000 and 5,000 downloads, blue for 10,000 and 50,000 downloads, green for 100,000 and 500,000 downloads, and red/orange for 1 million, 5 million, 10 million and 1 billion downloads.[53][54]\\r\\nUsers can submit reviews and ratings for apps and digital content distributed through Google Play, which are displayed publicly. Ratings are based on a 5-point scale. App developers can respond to reviews[55][56] using the Google Play Developer Console.[57]\\r\\nGoogle has redesigned Google Play's interface on several occasions. In February 2011, Google introduced a website interface for then-named Android Market that provides access through a computer.[58] Applications purchased are downloaded and installed on an Android device remotely, with a \\"My Market Account\\" section letting users give their devices a nickname for easy recognition.[59] In May 2011, Google added new application lists to Android Market, including \\"Top Paid\\", \\"Top Free\\", \\"Editor's Choice\\", \\"Top Grossing\\", \\"Top Developers\\", and \\"Trending\\".[60][61] In July, Google introduced an interface with a focus on featured content, more search filters, and (in the US) book sales and movie rentals.[62] In May 2013, a redesign to the website interface matched the then-recently redesigned Android app.[63] In July 2014, the Play Store Android app added new headers to the Books/Movies sections, a new Additional Information screen offering a list featuring the latest available app version, installed size, and content rating, and simplified the app permissions prompt into overview categories.[64] A few days later, it got a redesign consistent with the then-new Material Design design language,[65][66] and the app was again updated in October 2015 to feature new animations, divide up the content into \\"Apps and Games\\" and \\"Entertainment\\" sections, as well as added support for languages read right-to-left.[67][68][69] In April 2016, Google announced a redesign of all the icons used for its suite of Play apps, adding a similar style and consistent look.[70][71] In May 2017, Google removed the shopping bag from the Google Play icon, with only the triangle and associated colors remaining.[72][73]\\r\\nGoogle states in its Developer Policy Center that \\"Google Play supports a variety of monetization strategies to benefit developers and users, including paid distribution, in-app products, subscriptions, and ad-based models\\", and requires developers to comply with the policies in order to \\"ensure the best user experience\\". It requires that developers charging for apps and downloads through Google Play must use Google Play's payment system. In-app purchases unlocking additional app functionality must also use the Google Play payment system, except in cases where the purchase \\"is solely for physical products\\" or \\"is for digital content that may be consumed outside of the app itself (e.g. songs that can be played on other music players).\\"[74] Support for paid applications was introduced on February 13, 2009 for developers in the United States and the United Kingdom,[75] with support expanded to an additional 29 countries on September 30, 2010.[76] The in-app billing system was originally introduced in March 2011.[77] All developers on Google Play are required to feature a physical address on the app's page in Google Play, a requirement established in September 2014.[78]\\r\\nIn February 2017, Google announced that it would let developers set sales for their apps, with the original price striked out and a banner underneath informing users when the sale ends. Google also announced that it had made changes to its algorithms to promote games based on user engagement and not just downloads. Finally, it announced new editorial pages for what it considers \\"optimal gaming experiences on Android\\", further promoting and curating games.[8][9][10]\\r\\nGoogle allows users to purchase content with credit or debit cards, carrier billing, gift cards, or through PayPal.[79] Google began rolling out carrier billing for purchases in May 2012,[14][80] followed by support for PayPal in May 2014.[81][82]\\r\\nThe rumor of Google Play gift cards started circulating online in August 2012 after references to it was discovered by Android Police in the 3.8.15 version update of the Play Store Android app.[83] Soon after, images of the gift cards started to leak,[84] and on August 21, 2012 they were made official by Google and rolled out over the next few weeks.[85][86]\\r\\nGoogle Play gift cards are currently available in Australia, Austria, Belgium, Brazil, Canada, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Hong Kong, India, Ireland, Italy, Japan, Mexico, Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Singapore, South Africa, South Korea, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, the United Kingdom and the United States.[87]\\r\\nGoogle introduced in-app subscriptions to Google Play in May 2012.[88][89] In June 2016, Google announced that subscriptions charged through Google Play would now split the revenue 85/15, where developers receive 85% of revenue and Google only takes 15%, a change from the traditional 70/30 split in years prior. The move followed Apple's then-recently announced change of the same model, although commentators were quick to point out that while Apple only grants the 85/15 revenue share after one year of active subscriptions, Google's subscription change takes effect immediately.[90][91][92]\\r\\n\\r\\nPlay Store is Google's official pre-installed app store on Android-certified devices. It provides access to content on the Google Play Store, including apps, books, magazines, music, movies, and television programs.[96]\\r\\nPlay Store filters the list of apps to those compatible with the user's device. Developers can target specific hardware components (such as compass), software components (such as widget), and Android versions (such as 7.0 Nougat).[97] Carriers can also ban certain apps from being installed on users' devices, for example tethering applications.[98]\\r\\nThere is no requirement that Android applications must be acquired using the Play Store. Users may download Android applications from a developer's website or through a third-party app store alternative.[99] Play Store applications are self-contained Android Package files (APK), similar to .exe files to install programs on Microsoft Windows computers.[100] On Android devices, an \\"Unknown sources\\" feature in Settings allows users to bypass the Play Store and install APKs from other sources.[101] Depending on developer preferences, some apps can be installed to a phone's external storage card.[102]\\r\\nThe Play Store app features a history of all installed apps. Users can remove apps from the list, with the changes also synchronizing to the Google Play website interface, where the option to remove apps from the history does not exist.[103]\\r\\nGoogle publishes the source code for Android through its \\"Android Open Source Project\\", allowing enthusiasts and developers to program and distribute their own modified versions of the operating system. However, not all these modified versions are compatible with apps developed for Google's official Android versions. The \\"Android Compatibility Program\\" serves to \\"define a baseline implementation of Android that is compatible with third-party apps written by developers\\". Only Android devices that comply with Google's compatibility requirements may install and access Google's Play Store application. As stated in a help page for the Android Open Source Project, \\"Devices that are \\"Android compatible\\" may participate in the Android ecosystem, including Android Market; devices that don't meet the compatibility requirements exist outside that ecosystem. In other words, the Android Compatibility Program is how we separate \\"Android compatible devices\\" from devices that merely run derivatives of the source code. We welcome all uses of the Android source code, but only Android compatible devicesas defined and tested by the Android Compatibility Programmay participate in the Android ecosystem.\\"[104]\\r\\nSome device manufacturers choose to use their own app store instead of - or in addition to - the Play Store. Examples include Amazon opting for Amazon Appstore instead of Google Play for its Kindle Fire tablet computers,[105] and Samsung adding Galaxy Apps for its line of Samsung Galaxy smartphones and tablets.[106]\\r\\nIn 2012, Google began decoupling certain aspects of its Android operating system (particularly its core applications) so they could be updated through the Google Play store independently of the OS. One of those components, Google Play Services, is a closed-source system-level process providing APIs for Google services, installed automatically on nearly all devices running Android 2.2 \\"Froyo\\" and higher. With these changes, Google can add new system functionality through Play Services and update apps without having to distribute an upgrade to the operating system itself.[107] As a result, Android 4.2 and 4.3 \\"Jelly Bean\\" contained relatively fewer user-facing changes, focusing more on minor changes and platform improvements.[108]\\r\\nIn April 2016, Google announced the Google Play Awards, described as \\"a way to recognize our incredible developer community and highlight some of the best apps and games\\". The awards showcase five nominees across ten award categories, and the apps are featured in a dedicated section of Google Play. Google stated that \\"Nominees were selected by a panel of experts on the Google Play team based on criteria emphasizing app quality, innovation, and having a launch or major update in the last 12 months\\", with the winners announced in May.[129][130]\\r\\nGoogle has also previously released yearly lists of apps it deemed the \\"best\\" on Google Play.[131][132]\\r\\nOn March 6, 2017, five years after Google Play's launch, Google released lists of the best-selling apps, games, movies, music, and books over the past five years.[133][134]\\r\\nIn June 2017, Google introduced \\"Android Excellence\\", a new editorial program to highlight the apps deemed the highest quality by the Google Play editors.[135][136]\\r\\nGoogle places some restrictions on the types of apps that can be published, in particular not allowing sexually explicit content, child endangerment, violence, bullying & harassment, hate speech, gambling, illegal activities, and requiring precautions for user-generated content.[137]\\r\\nIn March 2015, Google disclosed that over the past few months, it had been begun using a combination of automated tools and human reviewers to check apps for malware and terms of service violations before they are published in the Play Store. At the same time, it began rolling out a new age-based ratings system for apps and games, based on a given region's official ratings authority (for example, ESRB in the US).[138][139][140]\\r\\nIn October 2016, Google announced a new detection and filtering system designed to provide \\"additional enhancements to protect the integrity of the store\\". The new system is aimed to detect and filter cases where developers have been attempting to \\"manipulate the placement of their apps through illegitimate means like fraudulent installs, fake reviews, and incentivized ratings\\".[141][142][143]\\r\\nSome mobile carriers can block users from installing certain apps. In March 2009, reports surfaced that several tethering apps were banned from the store.[144] However, the apps were later restored, with a new ban preventing only T-Mobile subscribers from downloading the apps. Google released a statement:[145]\\r\\nWe inadvertently unpublished the applications for all carriers, and today we have corrected the problem so that all Android Market users outside the T-Mobile US network will now have access to the applications. We have notified the affected developers.\\r\\nIn April 2011, Google removed the Grooveshark app from the store due to unspecified policy violations. CNET noted that the removal came \\"after some of the top music labels have accused the service of violating copyright law\\".[146] TechCrunch wrote approximately two weeks later that Grooveshark had returned to Android, \\"albeit not through the official App Market\\", but rather \\"Playing on Android's ability to install third-party applications through the browser, Grooveshark has taken on the responsibility of distributing the application themselves\\".[147]\\r\\nIn May 2011, Google banned the account of the developer of several video game emulators. Neither Google nor the developer publicly revealed the reason for the ban.[148]\\r\\nIn March 2013, Google began to pull ad blocking apps from the Play Store, per section 4.4 of the developers' agreement, which prohibits apps that interfere with servers and services.[149]\\r\\nIn February 2012, Google introduced a new automated antivirus system, called Google Bouncer, to scan both new and existing apps for malware, spyware, and trojan viruses.[150][151] At Google I/O 2017, this feature, and other safety measures within the Android platform (such as Android Device Manager, which was re-named \\"Find My Device\\"), were rebranded under the umbrella name Google Play Protect.[152][153]\\r\\nAndroid apps can ask for or require certain permissions on the device, including access to body sensors, calendar, camera, contacts, location, microphone, phone, SMS, and storage.[154]\\r\\nIn July 2017, Google described a new security effort called \\"peer grouping\\", in which apps performing similar functionalities, such as calculator apps, are grouped together and attributes compared. If one app stands out, such as requesting more device permissions than others in the same group, Google's systems automatically flag the app and security engineers take a closer inspection. Peer grouping is based on app descriptions, metadata, and statistics such as download count.[155][156]\\r\\nIn early March 2011, DroidDream, a trojan rootkit exploit, was released to then-named Android Market in the form of several free applications that were, in many cases, pirated versions of existing priced apps. This exploit allowed hackers to steal information such as IMEI and IMSI numbers, phone model, user ID, and service provider. The exploit also installed a backdoor that allowed the hackers to download more code to the infected device.[157] The exploit only affected devices running Android versions earlier than 2.3 \\"Gingerbread\\".[158] Google removed the apps from the Market immediately after being alerted,[159] but the apps had already been downloaded more than 50,000 times, according to Android Police's estimate.[157] Android Police wrote that the only method of removing the exploit from an infected device was to reset it to factory state, although community-developed solutions for blocking some aspects of the exploit were created.[159] A few days later, Google confirmed that 58 malicious apps had been uploaded to Android Market, and had been downloaded to 260,000 devices before being removed from the store.[160] Google emailed affected users with information that \\"As far as we can determine, the only information obtained was device-specific (IMEI/IMSI, unique codes which are used to identify mobile devices, and the version of Android running on your device)\\" as opposed to personal data and account information.[160] It also announced a new \\"remote kill\\" functionality, alongside a security update, that lets Google remotely remove malicious apps from users' devices.[160] However, days later, a malicious version of the security update was found on the Internet, though it did not contain the specific DroidDream malware.[161] New apps featuring the malware, renamed DroidDream Light, surfaced the following June, and were also removed from the store.[162]\\r\\nAt the Black Hat security conference in 2012, security firm Trustwave demonstrated their ability to upload an app that would circumvent the Bouncer blocker system. The application used a JavaScript exploit to steal contacts, SMS messages, and photos, and was also capable of making the phone open arbitrary web pages or launch denial-of-service attacks. Nicholas Percoco, senior vice president of Trustwave's SpiderLabs advanced security team, stated that \\"We wanted to test the bounds of what it's capable of\\". The app stayed on Google Play for more than two weeks, being repeatedly scanned by the Bouncer system without detection, with Percoco further saying that \\"As an attack, all a malware attacker has to do to get into Google Play is to bypass Bouncer\\". Trustwave reached out to Google to share their findings, but noted that more manual testing of apps might be necessary to detect apps using malware-masking techniques.[163][164]\\r\\nAccording to a 2014 research study released by RiskIQ, a security services company, malicious apps introduced through Google Play increased 388% between 2011 and 2013, while the number of apps removed by Google dropped from 60% in 2011 to 23% in 2013. The study further revealed that \\"Apps for personalizing Android phones led all categories as most likely to be malicious\\".[165][166] According to PC World, \\"Google said it would need more information about RiskIQ's analysis to comment on the findings.\\"[167]\\r\\nIn October 2016, Engadget reported about a blog post named \\"Password Storage in Sensitive Apps\\" from freelance Android hacker Jon Sawyer, who decided to test the top privacy apps on Google Play. Testing two applications, one named \\"Hide Pictures Keep Safe Vault\\" and the other named \\"Private Photo Vault\\", Sawyer found significant errors in password handling in both, and commented, \\"These companies are selling products that claim to securely store your most intimate pieces of data, yet are at most snake oil. You would have near equal protection just by changing the file extension and renaming the photos.\\"[168][169]\\r\\nIn April 2017, security firm Check Point announced that a malware named \\"FalseGuide\\" had been hidden inside approximately 40 \\"game guide\\" apps in Google Play.[170] The malware is capable of gaining administrator access to infected devices, where it then receives additional modules that let it show popup ads. The malware, a type of botnet, is also capable of launching DDoS attacks.[171][170] After being alerted to the malware, Google removed all instances of it in the store,[171] but by that time, approximately two million Android users had already downloaded the apps, the oldest of which had been around since November 2016.[170]\\r\\nIn June 2017, researchers from Sophos security company announced their finding of 47 apps using a third-party development library that shows intrusive advertisements on users' phones. Even after such apps are force-closed by the user, advertisements remain. Google removed some of the apps after receiving reports from Sophos, but some apps remained. When asked for a comment by Ars Technica, Google didn't respond.[172]\\r\\nSome developers publishing on Google Play have been sued for patent infringement by \\"patent trolls\\", people who own broad or vaguely worded patents that they use to target small developers. If the developer manages to successfully challenge the initial assertion, the \\"patent troll\\" changes the claim of the violation in order to accuse the developer of having violated a different assertion in the patent. This situation continues until the case goes into the legal system, which can have substantial economic costs, prompting some developers to settle.[173] In February 2013, Austin Meyer, a flight simulator game developer, was sued for having used a copy-protection system in his app, a system that he said \\"Google gave us! And, of course, this is what Google provides to everyone else that is making a game for Android!\\" Meyer claimed that Google would not assist in the lawsuit, and he stated that he would not settle the case.[174] His battle with the troll continued for several years, uploading a video in June 2016 discussing that he was then being sued for uploading his app to Google Play, because \\"the patent troll apparently owns the idea [sic] of the Google Play Store itself\\".[173] Android Authority wrote that \\"This scenario has played out against many other app developers for many years\\", and have prompted discussions over \\"a larger issue at stake\\", in which developers stop making apps out of fear of patent problems.[173]\\r\\nUsers outside the countries/regions listed below only have access to free apps and games through Google Play.","input":"How many apps are on the google play store?"},{"output":"in Colorado, immediately north of Colorado Springs in El Paso County","context":"Gyrfalcon\\r\\nThe United States Air Force Academy (also known as USAFA, the Air Force Academy, or the Academy), is a military academy for officer cadets of the United States Air Force. Its campus is located in the western United States in Colorado, immediately north of Colorado Springs in El Paso County.\\r\\nThe Academy's stated mission is \\"to educate, train, and inspire men and women to become leaders of character, motivated to lead the United States Air Force in service to our nation.\\"[7] It is the youngest of the five U.S. service academies, having graduated its first class 59 years ago in 1959, however it is the third in seniority.[8] Graduates of the Academy's four-year program receive a Bachelor of Science degree, and are commissioned as second lieutenants in the U.S. Air Force.[9] The Academy is also one of the largest tourist attractions in Colorado, attracting approximately a million visitors each year.[7]\\r\\nAdmission is extremely competitive, with nominations divided equally among Congressional districts. Recent incoming classes have had about 1,200 cadets; historically, just under 1,000 of those will graduate.[10] Tuition along with room and board are all paid for by the Air Force. Cadets receive a monthly stipend, but incur a commitment to serve a number of years of military service after graduation.[11]\\r\\nThe program at the Academy is guided by the Air Force's core values of \\"Integrity First, Service Before Self, and Excellence in All We Do\\",[7] and based on four \\"pillars of excellence\\": military training, academics, athletics and character development.[7] In addition to a rigorous military training regimen, cadets also take a broad academic course load with an extensive core curriculum in engineering, humanities, social sciences, basic sciences, military studies and physical education. All cadets participate in either intercollegiate or intramural athletics, and a thorough character development and leadership curriculum provides cadets a basis for future officership. Each of the components of the program is intended to give cadets the skills and knowledge that they will need for success as officers.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nPrior to the Academy's establishment, air power advocates had been pushing for a separate Air Force Academy for decades. As early as 1918, Lieutenant Colonel A.J. Hanlon wrote, \\"As the Military and Naval Academies are the backbone of the Army and Navy, so must the Aeronautical Academy be the backbone of the Air Service. No service can flourish without some such institution to inculcate into its embryonic officers love of country, proper conception of duty, and highest regard for honor.\\"[12] Other officials expressed similar sentiments. In 1919, Congressman Charles F. Curry introduced legislation providing for an Academy, but concerns about cost, curriculum and location led to its demise.[12] In 1925, air power pioneer General Billy Mitchell testified on Capitol Hill that it was necessary \\"to have an air academy to form a basis for the permanent backbone of your air service and to attend to the...organizational part of it, very much the same way that West Point does for the Army, or that Annapolis does for the Navy.\\"[12][13] Mitchell's arguments did not gain traction with legislators, and it was not until the late 1940s that the concept of the United States Air Force Academy began to take shape.[12]\\r\\nSupport for an air academy got a boost with the National Security Act of 1947, which provided for the establishment of a separate Air Force within the United States military. As an initial measure, Secretary of the Air Force W. Stuart Symington negotiated an agreement where up to 25% of West Point and Annapolis graduates could volunteer to receive their commissions in the newly established Air Force. This was only intended to be a short term fix, however, and disagreements between the services quickly led to the establishment of the Service Academy Board by Secretary of Defense James Forrestal. In January 1950, the Service Academy Board, headed by Dwight D. Eisenhower, then president of Columbia University, concluded that the needs of the Air Force could not be met by the two existing U.S. service academies and that an air force academy should be established.[12]\\r\\nFollowing the recommendation of the Board, Congress passed legislation in 1954 to begin the construction of the Air Force Academy, and President Eisenhower signed it into law on 1 April of that year.[14] The legislation established an advisory commission to determine the site of the new school. Among the panel members were Charles Lindbergh, General Carl Spaatz, and Lieutenant General Hubert R. Harmon, who later became the Academy's first superintendent. The original 582 sites considered were winnowed to three: Alton, Illinois; Lake Geneva, Wisconsin; and the ultimate site at Colorado Springs, Colorado. The Secretary of the Air Force, Harold E. Talbott, announced the winning site on 24 June 1954.[15][16] Meanwhile, Air Training Command (ATC) began developing a detailed curriculum for the Academy program.[12]\\r\\nThe early Air Force Academy leadership had the model of West Point and Annapolis in designing an appropriate curriculum, faculty, and campus. The Academy's permanent site had not yet been completed when the first class entered, so the 306?cadets from the Class of 1959 were sworn in at a temporary site at Lowry Air Force Base in Denver on 11 July 1955.[17] While at Lowry, they were housed in renovated World War II barracks.[18] There were no upper class cadets to train the new cadets, so the Air Force appointed a cadre of \\"Air Training Officers\\" (ATOs) to conduct training. The ATOs were junior officers, many of whom were graduates of West Point, Annapolis, and The Citadel. They acted as surrogate upper class cadets until the upper classes could be populated over the next several years.[12] The Academy's dedication ceremony took place on that first day and was broadcast live on national television, with Walter Cronkite covering the event.[12] Arnold W. Braswell, a native of Minden, Louisiana, was commander of the original four cadet squadrons at the academy 1955 to 1958.[19]\\r\\nIn developing a distinctive uniform for cadets, the Air Force turned to Hollywood. Famed director Cecil B. DeMille designed the cadet parade uniform; it is still worn by cadets today.[citation needed]\\r\\nThe Class of 1959 established many other important traditions that continue until the present. The first class adopted the Cadet Honor Code, and chose the falcon as the Academy's mascot. On 29 August 1958, the wing of 1,145 cadets moved to the present site near Colorado Springs,[20] and less than a year later the Academy received accreditation. The first USAFA class graduated and was commissioned on 3 June 1959.[8][21]\\r\\nThe Vietnam War was the first war in which Academy graduates fought and died. As such, it had a profound effect on the development of the character of the Academy. Due to the need for more pilots, Academy enrollment grew significantly during this time. The size of the graduating classes went from 217 cadets in 1961 to 745 cadets in 1970.[22] Academy facilities were likewise expanded, and training was modified to better meet the needs of the wartime Air Force. The Jacks Valley field training area was added, the Survival, Evasion, Resistance and Escape (SERE) program was expanded, and light aircraft training started in 1968.[22]\\r\\nMany Academy graduates of this era served with distinction in the Vietnam War. F-4 Phantom II pilot Steve Ritchie '64 and weapon systems officer Jeffrey Feinstein '68 each became aces by downing five enemy aircraft in combat.[23][24] One hundred forty-one graduates died in the conflict; thirty-two graduates became prisoners of war. Lance Sijan, '65, fell into both categories and became the first Academy graduate to be awarded the Medal of Honor due to his heroism while evading capture and in captivity.[25] Sijan Hall, one of the cadet dormitories, is named in his memory.\\r\\nThe effects of the anti-war movement were felt at the Academy as well. Because the Academy grounds are generally open to the public, the Academy often became a site for protests by anti-war demonstrators.[22] Regular demonstrations were held at the Cadet Chapel, and cadets often became the targets of protesters' insults. Other aggravating factors were the presence in the Cadet Wing of cadets motivated to attend the Academy for reasons of draft avoidance, and a number of highly publicized cheating scandals. Morale sometimes suffered as a consequence.[citation needed]\\r\\nOne of the most significant events in the history of the Academy was the admission of women.[26][27] On 7?October 1975, President Gerald R. Ford signed legislation permitting women to enter the United States service academies. On 26 June 1976, 157 women entered the Air Force Academy with the Class of 1980. Because there were no female upper class cadets, the Air Training Officer model used in the early years of the Academy was revived, and fifteen young female officers were brought in to help with the integration process. The female cadets were initially segregated from the rest of the Cadet Wing but were fully integrated into their assigned squadrons after their first semester. On 28?May 1980, 97 of the original female cadets completed the program and graduated from the Academyjust over 10% of the graduating class. Women have made up just over 20% of the most recent classes, with the class of 2016 having the highest proportion of any class, 25%.[10]\\r\\nMany of the women from those early classes went on to achieve success within the Cadet Wing and after graduation (see list of Academy graduates below). Despite these successes, integration issues were long apparent. Female cadets have had consistently higher dropout rates than men and have left the Air Force in higher numbers than men.[28]\\r\\nInitial proposals for the Air Force Academy location were between Prescott, Arizona; Linn, Wisconsin; Alton, Illinois and Colorado Springs, Colorado. The selection committee cut the final list to only Alton, Linn and Colorado Springs. Final selection was awarded to Colorado Springs.[29]\\r\\nThe campus of the Academy covers 18,500 acres (29?sq?mi; 75?km2) on the east side of the Rampart Range of the Rocky Mountains, just north of Colorado Springs. Its elevation is normally given as 7,258 feet (2,212?m) above sea level, which is at the cadet area. The Academy was designed by Skidmore, Owings and Merrill (SOM) and lead architect Walter Netsch. SOM partner John O. Merrill moved from Chicago to a Colorado Springs field office to oversee the construction and to act as a spokesman for the project.[30]\\r\\nThe most controversial aspect of the SOM-designed Air Force Academy was its chapel.[31] It was designed by SOM architect Walter Netsch, who at one point was prepared to abandon the design;[32] but the accordion-like structure is acknowledged as an iconic symbol of the academy campus.\\r\\nThe buildings in the Cadet Area were designed in a distinct, modernist style, and make extensive use of aluminum on building exteriors, suggesting the outer skin of aircraft or spacecraft.[33] On 1 April 2004, fifty years after Congress authorized the building of the Academy, the Cadet Area at the Academy was designated a National Historic Landmark.[34][35]\\r\\nThe main buildings in the Cadet Area are set around a large, square pavilion known as \\"the Terrazzo,\\" and the most recognizable is the 17-spired Cadet Chapel.[36] The subject of controversy when it was first built, it is now considered among the most prominent examples of modern American academic architecture. Other buildings on the Terrazzo include Vandenberg Hall and Sijan Hall, the two dormitories; Mitchell Hall, the cadet dining facility; and Fairchild Hall, the main academic building, which houses academic classrooms, laboratories, research facilities, faculty offices and the Robert F. McDermott Library.\\r\\nThe Aeronautics Research Center (also known as the \\"Aero Lab\\") contains numerous aeronautical research facilities, including transonic, subsonic, low speed, and cascade wind tunnels; engine and rocket test cells; and simulators.[37] The Consolidated Education and Training Facility (CETF) was built in 1997 as an annex to Fairchild Hall. It contains chemistry and biology classrooms and labs, medical and dental clinics, and civil engineering and astronautics laboratories. The Cadet Area also contains an observatory and a planetarium for academic use and navigation training.\\r\\nThe cadet social center is Arnold Hall, located just outside the Cadet Area, which houses a 3000-seat theater, a ballroom, a number of lounges, and dining and recreation facilities for cadets and visitors. Harmon Hall is the primary administration building, which houses the offices of the Superintendent and the Superintendent's staff.\\r\\nThe Cadet Area also contains extensive facilities for use by cadets participating in intercollegiate athletics, intramural athletics, physical education classes and other physical training. Set amid numerous outdoor athletic fields are the Cadet Gymnasium and the Cadet Fieldhouse. The Fieldhouse is the home to Clune Arena, the ice hockey rink and an indoor track, which doubles as an indoor practice facility for a number of sports. Falcon Stadium, located outside of the Cadet Area, is the football field and site of the graduation ceremonies.[7]\\r\\nMany displays around the Cadet Area commemorate heroes and air power pioneers, and serve as an inspiration to cadets. The War Memorial, a black marble wall located just under the flagpole on the Terrazzo, is etched with the names of Academy graduates who have been killed in combat. The Honor Wall, overlooking the Terrazzo, is inscribed with the Cadet Honor Code: \\"We will not lie, cheat, or steal, nor tolerate among us anyone who does.\\" Just under the Cadet Chapel, the Class Wall bears the crests of each of the Academy's graduating classes. The crest of the current first (senior) class is displayed in the center position. Another display often used as a symbol of the Academy, the Eagle and Fledglings Statue was given as a gift to the Academy in 1958 by the personnel of Air Training Command. It contains the inscription by Austin Dusty Miller, \\"Man's flight through life is sustained by the power of his knowledge.\\" Static air- and spacecraft displays on the Academy grounds include an F-4, F-15, F-16 and F-105 on the Terrazzo; a B-52 by the North Gate; a T-38 and A-10 at the airfield; an F-100 by the preparatory school; a SV-5J lifting body next to the aeronautics laboratory; and a Minuteman III missile in front of the Fieldhouse. The Minuteman III was removed 9 years ago in August 2008 due to rusting and other internal damage.[citation needed]\\r\\nThe \\"Core Values Ramp\\" (formerly known as the \\"Bring Me Men Ramp\\") leads down from the main Terrazzo level toward the parade field. On in-processing day, new cadets arrive at the base of the ramp and start their transition into military and Academy life by ascending the ramp to the Terrazzo. From 1964 to 2004, the portal at the base of the ramp was inscribed with the words \\"Bring me men... \\" taken from the poem, \\"The Coming American,\\" by Samuel Walter Foss. In a controversial move following the 2003 sexual assault scandal, the words \\"Bring me men...\\" were taken down and replaced with the Academy's (later adopted as the Air Force's) core values: \\"Integrity first, service before self, and excellence in all we do.\\"[7]\\r\\nWith an enrollment of over 1300, Air Academy High School is the only high school in the United States built on a military academy. It ranks in the top ten in the state in academic standards. Part of School District 20 (D20), its marching band regularly places in the top ten in state championships. D20 also maintains an elementary school on the academy grounds.\\r\\nOther locations on campus serve support roles for cadet training and other base functions. Doolittle Hall is the headquarters of the Academy's Association of Graduates and also serves as the initial reception point for new cadets arriving for Basic Cadet Training. It is named after General Jimmy Doolittle. The Goldwater Visitor Center, named after longtime proponent of the Academy United States Senator Barry Goldwater, is the focal point for family, friends and tourists visiting the Academy grounds. The Academy Airfield is used for training cadets in airmanship courses, including parachute training, soaring and powered flight. Interment at the Academy Cemetery is limited to Academy cadets and graduates, certain senior officers, certain Academy staff members, and certain other family members. Air power notables Carl Spaatz, Curtis E. LeMay and Robin Olds, are interred here.[citation needed]\\r\\nThe United States Air Force Academy Preparatory School (usually referred to as the \\"Prep School\\") is a program offered to selected individuals who were not able to obtain appointments directly to the Academy. The program involves intense academic preparation (particularly in English, math and science), along with athletic and military training, meant to prepare the students for appointment to the Academy. A high percentage of USAFA Preparatory School students (known as \\"Preppies\\") earn appointments to the Academy following their year at the Prep School.[citation needed]\\r\\nThe Cadet Honor Code is the cornerstone of a cadet's professional training and development ÿ the minimum standard of ethical conduct that cadets expect of themselves and their fellow cadets. The Honor Code was developed and adopted by the Class of 1959, the first class to graduate from the Academy and has been handed down to every subsequent class.[38][39] The Code itself is simple:\\r\\nIn 1984, the Cadet Wing voted to add an \\"Honor Oath,\\" which was to be taken by all cadets. The oath is administered to fourth class cadets (freshmen) when they are formally accepted into the Wing at the conclusion of Basic Cadet Training.[39] The oath remains unchanged since its adoption in 1984 and consists of a statement of the code, followed by a resolution to live honorably (the phrase \\"So help me God\\" is now optional):\\r\\nWe will not lie, steal or cheat, nor tolerate among us anyone who does. Furthermore, I resolve to do my duty and to live honorably, (so help me God).\\r\\nCadets are considered the \\"guardians and stewards\\" of the Code. Cadet honor representatives are chosen by senior leadership, and oversee the honor system by conducting education classes and investigating suspected honor violations. Cadets throughout the Wing are expected to sit on Honor Boards as juries that determine whether their fellow cadets violated the code. Cadets also recommend sanctions for violations. The presumed sanction for an honor violation is disenrollment, but mitigating factors may result in the violator being placed in a probationary status for some period of time. This \\"honor probation\\" is usually only reserved for cadets in their first two years at the Academy.[citation needed]\\r\\nTo reinforce the importance of honor, character and integrity to future officers, cadets are given an extensive character and leadership curriculum. The Academy's Center for Character and Leadership Development provides classroom, seminar, workshop and experiential-based learning programs to all cadets, beginning when they enter Basic Cadet Training and continuing each year through their last semester at the Academy. The Center's programs, when coupled with the Honor Code and Honor System, establish a foundation for the \\"leaders of character\\" that the Academy aspires to produce.[40]\\r\\nThe Academy's organization is unusual in a number of respects. Because it is primarily a military unit, much of the Academy's structure is set up like that of any other Air Force Base. This is particularly true of the non-cadet unitsmost assigned to the 10th Air Base Wingthat provide base services such as security, communications, and engineering. Because the Academy is also a university, however, the organization of the faculty and the Cadet Wing have some aspects that are more similar to the faculty and student body at a civilian college.\\r\\nThe student body of the Academy is known as the Cadet Wing. The students, called \\"cadets\\", are divided into four classes, based on their year in school, much like a civilian college. They are not referred to as freshmen, sophomores, juniors and seniors, however, but as fourth-, third-, second- and first class cadets, respectively. Fourth class cadets (freshmen) are often referred to as \\"doolies,\\" a term derived from the Greek word Ѵ?? (\\"doulos\\") meaning \\"slave\\" or \\"servant.\\"[41] Members of the three lower classes are also referred to as \\"4 degrees,\\" \\"3 degrees\\" or \\"2 degrees\\" based on their class.[42] First-class cadets (seniors) are referred to as \\"firsties.\\" In the military structure of the Cadet Wing, first class cadets hold the positions of cadet officers, second class cadets act as the cadet non-commissioned officers and third class cadets represent the cadet junior non-commissioned officers.[citation needed]\\r\\nThe Cadet Wing is divided into four groups, of ten cadet squadrons each. Each cadet squadron consists of about 110 cadets, roughly evenly distributed among the four classes. Selected first-, second- and third-class cadets hold leadership, operational and support jobs at the squadron, group and wing levels. Cadets live, march and eat meals with members of their squadrons. Military training and intramural athletics are conducted by squadron as well. Each cadet squadron and cadet group is supervised by a specially selected active duty officer called an Air Officer Commanding (AOC). In the case of a cadet squadron, the AOC is normally an active duty Air Force major. For a cadet group, the AOC is normally an active-duty lieutenant colonel. These officers have command authority over the cadets, counsel cadets on leadership and military career issues, oversee military training and serve as role models for the future officers.[citation needed] In addition to an AOC, cadet squadrons and groups are also supervised by an active duty non-commissioned officer known as an Academy Military Trainer (AMT), who fulfills a similar job as the AOC.\\r\\nThe Superintendent of the Academy is the commander and senior officer. The position of Superintendent is normally held by an active-duty lieutenant general. The superintendent's role is roughly similar to that of the president of a civilian university. As such, the Superintendent oversees all aspects of the Academy, including military training, academics, athletics, admissions and also functions as the installation commander of the Academy Reservation. The Academy is a Direct Reporting Unit within the Air Force, so the Superintendent reports directly to the Chief of Staff of the Air Force.[43]\\r\\nThose reporting to the Superintendent include the Dean of the Faculty and Commandant of Cadets, each of whom typically holds the rank of brigadier general, as well as the Director of Athletics, the Commander of the 10th Air Base Wing and the Commander of the Prep School, each of whom typically holds the rank of colonel. The 10th Air Base Wing provides all base support functions that exist at other air force bases, including civil engineering, communications, medical support, personnel, administration, security and base services. The Preparatory School provides an academic, athletic and military program for qualified young men and women who may need certain additional preparation prior to acceptance to the Academy. All flying programs at the Academy are run by the 306th Flying Training Group, which reports to the Air Education and Training Command, ensuring uniformity of flight training with the rest of the Air Force.[citation needed]\\r\\nCongressional oversight of the Academy is exercised through a Board of Visitors (BOV), established under Title 10, United States Code, Section 9355. The board inquires into the morale, discipline, curriculum, instruction, physical equipment, fiscal affairs, academic methods and other matters relating to the Academy. The board meets at least four times per year and prepares semi-annual reports containing its views and recommendations submitted concurrently to the Secretary of Defense, the Senate Armed Services Committee, and the House Armed Services Committee. The 15 members of the BOV are variously appointed by the President of the United States, the Vice President, the Senate and House Armed Services Committees and the Speaker of the House of Representatives. Since 2006, the board has been required to include at least two Academy graduates. In July 2009, Speaker Nancy Pelosi appointed Colorado Congressman Jared Polis to the BOV, the first openly gay person to serve on a service academys advisory board.[44]\\r\\nCadets' military training occurs throughout their time at the Academy, but is especially intense during their four summers. The first military experience for new cadets (called \\"basic cadets\\") occurs during the six weeks of Basic Cadet Training (BCT), in the summer before their fourth class (freshman) year. During BCT, also known as \\"beast,\\" cadets learn the fundamentals of military and Academy life under the leadership of a cadre of first and second class cadets.[45] Basic cadets learn military customs and courtesies, proper wear of the uniform, drill and ceremony, and study military knowledge and undergo a rigorous physical training program. During the second half of BCT, basic cadets march to Jacks Valley, where they complete the program in a field encampment environment. Upon completion of BCT, basic cadets receive their fourth-class shoulder boards, take the Honor Oath and are formally accepted as members of the Cadet Wing.[46]\\r\\nThe fourth-class (freshman) year is traditionally the most difficult at the Academy, militarily. In addition to their full academic course loads, heavy demands are placed on fourth class cadets outside of class. Fourth class cadets are expected to learn an extensive amount of military and Academy-related knowledge and have significant restrictions placed on their movement and actionstraversing the Cadet Area only by approved routes (including staying on the marble \\"strips\\" on the Terrazzo) and interacting with upper class cadets using a very specific decorum. The fourth class year ends with \\"Recognition,\\" a physically and mentally demanding several-day event which culminates in the award of the Prop and Wings insignia to the fourth class cadets, signifying their ascension to the ranks of upper class cadets. After Recognition, the stringent rules of the fourth class year are relaxed.[citation needed]\\r\\nAfter the first year, cadets have more options for summer military training. Between their fourth and third class years, cadets undergo training in Air Force operations in a deployed environment (called Expeditionary Skills and Evasion Training [ESET]) and may participate in flying gliders, cyber-warfare training, satellite and space operations, unmanned systems, or free-fall parachute training. From the late 1960s until the mid-1990s, cadets also completed SERE training in the Jacks Valley complex between their fourth- and third-class years. This program was replaced with Combat Survival Training (CST) in 1995 and done away with entirely in 2005. In the summer of 2008, the CST program was reintroduced, but was cut again in 2011 and replaced with ESET for the summer of 2012 (the Class of 2015 was the first to participate in ESET). During their last two summers, cadets may serve as BCT cadre, travel to active duty Air Force bases and participate in a variety of other research, aviation and leadership programs. They may also be able to take courses offered by other military services, such as the U.S. Army's Airborne School at Fort Benning, Georgia, or the Air Assault School, at Fort Campbell, Kentucky. During the academic year, all cadets take formal classes in military theory, operations and leadership.\\r\\nThe Air Force Academy is an accredited four-year university offering bachelor's degrees in a variety of subjects. Active-duty Air Force officers make up approximately 70 percent of the faculty, with the balance long-term civilian professors, visiting professors from civilian universities and instructors from other U.S. and allied foreign military services. In recent years, civilians have become a growing portion of senior faculty.\\r\\nEvery Dean of the Faculty (equivalent to a Provost at most universities) has always been an active-duty brigadier general, although technically, a civilian may hold the position. The Dean, the Vice Dean, and each academic department chair hold the academic rank of Permanent Professor. Permanent Professors are nominated by the President of the United States and approved by the Senate, and can serve until age 64.\\r\\nAll graduates receive a Bachelor of Science degree, regardless of major, because of the technical content of the core requirements. Cadets may choose from a variety of majors, including engineering, the basic sciences, social sciences and humanities, as well as in a variety of divisional or inter-disciplinary subjects. The academic program has an extensive core curriculum, in which all cadets take required courses in the sciences, engineering, social sciences, humanities, military studies and physical education. Approximately sixty percent of a cadet's course load is mandated by the core curriculum. As a result, most of a cadet's first two years are spent in core classes. While core requirements remain significant during the third and fourth years, cadets have more flexibility to focus in their major areas of study, allowing them to participate in international and inter-service Academy exchange programs.\\r\\nTraditionally, the academic program at the Air Force Academy (as with military academies in general) has focused heavily on science and engineering, with the idea that many graduates would be expected to manage complex air, space and information technology systems. As a result, the Academy's engineering programs have traditionally been ranked highly. Over time, however, the Academy broadened its humanities offerings. About 55% of cadets typically select majors in non-technical disciplines.[citation needed] The academy's recent implementation of a computer and network security program may represent a return to form.[47]\\r\\nExternally funded research at the Air Force Academy has been a large and growing part of the technical majors. Air Force has ranked highest of all undergraduate-only universities in federally funded research as reported by the National Science Foundation, surpassing $60 million in 2010.[citation needed] Many cadets are involved in research via their major, coordinated in more than a dozen Academy research centers, including the Institute for Information Technology Applications, the Institute for National Security Studies, the Air Force Humanities Institute, the Eisenhower Center for Space and Defense Studies, the Life Sciences Research Center, the Academy Center for Physics Education Research, among others.\\r\\nAll cadets at the Academy take part in the school's extensive athletic program. The program is designed to enhance the physical conditioning of all cadets, to develop the physical skills necessary for officership, to teach leadership in a competitive environment and to build character.[48] The primary elements of the athletic program are intercollegiate athletics, intramural athletics, physical education, and the physical fitness tests.\\r\\nCadets are required to take physical education courses in each of their four years at the Academy. The classes cover a wide range of activities: Swimming and water survival build confidence while teaching important survival skills. Combative sports such as boxing, wrestling, judo and unarmed combat build confidence, teach controlled aggression and develop physical fitness. Cadets also take classes in team sports such as basketball and soccer, in lifetime sports such as tennis and golf and on the physiology of exercise.[citation needed]\\r\\nEach semester, cadets must pass two athletic fitness tests: a 1.5?mi (2.4?km) run to measure aerobic fitness, and a 15-minute, 5-event, physical fitness test consisting of pull-ups, a standing long jump, sit-ups, push-ups and a 600?yd (550?m) sprint.[49] Failure to pass a fitness test usually results in the cadet being assigned to reconditioning until he can pass the test. Repeated failures can lead to disenrollment.[citation needed]\\r\\nAll cadets are required to compete in intramural athletics for their entire time at the Academy, unless they are on-season for intercollegiate athletics. Intramural sports put cadet squadrons against one another in many sports, including basketball, cross-country, flag football, ice hockey, racquetball, flickerball, rugby union, boxing, soccer, mountain biking, softball, team handball, tennis, Ultimate, wallyball and volleyball. Winning the Wing Championship in a given sport is a particular source of pride for a cadet squadron.[citation needed]\\r\\nThe Academy's intercollegiate program has 17 men's and 10 women's NCAA sanctioned teams, nicknamed the Falcons.[48] Men's teams compete in football, baseball, basketball, ice hockey, cross-country, fencing, golf, gymnastics, indoor and outdoor track, lacrosse, soccer, swimming and diving, tennis, water polo and wrestling. Women's teams include basketball, cross-country, fencing, gymnastics, indoor and outdoor track, swimming and diving, soccer, tennis and volleyball. The Academy fields a coeducational team in rifle. In addition, the Academy also sponsors two non-NCAA programs: cheerleading and boxing. The Academy also has several club sports, such as rugby, that compete intercollegiately.[citation needed]\\r\\nThe men's and women's programs compete in NCAA's Division I, with the football team competing in Division I FBS. Most teams are in the Mountain West Conference; however, the wrestling team competes in the Big 12 Conference, the gymnastics teams compete in the Mountain Pacific Sports Federation; the men's soccer team competes in the Western Athletic Conference;[50] the men's hockey team competes in Atlantic Hockey, the water polo team competes in the Western Water Polo Association, the coeducational rifle team competes in the Patriot Rifle Conference, and the men's lacrosse team competes in the Southern Conference. The men's boxing team competes in the National Collegiate Boxing Association. For a number of years, only the men's teams competed in Division I. Women's teams competed in Division II and were once members of the Continental Divide Conference, then the Colorado Athletic Conference. With new NCAA legislation, beginning in 1996, women's teams also competed in Division I.[citation needed]\\r\\nAir Force has traditional service academy rivalries with Navy and Army. The three service academies compete for the Commander-in-Chief's Trophy in football each year. Air Force Falcons football has had the best showing of the three, winning the trophy 18 of its 34 years. The Academy also has an in-state rivalry with Colorado State University, which is located in Fort Collins and is a fellow member of the Mountain West Conference. [51][citation needed]\\r\\nThe boxing team, led for 31 years by Coach Ed Weichers, has won 18 national championships.[52] The Academy's men's and women's rugby teams have each won multiple national championships and the women's side recently had two players selected for the United States national team.[53] The football team has played in 17 bowl games and the basketball team has had strong showings in the last several years, qualifying for the NCAA tournament and, most recently, making the final four of the 2007 NIT Tournament.[54] The men's ice hockey team won the last two Atlantic Hockey conference tournaments, made the first ever appearance by a service academy in the NCAA hockey tournament in 2007, and made a repeat appearance in 2008. The Air Force Academy's Men's Hockey team recently lost in the \\"Elite Eight\\" of hockey in double overtime. This marked the farthest they had gone in the post-season in school history and the longest an Atlantic Hockey Association team has made it into the post-season.[55]\\r\\nIn 2014, Academy Superintendent Lt. Gen. Michelle Johnson responded to reports of allegations of sexual assault and drug use at a December 2011 party by calling for a review of the Athletic Department by the Inspector General.[56]\\r\\nCadets have the opportunity to take part in several airmanship activities to include soaring, parachuting, and powered flight. Airmanship activities at the Academy are primarily conducted by the 306th Flying Training Group.\\r\\nThe 94th Flying Training Squadron trains cadets in basic airmanship principles through several flights in TG-16A sailplanes. Each year, several soaring students are selected to become instructor pilots to teach new classes of soaring students. Some of these cadet instructor pilots also compete on the Soaring Racing Team or Acrobatics Team in national competitions.\\r\\nCadets also have the opportunity to take a parachuting course conducted by the 98th Flying Training Squadron. Each year, hundreds of cadets earn their Basic Parachutist Badge by completing five jumps in the program. A number of cadets are selected for further training and become members of The Wings of Blue, the U.S. Air Force Parachute Team.\\r\\nA powered flight program is conducted under the 557th Flying Training Squadron to expose cadets to the basics of powered flight. The program uses T-53A aircraft to offer cadets basic flight training and the opportunity to solo. The U.S. Air Force Academy Flying Team is composed of ~26 cadets selected to compete in National Intercollegiate Flying Association competitions. The Flying Team uses T-41D and T-51A aircraft to compete in precision landing, navigation, and message drop events.\\r\\nTo be eligible to enter the Academy, a candidate must:[57][58]\\r\\nIn addition to the normal application process, all candidates must secure a nomination to the Academy, normally from a U.S. Senator or U.S. Representative. Each member of Congress and the Vice President can have five appointees attending the Air Force Academy at any time. The process for obtaining a congressional nomination is not political and candidates do not have to know their senator or representative to secure a nomination. Additional nomination slots are available for children of career military personnel, children of disabled veterans or veterans who were killed in action, or children of Medal of Honor recipients. The admissions process is a lengthy one and applicants usually begin the paperwork during their junior year of high school.[60]\\r\\nThere were 306 cadets admitted for the first class (class of 1959).[12] By 1961, class size was down to 271, but due to the need for officers in the Vietnam War, grew to 745 admittees in 1970,[22] and peaking in 1974, with 1,620, and 1975, with 1,626, the largest number ever admitted.[61] After that class sizes shrank down to about 1,300.[62][63] Despite a peak of 1,350 (admitted 2004) and 1,418 (admitted 2005), from 1995 to 2005 class size averaged about 1,250 freshmen.[61] From 2005 to 2010 class sizes were slightly down from the 2005 peak. The 2013 class (beginning 2009) had 1,286[64] and the 2014 class (beginning Fall 2010) had 1,285.[65] Cutbacks were ordered in 2011, so by 2012, the entering class (class of 2016) was down to about 1,050.[65] The current class (class of 2019) began with 1,248 students.\\r\\nThe Prop and Wings insignia of the Air Service (1918ÿ26), Air Corps (1926ÿ41), and Army Air Forces (1941ÿ47) became the insignia of upperclass cadets at the Air Force Academy beginning with the first class, 1959. The insignia is given to fourth class (freshmen) cadets at the Recognition Ceremony near the end of their first year rite of passage. The standard insignia uses the design of the Air Corps Prop and Wings, except that it is all silver instead of the gold wings and silver prop of the earlier design. Cadets who have ancestors who served in the Air Service, Air Corps, or Army Air Forces, or those who are direct descendants of Air Force Academy graduates, are eligible to wear a silver prop and gold wings set of prop and wings.\\r\\nThe Air Force Academy cadet sabre is carried by first class (senior) cadets in command positions in the Cadet Wing. All graduates are normally entitled to own no more than two sabres: one for personal use and one to be given as a gift. The Plaque and Sabre Award is the highest award given by the Cadet Wing to dignitaries and other honorees.\\r\\nThe American college tradition of the class ring began with the class of 1835 at the U.S. Military Academy. From there, it spread to the U.S. Naval Academy in the class of 1869.[66] The Air Force Academy continued the tradition, beginning with the first class, 1959, and so is the only service academy to have had class rings for every class since its founding. The Air Force ring is distinctive for being white gold instead of the yellow gold used at the other academies. Each class designs its own class crest; the only requirements being that each crest include all the elements on the Class of 1959's crest: the class number, the class year, the Polaris star, and the eagle. One side of the ring bears the academy crest, while the other side bears the class crest; the center bezel bears the words United States Air Force Academy. Cadets choose their own stones for the center of the ring. The rings are received at the Ring Dance at the beginning of the Graduation Week festivities for the class ahead of the ring recipients. The rings traditionally are placed in glasses of champagne and are caught in the teeth following a toast. During the cadet's first class (senior) year, the ring is worn with the class crest facing the wearer; following graduation, the ring is turned so that the class crest faces out. The rings of all the academies were originally designed to be worn on the left hand, so that the wearer reads the name of the academy on the bezel while a cadet or midshipman and others can read it after graduation, the rings are now worn on either hand. The Academy's Association of Graduates (AOG) accepts rings of deceased graduates which are melted down to form an ingot of white gold from which a portion of all future rings are made.[67] Both the academy's Association of Graduates and the Academy Library maintain displays of class rings.\\r\\nThe first Honor scandal broke in 1965, when a resigning cadet reported knowing of more than 100 cadets who had been involved in a cheating ring. One hundred and nine cadets were ultimately expelled. Cheating scandals plagued the Academy again in 1967, 1972, 1984, 2004,[68] 2007,[69] 2012, and 2014. Following each of these events, the Academy thoroughly examined the etiology of the mass cheating in addition to alleged excessive pressures that the academic system at the time placed on cadets and made changes in attempts to reduce the opportunities for future incidents\\r\\nThe sexual assault scandal that broke in 2003 forced the Academy to look more closely at how effectively women had been integrated into cadet life; concerns with sexual assault, hazing of male cadets, and the disciplinary process during this period were detailed in a 2010 book by a former cadet.[70] Following the scandal and rising concerns about sexual assault throughout the U.S. military, the Department of Defense established a task force to investigate sexual harassment and assault at each of the United States service academies. The report also revealed 92 incidents of reported sexual assault.[71] At the same time, the Academy implemented programs to combat sexual assault, harassment and gender bias. The new programs actively encourage prompt sexual assault reporting. The Academy's decisive actions of zero tolerance were praised by officials and experts.[72]\\r\\nFollowing the 2003 crisis, the Department of Defense directed its attention to the problem of sexual harassment and assault at the military academies. The Department of Defense claimed that the program was successful although during the school year 2010ÿ11 there were increased reports of sexual assault at the academy; however, one goal of the program is increased reporting.[73] There have been several attempts to prosecute cadets for rape since 2003, but only three have been successful convictions, citing the confidential informant program that ran from 2011-2012. The informant program was led by former AFOSI agent Brandon Enos, AFOSI's most successful agent in Air Force Academy's history in combating sexual assault and drug use amongst cadets. After the confidential informant program was mysteriously disbanded in 2013 on orders from General Johnson, sexual assault reporting fell by half. On 5 January 2012 rape charges were preferred against cadets in three unrelated cases.[74] To help combat these problems, the United States Air Force Office of Special Investigations (AFOSI) created a system of cadet informants to hunt for misconduct among students.[75] According to The New York Times in Academic Year 2014, \\"after the informant program ended with no further convictions, reports fell by half.\\"[76]\\r\\nThe New York Times has cited a letter to Congress from former AFOSI Agent, Staff Sergeant Brandon Enos, who said that Lieutenant General Michael C. Gould, the superintendent from 2009 to 2013 and a former quarterback on the team, had repeatedly interfered in cases involving football players. In turn Gould said to the Times that the suggestion that he had interfered with the investigation preposterous.\\"[76] Gould was found guilty by a report from the Pentagon in June 2016 of interfering with AFOSI investigations from 2011-2012, including blocking an investigation into the football coaches. Gould was removed from the College Football Selection Committee but was able to retain his retirement pay.[citation needed]\\r\\nThese and other problems again rose to national prominence in the summer of 2014 when The Gazette broke an investigation into behavior by Academy cadets and faculty that included allegations of drug use, alcohol abuse, cheating, and sexual assault. This behavior, described as \\"so wild that AFOSI leaders canceled a planned 2012 sting out of concern that undercover agents and confidential informants at a party wouldn't be enough to protect women from rape,\\" prompted the Academy superintendent to call for an investigation of the Academy's athletic department.[77]\\r\\nIn 2005, allegations surfaced that some Evangelical Christian cadets and staff were effectively engaging in religious proselytizing at the Academy.[78] These allegations, along with concerns over how the Air Force handles other religious issues, prompted Academy graduate Michael L. Weinstein to file a lawsuit against the Air Force.[79][80] An Air Force panel investigated the accusations and issued a report on 22 June 2005.[81] The panel's investigation found a \\"religious climate that does not involve overt religious discrimination, but a failure to fully accommodate all members needs and a lack of awareness over where the line is drawn between permissible and impermissible expression of beliefs.\\" Evidence discovered during the investigation included antisemitic remarks, official sponsorship of a showing of the film The Passion of the Christ and a locker room banner that said academy athletes played for \\"Team Jesus.\\" In response to the panel's findings, the Air Force released new guidelines to discourage public prayers at official events or meetings and to facilitate worship by non-Christian religions.[82]\\r\\nIn 2010 the academy set up an outdoor worship area for cadets following Wicca, Neo-Druidism, or other earth-based religions to practice their faiths.[83][84]\\r\\nA 2010 survey found that 41 percent of academy cadets who identified themselves as non-Christian reported they were subjected to unwanted religious proselytizing at least once or twice last year at the school. The survey's results, however, showed that the number of cadets who felt pressured to join in religious activities had declined from previous years. Colorado congressman Mike Coffman criticized the academy for resisting calls to release details of the survey's results.[85][86]\\r\\nIn 2012, 66 House Republicans complained about policies set in place the last September to curtail requirements to attend religious events.[87]\\r\\nCoordinates: 3901N 10453W? / ?39.01N 104.89W? / 39.01; -104.89","input":"Where is the u.s. air force academy located?"},{"output":"40,524 at the 2010 census","context":"Sumter /?s?mt?r/ is a city in and the county seat of Sumter County, South Carolina, United States.[3] Known as the Sumter Metropolitan Statistical Area, the namesake county adjoins Clarendon and Lee to form the core of Sumter-Lee-Clarendon tri-county area of South Carolina, an area that includes the three counties in the east central Piedmont.

In the 1780s his cerebral brand of history painting marked a change in taste away from Rococo frivolity toward classical austerity and severity and heightened feeling,[1] harmonizing with the moral climate of the final years of the Ancien Rgime.\\r\\n\\r\\nDavid later became an active supporter of the French Revolution and friend of Maximilien Robespierre (1758ÿ1794), and was effectively a dictator of the arts under the French Republic. Imprisoned after Robespierre's fall from power, he aligned himself with yet another political regime upon his release: that of Napoleon, The First Consul of France. At this time he developed his Empire style, notable for its use of warm Venetian colours. After Napoleon's fall from Imperial power and the Bourbon revival, David exiled himself to Brussels, then in the United Kingdom of the Netherlands, where he remained until his death. David had a large number of pupils, making him the strongest influence in French art of the early 19th century, especially academic Salon painting.\\r\\n\\r\\nJacques-Louis David was born into a prosperous family in Paris on 30 August 1748. When he was about nine his father was killed in a duel and his mother left him with his well-off architect uncles. They saw to it that he received an excellent education at the Collge des Quatre-Nations, University of Paris, but he was never a good student: he had a facial tumor that impeded his speech, and he was always preoccupied with drawing. He covered his notebooks with drawings, and he once said, \\"I was always hiding behind the instructor's chair, drawing for the duration of the class\\". Soon, he desired to be a painter, but his uncles and mother wanted him to be an architect. He overcame the opposition, and went to learn from Fran?ois Boucher (1703ÿ1770), the leading painter of the time, who was also a distant relative. Boucher was a Rococo painter, but tastes were changing, and the fashion for Rococo was giving way to a more classical style. Boucher decided that instead of taking over David's tutelage, he would send David to his friend, Joseph-Marie Vien (1716ÿ1809), a painter who embraced the classical reaction to Rococo. There David attended the Royal Academy, based in what is now the Louvre.\\r\\n\\r\\nEach year the Academy awarded an outstanding student the prestigious Prix de Rome, which funded a three- to five-year stay in the Eternal City. The culmination of the Academy's educational program, the Rome trip provided its winners the opportunity to study the remains of classical antiquity and the works of the Italian Renaissance masters at first hand. Each pensionnaire was lodged in the French Academy's Roman outpost, which from the years 1737 to 1793 was the Palazzo Mancini in the Via del Corso. David competed for, and failed to win, the prize for three consecutive years (with Minerva Fighting Mars, Diana and Apollo Killing Niobe's Children and The Death of Seneca), each failure contributing to his lifelong grudge against the institution.  After his second loss in 1772, David went on a hunger strike, which lasted two and a half days before the faculty encouraged him to continue painting. Confident he now had the support and backing needed to win the prize, he resumed his studies with great zealonly to fail to win the Prix de Rome again the following year. Finally, in 1774, David was awarded the Prix de Rome on the strength of his painting of Erasistratus Discovering the Cause of Antiochus' Disease, a subject set by the judges. In October 1775 he made the journey to Italy with his mentor, Joseph-Marie Vien, who had just been appointed director of the French Academy at Rome.[2]\\r\\n\\r\\nWhile in Italy, David especially studied the works of 17th-century masters such as Poussin, Caravaggio, and the Carracci.[2] Although he declared, \\"the Antique will not seduce me, it lacks animation, it does not move\\",[2] David filled twelve sketchbooks with drawings that he and his studio used as model books for the rest of his life. He was introduced to the painter Raphael Mengs (1728ÿ1779), who opposed the tendency in Rococo painting to sweeten and trivialize ancient subjects, advocating instead the rigorous study of classical sources and close adherence to ancient models. Mengs' principled, historicizing approach to the representation of classical subjects profoundly influenced David's pre-revolutionary painting, such as The Vestal Virgin, probably from the 1780s. Mengs also introduced David to the theoretical writings on ancient sculpture by Johann Joachim Winckelmann (1717ÿ1768), the German scholar held to be the founder of modern art history.[3] In 1779, David toured the newly excavated ruins of Pompeii, which deepened his belief that the persistence of classical culture was an index of its eternal conceptual and formal power. While in Rome, David also assiduously studied the High Renaissance painters, Raphael making a profound and lasting impression on the young French artist.\\r\\n\\r\\nDavid's fellow students at the academy found him difficult to get along with, but they recognized his genius. David's stay at the French Academy in Rome was extended by a year, but in July 1780 he returned to Paris.[2] There, he found people ready to use their influence for him, and he was made a member of the Royal Academy. He sent the Academy two paintings, and both were included in the Salon of 1781, a high honor. He was praised by his famous contemporary painters, but the administration of the Royal Academy was very hostile to this young upstart. After the Salon, the King granted David lodging in the Louvre, an ancient and much desired privilege of great artists. When the contractor of the King's buildings, M. Pcoul, was arranging with David, he asked the artist to marry his daughter, Marguerite Charlotte. This marriage brought him money and eventually four children. David had his own pupils, about 40 to 50, and was commissioned by the government to paint \\"Horace defended by his Father\\", but he soon decided, \\"Only in Rome can I paint Romans.\\" His father-in-law provided the money he needed for the trip, and David headed for Rome with his wife and three of his students, one of whom, Jean-Germain Drouais (1763ÿ1788), was the Prix de Rome winner of that year.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn Rome, David painted his famous Oath of the Horatii, 1784. In this piece, the artist references Enlightenment values while alluding to Rousseau's social contract. The republican ideal of the general will becomes the focus of the painting with all three sons positioned in compliance with the father. The Oath between the characters can be read as an act of unification of men to the binding of the state.[4] The issue of gender roles also becomes apparent in this piece, as the women in Horatii greatly contrast the group of brothers. David depicts the father with his back to the women, shutting them out of the oath making ritual; they also appear to be smaller in scale than the male figures.[5]  The masculine virility and discipline displayed by the men's rigid and confident stances is also severely contrasted to the slouching, swooning female softness created in the other half of the composition.[6]  Here we see the clear division of male-female attributes that confined the sexes to specific roles under Rousseau's popularized doctrine of \\"separate spheres\\".\\r\\n\\r\\nThese revolutionary ideals are also apparent in the Distribution of Eagles. While Oath of the Horatii and The Tennis Court Oath stress the importance of masculine self-sacrifice for one's country and patriotism, the Distribution of Eagles would ask for self-sacrifice for one's Emperor (Napoleon) and the importance of battlefield glory.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1787, David did not become the Director of the French Academy in Rome, which was a position he wanted dearly. The Count in charge of the appointments said David was too young, but said he would support him in 6 to 12 years. This situation would be one of many that would cause him to lash out at the Academy in years to come.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor the Salon of 1787, David exhibited his famous Death of Socrates.  \\"Condemned to death, Socrates, strong, calm and at peace, discusses the immortality of the soul. Surrounded by Crito, his grieving friends and students, he is teaching, philosophizing, and in fact, thanking the God of Health, Asclepius, for the hemlock brew which will ensure a peaceful death... The wife of Socrates can be seen grieving alone outside the chamber, dismissed for her weakness. Plato is depicted as an old man seated at the end of the bed.\\" Critics compared the Socrates with Michelangelo's Sistine Ceiling and Raphael's Stanze, and one, after ten visits to the Salon, described it as \\"in every sense perfect\\". Denis Diderot said it looked like he copied it from some ancient bas-relief. The painting was very much in tune with the political climate at the time. For this painting, David was not honored by a royal \\"works of encouragement\\".\\r\\n\\r\\nFor his next painting, David created The Lictors Bring to Brutus the Bodies of His Sons. The work had tremendous appeal for the time. Before the opening of the Salon, the French Revolution had begun. The National Assembly had been established, and the Bastille had fallen. The royal court did not want propaganda agitating the people, so all paintings had to be checked before being hung. David's portrait of Lavoisier, who was a chemist and physicist as well as an active member of the Jacobin party, was banned by the authorities for such reasons.[7] When the newspapers reported that the government had not allowed the showing of The Lictors Bring to Brutus the Bodies of His Sons, the people were outraged, and the royals were forced to give in. The painting was hung in the exhibition, protected by art students. The painting depicts Lucius Junius Brutus, the Roman leader, grieving for his sons. Brutus's sons had attempted to overthrow the government and restore the monarchy, so the father ordered their death to maintain the republic. Thus, Brutus was the heroic defender of the republic, at the cost of his own family. On the right, the Mother holds her two daughters, and the nurse is seen on the far right, in anguish. Brutus sits on the left, alone, brooding, seemingly dismissing the dead bodies of his sons. Knowing what he did was best for his country, but the tense posture of his feet and toes reveals his inner turmoil. The whole painting was a Republican symbol, and obviously had immense meaning during these times in France.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the beginning, David was a supporter of the Revolution, a friend of Robespierre and a member of the Jacobin Club. While others were leaving the country for new and greater opportunities, David stayed to help destroy the old order; he was a regicide who voted in the National Convention for the Execution of Louis XVI. It is uncertain why he did this,[citation needed] as there were many more opportunities for him under the King than the new order; some people suggest David's love for the classical made him embrace everything about that period, including a republican government.\\r\\n\\r\\nOthers believed that they found the key to the artist's revolutionary career in his personality. Undoubtedly, David's artistic sensibility, mercurial temperament, volatile emotions, ardent enthusiasm, and fierce independence might have been expected to help turn him against the established order but they did not fully explain his devotion to the republican regime. Nor did the vague statements of those who insisted upon his \\"powerful ambition...and unusual energy of will\\" actually account for his revolutionary connections. Those who knew him maintained that \\"generous ardor\\", high-minded idealism and well-meaning though sometimes fanatical enthusiasm, rather than opportunism and jealousy, motivated his activities during this period.\\r\\n\\r\\nSoon, David turned his critical sights on the Royal Academy of Painting and Sculpture. This attack was probably caused primarily by the hypocrisy of the organization and their personal opposition against his work, as seen in previous episodes in David's life. The Royal Academy was chock full of royalists, and David's attempt to reform it did not go over well with the members. However, the deck was stacked against this symbol of the old regime, and the National Assembly ordered it to make changes to conform to the new constitution.\\r\\n\\r\\nDavid then began work on something that would later hound him: propaganda for the new republic. David's painting of Brutus was shown during the play Brutus, by the famous Frenchman, Voltaire. The people responded in an uproar of approval.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1789, Jacques-Louis David attempted to leave his artistic mark on the historical beginnings of the French Revolution with his painting of The Oath of the Tennis Court. David undertook this task not out of personal political conviction but rather because he was commissioned to do so. The painting was meant to commemorate the event of the same name but was never completed. A meeting of the Estates General was convened in May to address reforms of the monarchy. Dissent arose over whether the three estates would meet separately, as had been tradition, or as one body. The King's acquiescence with the demands of the upper orders led to the deputies of the Third Estate renaming themselves as the National Assembly on 17 June. They were locked out of the meeting hall three days later when they attempted to meet, and forced to reconvene to the royal indoor tennis court. Presided over by Jean-Sylvain Bailly, they made a 'solemn oath never to separate' until a national constitution had been created. In 1789 this event was seen as a symbol of the national unity against the ancien regime. Rejecting the current conditions, the oath signified a new transition in human history and ideology.[8] David was enlisted by the Society of Friends of the Constitution, the body that would eventually form the Jacobins, to enshrine this symbolic event.[9]\\r\\n\\r\\nThis instance is notable in more ways than one because it eventually led David to finally become involved in politics as he joined the Jacobins. The picture was meant to be massive in scale; the figures in the foreground were to be life-sized portraits of the counterparts, including Jean-Sylvain Bailly, the President of the Constituent Assembly. Seeking additional funding, David turned to the Society of Friends of the Constitution. The funding for the project was to come from over three thousand subscribers hoping to receive a print of the image. However, when the funding was insufficient, the state ended up financing the project.[2]\\r\\n\\r\\nDavid set out in 1790 to transform the contemporary event into a major historical picture which would appear at the Salon of 1791 as a large pen-and-ink drawing. As in the Oath of the Horatii, David represents the unity of men in the service of a patriotic ideal. The outstretched arms which are prominent in both works betray David's deeply held belief that acts of republican virtue akin to those of the Romans were being played out in France. In what was essentially an act of intellect and reason, David creates an air of drama in this work. The very power of the people appears to be \\"blowing\\" through the scene with the stormy weather, in a sense alluding to the storm that would be the revolution.\\r\\n\\r\\nSymbolism in this work of art closely represents the revolutionary events taking place at the time. The figure in the middle is raising his right arm making the oath that they will never disband until they have reached their goal of creating a \\"constitution of the realm fixed upon solid foundations.\\"[10] The importance of this symbol is highlighted by the fact that the crowd's arms are angled to his hand forming a triangular shape. Additionally, the open space in the top half contrasted to the commotion in the lower half serves to emphasize the magnitude of the Tennis Court Oath.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn his attempt to depict political events of the Revolution in \\"real time\\", David was venturing down a new and untrodden path in the art world. However, Thomas Crow argues that this path \\"proved to be less a way forward than a cul-de-sac for history painting.\\"[9]   Essentially, the history of the demise of David's The Tennis Court Oath illustrates the difficulty of creating works of art that portray current and controversial political occurrences.  Political circumstances in France proved too volatile to allow the completion of the painting. The unity that was to be symbolized in The Tennis Court Oath no longer existed in radicalized 1792.  The National Assembly had split between conservatives and radical Jacobins, both vying for political power.  By 1792 there was no longer consensus that all the revolutionaries at the tennis court were \\"heroes\\".  A sizeable number of the heroes of 1789 had become the villains of 1792. In this unstable political climate David's work remained unfinished. With only a few nude figures sketched onto the massive canvas, David abandoned The Oath of the Tennis Court. To have completed it would have been politically unsound. After this incident, when David attempted to make a political statement in his paintings, he returned to the less politically charged use of metaphor to convey his message.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen Voltaire died in 1778, the church denied him a church burial, and his body was interred near a monastery. A year later, Voltaire's old friends began a campaign to have his body buried in the Panthon, as church property had been confiscated by the French Government. In 1791 David was appointed to head the organizing committee for the ceremony, a parade through the streets of Paris to the Panthon. Despite rain, and opposition from conservatives based on the amount of money that was being spent, the procession went ahead. Up to 100,000 people watched the \\"Father of the Revolution\\" be carried to his resting place. This was the first of many large festivals organized by David for the republic. He went on to organize festivals for martyrs that died fighting royalists. These funerals echoed the religious festivals of the pagan Greeks and Romans and are seen by many as Saturnalian.\\r\\n\\r\\nDavid incorporated many revolutionary symbols into these theatrical performances and orchestrated ceremonial rituals; in effect radicalizing the applied arts, themselves. The most popular symbol for which David was responsible as propaganda minister was drawn from classical Greek images; changing and transforming them with contemporary politics. In an elaborate festival held on the anniversary of the revolt that brought the monarchy to its knees, David's Hercules figure was revealed in a procession following the Goddess of Liberty (Marianne). Liberty, the symbol of Enlightenment ideals was here being overturned by the Hercules symbol; that of strength and passion for the protection of the Republic against disunity and factionalism.[11] In his speech during the procession, David \\"explicitly emphasized the opposition between people and monarchy; Hercules was chosen, after all, to make this opposition more evident\\".[12] The ideals that David linked to his Hercules single-handedly transformed the figure from a sign of the old regime into a powerful new symbol of revolution. \\"David turned him into the representation of a collective, popular power. He took one of the favorite signs of monarchy and reproduced, elevated, and monumentalized it into the sign of its opposite.\\"[13] Hercules, the image, became to the revolutionaries, something to rally around.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn June 1791, the King made an ill-fated attempt to flee the country, but was apprehended short of his goal on the Austrian Netherlands border and was forced to return under guard to Paris. Louis XVI had made secret requests to Emperor Leopold II of Austria, Marie-Antoinette's brother, to restore him to his throne. This was granted and Austria threatened France if the royal couple were hurt. In reaction, the people arrested the King. This led to an Invasion after the trials and execution of Louis and Marie-Antoinette. The Bourbon monarchy was destroyed by the French people in 1792it would be restored after Napoleon, then destroyed again with the Restoration of the House of Bonaparte. When the new National Convention held its first meeting, David was sitting with his friends Jean-Paul Marat and Robespierre. In the Convention, David soon earned a nickname \\"ferocious terrorist\\". Soon, Robespierre's agents discovered a secret vault of the king's proving he was trying to overthrow the government, and demanded his execution. The National Convention held the trial of Louis XVI and David voted for the death of the King, causing his wife, a royalist, to divorce him.[citation needed]\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen Louis XVI was executed on 21 January 1793, another man had already died as wellLouis Michel le Peletier de Saint-Fargeau. Le Peletier was killed on the preceding day by a royal bodyguard in revenge for having voted for the death of the King. David was called upon to organize a funeral, and he painted Le Peletier Assassinated.  In it, the assassin's sword was seen hanging by a single strand of horsehair above Le Peletier's body, a concept inspired by the proverbial ancient tale of the sword of Damocles, which illustrated the insecurity of power and position. This underscored the courage displayed by Le Peletier and his companions in routing an oppressive king. The sword pierces a piece of paper on which is written \\"I vote the death of the tyrant\\", and as a tribute at the bottom right of the picture David placed the inscription \\"David to Le Peletier. 20 January 1793\\". The painting was later destroyed by Le Peletier's royalist daughter, and is known by only a drawing, an engraving, and contemporary accounts. Nevertheless, this work was important in David's career because it was the first completed painting of the French Revolution, made in less than three months, and a work through which he initiated the regeneration process that would continue with The Death of Marat, David's masterpiece.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn 13 July 1793, David's friend Marat was assassinated by Charlotte Corday with a knife she had hidden in her clothing. She gained entrance to Marat's house on the pretense of presenting him a list of people who should be executed as enemies of France. Marat thanked her and said that they would be guillotined next week upon which Corday immediately fatally stabbed him. She was guillotined shortly thereafter. Corday was of an opposing political party, whose name can be seen in the note Marat holds in David's subsequent painting, The Death of Marat. Marat, a member of the National Convention and a journalist, had a skin disease that caused him to itch horribly. The only relief he could get was in his bath over which he improvised a desk to write his list of suspect counter-revolutionaries who were to be quickly tried and, if convicted, guillotined. David once again organized a spectacular funeral, and Marat was buried in the Panthon. Marat's body was to be placed upon a Roman bed, his wound displayed and his right arm extended holding the pen which he had used to defend the Republic and its people. This concept was to be complicated by the fact that the corpse had begun to putrefy. Marat's body had to be periodically sprinkled with water and vinegar as the public crowded to see his corpse prior to the funeral on 15 and 16 July. The stench became so bad however that the funeral had to be brought forward to the evening of 16 July.[14]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Death of Marat, perhaps David's most famous painting, has been called the Piet of the revolution. Upon presenting the painting to the convention, he said \\"Citizens, the people were again calling for their friend; their desolate voice was heard: David, take up your brushes.., avenge Marat... I heard the voice of the people. I obeyed.\\"  David had to work quickly, but the result was a simple and powerful image.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Death of Marat, 1793, became the leading image of the Terror and immortalized both Marat and David in the world of the revolution. This piece stands today as \\"a moving testimony to what can be achieved when an artist's political convictions are directly manifested in his work\\".[15]  A political martyr was instantly created as David portrayed Marat with all the marks of the real murder, in a fashion which greatly resembles that of Christ or his disciples.[16] The subject although realistically depicted remains lifeless in a rather supernatural composition. With the surrogate tombstone placed in front of him and the almost holy light cast upon the whole scene; alluding to an out of this world existence.  \\"Atheists though they were, David and Marat, like so many other fervent social reformers of the modern world, seem to have created a new kind of religion.\\"[17] At the very center of these beliefs, there stood the republic.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter the King's execution, war broke out between the new Republic and virtually every major power in Europe. David, as a member of the Committee of General Security, contributed directly to the Reign of Terror.[18] David organized his last festival: the festival of the Supreme Being. Robespierre had realized what a tremendous propaganda tool these festivals were, and he decided to create a new religion, mixing moral ideas with the Republic and based on the ideas of Rousseau. This process had already begun by confiscating church lands and requiring priests to take an oath to the state. The festivals, called ftes, would be the method of indoctrination. On the appointed day, 20 Prairial by the revolutionary calendar, Robespierre spoke, descended steps, and with a torch presented to him by David, incinerated a cardboard image symbolizing atheism, revealing an image of wisdom underneath.\\r\\n\\r\\nSoon, the war began to go well; French troops marched across the southern half of the Netherlands (which would later become Belgium), and the emergency that had placed the Committee of Public Safety in control was no more. Then plotters seized Robespierre at the National Convention and he was later guillotined, in effect ending the Reign of Terror. As Robespierre was arrested, David yelled to his friend \\"if you drink hemlock, I shall drink it with you.\\"[19] After this, he supposedly fell ill, and did not attend the evening session because of \\"stomach pain\\", which saved him from being guillotined along with Robespierre. David was arrested and placed in prison, first from 2 August to 28 December 1794 and then from 29 May to 3 August 1795.[2] There he painted his own portrait, showing him much younger than he actually was, as well as that of his jailer.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter David's wife visited him in jail, he conceived the idea of telling the story of The rape of the Sabine women.  The Sabine Women Enforcing Peace by Running between the Combatants, also called The Intervention of the Sabine Women is said to have been painted to honor his wife, with the theme being love prevailing over conflict. The painting was also seen as a plea for the people to reunite after the bloodshed of the revolution.[20]\\r\\n\\r\\nDavid conceived a new style for this painting, one which he called the \\"Grecian style\\", as opposed to the \\"Roman style\\" of his earlier historical paintings. The new style was influenced heavily by the work of art historian Johann Joachim Winckelmann. In David's words, \\"the most prominent general characteristics of the Greek masterpieces are a noble simplicity and silent greatness in pose as well as in expression.\\"[21]\\r\\n\\r\\nThis work also brought him to the attention of Napoleon. The story for the painting is as follows: \\"The Romans have abducted the daughters of their neighbors, the Sabines. To avenge this abduction, the Sabines attacked Rome, although not immediatelysince Hersilia, the daughter of Tatius, the leader of the Sabines, had been married to Romulus, the Roman leader, and then had two children by him in the interim. Here we see Hersilia between her father and husband as she adjures the warriors on both sides not to take wives away from their husbands or mothers away from their children. The other Sabine Women join in her exhortations.\\" During this time, the martyrs of the Revolution were taken from the Pantheon and buried in common ground, and revolutionary statues were destroyed. When David was finally released to the country, France had changed. His wife managed to get him released from prison, and he wrote letters to his former wife, and told her he never ceased loving her.  He remarried her in 1796. Finally, wholly restored to his position, he retreated to his studio, took pupils and for the most part, retired from politics.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn August 1796, David and many other artists signed a petition orchestrated by Quatremre de Quincy which questioned the wisdom of the planned seizure of works of art from Rome. The Director Barras believed that David was \\"tricked\\" into signing, although one of David's students recalled that in 1798 his master lamented the fact that masterpieces had been imported from Italy.\\r\\n\\r\\nDavid's close association with the Committee of Public Safety during the Terror resulted in his signing of the death warrant for Alexandre de Beauharnais, a minor noble. Beauharnais's widow, Josphine, went on to marry Napoleon Bonaparte and became his empress; David himself depicted their coronation in the Coronation of Napoleon and Josephine, 2?December 1804.\\r\\n\\r\\nDavid had been an admirer of Napoleon from their first meeting, struck by Bonaparte's classical features. Requesting a sitting from the busy and impatient general, David was able to sketch Napoleon in 1797. David recorded the face of the conqueror of Italy, but the full composition of Napoleon holding the peace treaty with Austria remains unfinished. Bonaparte had high esteem for David, and asked him to accompany him to Egypt in 1798, but David refused, claiming he was too old for adventuring and sending instead his student, Antoine-Jean Gros.[citation needed]\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter Napoleon's successful coup d'tat in 1799, as First Consul he commissioned David to commemorate his daring crossing of the Alps. The crossing of the St. Bernard Pass had allowed the French to surprise the Austrian army and win victory at the Battle of Marengo on 14 June 1800. Although Napoleon had crossed the Alps on a mule, he requested that he be portrayed \\"calm upon a fiery steed\\". David complied with Napoleon Crossing the Saint-Bernard.  After the proclamation of the Empire in 1804, David became the official court painter of the regime. During this period he took students, one of whom was the Belgian painter Pieter van Hanselaere.\\r\\n\\r\\nOne of the works David was commissioned for was The Coronation of Napoleon in Notre Dame. David was permitted to watch the event. He had plans of Notre Dame delivered and participants in the coronation came to his studio to pose individually, though never the Emperor (the only time David obtained a sitting from Napoleon had been in 1797). David did manage to get a private sitting with the Empress Josphine and Napoleon's sister, Caroline Murat, through the intervention of erstwhile art patron Marshal Joachim Murat, the Emperor's brother-in-law. For his background, David had the choir of Notre Dame act as his fill-in characters. Pope Pius VII came to sit for the painting, and actually blessed David. Napoleon came to see the painter, stared at the canvas for an hour and said \\"David, I salute you.\\" David had to redo several parts of the painting because of Napoleon's various whims, and for this painting, he received twenty-four thousand Francs.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn the Bourbons returning to power, David figured in the list of proscribed former revolutionaries and Bonapartistsfor having voted execution for the deposed King Louis XVI; and for participating in the death of Louis XVII. Mistreated and starved, the imprisoned Louis XVII was forced into a false confession of incest with his mother, Queen Marie-Antoinette. This was untrue, as the son was separated from his mother early and was not allowed communication with her, nevertheless, the allegation helped earn her the guillotine. The newly restored Bourbon King, Louis XVIII, however, granted amnesty to David and even offered him the position of court painter. David refused, preferring self-exile in Brussels. There, he trained and influenced Brussels artists like Fran?ois-Joseph Navez and Ignace Brice, painted Cupid and Psyche and quietly lived the remainder of his life with his wife (whom he had remarried). In that time, he painted smaller-scale mythological scenes, and portraits of citizens of Brussels and Napoleonic migrs, such as the Baron Gerard.\\r\\n\\r\\nDavid created his last great work, Mars Being Disarmed by Venus and the Three Graces, from 1822 to 1824. In December 1823, he wrote: \\"This is the last picture I want to paint, but I want to surpass myself in it. I will put the date of my seventy-five years on it and afterwards I will never again pick up my brush.\\" The finished paintingevoking painted porcelain because of its limpid colorationwas exhibited first in Brussels, then in Paris, where his former students flocked to view it. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe exhibition was profitable13,000 francs, after deducting operating costs, thus, more than 10,000 people visited and viewed the painting. In his later years, David remained in full command of his artistic faculties, even after a stroke in the spring of 1825 disfigured his face and slurred his speech. In June 1825, he resolved to embark on an improved version of his \\"Anger of Achilles\\" (also known as the \\"Sacrifice of Iphigenie\\"); the earlier version was completed in 1819 and is now in the collection of the Kimbell Art Museum, Fort Worth, Texas. David remarked to his friends who visited his studio \\"this [painting] is what is killing me\\" such was his determination to complete the work, but by October it must have already been well advanced, as his former pupil Gros wrote to congratulate him, having heard reports of the painting's merits. By the time David died, the painting had been completed and the commissioner Ambroise Firmin-Didot brought it back to Paris to include it in the exhibition \\"Pour les grecs\\" that he had organised and which opened in Paris in April 1826.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen David was leaving a theater, a carriage struck him, and he later died, on 29 December 1825. At his death, some portraits were auctioned in Paris, they sold for little; the famous Death of Marat was exhibited in a secluded room, to avoid outraging public sensibilities. Disallowed return to France for burial, for having been a regicide of King Louis XVI, the body of the painter Jacques-Louis David was buried in Brussels and moved in 1882 to Brussels Cemetery, while some say his heart was buried with his wife at Pre Lachaise Cemetery, Paris.\\r\\nDavid was made a Chevalier de la Lgion d'honneur in 1803. He was promoted to an Officier in 1808. And, in 1815, he was promoted to a Commandant (now Commandeur) de la Lgion d'honneur.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe theme of the oath found in several works like The Oath of the Tennis Court, The Distribution of the Eagles, and Leonidas at Thermopylae, was perhaps inspired by the rituals of Freemasonry. In 1989 during the \\"David against David\\" conference Albert Boime was able to prove, on the basis of a document dated in 1787, the painter's membership in the \\"La Moderation\\" Masonic Lodge.[22][23]\\r\\n\\r\\nJacques-Louis David's facial abnormalities were traditionally reported to be a consequence of a deep facial sword wound after a fencing incident. These left him with a noticeable asymmetry during facial expression and resulted in his difficulty in eating or speaking (he could not pronounce some consonants such as the letter 'r'). A sword scar wound on the left side of his face is present in his self-portrait and sculptures and corresponds to some of the buccal branches of the facial nerve. An injury to this nerve and its branches are likely to have resulted in the difficulties with his left facial movement.\\r\\n\\r\\nFurthermore, as a result of this injury, he suffered from a growth on his face that biographers and art historians have defined as a benign tumor. These however may have been a granuloma, or even a post-traumatic neuroma.[24] As Simon Schama has pointed out, witty banter and public speaking ability were key aspects of the social culture of 18th-century France. In light of these cultural keystones, David's tumor would have been a heavy obstacle in his social life.[25] David was sometimes referred to as \\"David of the Tumor\\".[26]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn addition to his history paintings, David completed a number of privately commissioned portraits. Warren Roberts, among others, has pointed out the contrast between David's \\"public style\\" of painting, as shown in his history paintings, and his \\"private style\\", as shown in his portraits.[27] His portraits were characterized by a sense of truth and realism. He focused on defining his subjects features and characters without idealizing them.[28] This is different from the style seen in his historical paintings, in which he idealizes his figures features and bodies to align with Greek and Roman ideals of beauty.[29] He puts a great deal of detail into his portraits, defining smaller features like hands and fabric. The compositions of his portraits remain simple with blank backgrounds that allow the viewer to focus on the details of the subject.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe portrait he did of his wife (1813) is an example of his typical portrait style.[27] The background is dark and simple without any clues as to the setting, which forces the viewer to focus entirely on her. Her features are un-idealized and truthful to her appearance.[27] There is a great amount of detail that can be seen in his attention to portraying the satin material of the dress she wears, the drapery of the scarf around her, and her hands which rest in her lap. \\r\\n\\r\\nIn the painting of Brutus (1789), the man and his wife are separated, both morally and physically. Paintings like these, depicting the great strength of patriotic sacrifice, made David a popular hero of the revolution.[27]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the Portrait of Antoine-Laurent Lavoisier and his wife (1788), the man and his wife are tied together in an intimate pose. She leans on his shoulder while he pauses from his work to look up at her. David casts them in a soft light, not in the sharp contrast of Brutus or of the Horatii. Also of interestLavoisier was a tax collector, as well as a famous chemist. Though he spent some of his money trying to clean up swamps and eradicate malaria, he was nonetheless sent to the guillotine during the Reign of Terror as an enemy of the people. David, then a powerful member of the National Assembly, stood idly by and watched.[30]\\r\\n\\r\\nOther portraits include paintings of his sister-in-law and her husband, Madame and Monsieur Seriziat. The picture of Monsieur Seriziat depicts a man of wealth, sitting comfortably with his horse-riding equipment. The picture of the Madame shows her wearing an unadorned white dress, holding her young child's hand as they lean against a bed. David painted these portraits of Madame and Monsieur Seriziat out of gratitude for letting him stay with them after he was in jail.[31]\\r\\n\\r\\nTowards the end of David's life, he painted a portrait of his old friend Abb Sieys. Both had been involved in the Revolution, both had survived the purging of political radicals that followed the reign of terror. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe shift in David's perspective played an important role in the paintings of David's later life, including this one of Sieys.[32] During the height of the reign of terror, David was an ardent supporter of radicals such as Robespierre and Marat, and twice offered up his life in their defense. He organized revolutionary festivals and painted portraits of martyrs of the revolution, such as Lepeletier, who was assassinated for voting for the death of the king. David was an impassioned speaker at times in the National Assembly. In speaking to the Assembly about the young boy named Bara, another martyr of the revolution, David said, \\"O Bara! O Viala! The blood that you have spread still smokes; it rises toward Heaven and cries for vengeance.\\"[33]\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter Robespierre was sent to the guillotine, however, David was imprisoned and changed the attitude of his rhetoric. During his imprisonment he wrote many letters, pleading his innocence. In one he wrote, \\"I am prevented from returning to my atelier, which, alas, I should never have left. I believed that in accepting the most honorable position, but very difficult to fill, that of legislator, that a righteous heart would suffice, but I lacked the second quality, understanding.\\"[34]\\r\\n\\r\\nLater, while explaining his developing \\"Grecian style\\" for paintings such as The Intervention of the Sabine Women, David further commented on a shift in attitude: \\"In all human activity the violent and transitory develops first; repose and profundity appear last. The recognition of these latter qualities requires time; only great masters have them, while their pupils have access only to violent passions.\\"[35]\\r\\n\\r\\nJacques-Louis David was, in his time, regarded as the leading painter in France, and arguably all of Western Europe; many of the painters honored by the restored Bourbons following the French Revolution had been David's pupils.[36]  David's student Antoine-Jean Gros for example, was made a Baron and honored by Napoleon Bonaparte's court.[36]  Another pupil of David's, Jean Auguste Dominique Ingres became the most important artist of the restored Royal Academy and the figurehead of the Neoclassical school of art, engaging the increasingly popular Romantic school of art that was beginning to challenge Neoclassicism.[36] David invested in the formation of young artists for the Rome Prize, which was also a way to pursue his old rivalry with other contemporary painters such as Joseph Suvee, who also had opened teaching studios.[37] To be one of David's students was considered prestigious and earned his students a lifetime of reputation.[38] He also called on the more advanced students, such as Jr?me-Martin Langlois, to help him paint his large canvases.\\r\\n\\r\\nDespite David's reputation, he was more fiercely criticized right after his death than at any point during his life. His style came under the most serious criticism for being static, rigid, and uniform throughout all his work. David's art was also attacked for being cold and lacking warmth.[39] David, however, made his career precisely by challenging what he saw as the earlier rigidity and conformity of the French Royal Academy's approach to art.[40] David's later works also reflect his growth in the development of the Empire style, notable for its dynamism and warm colors. It is likely that much of the criticism of David following his death came from David's opponents; during his lifetime David made a great many enemies with his competitive and arrogant personality as well as his role in the Terror.[38] David sent many people to the guillotine and personally signed the death warrants for King Louis XVI and Marie Antoinette. One significant episode in David's political career that earned him a great deal of contempt was the execution of Emilie Chalgrin. A fellow painter Carle Vernet had approached David, who was on the Committee of Public Safety, requesting him to intervene on behalf of his sister, Chalgrin. She had been accused of crimes against the Republic, most notably possessing stolen items.[41] David refused to intervene in her favor, and she was executed. Vernet blamed David for her death, and the episode followed him for the rest of his life and after.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the last 50 years David has enjoyed a revival in popular favor and in 1948 his two-hundredth birthday was celebrated with an exhibition at the Muse de l'Orangerie in Paris and at Versailles showing his life's works.[42] Following World War II, Jacques-Louis David was increasingly regarded as a symbol of French national pride and identity, as well as a vital force in the development of European and French art in the modern era.[43]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe birth of Romanticism is traditionally credited to the paintings of eighteenth century French artists such as Jacques-Louis David.

In 1926, Pi?sudski. who was fed up with regional bickering, staged a coup deposed the president and had the National Assembly elect a new one, Ignacy Mo?cicki, under the thumb of Sanacja. Just before Pi?sudski died, parliament passed the 1935 April Constitution of Poland which incorporated Pi?sudski's ideals, but was not in accord with the amendment procedures of the 1921 Constitution.[2] Mo?cicki continued as president until he resigned following the German invasion of Poland in 1939. Mo?cicki and his government went into exile first into Romania, where Mo?cicki was interned, then to Angers in France where W?adys?aw Raczkiewicz, at the time the Speaker of the Senate, assumed the presidency following Mo?cicki's resignation on 29 September 1939,[3] and then on to London. The transfer from Mo?cicki to Raczkiewicz was in accordance with Article 24 of the 1935 April Constitution.[4][5]\\r\\nFollowing the invasion of Poland by the Red Army in 1944, Boles?aw Bierut assumed the reins of government, and in July 1945 was internationally recognized as the head of state, but it wasn't until 1947 when the Sejm passed an interim constitution based in part on the March 1921 constitution, that Bierut was elected president by the Sejm, the Senate having been abolished the previous year by the Polish people's referendum, 1946. He served until the 1952 Constitution eliminated the office of the president.[6]\\r\\nFollowing the 1989 amendments to the constitution which restored the presidency,[7] Wojciech Jaruzelski, the existing head of state, took office. In Poland's first direct presidential election, Lech Wa??sa won and was sworn in on 22 December 1990. The office of the president was continued in the Constitution of 1997, which now provides the requirements for, the duties of and the authority of the office.\\r\\nThe President of Poland is elected directly by the people to serve for five years and can be reelected only once. Pursuant to the provisions of the Constitution, the President is elected by an absolute majority. If no candidate succeeds in passing this threshold, a second round of voting is held with the participation of the two candidates with the largest and second largest number of votes respectively.\\r\\nIn order to be registered as a candidate in the presidential election, one must be a Polish citizen, be at least 35 years old on the day of the first round of the election and collect at least 100,000 signatures of registered voters.\\r\\nThe President has a free choice in selecting the Prime Minister, yet in practice he usually gives the task of forming a new government to a politician supported by the political party with the majority of seats in the Sejm (usually, though not always, it is the leader of that political party).\\r\\nThe President has the right to initiate the legislative process. He also has the opportunity to directly influence it by using his veto to stop a bill; however, his veto can be overruled by a three-fifths majority vote in the presence of at least half of the statutory number of members of the Sejm (230). Before signing a bill into law, the President can also ask the Constitutional Tribunal to verify its compliance with the Constitution, which in practice bears a decisive influence on the legislative process.\\r\\nIn his role as supreme representative of the Polish state, the President has power to ratify and revoke international agreements, nominates and recalls ambassadors, and formally accepts the accreditations of representatives of other states. The President also makes decisions on award of highest academic titles, as well as state distinctions and orders. In addition, he has the right of clemency, viz. he can dismiss final court verdicts (in practice, the President consults such decisions with the Minister of Justice).\\r\\nThe President is also the Supreme Commander of the Armed Forces; he appoints the Chief of the General Staff and the commanders of all of the service branches; in wartime he nominates the Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces and can order a general mobilization. The President performs his duties with the help of the following offices: the Chancellery of the President, the Office of National Security, and the Body of Advisors to the President.\\r\\nSeveral properties are owned by the Office of the President and are used by the Head of State as his or her official residence, private residence, residence for visiting foreign officials etc.\\r\\nThe constitution states that the President is an elected office, there is no directly elected presidential line of succession. If the President is unable to execute his/her powers and duties, the Marshal of the Sejm will have the powers of a President for a maximum of 60 days until elections are called.\\r\\nOn 10 April 2010, a plane carrying Polish President Lech Kaczyski, his wife, and 94 others including many Polish officials crashed near Smolensk-North Airport in Russia. There were no survivors.[8] Bronis?aw Komorowski took over acting presidential powers following the incident. On 8 July Bronislaw Komorowski resigned from the office of Marshal of the Sejm after winning the presidential election. According to the constitution, the acting president then became the Marshal of the Senate, Bogdan Borusewicz. In the afternoon Grzegorz Schetyna was elected as a new Marshal of the Sejm and he became acting president. Schetyna served as the interim head of state until Komorowski's swearing-in on 6 August.\\r\\nWithin Poland, former presidents are entitled to lifetime personal security protection by Biuro Ochrony Rz?du officers, in addition to receiving a substantial pension and a private office. On 10 April 2010, Lech Kaczyski, president at the time, and Ryszard Kaczorowski, the last president-in-exile although not internationally recognized, died in the crash of the Polish Air Force Tu-154 en route to Russia.[9]\\r\\nAs of 2016, three former Presidents of Poland are alive:\\r\\nAlso, three former Acting Presidents are alive:\\r\\nThere are three living former Polish Presidents:","input":"Who was the first elected president of poland?"},{"output":"Rian Johnson","context":"Star Wars: The Last Jedi (also known as Star Wars: Episode VIII ÿ The Last Jedi[3]) is an upcoming American epic space opera film written and directed by Rian Johnson.

Disney announced a new trilogy of Star Wars films.[31] J. J. Abrams was named director of the first episode in the trilogy, The Force Awakens, in January 2013.[32][33] In June 2014, director Rian Johnson was reported to be in talks to write and direct its sequel, dubbed Episode VIII, and to write a treatment for the third film, Episode IX, with Ram Bergman producing both films.[34][35] Johnson confirmed in August 2014 that he would direct Episode VIII.[36] In September, filmmaker Terry Gilliam asked Johnson about what it felt like to take over something that was made famous by another filmmaker, to which Johnson responded:\\r\\nI'm just starting into it, but so far, honestly, it's the most fun I've ever had writing. It's just joyous. But also for me personally, I grew up not just watching those movies but playing with those toys, so as a little kid, the first movies I was making in my head were set in this world. A big part of it is that direct connection, almost like an automatic jacking back into childhood in a weird way. But I don't know, ask me again in a few years and we'll be able to talk about that.[37]\\r\\nAccording to Johnson, the story begins immediately after the last scene of The Force Awakens.[26] He had his story group watch films such as Twelve O'Clock High, The Bridge on the River Kwai, Gunga Din, Three Outlaw Samurai, Sahara, and Letter Never Sent for inspiration while developing ideas.[26][38] He felt it was difficult to work on the film while The Force Awakens was being finished.[26] In December 2015, Lucasfilm president Kathleen Kennedy admitted that \\"we haven't mapped out every single detail [of the sequel trilogy] yet\\". She said that Abrams was collaborating with Johnson and that Johnson would in turn work with (then) Episode IX director Colin Trevorrow to ensure a smooth transition.[39] Abrams is an executive producer along with Jason McGatlin and Tom Karnowski.[40] Lucasfilm announced the film's title, Star Wars: The Last Jedi, on January 23, 2017.[41]\\r\\nIn September 2015, Disney shortlisted the female cast members to Gina Rodriguez, Tatiana Maslany, and Olivia Cooke.[42] Later that month, Benicio del Toro confirmed that he will play the villain in the film,[43] and Mark Hamill was also confirmed.[5] In October 2015, Gugu Mbatha-Raw was rumored to have been cast in the film.[44] In November, Jimmy Vee was cast as R2-D2.[21] In November, Kennedy announced at the London premiere for The Force Awakens that the entire cast would return for Episode VIII, along with \\"a handful\\" of new cast members.[6] In February 2016, at the start of filming, it was confirmed that Laura Dern and Kelly Marie Tran had been cast in unspecified roles.[2] In April 2017, at Star Wars Celebration Orlando, Lucasfilm announced that Tran plays Resistance maintenance worker Rose Tico, which Johnson described as the film's largest new role.[13][14]\\r\\nSecond unit photography began during pre-production at Skellig Michael in Ireland on September 14, 2015, due to the difficulties of filming at that location during other seasons. It would have lasted four days,[45][46][47] but filming was canceled for the first day due to poor weather and rough conditions.[48] In November 2014, Ivan Dunleavy, chief executive of Pinewood Studios, confirmed that the film would be shot at Pinewood,[49] with filming also occurring in Mexico.[10] In September 2015, del Toro revealed that principal photography would begin in March 2016;[43] however, Kennedy later stated that filming would begin in January 2016.[6] The production began work on the 007 Stage at Pinewood Studios on November 15, 2015.[50] Rick Heinrichs served as production designer.[51]\\r\\nIn January 2016, production of Episode VIII was delayed until February 2016, due to script rewrites.[52] Additionally, filming was potentially in danger of being delayed further due to an upcoming strike between the Producers Alliance for Cinema and Television and the Broadcasting, Entertainment, Cinematograph and Theatre Union.[53] On February 10, 2016, Disney CEO Bob Iger confirmed that principal photography had begun,[54] under the working title Space Bear.[26] Additional filming took place in Dubrovnik from March 9 to 16, 2016,[55][56] as well as in Ireland in May.[57] Malin Head in County Donegal and a mountain headland, Ceann Sibeal in County Kerry, served as additional filming locations.[58] Principal photography wrapped on July 22, 2016,[59] though as of early September 2016, Nyong'o had not filmed her scenes.[60] In February 2017, it was announced that sequences from the film were shot in IMAX.[61]\\r\\nIn July 2013, Kennedy announced at Star Wars Celebration Europe that John Williams would return to score the Star Wars sequel trilogy.[1][62] At a Tanglewood concert in August 2016, Williams confirmed he is scheduled to start scoring Episode VIII.[63] Williams said he would begin recording the score \\"off and on\\" in December 2016 until March or April 2017.[64] On February 21, 2017, it was confirmed that recording was underway, with Williams conducting.[65]\\r\\nIn January 2015, Disney CEO Bob Iger stated that Episode VIII would be released in 2017,[66] and in March, Lucasfilm announced a release date of May 26, 2017.[67][68] In January 2016, The Last Jedi was rescheduled for December 15, 2017 in 3D and IMAX 3D.[40][69] On January 23, 2017, the film's title was announced as Star Wars: The Last Jedi.[41] Similarly to The Empire Strikes Back, Return of the Jedi and The Force Awakens, \\"Episode VIII\\" will be included in the film's opening crawl, although not in its official title.[70]\\r\\nPre-sale tickets went on sale in the United States on October 9, 2017, and as with The Force Awakens and Rogue One, ticket service sites like Fandango had their servers crash due to heavy traffic and demand.[71]\\r\\nA set of eight promotional postage stamps are to be released on October 12, 2017 in the UK by the Royal Mail with artwork by Malcolm Tween.[72] On September 19, 2017, the Australia Post released a set stamp packs in the country.[73]\\r\\nEpisode IX, the final installment of the sequel trilogy, is scheduled to be released on December 20, 2019.[74] Prior to her death in December 2016, Carrie Fisher had been expected to appear in Episode IX.[75][76] Though Fisher's family granted the rights to use recent footage of Fisher for Star Wars: Episode IX,[77] Fisher will not appear in the film[78][79] and Lucasfilm will not digitally generate new footage of her.[80] Principal photography of Star Wars: Episode IX is set to begin in January 2018.[81][82] On September 5, 2017, Lucasfilm announced that Trevorrow had stepped down as director.[83] A week later, Lucasfilm announced that Abrams would return to direct Episode IX and co-write it with Chris Terrio.[84]","input":"Who is directing the new star wars movie?"},{"output":"a few minutes","context":"Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six Siege is a tactical shooter video game developed by Ubisoft Montreal and published by Ubisoft. It was released worldwide for Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 4, and Xbox One on December 1, 2015. The game puts heavy emphasis on environmental destruction and cooperation between players. Players assume control of an attacker or a defender in different gameplay modes such as hostage rescuing and bomb defusing. The title has no campaign, but features a series of short missions that can be played solo. These missions have a loose narrative, focusing on recruits going through training to prepare them for future encounters with the White Masks, a terrorist group that threatens the safety of the world.\\r\\nIt is an entry in the Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six series and the successor to Tom Clancy's Rainbow 6: Patriots, a tactical shooter that had a larger focus on narrative. However, Patriots was eventually cancelled due to its technical shortcomings, and the team decided to reboot the franchise. The team evaluated the core of the Rainbow Six franchise and believed that letting players impersonate the top counter-terrorist operatives around the world suited the game most. To create authentic siege situations, the team consulted actual counter-terrorism units, and looked at real-life examples of sieges. Powered by AnvilNext 2.0, the game also utilizes Ubisoft's RealBlast technology to create destructible environments.\\r\\nAnnounced at Electronic Entertainment Expo 2014, it received four nominations from Game Critics Awards including Best of Show. The game received a generally positive reception from critics, with praise mostly directed to the game's tense multiplayer and focus on tactics. However, the game was criticized for its progression system and its lack of content. Initial sales were weak, but the game's player base increased significantly as Ubisoft adopted a \\"games as a service\\" model for the game and subsequently released several packages of free downloadable content. The company also partnered with ESL to make Siege an eSports game. Two years after the game's initial launch, the game had 25 million registered players.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nTom Clancy's Rainbow Six Siege is a first-person shooter game, in which players control an operator from the Rainbow team. Different operators have different nationalities, weapons, and gadgets.[1] The game features an asymmetrical structure whereby the teams are not always balanced in their ability choices.[2] The Counter Terrorism Units (CTUs) available for play include the FBI Hostage Rescue Team, the British SAS, German GSG-9, Russian Spetsnaz and French GIGN, each of which has four operators per unit (other units were later added through downloadable content, see below). Players also have access to a \\"Recruit\\" operator who can choose from a more flexible assortment of equipment at the expense of having no unique gadget. Players pick an operator from any unit before a round starts, and are not allowed to change operators during a round. An in-game shop allows players to purchase operators using the in-game currency, \\"Renown\\", which is earned at the end of matches from actions performed in-game. The different gameplay modes award renown at different rates, with ranked matches offering the largest renown multiplier potential per match. Renown can also be affected with the addition of \\"boosters\\" which give the player a 100% increase in all renown earned for 24 hours (real time not play time). . Renown can be used to purchase weapon customization options, which allow players to put attachments such as silencers and scopes on their weapons.[3] A premium credit, known as \\"R6 credits\\" can also be purchased using real world currency to get operators quicker in-game, or other cosmetic.[4]\\r\\nIn ranked play, when a round begins, the attackers choose one of several spawn points from which to launch their attack. The attackers are then given control over wheeled drones to scout the map in search of enemy operators and targets,[5] while the defenders can use security cameras to spot the attackers.[6] Maps in the game are designed to encourage close quarters combat, and players cannot respawn until the end of a round. Defenders can also put up destructible barricades and reinforce walls to make them indestructible unless you have an appropriate operator. Players who were killed by opponents can enter \\"Support Mode\\", which allows them to gain access to drone's cameras and security cameras so that they can continue to contribute to their team by informing them of opponent locations and activities.[7][8] Matches generally last only a few minutes.[9] Teamwork and cooperation is encouraged in Siege, and players need to take advantage of their different abilities in order to complete the objective and defeat the enemy team.[5] Communication between players is also encouraged.[5][10] The game also has a spectator mode, which allows players to observe a match from different angles.[11]\\r\\nThe game features heavy emphasis on environmental destruction[12][13] using a procedural destruction system. Players can break structures by planting explosives on them, or shoot walls to make bullet holes.[14] Players may gain tactical advantages through environmental destruction, and the system aims at encouraging players to utilize creativity and strategy.[14][15] A bullet-penetration system is featured, in which bullets that pass through structures deal less damage to enemies.[13] In addition to destruction, players can also set up heavy-duty fortifications on walls and deployable shields around them for protection; these can be destroyed through breaching or by utilizing operator specific melee-weapons like sledgehammers.[16] In order to stop attackers' advance, defenders can place traps like barbed-wire and explosive laserwire traps around the maps.[17] Vertical space is a key gameplay element in the game's maps: players can destroy ceilings and floors using breach charges and can ambush enemies by rappelling through windows.[5] Powerful weapons like grenades and breach charges are valuable, as only limited numbers can be used in a round.[9]\\r\\nAt launch, the game featured 11 maps[18] and 5 different gameplay modes. With the downloadable content (DLC) ÿ an additional four maps from season one and the first map from season two[needs update] ÿ there are currently 16 maps with two more slated for release by January 2018. The gameplay modes featured include:\\r\\nThree years after Rainbow Program's deactivation, there is a resurgence of terrorist activities, with the White Mask being the most prominent. The terrorists' goals are unknown, yet they are causing chaos across the world.[27] To counter this rising threat, the program is reactivated by a new leader who is simply known as Six (voiced by Angela Bassett).[28] Six assembles a group of special forces operatives from different countries to face and combat the White Masks. Recruits go through multiple exercises to prepare them for future encounters with the White Masks, training to perform hostage rescue and bomb disposal. Eventually, the White Masks launch a chemical attack on a university (called Bartlett University), and the recruits are sent to disarm the bombs and eliminate the enemy presence. The operation is a massive success, though there are casualties. The story ends with Six affirming that the reactivation of Team Rainbow is the best and only choice in a time filled with risks and uncertainties. Team Rainbow is ready for their next mission ÿ to hunt down the leader of their enemy ÿ and they stand prepared to protect and defend their nation from terrorists.\\r\\nThis entire project was born and has grown out of an in-depth study that looked to distill what the Rainbow series is at its core in terms of both fantasy and gameplay. At the end of the day, the Rainbow Six fantasy about being part of the greatest counter-terrorist organization and impersonating the best of the best operators, working as a team, [and] carrying out dangerous operations (hostage rescue) anywhere on the globe\\r\\nThe game's predecessor was Tom Clancy's Rainbow 6: Patriots, a tactical shooter announced in 2011. It had a focus on narrative, and the story campaign features many cut-scenes and scripted events. However, the game fell into a development hell shortly after its announcement. The game's outdated engine and frequent change of leadership hindered development progress, and game quality was not up to par.[30] In addition, it was planned to be released on seventh-generation video-game consoles which were not capable of processing certain game mechanics. Seeing the arrival of a new generation of consoles, the team wanted to make use of this opportunity to create a more technologically advanced game.[31] As a result, Ubisoft decided to cancel Patriots, and assembled a new team of 25 people to come up with ideas to reboot the series.[32]\\r\\nTo make the new game feel refreshing, only certain multiplayer elements were retained as the small team took the game in a different direction. They evaluated the core of the Rainbow Six series, which they thought was about being a member of a counter-terrorist team traveling around the globe to deal with dangerous terrorist attacks ÿ operations which are usually intense confrontations between attackers and defenders.[29] However, the team wanted to fit these ideas into a multiplayer format which would increase the game's sustainability.[33][34] These became the basic concept ideas for the game. As the development team hoped that the game can be replayed frequently, the team decided to devote all the resources into developing the game's multiplayer and abandoned the single-player campaign.[35]\\r\\nDevelopment of the game officially began in January 2013. Ubisoft Montreal, the developer of Patriots, handled the game's development, with Ubisoft's offices in Barcelona, Toronto, Kiev, Shanghai and Chengdu providing assistance.[36][37] The game was originally called Rainbow Six Unbreakable, a title that reflected not only the game's destruction mechanic but also the mindset of the development team, who had to deliver a game that was once stuck in development hell.[33] According to Alexandre Remy, the brand director, the team was confident in their new vision for the game but very nervous when they revealed it, realizing the change of direction would likely disappoint some fans.[32]\\r\\nThe 150-person team consisted mainly of first-person shooter veterans or longtime Rainbow Six players.[33] Despite having prior knowledge on how these types of games work, the team decided to study historic examples of counter-terrorist operations, including 1980's London Iranian Embassy siege, 1977's Lufthansa Flight 181 hijacking, and 2002's Moscow theater hostage crisis to ensure that the portrayal of these operations was accurate and appropriate. The team also consulted counter-terrorism units, such as the National Gendarmerie Intervention Group (GIGN), for their opinions on how they would react during a hostage rescue situation.[38] According to Xavier Marquis, the game's creative director, having a hostage rescue mission in the game helped create an immersive story. By allowing players to assume control of an operator tasked with saving innocents, it gives them an objective and a priority. They must be careful in dealing with the situation and try their best not to hurt the hostage. This further promotes teamwork between players and prompts them to plan before attacking, and further makes the game more realistic, tense and immersive.[39] To make the game feel more realistic, the team introduced a mechanic called \\"living hostage\\" to govern the hostage character's behavior ÿ e.g., coughing if there is dust in the air or shielding him or herself if there is nearby gunfire.[40]\\r\\nThe environmental destruction mechanic was one of the game's most important elements. When the game's development was begun, The developer's in-house team completed their work on RealBlast Destruction, an engine that \\"procedurally breaks everything down\\" and remodels the environment.[41] The development team thought that this technology fitted the game's style and gameplay, and decided to use it.[42] This aspect of the game became increasingly important during development, and the team spent an extended period of time making sure that these destructions were authentic. As a result, the team implemented a materials-based tearing system, in which environmental objects of different materials show different reactions to players' attacks.[13] To render the game's texture, the team used physically based rendering, even though it was ineffective during the game's early stage of production due to issues with the game's engine. A material bank and substance painter were utilized to create textures for environmental objects when they were damaged or destroyed. The team also implemented subtle visual cues to help players identify whether a structure was destructible or not, as opposed to \\"distracting\\" players with more-obvious hints.[43] The destruction mechanic prompted Ubisoft to change their level-design approach, as they had to ensure that the level was still logical and realistic when parts of the environment were destroyed.[44]\\r\\nAccording to Ubisoft, \\"teamwork, tactics, and tension\\" were the game's three most important pillars. The team initially worked on a respawn feature, allowing players to rejoin after they are killed in the game. However, following several internal tournaments, the team realized that some of their employees would always win a match. They concluded that the respawn system worked to the benefit of strong players and placed individual skill above teamwork,[45] which did not fit the developer's focus on game tactics. Removing the respawn feature meant greater consequences for taking risks, and players had to rely on their teammates in order to survive and achieve objectives. According to Chris Lee, the game's designer, the team initially worried that the system would only appeal to hardcore players. However, after several testings, they found that the removal of the respawn system provided new challenges to strong players and forced them to cooperate with their teammates ÿ while it rewarded weaker players who were willing to take their time, plan their actions, and be strategic.[46][47][48]\\r\\nThe gameplay system was designed to allow players to have a lot of freedom. As a result, the team implemented the \\"Golden 3C Rules\\", which represents Character, Control, and Camera.[49] Players are always controlling their own actions and movements, and the team intentionally avoided any animation that would disrupt the players. As a result, actions such as setting explosives, or placing a breach charge, can be cancelled immediately so that players can react and shoot. The game's camera only moves when the player moves, as the team feared that the changes of camera angle may lead to players' in-game deaths. A free-lean system was introduced to the game so that players can have more control on their line of sight.[29] According to Ubisoft, this input-driven control mechanism makes the game feel more \\"natural\\" and \\"fluid\\". This is because it allows players to concentrate on planning and coordinating, rather than thinking if the camera or environment will interfere their actions.[50]\\r\\nSeveral gameplay elements were scrapped or removed from the final game. One of the features of its predecessors, artificial intelligence-controlled squadmates, were removed from single-player missions. This decision was made because the team wanted players to play with a squad controlled by actual players rather than computers. The team once considered adding a map editor so that players could design their own maps, but this plan never came to fruition. Hit markers, which would indicate an injury inflicted on an opponent, were removed because the team feared that players would abuse the system by \\"peppering the walls with gunfire\\" and use hit markers to locate enemies. Players cannot jump in the game, as real-life counter-terrorist unit operators do not jump while carrying out their missions.[47]\\r\\nAccording to Louis Philippe, the game's audio director, the team originally used intense music and sounds to create tension. However, the team decided to scrap this idea, realizing that the best way to create a tense atmosphere is to create the sounds of other players, which are often unexpected. The team created Navigation Sounds, in which the sound a player made is determined by their operators' weight, armor, and speed. Gadget deployment such as fortifying and breach-charging create louder sounds that may reveal the player's presence. The team thought that this would be enjoyable for players and influence their gameplay experience.[51] The game's music was composed by Paul Haslinger, who had worked on the score of the previous Rainbow Six games and the Far Cry series. His co-composer was Ben Frost, who debuted his first video game soundtrack with Siege. Leon Purviance assisted Frost and Haslinger in composing the music.[52]\\r\\nUbisoft announced the game at their press conference during Electronic Entertainment Expo 2014.[53] In August 2015, Ubisoft announced that they had delayed the game's release from October 10 to December 1, 2015, in order to give additional time for the team to balance the game for cooperative multiplayer play.[54] A closed alpha-testing was held by Ubisoft on April 7ÿ13, 2015, in which players could play an early version of the game in order to help the development team test their servers and core gameplay loops, and to provide feedback.[55] Ubisoft held a closed beta, starting on September 24, 2015, for further testing. The company originally wanted to hold another round of testing with the release of the game's open beta on November 25, 2015, but they delayed its release to November 26 due to matchmaking issues.[56] Players who purchased Siege for the Xbox One could download Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six: Vegas and its sequel, Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six: Vegas 2 for free.[57]\\r\\nThe game had multiple versions for players to purchase. A season pass was announced on November 12, 2015. Players who bought this version of the game could gain early access to operators offered in the DLCs and receive several weapon skins.[58] The game was also released alongside its Collector's Edition, which included the game's season pass, a hat, a compass and bottle opener, a backpack, and a 120-page guide.[59] A Starter Edition was released on PC in June 2016, featuring all the maps, modes and weapons of the standard edition, and included two operators plus enough Rainbow 6 Credits to purchase two more of the player's choice (players could purchase the rest of the operators with Renown or Rainbow 6 Credits). The Starter Edition was cheaper than the main game, and was initially available for a limited time.[60] In February 2017, the Starter Edition became permanently available via Uplay.[61]\\r\\nAccording to Ubisoft, the game adopted a \\"game as a service\\" approach, as they would provide long-term support for the game and offer post-release content to keep players engaged. The management team initially doubted the idea, but eventually decided to approve it.[32] The title was supported with many updates upon launch, with the company introducing fixes to bugs, and improvements on both matchmaking and general gameplay mechanics.[62][63] They also introduced an auto-kick system, which automatically removes players from a match when they kill a friendly player,[64] and launched the BattleEye system in August 2016 to punish cheaters.[65] All downloadable content maps was released to all players for free.[66] The team avoided adding more modes to the game because most would not fit well with the game's close-quarter combat.[67] Downloadable content for the game were divided into several seasons, with a Mid-Season Reinforcement patch which added new weapons and modified some of the operators' core abilities.[32] This post-release content was developed by the Montreal studio in conjunction with Blue Byte in Germany.[68]\\r\\nUbisoft also envisioned the game as an eSports game. The company had their first meeting with David Hiltscher, vice president of ESL, in late 2013. ESL offered feedback on the game's balancing and helped the developer to ensure that the game was suitable for competitive play.[89] The team focused on introducing new operators to provide variety for eSports viewers after the game's release, a decision inspired by modern multiplayer online battle arena games such as Dota 2, as this type of game often has 80ÿ100 playable characters.[90] ESL and Ubisoft officially announced Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six Pro League, a global tournament for Windows and Xbox One players. The competition was held at Intel Extreme Masters eSports tournament on March 4, 2016.[91] A European team, PENTA Sports, became the champion of the first season of Rainbow Six Pro League after defeating another team, GiFu, at the final of the tournament held in May 2016.[92] In 2017, It was revealed that Pro League Year Two would return, but Xbox One tournaments would not be featured.[93]\\r\\nThe pre-release reception of the game was positive, with critics praising the game's design and tensions created during matches.[24] In 2014, the game received four nominations from Game Critics Awards: Best of Show, Best PC Game, Best Action Game and Best Online Multiplayer Game.[107] The game eventually became the winner of the Best PC Game category.[108]\\r\\nTom Clancy's Rainbow Six Siege received \\"generally favorable\\" reviews from critics, according to review aggregator Metacritic. Critics generally praised the game's destructive environment, tactical nature, map design, and its focus on teamwork. However, the lack of content and the game's microtransactions were subjected to criticism.\\r\\nThe game's multiplayer was widely praised by critics. Chris Carter from Destructoid praised the game's open-ended nature, which made each match unpredictable and helped the experience to stay fresh even after an extended period of playing.[97] GameSpot's Scott Butterworth appreciated the title for allowing players to make use of their creativity in approaching a mission.[100] James Davenport from PC Gamer echoed this thought, and he described Siege as a \\"psychological race\\" in which players are constantly trying to outwit their opponents.[104] Ryan McCaffery from IGN also praised the tactical possibilities, which make the game \\"tense and riveting\\".[103] The large number of operators available for players to choose were praised by both Carter and Matt Bertz from Game Informer, who commented that they added depths and variety to the game and that players could experiment to see which pairs of operators can complement each other.[98] However, McCaffery was disappointed by the lack of variety of game modes, and commented that most players usually neglect the mode's objectives and opted to simply eliminate their opponents.[103] Terrorist Hunt received divisive opinions from critics. Carter thought that it was more relaxing,[97] and Butterworth thought it was exhilarating. However, Bertz criticized its lack of variety, weak artificial intelligence, and its less-intense nature when compared with the player-versus-player modes.[98] Martin Robinson from Eurogamer also noted that the mode only ran at 30 frames per second, which limited its appeal.[109]\\r\\nThe game's focus on tactics was praised. Bertz applauded the tactical nature of the game, as it fostered communications between players. However, he noted that teamwork may not be possible if players did not have a headphone and microphone.[98] Arthur Gies from Polygon echoed these comments, stating that the game's over-reliance on teamwork meant that when teammates were not communicating, the game would not be fun to play.[105] The \\"No Respawn\\" system was praised by Butterworth for making each match feel intense, as even the best player needs to think tactically in order to win.[100] Jonathon Leack from Game Revolution enjoyed the scouting phase of a multiplayer match, which encouraged players to communicate with each other and coordinate their attacks.[99] However, Gies noted that the placement of game objectives does not vary much, thus making the scouting phase meaningless. Both Bertz and Butterworth agreed that the game's competitive nature increases the game's replay value.[98][100] Ben Griffin from GamesRadar praised the destruction mechanic for bringing tactical depth to the game.[101]\\r\\nThe gameplay received mixed reviews. Both Bertz and Griffin criticized the game's incompetent hit detection system, which made the experience unfair.[101] Bertz described the game's gunplay as \\"servicable\\",[98] while Leack noticed a delay in shooting, which drags the game's pace and leads to a steep learning curve. However, Leack appreciated the game's map design, which opened many possibilities. He also praised its attention to detail and sound design, which can often make a multiplayer match feel like a \\"great action film\\".[99] Bertz was disappointed by the lack of customization options, which did not offer long-term progression for the players.[98] Butterworth similarly criticized the progression system for being slow. As players cannot play as the same operator in the same match, he was often forced to play as the generic \\"recruit\\" character when he was only at the beginning stage of the game. He also criticized the limited weapon customization options, which barely affect gameplay.[100] McCaffery described customization as the \\"least interesting\\" aspect of the game, and claimed that most gameplay features were locked when players started playing.[103] Griffin, Gies, and Steven Burns from VideoGamer.com were annoyed by the microtransactions featured in the game,[106][105] with Griffin describing it as a greedy attempt by Ubisoft to make more money,[101] though Davenport did not mind these features as they were limited to cosmetic items and could be unlocked through earning Renown.[104] Bertz was annoyed the lack of clan infrastructure, which may cause players troubles when they were finding matches,[98] while Griffin thought that map rotation often felt random and was disappointed that players cannot vote to decide which map they are going to play next.[101]\\r\\nSingle-player was generally considered a disappointment by critics, with Situations receiving mixed reviews. Carter described it as one of his \\"favorite non-campaign additions\\" as the mode gave players incentive to return due to its rating system. Butterworth described it as a \\"surprisingly robust\\" mode, and thought that there were great tutorial missions that help players to understand gameplay before trying multiplayer.[100] However, Bertz criticized it for its lack of replay value,[98] and Griffin noted their short length.[101] McCaffery thought that it served as a competent tutorial, but its solo play nature meant that players could not practice teamplay and tactics.[103] Davenport criticized the narrative in Situations, which he thought was not meaningful.[104] Many critics were disappointed with the lack of a single-player campaign or a cooperative campaign,[98][99] but Butterworth believed that the strong multiplayer components can compensate for this absence.[100] Gies noticed certain network issues would affect the single-player.[105]\\r\\nMany critics generally had a positive opinion on the package. Bertz thought that the game's multiplayer design had laid a great foundation for the game, but it was not taken advantage of due to the small number of game modes.[98] Leack felt that Siege's tight focus on tactical gameplay had \\"provided something unlike any other game on the market\\".[99] Butterworth found the game very unique and that there was \\"nothing else like it\\" when he put aside the game's minor annoyances.[100] Griffin wrote that the title felt very fresh, as most games in the market did not value tactics.[101] Davenport similarly praised the game for being very concentrated and making no compromises on gameplay design, which in turn make the title one of the best tactical multiplayer shooters on the market.[104] Gies recognized the game's potential but thought that they were overshadowed by the game's numerous technical annoyances, frustrating progression system and its lack of content.[105] Robinson was impressed by the game's multiplayer mode, and that the overall package could be considered as the year's best multiplayer game. However, he questioned Ubisoft for releasing the game with so little content while still selling it at full-price.[109]\\r\\nIn May 2015, CEO of Ubisoft Yves Guillemot announced that the company expected the game to outsell Far Cry 4's seven million sales over the course of its lifetime because of post-launch support.[110]\\r\\nAt the game's launch, it debuted at number six in UK Software Charts, selling 76,000 retail copies across all three platforms.[111] Critics thought that the launch performance was underwhelming and lackluster.[112] However, through continued post-release support and updates, the player base had doubled since the game's launch.[113] Following the summer 2016 launch of the third DLC, Skull Rain, the size of the player base had a 40% increase, and the title had more than 10 million registered players.[114] Two years after launch, the game remained as one of the top 40 best-selling retail games in the UK.[44] The strong performance of Siege, alongside with Tom Clancy's The Division (2016) and Tom Clancy's Ghost Recon Wildlands (2017) boosted the total number of players of the Tom Clancy's franchise to 44 million in 2017.[115] The post-launch success for Siege further solidified Ubisoft's belief in the model of \\"game as a service\\". Future Ubisoft multiplayer-focused titles ÿ such as For Honor ÿ adopted this structure, in which the company would provide free DLC and updates several years after the game's official release.[116] In August 2017, Ubisoft announced that the game had passed 20 million players and that the game was played by 2.3 million players every day.[117] Two years after the game's launch, Ubisoft announced that the game has passed 25 million registered players.[118]","input":"How long is a rainbow six siege game?"},{"output":"best-of-seven","context":"The NBA playoffs are a best-of-seven elimination tournament annually held after the National Basketball Association's regular season to determine the league's champion.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn September 2015, the NBA announced changes to the formula used to determine the format of the 2016 NBA Playoffs. The top eight teams in each conference (East and West), ranked in order by win-loss records, qualify for the playoffs. The tie-break criteria for playoff seeding and home-court advantage have also changed; head-to-head results between the tied teams is the first tie-breaker, and whether a team won its division championship is the second tie-breaker.[1]\\r\\n\\r\\nThese seedings are used to create a bracket that determines the match-ups throughout the series. Once the playoffs start, the bracket is fixed; teams are never \\"reseeded\\", unlike in the National Football League (NFL) and Major League Soccer (MLS) where the strongest remaining teams face the weakest teams in subsequent rounds. The first round of the NBA playoffs, or conference quarterfinals, consists of four match-ups in each conference based on the seedings (1ÿ8, 2ÿ7, 3ÿ6, and 4ÿ5). The four winners advance to the second round, or conference semifinals, with a match-up between the 1ÿ8 and 4ÿ5 winners and a match-up between the 2ÿ7 and 3ÿ6 winners. The two winners advance to the third round, or conference finals. The winner from each conference will advance to the final round, or the NBA Finals.\\r\\n\\r\\nAll rounds are best-of-seven series. Series are played in a 2ÿ2ÿ1ÿ1ÿ1 format, meaning the team with home-court advantage hosts games 1, 2, 5, and 7, while their opponent hosts games 3, 4, and 6, with games 5ÿ7 being played if needed. This format has been used since 2014, after NBA team owners unanimously voted to change from a 2ÿ3ÿ2 format on October 23, 2013.[2]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe most common criticism of the current structure is related to parity of conferences. On numerous occasions, Eastern Conference teams with losing records qualified for the playoffs, while Western Conference teams with winning records ended up missing them, including the 2011, 2013 and the 2015 NBA Playoffs.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe National Basketball Association was established in 1949 by merger of the Basketball Association of America (BAA) and National Basketball League but it recognizes the three BAA seasons as part of its own history. In all of its three years the BAA champion was finally determined in a best-of-seven series but its first two tournaments, the 1947 and 1948 BAA Playoffs, were otherwise quite different from the third, which 21st-century NBA playoffs nearly match. In 1947 and 1948, the Eastern and Western Division champions were matched in a best-of-seven series following the regular season, whose winner advanced to the championship round. Meanwhile, four runners-up played best-of-three series to determine the other finalist: the two second-place teams were matched in one short series and the two third-place teams in another; the winners of those two series played another one. In 1947 the Philadelphia Warriors won the runners-up bracket and beat the Western champion Chicago Stags four games to one, which the NBA recognizes as its first championship; in 1948 Baltimore won the runners-up and beat Eastern champion Philadelphia in the final. Both tournaments generated one finalist from the Eastern and one from the Western Division, but only by chance.[3]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1949 the third and last BAA tournament matched Eastern teams exclusively and Western teams exclusively, necessarily generating Eastern and Western playoff champions to meet in the final. At the same time, the number of playoff teams was increased from three to four from each Division; two rounds of best-of-three series were played, followed by a best-of-seven championship. The main idea was retained by the NBA. Even the 1950 tournament, following a transitional season with three divisions rather than two, initially determined one playoff champion from each division. The Central champion Minneapolis Lakers became the first league champion under the NBA name by defeating Anderson from the West in a best-of-three, with Syracuse from the East idle, and then knocking off the Syracuse Nationals in six games.[4]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe 1951 through 1953 playoffs changed the division finals into a best-of-five playoff. With only nine league members in 1953ÿ54, the NBA cut its postseason tournament field from eight teams to six (from 1954 through 1966, the period of eight to nine league members). Round robins were played in 1954, uniquely in NBA historya three-team round robin among the three playoff teams in each division. From 1955 to 1966, the first-place team in each division was idle while its two runners-up faced played a best-of-three. Division finals were expanded to best-of-seven in 1958 and division semifinals to best-of-five in 1961.\\r\\n\\r\\nWith ten league members again for the 1966ÿ67 season, eight teams were again admitted to the tournament, providing a simple three-round knockout (8-team bracket). A year later, the division semifinals were changed to best-of-seven playoff.  Then, in 1975 and 1977, respectively, a fifth and sixth team were added to each Division, necessitating an additional first round of best-of-three series.\\r\\n\\r\\nFinally in 1984, the tournament expanded to its present 16-team, four-round knockout, and the now-complete set of first-round series were expanded to a best-of-five. In 2003 the first round was changed to also be best-of-seven. (Thus all playoff teams from 2003 to present, same as the two Division champions in 1947 and 1948, continue to play at the close of the regular season without idle team (\\"bye\\") and may be certain of four playoff games including two at home.)\\r\\n\\r\\nBeginning with the 2004 season, with the addition of the thirtieth NBA franchise, the Charlotte Bobcats, the NBA realigned its divisions. The result was that each conference would have three divisions of five teams each, and the winner of each division was guaranteed a top-three playoff seed. This would change slightly after the 2005ÿ06 season; while division winners still receive automatic playoff berths, they are guaranteed a top-four seed, as described below.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe previous playoff format, in place for the 2004ÿ05 and 2005ÿ06 NBA playoffs, after the NBA was re-aligned into six divisions, created controversy during the 2005ÿ06 season and playoffs, and would be changed prior to the 2006ÿ07 NBA season.[5]\\r\\n\\r\\nPrior to 2005, NBA division champions were seeded higher than the other teams in their conference, regardless of their record. Prior to 2004, when the NBA was aligned into two conferences with two divisions each, the division champions were guaranteed the top two seeds. This meant that top two teams in a conference (by record) would be seeded either first and second (if they were in opposite divisions) or first and third (if they were in the same division). Because of the NBA playoffs' preset matchups in the second round, this meant that the top two teams in a conference could never meet until the conference finals, assuming they both made it to that round.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter the NBA realigned its two conferences into three divisions each, the seeding rules remained largely unchanged. The top three seeds would now be reserved for division champions.  However, this meant that if the top two teams (by record) in a conference were in the same division, they would be seeded first and fourth.  Assuming no first-round upsets, this raised the prospect that the top two teams in the conference would face each other in the conference semifinals, instead of the conference finals.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the second year of this format, the 2005ÿ06 NBA season, the two teams with the best records in the Western Conference, the San Antonio Spurs and Dallas Mavericks of the Southwest Division, did just that.  The Mavericks had the second-best record in the Western Conference and the third-best record in the entire league, behind the Detroit Pistons and San Antonio.  However, they were seeded fourth because they finished second in the Southwest behind the Spurs.  This turn of events led to the playoff format being criticized by many. Besides the prospect of a team losing earlier in the playoffs than its regular-season record or seeding would suggest, critics claimed that it also created an unfair advantage for teams in the 2-7/3-6 half of the Western Conference playoff bracket, who could advance to the conference finals without playing either of the two best teams in the conference in an earlier round.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Phoenix Suns, winners of the Pacific Division and possessors of the third best record, were seeded second, while the Denver Nuggets, winners of the Northwest Division and tied for only the seventh-best record in the conference, were seeded third.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Memphis Grizzlies and Los Angeles Clippers met in the second-to-last game of the regular season, after the top four seeds had been clinched. The two teams were already determined to be the fifth and sixth seeds, and had only to determine which rank higher. The fifth seed would likely need to defeat the best two teams in the conference without home-court advantage to advance to the conference finals, as it would face fourth-seeded Dallas in the first round and likely face first-seeded San Antonio if it managed to defeat Dallas. The sixth seed would play third-seeded Denver in the first round, but would have home-court advantage (since the Grizzlies had the fourth-best record in the conference and the Clippers had the fifth-best), and would not have to face either San Antonio or Dallas until the conference finals at the earliest.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis led to speculation about whether the Grizzlies or the Clippers would have much commitment to winning their match-up in the second-to-last game of the season, since it was clearly most advantageous to lose the game in order to obtain the 6th seed. The Clippers eventually lost to Memphis without much evidence to support the speculation that the Clippers had lost intentionally.[6] In the first round of the playoffs, the Clippers defeated the Nuggets in five games, while Memphis was swept by Dallas. Ultimately, Dallas and San Antonio did meet in the second round, with Dallas winning in seven games and advancing all the way to the NBA finals.\\r\\n\\r\\nBest-of-7 (one series)\\r\\n\\r\\nThere were no byes, or idle time, for the division champions ÿ as there would be for higher-seeded playoff teams 1955ÿ66 and 1975ÿ83. All six 1947 participants played their first tournament games on Wednesday, April 2; in 1948 the two Eastern runners-up (E2, E3 in the figure) were idle for a few days only because there was a three-way Western tie to break. Both winners of the runners-up bracket, Philadelphia in 1947 and Baltimore in 1948, reached the final series having played fewer tournament games than their final opponents, Chicago in 1947 and Philadelphia in 1948, had played in the best-of-7 pairings of division champions. And both winners of the runners-up bracket won the final series. The \\"postseason\\" actually comprised 11 games played in a span of 21 days for the 1947 Chicago Stags and 13 games in 30 days for 1948 Philadelphia Warriors, the finalists who emerged from the pairing of division champions.[3]\\r\\n\\r\\nBest-of-5 (1961ÿ1966)\\r\\n\\r\\nBest-of-7 (1958ÿ1966)\\r\\n\\r\\nThe 1961 to 1966 tournaments alone combined initial byes for seeded teams with best-of-five initial series for unseeded teams. The 1961 byes provided five and seven extra days idle for the first-place teams. By 1966 the schedule provided more rest for the first-round participants with byes of 11 and eight extra days idle.[8]\\r\\n\\r\\nBest-of-7 (1968ÿ1970)\\r\\n\\r\\nThe 1983 tournament is the latest to incorporate first-round byes for seeded teams. The first-round best-of-three series tapped off on Tuesday and Wednesday, April 19 and 20; the second-round best-of-sevens on Sunday to the following Wednesday, April 27. Counting from Tuesday the byes provided five to eight extra days idle.[9]\\r\\n\\r\\nPlayoff teams must identify their postseason roster before the playoffs begin. They are allowed up to 15 players and can designate two as inactive for each game.[10] Players are eligible to be on a team's playoff roster provided they were on the team for at least one regular season game, and were not on another NBA team's roster after March 1.[11] Previously[when?], playoff rosters were limited to 12 players who were named before the playoffs began.[10]\\r\\n\\r\\nCurrent as of 2018 NBA Playoffs","input":"How many games is in the nba playoffs?"},{"output":"Western Asia","context":"The Tigris and Euphrates, with their tributaries, form a major river system in Western Asia. From sources originating in the Armenian Highlands[5] of eastern Turkey they flow by/through Syria through Iraq into the Persian Gulf.[6]  The system is part of the Palearctic TigrisÿEuphrates ecoregion, which includes Iraq and parts of Turkey, Syria, Iran, Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, and Jordan.\\r\\n\\r\\nFrom their sources and upper courses in the mountains of eastern Anatolia, the rivers descend through valleys and gorges to the uplands of Syria and northern Iraq and then to the alluvial plain of central Iraq. The rivers flow in a south-easterly direction through the central plain and combine at Al-Qurnah to form the Shatt al-Arab and discharge into the Persian Gulf.[5]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe region has historical importance as part of the Fertile Crescent region, in which civilization is believed to have first emerged.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe ecoregion is characterized by two large rivers, the Tigris and Euphrates. The rivers have several small tributaries which feed into the system from shallow freshwater lakes, swamps, and marshes, all surrounded by desert.  The hydrology of these vast marshes is extremely important to the ecology of the entire upper Persian Gulf. Historically, the area is known as Mesopotamia. As part of the larger Fertile Crescent, it saw the earliest emergence of literate urban civilization in the Uruk period, for which reason it is often described as a \\"Cradle of Civilization\\".\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the 1980s, this ecoregion was put in grave danger as the IranÿIraq War raged within its boundaries.  The wetlands of Iraq, which were inhabited by the Marsh Arabs, were almost completely dried out, and have only recently[when?] shown signs of recovery.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe TigrisÿEuphrates Basin is shared by Turkey, Syria, Iraq, Iran and Kuwait.[4] Many Tigris tributaries originate in Iran and a TigrisÿEuphrates confluence forms part of the KuwaitÿIraq border.[7] Since the 1960s and in the 1970s, when Turkey began the GAP project in earnest, water disputes have regularly occurred in addition to the associated dam's effects on the environment.  In addition, Syrian and Iranian dam construction has also contributed to political tension within the basin, particularly during drought.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe general climate of the region is subtropical, hot and arid.  At the northern end of the Persian Gulf is the vast floodplain of the Euphrates, Tigris, and Karun Rivers, featuring huge permanent lakes, marshes, and forest. The aquatic vegetation includes reeds, rushes, and papyrus, which support numerous species. Areas around the Tigris and the Euphrates are very fertile. Marshy land is home to water birds, some stopping here while migrating, and some spending the winter in these marshes living off the lizards, snakes, frogs, and fish. Other animals found in these marshes are water buffalo, two endemic rodent species, antelopes and gazelles and small animals such as the jerboa and several other mammals.\\r\\n\\r\\nIraq suffers from desertification and soil salination due in large part to thousands of years of agricultural activity. Water and plant life are sparse. Saddam Hussein's government water-control projects drained the inhabited marsh areas east of An Nasiriyah by drying up or diverting streams and rivers. Shi'a Muslims were displaced under the Ba'athist regime. The destruction of the natural habitat poses serious threats to the area's wildlife populations. There are also inadequate supplies of potable water.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe marshlands were an extensive natural wetlands ecosystem which developed over thousands of years in the TigrisÿEuphrates basin and once covered 15ÿ20,000 square kilometers. According to the United Nations Environmental Program and the AMAR Charitable Foundation, between 84% and 90% of the marshes have been destroyed since the 1970s. In 1994, 60 percent of the wetlands were destroyed by Hussein's regime ÿ drained to permit military access and greater political control of the native Marsh Arabs. Canals, dykes and dams were built routing the water of the Tigris and Euphrates Rivers around the marshes, instead of allowing water to move slowly through the marshland. After part of the Euphrates was dried up due to re-routing its water to the sea, a dam was built so water could not back up from the Tigris and sustain the former marshland. Some marshlands were burned and pipes buried underground helped to carry away water for quicker drying.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe drying of the marshes led to the disappearance of the salt-tolerant vegetation; the plankton rich waters that fertilized surrounding soils; 52 native fish species; the wild boar, red fox, buffalo and water birds of the marsh habitat.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe issue of water rights became a point of contention for Iraq, Turkey and Syria beginning in the 1960s when Turkey implemented a public-works project (the GAP project) aimed at harvesting the water from the Tigris and Euphrates rivers through the construction of  22 dams, for irrigation and hydroelectric energy purposes. Although the water dispute between Turkey and Syria was more problematic, the GAP project was also perceived as a threat by Iraq. The tension between Turkey and Iraq about the issue was increased by the effect of Syria and Turkey's participation in the UN embargo against Iraq following the Gulf War. However, the issue had never become as significant as the water dispute between Turkey and Syria.[8]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe 2008 drought in Iraq sparked new negotiations between Iraq and Turkey over trans-boundary river flows.  Although the drought affected Turkey, Syria and Iran as well, Iraq complained regularly about reduced water flows.  Iraq particularly complained about the Euphrates River because of the large amount of dams on the river.  Turkey agreed to increase the flow several times, beyond its means in order to supply Iraq with extra water.  Iraq has seen significant declines in water storage and crop yields because of the drought.  To make matters worse, Iraq's water infrastructure has suffered from years of conflict and neglect.[9]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 2008, Turkey, Iraq and Syria agreed to restart the Joint Trilateral Committee on water for the three nations for better water resources management. Turkey, Iraq and Syria signed a memorandum of understanding on September 3, 2009, in order to strengthen communication within the TigrisÿEuphrates Basin and to develop joint water-flow-monitoring stations.  On September 19, 2009, Turkey formally agreed to increase the flow of the Euphrates River to 450 to 500 m3/s, but only until October 20, 2009.  In exchange, Iraq agreed to trade petroleum with Turkey and help curb Kurdish militant activity in their border region.  One of Turkey's last large GAP dams on the Tigris ÿ the Ilisu Dam ÿ is strongly opposed by Iraq and is the source of political strife.[10]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Mesopotamian Marshes in southern Iraq were historically the largest wetland ecosystem of Western Eurasia. Their drainage began in the 1950s, to reclaim land for agriculture and oil exploration. Saddam Hussein extended this work in the late 1980s and early 1990s, as part of ecological warfare against the Marsh Arabs, a rebellious group of people in Baathist Iraq. However, with the breaching of the dikes by local communities after the 2003 invasion of Iraq and the ending of a four-year drought that same year, the process has been reversed and the marshes have experienced a substantial rate of recovery. The permanent wetlands now cover more than 50% of pre-1970s levels, with a remarkable regrowth of the Hammar and Hawizeh Marshes and some recovery of the Central Marshes.[11]","input":"Where is the tigris and euphrates river valley located?"},{"output":"between 1652 and 1674","context":"Gross domestic product (GDP) is a monetary measure of the market value of all final goods and services produced in a period (quarterly or yearly) of time. Nominal GDP estimates are commonly used to determine the economic performance of a whole country or region, and to make international comparisons. Nominal GDP per capita does not, however, reflect differences in the cost of living and the inflation rates of the countries; therefore using a basis of GDP per capita at purchasing power parity (PPP) is arguably more useful when comparing differences in living standards between nations.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe OECD defines GDP as \\"an aggregate measure of production equal to the sum of the gross values added of all resident and institutional units engaged in production (plus any taxes, and minus any subsidies, on products not included in the value of their outputs).[2] An IMF publication states that \\"GDP measures the monetary value of final goods and services - that is, those that are bought by the final user - produced in a country in a given period of time (say a quarter or a year).\\"[3]\\r\\nTotal GDP can also be broken down into the contribution of each industry or sector of the economy.[4] The ratio of GDP to the total population of the region is the per capita GDP and the same is called Mean Standard of Living.

After the Bretton Woods conference in 1944, GDP became the main tool for measuring a country's economy.[9] At that time gross national product (GNP) was the preferred estimate, which differed from GDP in that it measured production by a country's citizens at home and abroad rather than its 'resident institutional units' (see OECD definition above). The switch from \\"GNP\\" to \\"GDP\\" in the US was in 1991, trailing behind most other nations. Crucial to the development of GDP was its role in the wartime effort.[10] A crucial role was played here by the US Department of Commerce under Milton Gilbert where ideas from Kuznets were embedded into governmental institutions.\\r\\nThe history of the concept of GDP should be distinguished from the history of changes in ways of estimating it. The value added by firms is relatively easy to calculate from their accounts, but the value added by the public sector, by financial industries, and by intangible asset creation is more complex. These activities are increasingly important in developed economies, and the international conventions governing their estimation and their inclusion or exclusion in GDP regularly change in an attempt to keep up with industrial advances. In the words of one academic economist \\"The actual number for GDP is therefore the product of a vast patchwork of statistics and a complicated set of processes carried out on the raw data to fit them to the conceptual framework.\\"[11]\\r\\nGDP can be determined in three ways, all of which should, in principle, give the same result. They are the production (or output or value added) approach, the income approach, or the expenditure approach.\\r\\nThe most direct of the three is the production approach, which sums the outputs of every class of enterprise to arrive at the total. The expenditure approach works on the principle that all of the product must be bought by somebody, therefore the value of the total product must be equal to people's total expenditures in buying things. The income approach works on the principle that the incomes of the productive factors (\\"producers,\\" colloquially) must be equal to the value of their product, and determines GDP by finding the sum of all producers' incomes.[12]\\r\\nThis approach mirrors the OECD definition given above.\\r\\nGross value added = gross value of output ÿ value of intermediate consumption.\\r\\nValue of output = value of the total sales of goods and services plus value of changes in the inventory.\\r\\nThe sum of the gross value added in the various economic activities is known as \\"GDP at factor cost\\".\\r\\nGDP at factor cost plus indirect taxes less subsidies on products = \\"GDP at producer price\\".\\r\\nFor measuring output of domestic product, economic activities (i.e. industries) are classified into various sectors. After classifying economic activities, the output of each sector is calculated by any of the following two methods:\\r\\nThe gross value of all sectors is then added to get the gross value added (GVA) at factor cost. Subtracting each sector's intermediate consumption from gross output gives the GVA at factor cost. Adding indirect tax minus subsidies in GVA at factor cost gives the \\"GVA at producer prices\\".\\r\\nThe second way of estimating GDP is to use \\"the sum of primary incomes distributed by resident producer units\\".[2]\\r\\nIf GDP is calculated this way it is sometimes called gross domestic income (GDI), or GDP (I). GDI should provide the same amount as the expenditure method described later. (By definition, GDI = GDP. In practice, however, measurement errors will make the two figures slightly off when reported by national statistical agencies.)\\r\\nThis method measures GDP by adding incomes that firms pay households for factors of production they hire - wages for labour, interest for capital, rent for land and profits for entrepreneurship.\\r\\nThe US \\"National Income and Expenditure Accounts\\" divide incomes into five categories:\\r\\nThese five income components sum to net domestic income at factor cost.\\r\\nTwo adjustments must be made to get GDP:\\r\\nTotal income can be subdivided according to various schemes, leading to various formulae for GDP measured by the income approach. A common one is:\\r\\nThe sum of COE, GOS and GMI is called total factor income; it is the income of all of the factors of production in society. It measures the value of GDP at factor (basic) prices. The difference between basic prices and final prices (those used in the expenditure calculation) is the total taxes and subsidies that the government has levied or paid on that production. So adding taxes less subsidies on production and imports converts GDP at factor cost to GDP(I).\\r\\nTotal factor income is also sometimes expressed as:\\r\\nThe third way to estimate GDP is to calculate the sum of the final uses of goods and services (all uses except intermediate consumption) measured in purchasers' prices.[2]\\r\\nMarket goods which are produced are purchased by someone. In the case where a good is produced and unsold, the standard accounting convention is that the producer has bought the good from themselves. Therefore, measuring the total expenditure used to buy things is a way of measuring production. This is known as the expenditure method of calculating GDP.\\r\\nGDP (Y) is the sum of consumption (C), investment (I), government spending (G) and net exports (X ÿ M).\\r\\nHere is a description of each GDP component:\\r\\nNote that C, G, and I are expenditures on final goods and services; expenditures on intermediate goods and services do not count. (Intermediate goods and services are those used by businesses to produce other goods and services within the accounting year.[15])\\r\\nAccording to the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis, which is responsible for calculating the national accounts in the United States, \\"In general, the source data for the expenditures components are considered more reliable than those for the income components [see income method, below].\\"[16]\\r\\nGDP can be contrasted with gross national product (GNP) or, as it is now known, gross national income (GNI). The difference is that GDP defines its scope according to location, while GNI defines its scope according to ownership. In a global context, world GDP and world GNI are, therefore, equivalent terms.\\r\\nGDP is product produced within a country's borders; GNI is product produced by enterprises owned by a country's citizens. The two would be the same if all of the productive enterprises in a country were owned by its own citizens, and those citizens did not own productive enterprises in any other countries. In practice, however, foreign ownership makes GDP and GNI non-identical. Production within a country's borders, but by an enterprise owned by somebody outside the country, counts as part of its GDP but not its GNI; on the other hand, production by an enterprise located outside the country, but owned by one of its citizens, counts as part of its GNI but not its GDP.\\r\\nFor example, the GNI of the USA is the value of output produced by American-owned firms, regardless of where the firms are located. Similarly, if a country becomes increasingly in debt, and spends large amounts of income servicing this debt this will be reflected in a decreased GNI but not a decreased GDP. Similarly, if a country sells off its resources to entities outside their country this will also be reflected over time in decreased GNI, but not decreased GDP. This would make the use of GDP more attractive for politicians in countries with increasing national debt and decreasing assets.\\r\\nGross national income (GNI) equals GDP plus income receipts from the rest of the world minus income payments to the rest of the world.[17]\\r\\nIn 1991, the United States switched from using GNP to using GDP as its primary measure of production.[18] The relationship between United States GDP and GNP is shown in table 1.7.5 of the National Income and Product Accounts.[19]\\r\\nThe international standard for measuring GDP is contained in the book System of National Accounts (1993), which was prepared by representatives of the International Monetary Fund, European Union, Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development, United Nations and World Bank. The publication is normally referred to as SNA93 to distinguish it from the previous edition published in 1968 (called SNA68) [20]\\r\\nSNA93 provides a set of rules and procedures for the measurement of national accounts. The standards are designed to be flexible, to allow for differences in local statistical needs and conditions.\\r\\nWithin each country GDP is normally measured by a national government statistical agency, as private sector organizations normally do not have access to the information required (especially information on expenditure and production by governments).\\r\\nThe raw GDP figure as given by the equations above is called the nominal, historical, or current, GDP. When one compares GDP figures from one year to another, it is desirable to compensate for changes in the value of money ÿ i.e., for the effects of inflation or deflation. To make it more meaningful for year-to-year comparisons, it may be multiplied by the ratio between the value of money in the year the GDP was measured and the value of money in a base year.\\r\\nFor example, suppose a country's GDP in 1990 was $100 million and its GDP in 2000 was $300 million. Suppose also that inflation had halved the value of its currency over that period. To meaningfully compare its GDP in 2000 to its GDP in 1990, we could multiply the GDP in 2000 by one-half, to make it relative to 1990 as a base year. The result would be that the GDP in 2000 equals $300 million G one-half = $150 million, in 1990 monetary terms. We would see that the country's GDP had realistically increased 50 percent over that period, not 200 percent, as it might appear from the raw GDP data. The GDP adjusted for changes in money value in this way is called the real, or constant, GDP.\\r\\nThe factor used to convert GDP from current to constant values in this way is called the GDP deflator. Unlike consumer price index, which measures inflation or deflation in the price of household consumer goods, the GDP deflator measures changes in the prices of all domestically produced goods and services in an economy including investment goods and government services, as well as household consumption goods.[21]\\r\\nConstant-GDP figures allow us to calculate a GDP growth rate, which indicates how much a country's production has increased (or decreased, if the growth rate is negative) compared to the previous year.\\r\\nAnother thing that it may be desirable to account for is population growth. If a country's GDP doubled over a certain period, but its population tripled, the increase in GDP may not mean that the standard of living increased for the country's residents; the average person in the country is producing less than they were before. Per-capita GDP is a measure to account for population growth.\\r\\nThe level of GDP in different countries may be compared by converting their value in national currency according to either the current currency exchange rate, or the purchasing power parity exchange rate.\\r\\nThe ranking of countries may differ significantly based on which method is used.\\r\\nThere is a clear pattern of the purchasing power parity method decreasing the disparity in GDP between high and low income (GDP) countries, as compared to the current exchange rate method. This finding is called the Penn effect.\\r\\nFor more information, see Measures of national income and output.\\r\\nGDP per capita is often used as an indicator of living standards.[22]\\r\\nThe major advantage of GDP per capita as an indicator of standard of living is that it is measured frequently, widely, and consistently. It is measured frequently in that most countries provide information on GDP on a quarterly basis, allowing trends to be seen quickly. It is measured widely in that some measure of GDP is available for almost every country in the world, allowing inter-country comparisons. It is measured consistently in that the technical definition of GDP is relatively consistent among countries.\\r\\nGDP does not include several factors that influence the standard of living. In particular, it fails to account for:\\r\\nIt can be argued that GDP per capita as an indicator standard of living is correlated with these factors, capturing them indirectly.[22][26] As a result, GDP per capita as a standard of living is a continued usage because most people have a fairly accurate idea of what it is and know it is tough to come up with quantitative measures for such constructs as happiness, quality of life, and well-being.[22]\\r\\nSimon Kuznets, the economist who developed the first comprehensive set of measures of national income, stated in his first report to the US Congress in 1934, in a section titled \\"Uses and Abuses of National Income Measurements\\":[8]\\r\\nThe valuable capacity of the human mind to simplify a complex situation in a compact characterization becomes dangerous when not controlled in terms of definitely stated criteria. With quantitative measurements especially, the definiteness of the result suggests, often misleadingly, a precision and simplicity in the outlines of the object measured. Measurements of national income are subject to this type of illusion and resulting abuse, especially since they deal with matters that are the center of conflict of opposing social groups where the effectiveness of an argument is often contingent upon oversimplification. [...]\\r\\nAll these qualifications upon estimates of national income as an index of productivity are just as important when income measurements are interpreted from the point of view of economic welfare. But in the latter case additional difficulties will be suggested to anyone who wants to penetrate below the surface of total figures and market values. Economic welfare cannot be adequately measured unless the personal distribution of income is known. And no income measurement undertakes to estimate the reverse side of income, that is, the intensity and unpleasantness of effort going into the earning of income. The welfare of a nation can, therefore, scarcely be inferred from a measurement of national income as defined above.\\r\\nIn 1962, Kuznets stated:[27]\\r\\nDistinctions must be kept in mind between quantity and quality of growth, between costs and returns, and between the short and long run. Goals for more growth should specify more growth of what and for what.\\r\\nEver since the development of GDP, multiple observers have pointed out limitations of using GDP as the overarching measure of economic and social progress.\\r\\nMany environmentalists argue that GDP is a poor measure of social progress because it does not take into account harm to the environment.[28][29]\\r\\nAlthough a high or rising level of GDP is often associated with increased economic and social progress within a country, a number of scholars have pointed out that this does not necessarily play out in many instances. For example, Jean Drze and Amartya Sen have pointed out that an increase in GDP or in GDP growth does not necessarily lead to a higher standard of living, particularly in areas such as healthcare and education.[30] Another important area that does not necessarily improve along with GDP is political liberty, which is most notable in China, where GDP growth is strong yet political liberties are heavily restricted.[31]\\r\\nGDP does not account for the distribution of income among the residents of a country, because GDP is merely an aggregate measure. An economy may be highly developed or growing rapidly, but also contain a wide gap between the rich and the poor in a society. These inequalities often occur on the lines of race, ethnicity, gender, religion, or other minority status within countries. This can lead to misleading characterizations of economic well-being if the income distribution is heavily skewed toward the high end, as the poorer residents will not directly benefit from the overall level of wealth and income generated in their country. Even GDP per capita measures may have the same downside if inequality is high. For example, South Africa during apartheid ranked high in terms of GDP per capita, but the benefits of this immense wealth and income were not shared equally among the country.[citation needed]\\r\\nGDP does not take into account the value of household and other unpaid work. Some, including Martha Nussbaum, argue that this value should be included in measuring GDP, as household labor is largely a substitute for goods and services that would otherwise be purchased for value.[32] Even under conservative estimates, the value of unpaid labor in Australia has been calculated to be over 50% of the country's GDP.[33] A later study analyzed this value in other countries, with results ranging from a low of about 15% in Canada (using conservative estimates) to high of nearly 70% in the United Kingdom (using more liberal estimates). For the United States, the value was estimated to be between about 20% on the low end to nearly 50% on the high end, depending on the methodology being used.[34] Because many public policies are shaped by GDP calculations and by the related field of national accounts,[35] the non-inclusion of unpaid work in calculating GDP can create distortions in public policy, and some economists have advocated for changes in the way public policies are formed and implemented.[36]\\r\\nThe UK's Natural Capital Committee highlighted the shortcomings of GDP in its advice to the UK Government in 2013, pointing out that GDP \\"focuses on flows, not stocks. As a result, an economy can run down its assets yet, at the same time, record high levels of GDP growth, until a point is reached where the depleted assets act as a check on future growth\\". They then went on to say that \\"it is apparent that the recorded GDP growth rate overstates the sustainable growth rate. Broader measures of wellbeing and wealth are needed for this and there is a danger that short-term decisions based solely on what is currently measured by national accounts may prove to be costly in the long-term\\".\\r\\nIn response to these and other limitations of using GDP, alternative approaches have emerged.","input":"When was the concept of gross domestic product (gdp) born?"},{"output":"Hollywood","context":"Roscoe's House of Chicken and Waffles is a Los Angeles-based soul food restaurant chain founded by Herb Hudson, a Harlem native, in 1975.

Every solid, liquid, gas, and plasma is composed of neutral or ionized atoms. Atoms are very small; typical sizes are around 100?picometers (a ten-billionth of a meter, in the short scale).\\r\\nAtoms are small enough that attempting to predict their behavior using classical physics ÿ as if they were billiard balls, for example ÿ gives noticeably incorrect predictions due to quantum effects. Through the development of physics, atomic models have incorporated quantum principles to better explain and predict the behavior.\\r\\nEvery atom is composed of a nucleus and one or more electrons bound to the nucleus. The nucleus is made of one or more protons and typically a similar number of neutrons. Protons and neutrons are called nucleons. More than 99.94% of an atom's mass is in the nucleus. The protons have a positive electric charge, the electrons have a negative electric charge, and the neutrons have no electric charge. If the number of protons and electrons are equal, that atom is electrically neutral. If an atom has more or fewer electrons than protons, then it has an overall negative or positive charge, respectively, and it is called an ion.\\r\\nThe electrons of an atom are attracted to the protons in an atomic nucleus by this electromagnetic force. The protons and neutrons in the nucleus are attracted to each other by a different force, the nuclear force, which is usually stronger than the electromagnetic force repelling the positively charged protons from one another. Under certain circumstances, the repelling electromagnetic force becomes stronger than the nuclear force, and nucleons can be ejected from the nucleus, leaving behind a different element: nuclear decay resulting in nuclear transmutation.\\r\\nThe number of protons in the nucleus defines to what chemical element the atom belongs: for example, all copper atoms contain 29 protons. The number of neutrons defines the isotope of the element. The number of electrons influences the magnetic properties of an atom. Atoms can attach to one or more other atoms by chemical bonds to form chemical compounds such as molecules. The ability of atoms to associate and dissociate is responsible for most of the physical changes observed in nature and is the subject of the discipline of chemistry.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe idea that matter is made up of discrete units is a very old idea, appearing in many ancient cultures such as Greece and India. The word \\"atom\\" was coined by ancient Greek philosophers. However, these ideas were founded in philosophical and theological reasoning rather than evidence and experimentation. As a result, their views on what atoms look like and how they behave were incorrect. They also could not convince everybody, so atomism was but one of a number of competing theories on the nature of matter. It was not until the 19th century that the idea was embraced and refined by scientists, when the blossoming science of chemistry produced discoveries that only the concept of atoms could explain.\\r\\nIn the early 1800s, John Dalton used the concept of atoms to explain why elements always react in ratios of small whole numbers (the law of multiple proportions). For instance, there are two types of tin oxide: one is 88.1% tin and 11.9% oxygen and the other is 78.7% tin and 21.3% oxygen (tin(II) oxide and tin dioxide respectively). This means that 100g of tin will combine either with 13.5g or 27g of oxygen. 13.5 and 27 form a ratio of 1:2, a ratio of small whole numbers. This common pattern in chemistry suggested to Dalton that elements react in whole number multiples of discrete unitsin other words, atoms. In the case of tin oxides, one tin atom will combine with either one or two oxygen atoms.[1]\\r\\nDalton also believed atomic theory could explain why water absorbs different gases in different proportions. For example, he found that water absorbs carbon dioxide far better than it absorbs nitrogen.[2] Dalton hypothesized this was due to the differences between the masses and configurations of the gases' respective particles, and carbon dioxide molecules (CO2) are heavier and larger than nitrogen molecules (N2).\\r\\nIn 1827, botanist Robert Brown used a microscope to look at dust grains floating in water and discovered that they moved about erratically, a phenomenon that became known as \\"Brownian motion\\". This was thought to be caused by water molecules knocking the grains about. In 1905, Albert Einstein proved the reality of these molecules and their motions by producing the first Statistical physics analysis of Brownian motion.[3][4][5] French physicist Jean Perrin used Einstein's work to experimentally determine the mass and dimensions of atoms, thereby conclusively verifying Dalton's atomic theory.[6]\\r\\nThe physicist J. J. Thomson measured the mass of cathode rays, showing they were made of particles, but were around 1800 times lighter than the lightest atom, hydrogen. Therefore, they were not atoms, but a new particle, the first subatomic particle to be discovered, which he originally called \\"corpuscle\\" but was later named electron, after particles postulated by George Johnstone Stoney in 1874. He also showed they were identical to particles given off by photoelectric and radioactive materials.[7] It was quickly recognized that they are the particles that carry electric currents in metal wires, and carry the negative electric charge within atoms. Thomson was given the 1906 Nobel Prize in Physics for this work. Thus he overturned the belief that atoms are the indivisible, ultimate particles of matter.[8] Thomson also incorrectly postulated that the low mass, negatively charged electrons were distributed throughout the atom in a uniform sea of positive charge. This became known as the plum pudding model.\\r\\nIn 1909, Hans Geiger and Ernest Marsden, under the direction of Ernest Rutherford, bombarded a metal foil with alpha particles to observe how they scattered. They expected all the alpha particles to pass straight through with little deflection, because Thomson's model said that the charges in the atom are so diffuse that their electric fields could not affect the alpha particles much. However, Geiger and Marsden spotted alpha particles being deflected by angles greater than 90, which was supposed to be impossible according to Thomson's model. To explain this, Rutherford proposed that the positive charge of the atom is concentrated in a tiny nucleus at the center of the atom.[9] Rutherford compared his findings to one firing a 15-inch shell at a sheet of tissue paper and it coming back to hit the person who fired it.[10]\\r\\nWhile experimenting with the products of radioactive decay, in 1913 radiochemist Frederick Soddy discovered that there appeared to be more than one type of atom at each position on the periodic table.[11] The term isotope was coined by Margaret Todd as a suitable name for different atoms that belong to the same element. J.J. Thomson created a technique for separating atom types through his work on ionized gases, which subsequently led to the discovery of stable isotopes.[12]\\r\\nIn 1913 the physicist Niels Bohr proposed a model in which the electrons of an atom were assumed to orbit the nucleus but could only do so in a finite set of orbits, and could jump between these orbits only in discrete changes of energy corresponding to absorption or radiation of a photon.[13] This quantization was used to explain why the electrons orbits are stable (given that normally, charges in acceleration, including circular motion, lose kinetic energy which is emitted as electromagnetic radiation, see synchrotron radiation) and why elements absorb and emit electromagnetic radiation in discrete spectra.[14]\\r\\nLater in the same year Henry Moseley provided additional experimental evidence in favor of Niels Bohr's theory. These results refined Ernest Rutherford's and Antonius Van den Broek's model, which proposed that the atom contains in its nucleus a number of positive nuclear charges that is equal to its (atomic) number in the periodic table. Until these experiments, atomic number was not known to be a physical and experimental quantity. That it is equal to the atomic nuclear charge remains the accepted atomic model today.[15]\\r\\nChemical bonds between atoms were now explained, by Gilbert Newton Lewis in 1916, as the interactions between their constituent electrons.[16] As the chemical properties of the elements were known to largely repeat themselves according to the periodic law,[17] in 1919 the American chemist Irving Langmuir suggested that this could be explained if the electrons in an atom were connected or clustered in some manner. Groups of electrons were thought to occupy a set of electron shells about the nucleus.[18]\\r\\nThe SternÿGerlach experiment of 1922 provided further evidence of the quantum nature of the atom. When a beam of silver atoms was passed through a specially shaped magnetic field, the beam was split based on the direction of an atom's angular momentum, or spin. As this direction is random, the beam could be expected to spread into a line. Instead, the beam was split into two parts, depending on whether the atomic spin was oriented up or down.[19]\\r\\nIn 1924, Louis de Broglie proposed that all particles behave to an extent like waves. In 1926, Erwin Schr?dinger used this idea to develop a mathematical model of the atom that described the electrons as three-dimensional waveforms rather than point particles. A consequence of using waveforms to describe particles is that it is mathematically impossible to obtain precise values for both the position and momentum of a particle at a given point in time; this became known as the uncertainty principle, formulated by Werner Heisenberg in 1926. In this concept, for a given accuracy in measuring a position one could only obtain a range of probable values for momentum, and vice versa.[20] This model was able to explain observations of atomic behavior that previous models could not, such as certain structural and spectral patterns of atoms larger than hydrogen. Thus, the planetary model of the atom was discarded in favor of one that described atomic orbital zones around the nucleus where a given electron is most likely to be observed.[21][22]\\r\\nThe development of the mass spectrometer allowed the mass of atoms to be measured with increased accuracy. The device uses a magnet to bend the trajectory of a beam of ions, and the amount of deflection is determined by the ratio of an atom's mass to its charge. The chemist Francis William Aston used this instrument to show that isotopes had different masses. The atomic mass of these isotopes varied by integer amounts, called the whole number rule.[23] The explanation for these different isotopes awaited the discovery of the neutron, an uncharged particle with a mass similar to the proton, by the physicist James Chadwick in 1932. Isotopes were then explained as elements with the same number of protons, but different numbers of neutrons within the nucleus.[24]\\r\\nIn 1938, the German chemist Otto Hahn, a student of Rutherford, directed neutrons onto uranium atoms expecting to get transuranium elements. Instead, his chemical experiments showed barium as a product.[25][26] A year later, Lise Meitner and her nephew Otto Frisch verified that Hahn's result were the first experimental nuclear fission.[27][28] In 1944, Hahn received the Nobel prize in chemistry. Despite Hahn's efforts, the contributions of Meitner and Frisch were not recognized.[29]\\r\\nIn the 1950s, the development of improved particle accelerators and particle detectors allowed scientists to study the impacts of atoms moving at high energies.[30] Neutrons and protons were found to be hadrons, or composites of smaller particles called quarks. The standard model of particle physics was developed that so far has successfully explained the properties of the nucleus in terms of these sub-atomic particles and the forces that govern their interactions.[31]\\r\\nThough the word atom originally denoted a particle that cannot be cut into smaller particles, in modern scientific usage the atom is composed of various subatomic particles. The constituent particles of an atom are the electron, the proton and the neutron; all three are fermions. However, the hydrogen-1 atom has no neutrons and the hydron ion has no electrons.\\r\\nThe electron is by far the least massive of these particles at 6969911000000000000?9.11G10?31?kg, with a negative electrical charge and a size that is too small to be measured using available techniques.[32] It is the lightest particle with a positive rest mass measured. Under ordinary conditions, electrons are bound to the positively charged nucleus by the attraction created from opposite electric charges. If an atom has more or fewer electrons than its atomic number, then it becomes respectively negatively or positively charged as a whole; a charged atom is called an ion. Electrons have been known since the late 19th century, mostly thanks to J.J. Thomson; see history of subatomic physics for details.\\r\\nProtons have a positive charge and a mass 1,836 times that of the electron, at 6973167260000000000?1.6726G10?27?kg. The number of protons in an atom is called its atomic number. Ernest Rutherford (1919) observed that nitrogen under alpha-particle bombardment ejects what appeared to be hydrogen nuclei. By 1920 he had accepted that the hydrogen nucleus is a distinct particle within the atom and named it proton.\\r\\nNeutrons have no electrical charge and have a free mass of 1,839 times the mass of the electron,[33] or 6973169290000000000?1.6929G10?27?kg, the heaviest of the three constituent particles, but it can be reduced by the nuclear binding energy. Neutrons and protons (collectively known as nucleons) have comparable dimensionson the order of 6985250000000000000?2.5G10?15?malthough the 'surface' of these particles is not sharply defined.[34] The neutron was discovered in 1932 by the English physicist James Chadwick.\\r\\nIn the Standard Model of physics, electrons are truly elementary particles with no internal structure. However, both protons and neutrons are composite particles composed of elementary particles called quarks. There are two types of quarks in atoms, each having a fractional electric charge. Protons are composed of two up quarks (each with charge +2/3) and one down quark (with a charge of ?1/3). Neutrons consist of one up quark and two down quarks. This distinction accounts for the difference in mass and charge between the two particles.[35][36]\\r\\nThe quarks are held together by the strong interaction (or strong force), which is mediated by gluons. The protons and neutrons, in turn, are held to each other in the nucleus by the nuclear force, which is a residuum of the strong force that has somewhat different range-properties (see the article on the nuclear force for more). The gluon is a member of the family of gauge bosons, which are elementary particles that mediate physical forces.[35][36]\\r\\nAll the bound protons and neutrons in an atom make up a tiny atomic nucleus, and are collectively called nucleons. The radius of a nucleus is approximately equal to 1.07?3|A?fm, where A is the total number of nucleons.[37] This is much smaller than the radius of the atom, which is on the order of 105?fm. The nucleons are bound together by a short-ranged attractive potential called the residual strong force. At distances smaller than 2.5 fm this force is much more powerful than the electrostatic force that causes positively charged protons to repel each other.[38]\\r\\nAtoms of the same element have the same number of protons, called the atomic number. Within a single element, the number of neutrons may vary, determining the isotope of that element. The total number of protons and neutrons determine the nuclide. The number of neutrons relative to the protons determines the stability of the nucleus, with certain isotopes undergoing radioactive decay.[39]\\r\\nThe proton, the electron, and the neutron are classified as fermions. Fermions obey the Pauli exclusion principle which prohibits identical fermions, such as multiple protons, from occupying the same quantum state at the same time. Thus, every proton in the nucleus must occupy a quantum state different from all other protons, and the same applies to all neutrons of the nucleus and to all electrons of the electron cloud. However, a proton and a neutron are allowed to occupy the same quantum state.[40]\\r\\nFor atoms with low atomic numbers, a nucleus that has more neutrons than protons tends to drop to a lower energy state through radioactive decay so that the neutronÿproton ratio is closer to one. However, as the atomic number increases, a higher proportion of neutrons is required to offset the mutual repulsion of the protons. Thus, there are no stable nuclei with equal proton and neutron numbers above atomic number Z = 20 (calcium) and as Z increases, the neutronÿproton ratio of stable isotopes increases.[40] The stable isotope with the highest protonÿneutron ratio is lead-208 (about 1.5).\\r\\nThe number of protons and neutrons in the atomic nucleus can be modified, although this can require very high energies because of the strong force. Nuclear fusion occurs when multiple atomic particles join to form a heavier nucleus, such as through the energetic collision of two nuclei. For example, at the core of the Sun protons require energies of 3ÿ10 keV to overcome their mutual repulsionthe coulomb barrierand fuse together into a single nucleus.[41] Nuclear fission is the opposite process, causing a nucleus to split into two smaller nucleiusually through radioactive decay. The nucleus can also be modified through bombardment by high energy subatomic particles or photons. If this modifies the number of protons in a nucleus, the atom changes to a different chemical element.[42][43]\\r\\nIf the mass of the nucleus following a fusion reaction is less than the sum of the masses of the separate particles, then the difference between these two values can be emitted as a type of usable energy (such as a gamma ray, or the kinetic energy of a beta particle), as described by Albert Einstein's massÿenergy equivalence formula, E?=?mc2, where m is the mass loss and c is the speed of light. This deficit is part of the binding energy of the new nucleus, and it is the non-recoverable loss of the energy that causes the fused particles to remain together in a state that requires this energy to separate.[44]\\r\\nThe fusion of two nuclei that create larger nuclei with lower atomic numbers than iron and nickela total nucleon number of about 60is usually an exothermic process that releases more energy than is required to bring them together.[45] It is this energy-releasing process that makes nuclear fusion in stars a self-sustaining reaction. For heavier nuclei, the binding energy per nucleon in the nucleus begins to decrease. That means fusion processes producing nuclei that have atomic numbers higher than about 26, and atomic masses higher than about 60, is an endothermic process. These more massive nuclei can not undergo an energy-producing fusion reaction that can sustain the hydrostatic equilibrium of a star.[40]\\r\\nThe electrons in an atom are attracted to the protons in the nucleus by the electromagnetic force. This force binds the electrons inside an electrostatic potential well surrounding the smaller nucleus, which means that an external source of energy is needed for the electron to escape. The closer an electron is to the nucleus, the greater the attractive force. Hence electrons bound near the center of the potential well require more energy to escape than those at greater separations.\\r\\nElectrons, like other particles, have properties of both a particle and a wave. The electron cloud is a region inside the potential well where each electron forms a type of three-dimensional standing wavea wave form that does not move relative to the nucleus. This behavior is defined by an atomic orbital, a mathematical function that characterises the probability that an electron appears to be at a particular location when its position is measured.[46] Only a discrete (or quantized) set of these orbitals exist around the nucleus, as other possible wave patterns rapidly decay into a more stable form.[47] Orbitals can have one or more ring or node structures, and differ from each other in size, shape and orientation.[48]\\r\\nEach atomic orbital corresponds to a particular energy level of the electron. The electron can change its state to a higher energy level by absorbing a photon with sufficient energy to boost it into the new quantum state. Likewise, through spontaneous emission, an electron in a higher energy state can drop to a lower energy state while radiating the excess energy as a photon. These characteristic energy values, defined by the differences in the energies of the quantum states, are responsible for atomic spectral lines.[47]\\r\\nThe amount of energy needed to remove or add an electronthe electron binding energyis far less than the binding energy of nucleons. For example, it requires only 13.6?eV to strip a ground-state electron from a hydrogen atom,[49] compared to 2.23?million eV for splitting a deuterium nucleus.[50] Atoms are electrically neutral if they have an equal number of protons and electrons. Atoms that have either a deficit or a surplus of electrons are called ions. Electrons that are farthest from the nucleus may be transferred to other nearby atoms or shared between atoms. By this mechanism, atoms are able to bond into molecules and other types of chemical compounds like ionic and covalent network crystals.[51]\\r\\nBy definition, any two atoms with an identical number of protons in their nuclei belong to the same chemical element. Atoms with equal numbers of protons but a different number of neutrons are different isotopes of the same element. For example, all hydrogen atoms admit exactly one proton, but isotopes exist with no neutrons (hydrogen-1, by far the most common form,[52] also called protium), one neutron (deuterium), two neutrons (tritium) and more than two neutrons. The known elements form a set of atomic numbers, from the single proton element hydrogen up to the 118-proton element oganesson.[53] All known isotopes of elements with atomic numbers greater than 82 are radioactive, although the radioactivity of element 83 (bismuth) is so slight as to be practically negligible.[54][55]\\r\\nAbout 339 nuclides occur naturally on Earth,[56] of which 254 (about 75%) have not been observed to decay, and are referred to as \\"stable isotopes\\". However, only 90 of these nuclides are stable to all decay, even in theory. Another 164 (bringing the total to 254) have not been observed to decay, even though in theory it is energetically possible. These are also formally classified as \\"stable\\". An additional 34 radioactive nuclides have half-lives longer than 80 million years, and are long-lived enough to be present from the birth of the solar system. This collection of 288 nuclides are known as primordial nuclides. Finally, an additional 51 short-lived nuclides are known to occur naturally, as daughter products of primordial nuclide decay (such as radium from uranium), or else as products of natural energetic processes on Earth, such as cosmic ray bombardment (for example, carbon-14).[57][note 1]\\r\\nFor 80 of the chemical elements, at least one stable isotope exists. As a rule, there is only a handful of stable isotopes for each of these elements, the average being 3.2 stable isotopes per element. Twenty-six elements have only a single stable isotope, while the largest number of stable isotopes observed for any element is ten, for the element tin. Elements 43, 61, and all elements numbered 83 or higher have no stable isotopes.[58][page?needed]\\r\\nStability of isotopes is affected by the ratio of protons to neutrons, and also by the presence of certain \\"magic numbers\\" of neutrons or protons that represent closed and filled quantum shells. These quantum shells correspond to a set of energy levels within the shell model of the nucleus; filled shells, such as the filled shell of 50 protons for tin, confers unusual stability on the nuclide. Of the 254 known stable nuclides, only four have both an odd number of protons and odd number of neutrons: hydrogen-2 (deuterium), lithium-6, boron-10 and nitrogen-14. Also, only four naturally occurring, radioactive oddÿodd nuclides have a half-life over a billion years: potassium-40, vanadium-50, lanthanum-138 and tantalum-180m. Most oddÿodd nuclei are highly unstable with respect to beta decay, because the decay products are evenÿeven, and are therefore more strongly bound, due to nuclear pairing effects.[58][page?needed]\\r\\nThe large majority of an atom's mass comes from the protons and neutrons that make it up. The total number of these particles (called \\"nucleons\\") in a given atom is called the mass number. It is a positive integer and dimensionless (instead of having dimension of mass), because it expresses a count. An example of use of a mass number is \\"carbon-12,\\" which has 12 nucleons (six protons and six neutrons).\\r\\nThe actual mass of an atom at rest is often expressed using the unified atomic mass unit (u), also called dalton (Da). This unit is defined as a twelfth of the mass of a free neutral atom of carbon-12, which is approximately 6973166000000000000?1.66G10?27?kg.[59] Hydrogen-1 (the lightest isotope of hydrogen which is also the nuclide with the lowest mass) has an atomic weight of 1.007825?u.[60] The value of this number is called the atomic mass. A given atom has an atomic mass approximately equal (within 1%) to its mass number times the atomic mass unit (for example the mass of a nitrogen-14 is roughly 14?u). However, this number will not be exactly an integer except in the case of carbon-12 (see below).[61] The heaviest stable atom is lead-208,[54] with a mass of 7002207976652100000?207.9766521?u.[62]\\r\\nAs even the most massive atoms are far too light to work with directly, chemists instead use the unit of moles. One mole of atoms of any element always has the same number of atoms (about 7023602200000000000?6.022G1023). This number was chosen so that if an element has an atomic mass of 1?u, a mole of atoms of that element has a mass close to one gram. Because of the definition of the unified atomic mass unit, each carbon-12 atom has an atomic mass of exactly 12?u, and so a mole of carbon-12 atoms weighs exactly 0.012?kg.[59]\\r\\nAtoms lack a well-defined outer boundary, so their dimensions are usually described in terms of an atomic radius. This is a measure of the distance out to which the electron cloud extends from the nucleus.[63] However, this assumes the atom to exhibit a spherical shape, which is only obeyed for atoms in vacuum or free space. Atomic radii may be derived from the distances between two nuclei when the two atoms are joined in a chemical bond. The radius varies with the location of an atom on the atomic chart, the type of chemical bond, the number of neighboring atoms (coordination number) and a quantum mechanical property known as spin.[64] On the periodic table of the elements, atom size tends to increase when moving down columns, but decrease when moving across rows (left to right).[65] Consequently, the smallest atom is helium with a radius of 32?pm, while one of the largest is caesium at 225?pm.[66]\\r\\nWhen subjected to external forces, like electrical fields, the shape of an atom may deviate from spherical symmetry. The deformation depends on the field magnitude and the orbital type of outer shell electrons, as shown by group-theoretical considerations. Aspherical deviations might be elicited for instance in crystals, where large crystal-electrical fields may occur at low-symmetry lattice sites.[67][68] Significant ellipsoidal deformations have been shown to occur for sulfur ions[69] and chalcogen ions[70] in pyrite-type compounds.\\r\\nAtomic dimensions are thousands of times smaller than the wavelengths of light (400ÿ700?nm) so they cannot be viewed using an optical microscope. However, individual atoms can be observed using a scanning tunneling microscope. To visualize the minuteness of the atom, consider that a typical human hair is about 1?million carbon atoms in width.[71] A single drop of water contains about 2?sextillion (7021200000000000000?2G1021) atoms of oxygen, and twice the number of hydrogen atoms.[72] A single carat diamond with a mass of 6996200000000000000?2G10?4?kg contains about 10?sextillion (1022) atoms of carbon.[note 2] If an apple were magnified to the size of the Earth, then the atoms in the apple would be approximately the size of the original apple.[73]\\r\\nEvery element has one or more isotopes that have unstable nuclei that are subject to radioactive decay, causing the nucleus to emit particles or electromagnetic radiation. Radioactivity can occur when the radius of a nucleus is large compared with the radius of the strong force, which only acts over distances on the order of 1?fm.[74]\\r\\nThe most common forms of radioactive decay are:[75][76]\\r\\nOther more rare types of radioactive decay include ejection of neutrons or protons or clusters of nucleons from a nucleus, or more than one beta particle. An analog of gamma emission which allows excited nuclei to lose energy in a different way, is internal conversion a process that produces high-speed electrons that are not beta rays, followed by production of high-energy photons that are not gamma rays. A few large nuclei explode into two or more charged fragments of varying masses plus several neutrons, in a decay called spontaneous nuclear fission.\\r\\nEach radioactive isotope has a characteristic decay time periodthe half-lifethat is determined by the amount of time needed for half of a sample to decay. This is an exponential decay process that steadily decreases the proportion of the remaining isotope by 50% every half-life. Hence after two half-lives have passed only 25% of the isotope is present, and so forth.[74]\\r\\nElementary particles possess an intrinsic quantum mechanical property known as spin. This is analogous to the angular momentum of an object that is spinning around its center of mass, although strictly speaking these particles are believed to be point-like and cannot be said to be rotating. Spin is measured in units of the reduced Planck constant (?), with electrons, protons and neutrons all having spin , or \\"spin-?\\". In an atom, electrons in motion around the nucleus possess orbital angular momentum in addition to their spin, while the nucleus itself possesses angular momentum due to its nuclear spin.[77]\\r\\nThe magnetic field produced by an atomits magnetic momentis determined by these various forms of angular momentum, just as a rotating charged object classically produces a magnetic field. However, the most dominant contribution comes from electron spin. Due to the nature of electrons to obey the Pauli exclusion principle, in which no two electrons may be found in the same quantum state, bound electrons pair up with each other, with one member of each pair in a spin up state and the other in the opposite, spin down state. Thus these spins cancel each other out, reducing the total magnetic dipole moment to zero in some atoms with even number of electrons.[78]\\r\\nIn ferromagnetic elements such as iron, cobalt and nickel, an odd number of electrons leads to an unpaired electron and a net overall magnetic moment. The orbitals of neighboring atoms overlap and a lower energy state is achieved when the spins of unpaired electrons are aligned with each other, a spontaneous process known as an exchange interaction. When the magnetic moments of ferromagnetic atoms are lined up, the material can produce a measurable macroscopic field. Paramagnetic materials have atoms with magnetic moments that line up in random directions when no magnetic field is present, but the magnetic moments of the individual atoms line up in the presence of a field.[78][79]\\r\\nThe nucleus of an atom will have no spin when it has even numbers of both neutrons and protons, but for other cases of odd numbers, the nucleus may have a spin. Normally nuclei with spin are aligned in random directions because of thermal equilibrium. However, for certain elements (such as xenon-129) it is possible to polarize a significant proportion of the nuclear spin states so that they are aligned in the same directiona condition called hyperpolarization. This has important applications in magnetic resonance imaging.[80][81]\\r\\nThe potential energy of an electron in an atom is negative, its dependence of its position reaches the minimum (the most absolute value) inside the nucleus, and vanishes when the distance from the nucleus goes to infinity, roughly in an inverse proportion to the distance. In the quantum-mechanical model, a bound electron can only occupy a set of states centered on the nucleus, and each state corresponds to a specific energy level; see time-independent Schr?dinger equation for theoretical explanation. An energy level can be measured by the amount of energy needed to unbind the electron from the atom, and is usually given in units of electronvolts (eV). The lowest energy state of a bound electron is called the ground state, i.e. stationary state, while an electron transition to a higher level results in an excited state.[82] The electron's energy raises when n increases because the (average) distance to the nucleus increases. Dependence of the energy on ? is caused not by electrostatic potential of the nucleus, but by interaction between electrons.\\r\\nFor an electron to transition between two different states, e.g. grounded state to first excited level (ionization), it must absorb or emit a photon at an energy matching the difference in the potential energy of those levels, according to Niels Bohr model, what can be precisely calculated by the Schr?dinger equation. Electrons jump between orbitals in a particle-like fashion. For example, if a single photon strikes the electrons, only a single electron changes states in response to the photon; see Electron properties.\\r\\nThe energy of an emitted photon is proportional to its frequency, so these specific energy levels appear as distinct bands in the electromagnetic spectrum.[83] Each element has a characteristic spectrum that can depend on the nuclear charge, subshells filled by electrons, the electromagnetic interactions between the electrons and other factors.[84]\\r\\nWhen a continuous spectrum of energy is passed through a gas or plasma, some of the photons are absorbed by atoms, causing electrons to change their energy level. Those excited electrons that remain bound to their atom spontaneously emit this energy as a photon, traveling in a random direction, and so drop back to lower energy levels. Thus the atoms behave like a filter that forms a series of dark absorption bands in the energy output. (An observer viewing the atoms from a view that does not include the continuous spectrum in the background, instead sees a series of emission lines from the photons emitted by the atoms.) Spectroscopic measurements of the strength and width of atomic spectral lines allow the composition and physical properties of a substance to be determined.[85]\\r\\nClose examination of the spectral lines reveals that some display a fine structure splitting. This occurs because of spinÿorbit coupling, which is an interaction between the spin and motion of the outermost electron.[86] When an atom is in an external magnetic field, spectral lines become split into three or more components; a phenomenon called the Zeeman effect. This is caused by the interaction of the magnetic field with the magnetic moment of the atom and its electrons. Some atoms can have multiple electron configurations with the same energy level, which thus appear as a single spectral line. The interaction of the magnetic field with the atom shifts these electron configurations to slightly different energy levels, resulting in multiple spectral lines.[87] The presence of an external electric field can cause a comparable splitting and shifting of spectral lines by modifying the electron energy levels, a phenomenon called the Stark effect.[88]\\r\\nIf a bound electron is in an excited state, an interacting photon with the proper energy can cause stimulated emission of a photon with a matching energy level. For this to occur, the electron must drop to a lower energy state that has an energy difference matching the energy of the interacting photon. The emitted photon and the interacting photon then move off in parallel and with matching phases. That is, the wave patterns of the two photons are synchronized. This physical property is used to make lasers, which can emit a coherent beam of light energy in a narrow frequency band.[89]\\r\\nValency is the combining power of an element. It is equal to number of hydrogen atoms that atom can combine or displace in forming compounds.[90] The outermost electron shell of an atom in its uncombined state is known as the valence shell, and the electrons in that shell are called valence electrons. The number of valence electrons determines the bonding behavior with other atoms. Atoms tend to chemically react with each other in a manner that fills (or empties) their outer valence shells.[91] For example, a transfer of a single electron between atoms is a useful approximation for bonds that form between atoms with one-electron more than a filled shell, and others that are one-electron short of a full shell, such as occurs in the compound sodium chloride and other chemical ionic salts. However, many elements display multiple valences, or tendencies to share differing numbers of electrons in different compounds. Thus, chemical bonding between these elements takes many forms of electron-sharing that are more than simple electron transfers. Examples include the element carbon and the organic compounds.[92]\\r\\nThe chemical elements are often displayed in a periodic table that is laid out to display recurring chemical properties, and elements with the same number of valence electrons form a group that is aligned in the same column of the table. (The horizontal rows correspond to the filling of a quantum shell of electrons.) The elements at the far right of the table have their outer shell completely filled with electrons, which results in chemically inert elements known as the noble gases.[93][94]\\r\\nQuantities of atoms are found in different states of matter that depend on the physical conditions, such as temperature and pressure. By varying the conditions, materials can transition between solids, liquids, gases and plasmas.[95] Within a state, a material can also exist in different allotropes. An example of this is solid carbon, which can exist as graphite or diamond.[96] Gaseous allotropes exist as well, such as dioxygen and ozone.\\r\\nAt temperatures close to absolute zero, atoms can form a BoseÿEinstein condensate, at which point quantum mechanical effects, which are normally only observed at the atomic scale, become apparent on a macroscopic scale.[97][98] This super-cooled collection of atoms then behaves as a single super atom, which may allow fundamental checks of quantum mechanical behavior.[99]\\r\\nThe scanning tunneling microscope is a device for viewing surfaces at the atomic level. It uses the quantum tunneling phenomenon, which allows particles to pass through a barrier that would normally be insurmountable. Electrons tunnel through the vacuum between two planar metal electrodes, on each of which is an adsorbed atom, providing a tunneling-current density that can be measured. Scanning one atom (taken as the tip) as it moves past the other (the sample) permits plotting of tip displacement versus lateral separation for a constant current. The calculation shows the extent to which scanning-tunneling-microscope images of an individual atom are visible. It confirms that for low bias, the microscope images the space-averaged dimensions of the electron orbitals across closely packed energy levelsthe Fermi level local density of states.[100][101]\\r\\nAn atom can be ionized by removing one of its electrons. The electric charge causes the trajectory of an atom to bend when it passes through a magnetic field. The radius by which the trajectory of a moving ion is turned by the magnetic field is determined by the mass of the atom. The mass spectrometer uses this principle to measure the mass-to-charge ratio of ions. If a sample contains multiple isotopes, the mass spectrometer can determine the proportion of each isotope in the sample by measuring the intensity of the different beams of ions. Techniques to vaporize atoms include inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectroscopy and inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry, both of which use a plasma to vaporize samples for analysis.[102]\\r\\nA more area-selective method is electron energy loss spectroscopy, which measures the energy loss of an electron beam within a transmission electron microscope when it interacts with a portion of a sample. The atom-probe tomograph has sub-nanometer resolution in 3-D and can chemically identify individual atoms using time-of-flight mass spectrometry.[103]\\r\\nSpectra of excited states can be used to analyze the atomic composition of distant stars. Specific light wavelengths contained in the observed light from stars can be separated out and related to the quantized transitions in free gas atoms. These colors can be replicated using a gas-discharge lamp containing the same element.[104] Helium was discovered in this way in the spectrum of the Sun 23?years before it was found on Earth.[105]\\r\\nAtoms form about 4% of the total energy density of the observable Universe, with an average density of about 0.25?atoms/m3.[106] Within a galaxy such as the Milky Way, atoms have a much higher concentration, with the density of matter in the interstellar medium (ISM) ranging from 105 to 109 atoms/m3.[107] The Sun is believed to be inside the Local Bubble, a region of highly ionized gas, so the density in the solar neighborhood is only about 103 atoms/m3.[108] Stars form from dense clouds in the ISM, and the evolutionary processes of stars result in the steady enrichment of the ISM with elements more massive than hydrogen and helium. Up to 95% of the Milky Way's atoms are concentrated inside stars and the total mass of atoms forms about 10% of the mass of the galaxy.[109] (The remainder of the mass is an unknown dark matter.)[110]\\r\\nElectrons are thought to exist in the Universe since early stages of the Big Bang. Atomic nuclei forms in nucleosynthesis reactions. In about three minutes Big Bang nucleosynthesis produced most of the helium, lithium, and deuterium in the Universe, and perhaps some of the beryllium and boron.[111][112][113]\\r\\nUbiquitousness and stability of atoms relies on their binding energy, which means that an atom has a lower energy than an unbound system of the nucleus and electrons. Where the temperature is much higher than ionization potential, the matter exists in the form of plasmaa gas of positively charged ions (possibly, bare nuclei) and electrons. When the temperature drops below the ionization potential, atoms become statistically favorable. Atoms (complete with bound electrons) became to dominate over charged particles 380,000?years after the Big Bangan epoch called recombination, when the expanding Universe cooled enough to allow electrons to become attached to nuclei.[114]\\r\\nSince the Big Bang, which produced no carbon or heavier elements, atomic nuclei have been combined in stars through the process of nuclear fusion to produce more of the element helium, and (via the triple alpha process) the sequence of elements from carbon up to iron;[115] see stellar nucleosynthesis for details.\\r\\nIsotopes such as lithium-6, as well as some beryllium and boron are generated in space through cosmic ray spallation.[116] This occurs when a high-energy proton strikes an atomic nucleus, causing large numbers of nucleons to be ejected.\\r\\nElements heavier than iron were produced in supernovae through the r-process and in AGB stars through the s-process, both of which involve the capture of neutrons by atomic nuclei.[117] Elements such as lead formed largely through the radioactive decay of heavier elements.[118]\\r\\nMost of the atoms that make up the Earth and its inhabitants were present in their current form in the nebula that collapsed out of a molecular cloud to form the Solar System. The rest are the result of radioactive decay, and their relative proportion can be used to determine the age of the Earth through radiometric dating.[119][120] Most of the helium in the crust of the Earth (about 99% of the helium from gas wells, as shown by its lower abundance of helium-3) is a product of alpha decay.[121]\\r\\nThere are a few trace atoms on Earth that were not present at the beginning (i.e., not \\"primordial\\"), nor are results of radioactive decay. Carbon-14 is continuously generated by cosmic rays in the atmosphere.[122] Some atoms on Earth have been artificially generated either deliberately or as by-products of nuclear reactors or explosions.[123][124] Of the transuranic elementsthose with atomic numbers greater than 92only plutonium and neptunium occur naturally on Earth.[125][126] Transuranic elements have radioactive lifetimes shorter than the current age of the Earth[127] and thus identifiable quantities of these elements have long since decayed, with the exception of traces of plutonium-244 possibly deposited by cosmic dust.[128] Natural deposits of plutonium and neptunium are produced by neutron capture in uranium ore.[129]\\r\\nThe Earth contains approximately 7050133000000000000?1.33G1050 atoms.[130] Although small numbers of independent atoms of noble gases exist, such as argon, neon, and helium, 99% of the atmosphere is bound in the form of molecules, including carbon dioxide and diatomic oxygen and nitrogen. At the surface of the Earth, an overwhelming majority of atoms combine to form various compounds, including water, salt, silicates and oxides. Atoms can also combine to create materials that do not consist of discrete molecules, including crystals and liquid or solid metals.[131][132] This atomic matter forms networked arrangements that lack the particular type of small-scale interrupted order associated with molecular matter.[133]\\r\\nWhile isotopes with atomic numbers higher than lead (82) are known to be radioactive, an \\"island of stability\\" has been proposed for some elements with atomic numbers above 103. These superheavy elements may have a nucleus that is relatively stable against radioactive decay.[134] The most likely candidate for a stable superheavy atom, unbihexium, has 126?protons and 184?neutrons.[135]\\r\\nEach particle of matter has a corresponding antimatter particle with the opposite electrical charge. Thus, the positron is a positively charged antielectron and the antiproton is a negatively charged equivalent of a proton. When a matter and corresponding antimatter particle meet, they annihilate each other. Because of this, along with an imbalance between the number of matter and antimatter particles, the latter are rare in the universe. The first causes of this imbalance are not yet fully understood, although theories of baryogenesis may offer an explanation. As a result, no antimatter atoms have been discovered in nature.[136][137] However, in 1996 the antimatter counterpart of the hydrogen atom (antihydrogen) was synthesized at the CERN laboratory in Geneva.[138][139]\\r\\nOther exotic atoms have been created by replacing one of the protons, neutrons or electrons with other particles that have the same charge. For example, an electron can be replaced by a more massive muon, forming a muonic atom.

West and Alison Fernandez were announced as new regulars in May 2017.[3] Dania Ramirez and Gabrielle Anwar were announced as additional regulars in July 2017.[4] In August 2017, it was announced that Mekia Cox had been promoted to series regular after initially joining the cast in July as recurring.[5]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe storyline was softly rebooted[6][7][8] with a main narrative led by an adult Henry Mills, set several years after last season's events.[9] In February 2018, it was announced the seventh season would serve as the final season of the series; the season and series concluded on May 18, 2018.[10]\\r\\n\\r\\nSeveral years after the Final Battle, Henry Mills leaves Storybrooke in search of his own story, only to find himself in the New Enchanted Forest of New Fairy Tale Land,[11][12] where a conflict between Lady Tremaine, Cinderella, Drizella, a resistance led by Tiana, and Mother Gothel's Coven of the Eight culminates in the casting of a new curse that sends the New Enchanted Forest inhabitants to Seattle in the past, before Henry leaves Storybrooke. As Henry's daughter Lucy sets out to restore his belief, Gothel's coven builds its sinister agenda and contends with an unknown witch murderer, while Dr. Facilier embarks on his own power grab for the Dark One Dagger. However, the breaking of the curse results in the return of Rumplestiltskin of the Wish Realm who intends to doom everyone to a miserable end, and amplify his own powers. His defeat ultimately leads to Regina's decision to merge all the realms of story, uniting them into one: the United Realms, with Regina elected and crowned the Good Queen.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn January 2017, while season 6 was still in production, ABC president Channing Dungey spoke of a possible \\"reset\\" of the show's narrative in the event that the show received a season 7 order.[9] After much speculation, executive producers Adam Horowitz and Edward Kitsis later confirmed that certain characters would have their storylines wrapped up and that the back-end of the sixth season had been written with the season 7 narrative change in mind.[81] Despite the major changes from seasons past, the showrunners have said that they do not view season 7 as a complete reboot of the show. Horowitz said: \\"I hesitate to use the word \\"reboot.\\" We're more thinking about it as a hybrid of a lot of things. We're paying homage to the original premise, but there are certain characters who are returning and some who are not. It's a combination of a lot of things, but what we're trying to do is go in a new direction but stay true to the spirit of what the show has always been.\\"[82]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn July 2017, the creators announced that the series now take place in the Seattle neighborhood of Hyperion Heights, which was  created under a new and darker curse. Residents of this neighborhood include displaced characters from the original and new versions of the Enchanted Forest, as well as regular people from the Land Without Magic. This differs from Storybrooke in season 1, which was an isolated town that was blocked off from real-world Maine. The initial villain is Lady Tremaine, who assumes the role of an urban developer who seeks to \\"gentrify the neighborhood\\" and push out and separate fairy tale residents. Meanwhile, Storybrooke and various Fairy Tale Land locations still appear in the flashbacks of the season as the story bounces back and forth between the characters' lives before and during the latest curse.[83]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe main flashback setting of the seventh season is the New Enchanted Forest, which is a New Fairy Tale Land realm.[11] Other locations featured in flashbacks are the Edge of Realms, the Wish Realm, New Wonderland, Oz, and Storybrooke itself.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn May 2017, it was announced that Lana Parrilla, Colin O'Donoghue, and Robert Carlyle would be the only series regulars from season 6 to continue onto season 7.[3] It was teased that the three would be portraying their original characters but with cursed identities, similar to the circumstances in season 1. In July, the first promo of the season revealed that Killian is now a Seattle police officer with the last name Rogers, who is living with an unexplained sense of loss.[84] In August, it was revealed that Regina is now a bar owner named Roni, who is more dressed down and is \\"no longer in charge.\\"[85]\\r\\n\\r\\nFormer main cast member Jennifer Morrison has confirmed that she has agreed to return for one episode, later revealed to be the second episode of the season.[86][87] Morrison announced her last filming day on July 19, 2017.[88] On July 22, it was confirmed that Emilie de Ravin would return for the fourth episode in the seventh season.[39]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn March 2017, Andrew J. West and Alison Fernandez were cast for unknown guest roles in the season six finale. During the episode, it was revealed that West was portraying an adult Henry Mills, while Fernandez portrayed his daughter, Lucy. After that episode's airing, they were confirmed as series regulars for season 7.[3] West will be taking over the role from Jared S. Gilmore, who has been confirmed to appear in at least the first two episodes of the season.[17][89]\\r\\n\\r\\nOn July 6, 2017, it was announced that Dania Ramirez and Gabrielle Anwar would be two additional series regulars for season 7.[3]  Additionally, Adelaide Kane, Mekia Cox, and Rose Reynolds were cast in recurring roles for the upcoming season.[3] On July 15, it was announced that Ramirez would be portraying Cinderella, albeit a different version from the one previously played by Jessy Schram for the first six seasons.[13] On July 22 at San Diego Comic-Con, it was revealed that Anwar and Kane will be portraying Lady Tremaine and Drizella, respectively. Cox would be portraying Tiana from The Princess and the Frog, while Reynolds would be playing an alternate version of Alice, a character previously heavily featured in the spin-off Once Upon a Time in Wonderland.[84] In August 2017, Cox was promoted to series regular.[5]\\r\\n\\r\\nOn August 1, it was announced that Giles Matthey would return as an adult Gideon for the season's fourth episode. The episode, also featuring Emilie de Ravin, would be centered around Rumple.[40] On that same day, it was also announced that Emma Booth was cast in a major recurring role as the Witch,[23] whose more specific identity would be revealed later on during the season.[90] On August 25, Kevin Ryan announced that he would be making an appearance as a new prince in the upcoming season.[91] On August 30, it was announced that Robin Givens had been cast as Tiana's mother, Eudora.[30]\\r\\n\\r\\nOn September 8, it was announced that Meegan Warner would be guest starring as an alternate version of Rapunzel, a character previously featured in one episode of season 3.[31] It was later revealed that the character would appear in a multi-episode arc.[92] On September 20, it was announced that former main Rebecca Mader would return for multiple episodes in the seventh season as Zelena, who will also have a cursed identity.[26][93]\\r\\n\\r\\nOn October 2, it was announced that Dr. Facilier from The Princess and the Frog would make an appearance during the season,[94] later revealed to be portrayed by Daniel Francis in the season's fifth episode.[28] On October 3, it was announced that flashbacks of the ninth episode would feature a \\"tweenage\\" Anastasia, Lady Tremaine's other biological daughter.[95]\\r\\n\\r\\nOn November 1, it was announced that Tiera Skovbye would be recurring as an older version of Robin, the daughter of Zelena and Robin Hood.[32] On November 2, it was announced that Nathan Parsons had been cast in a recurring role as Nick, a lawyer and potential love interest for another character.[34] On November 3, it was announced that the show was casting for the role of Naveen from The Princess and the Frog, who will be recurring in the second half of the season.[96] It was later revealed that the role would be played by Jeff Pierre, who will first appear in the twelfth episode of the season.[36] On November 16, actor Chad Rook announced that he had been cast in an unknown role.[97]\\r\\n\\r\\nOn January 23, 2018, it was announced that Kip Pardue had been cast as Chad, Zelena's fianc from when she was cursed as Kelly.

It is one of the 20th century's most famous and distinctive buildings.[3]\\r\\nDesigned by Danish architect J?rn Utzon, the building was formally opened on 20 October 1973[4] after a gestation beginning with Utzon's 1957 selection as winner of an international design competition. The government of New South Wales, led by the premier, Joseph Cahill, authorised work to begin in 1958 with Utzon directing construction. The government's decision to build Utzon's design is often overshadowed by circumstances that followed, including cost and scheduling overruns as well as the architect's ultimate resignation.[5]\\r\\nThe building and its surrounds occupy the whole of Bennelong Point on Sydney Harbour, between Sydney Cove and Farm Cove, adjacent to the Sydney central business district and the Royal Botanic Gardens, and close by the Sydney Harbour Bridge.\\r\\nThough its name suggests a single venue, the building comprises multiple performance venues which together host well over 1,500 performances annually, attended by more than 1.2?million people.[6] Performances are presented by numerous performing artists, including three resident companies: Opera Australia, the Sydney Theatre Company and the Sydney Symphony Orchestra. As one of the most popular visitor attractions in Australia, more than eight million people visit the site annually, and approximately 350,000 visitors take a guided tour of the building each year.[7] The building is managed by the Sydney Opera House Trust, an agency of the New South Wales State Government.\\r\\nOn 28 June 2007, the Sydney Opera House became a UNESCO World Heritage Site;[8] having been listed on the (now defunct) Register of the National Estate since 1980, the National Trust of Australia register since 1983, the City of Sydney Heritage Inventory since 2000, the New South Wales State Heritage Register since 2003, and the Australian National Heritage List since 2005.[9][10]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe facility features a modern expressionist design, with a series of large precast concrete \\"shells\\",[11] each composed of sections of a sphere of 75.2 metres (246?ft 8.6?in) radius,[12] forming the roofs of the structure, set on a monumental podium. The building covers 1.8 hectares (4.4 acres) of land and is 183?m (600?ft) long and 120?m (394?ft) wide at its widest point. It is supported on 588 concrete piers sunk as much as 25?m (82?ft) below sea level.\\r\\nAlthough the roof structures are commonly referred to as \\"shells\\" (as in this article), they are precast concrete panels supported by precast concrete ribs, not shells in a strictly structural sense.[13] Though the shells appear uniformly white from a distance, they actually feature a subtle chevron pattern composed of 1,056,006 tiles in two colours: glossy white and matte cream. The tiles were manufactured by the Swedish company H?gan?s AB which generally produced stoneware tiles for the paper-mill industry.[14]\\r\\nApart from the tile of the shells and the glass curtain walls of the foyer spaces, the building's exterior is largely clad with aggregate panels composed of pink granite quarried at Tarana. Significant interior surface treatments also include off-form concrete, Australian white birch plywood supplied from Wauchope in northern New South Wales, and brush box glulam.[15]\\r\\nOf the two larger spaces, the Concert Hall is in the western group of shells, the Joan Sutherland Theatre in the eastern group. The scale of the shells was chosen to reflect the internal height requirements, with low entrance spaces, rising over the seating areas up to the high stage towers. The smaller venues (the Drama Theatre, the Playhouse and the Studio) are within the podium, beneath the Concert Hall. A smaller group of shells set to the western side of the Monumental Steps houses the Bennelong Restaurant. The podium is surrounded by substantial open public spaces, and the large stone-paved forecourt area with the adjacent monumental steps is regularly used as a performance space.\\r\\nThe Sydney Opera House includes a number of performance venues:[16]\\r\\nOther areas (for example the northern and western foyers) are also used for performances on an occasional basis. Venues are also used for conferences, ceremonies and social functions.\\r\\nThe building also houses a recording studio, cafes, restaurants, bars and retail outlets. Guided tours are available, including a frequent tour of the front-of-house spaces, and a daily backstage tour that takes visitors backstage to see areas normally reserved for performers and crew members.\\r\\nPlanning began in the late 1940s, when Eugene Goossens, the Director of the NSW State Conservatorium of Music, lobbied for a suitable venue for large theatrical productions. The normal venue for such productions, the Sydney Town Hall, was not considered large enough. By 1954, Goossens succeeded in gaining the support of NSW Premier Joseph Cahill, who called for designs for a dedicated opera house. It was also Goossens who insisted that Bennelong Point be the site: Cahill had wanted it to be on or near Wynyard Railway Station in the northwest of the CBD.[21]\\r\\nAn international design competition was launched by Cahill on 13 September 1955 and received 233 entries, representing architects from 32 countries. The criteria specified a large hall seating 3,000 and a small hall for 1,200 people, each to be designed for different uses, including full-scale operas, orchestral and choral concerts, mass meetings, lectures, ballet performances and other presentations.[22]\\r\\nThe winner, announced in 1957, was J?rn Utzon, a Danish architect. According to legend the Utzon design was rescued by noted Finnish-American architect Eero Saarinen from a final cut of 30 \\"rejects\\". The runner-up was an entry by firm GBQC of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. The grand prize was 5,000 Australian pounds.[23] Utzon visited Sydney in 1957 to help supervise the project.[24] His office moved to Palm Beach, Sydney in February 1963.[25]\\r\\nUtzon received the Pritzker Architecture Prize, architecture's highest honour, in 2003.[26] The Pritzker Prize citation read:\\r\\nThere is no doubt that the Sydney Opera House is his masterpiece. It is one of the great iconic buildings of the 20th century, an image of great beauty that has become known throughout the world ÿ a symbol for not only a city, but a whole country and continent.\\r\\nThe Fort Macquarie Tram Depot, occupying the site at the time of these plans, was demolished in 1958 and construction began in March 1959. It was built in three stages: stage I (1959ÿ1963) consisted of building the upper podium; stage II (1963ÿ1967) the construction of the outer shells; stage III (1967ÿ1973) interior design and construction.\\r\\nStage I commenced on 2 March 1959 with the construction firm Civil & Civic, monitored by the engineers Ove Arup and Partners.[27] The government had pushed for work to begin early, fearing that funding, or public opinion, might turn against them. However, Utzon had still not completed the final designs. Major structural issues still remained unresolved. By 23 January 1961, work was running 47 weeks behind,[27] mainly because of unexpected difficulties (inclement weather, unexpected difficulty diverting stormwater, construction beginning before proper construction drawings had been prepared, changes of original contract documents). Work on the podium was finally completed in February 1963. The forced early start led to significant later problems, not least of which was the fact that the podium columns were not strong enough to support the roof structure, and had to be re-built.[28]\\r\\nThe shells of the competition entry were originally of undefined geometry,[29] but, early in the design process, the \\"shells\\" were perceived as a series of parabolas supported by precast concrete ribs. However, engineers Ove Arup and Partners were unable to find an acceptable solution to constructing them. The formwork for using in-situ concrete would have been prohibitively expensive, and, because there was no repetition in any of the roof forms, the construction of precast concrete for each individual section would possibly have been even more expensive.\\r\\nFrom 1957 to 1963, the design team went through at least 12 iterations of the form of the shells trying to find an economically acceptable form (including schemes with parabolas, circular ribs and ellipsoids) before a workable solution was completed. The design work on the shells involved one of the earliest uses of computers in structural analysis, to understand the complex forces to which the shells would be subjected.[30] The computer system was also used in the assembly of the arches. The pins in the arches were surveyed at the end of each day, and the information was entered into the computer so the next arch could be properly placed the following day. In mid-1961, the design team found a solution to the problem: the shells all being created as sections from a sphere. This solution allows arches of varying length to be cast in a common mould, and a number of arch segments of common length to be placed adjacent to one another, to form a spherical section. With whom exactly this solution originated has been the subject of some controversy. It was originally credited to Utzon. Ove Arup's letter to Ashworth, a member of the Sydney Opera House Executive Committee, states: \\"Utzon came up with an idea of making all the shells of uniform curvature throughout in both directions.\\"[31] Peter Jones, the author of Ove Arup's biography, states that \\"the architect and his supporters alike claimed to recall the precise eureka moment ...?; the engineers and some of their associates, with equal conviction, recall discussion in both central London and at Ove's house.\\"\\r\\nHe goes on to claim that \\"the existing evidence shows that Arup's canvassed several possibilities for the geometry of the shells, from parabolas to ellipsoids and spheres.\\"[30] Yuzo Mikami, a member of the design team, presents an opposite view in his book on the project, Utzon's Sphere.[32][33] It is unlikely that the truth will ever be categorically known, but there is a clear consensus that the design team worked very well indeed for the first part of the project and that Utzon, Arup, and Ronald Jenkins (partner of Ove Arup and Partners responsible for the Opera House project) all played a very significant part in the design development.[34]\\r\\nAs Peter Murray states in The Saga of the Sydney Opera House:[28]\\r\\n... the two menand their teamsenjoyed a collaboration that was remarkable in its fruitfulness and, despite many traumas, was seen by most of those involved in the project as a high point of architect/engineer collaboration.\\r\\nThe design of the roof was tested on scale models in wind tunnels at University of Southampton and later NPL in order to establish the wind-pressure distribution around the roof shape in very high winds, which helped in the design of the roof tiles and their fixtures.[35][36]\\r\\nThe shells were constructed by Hornibrook Group Pty Ltd,[37] who were also responsible for construction in Stage III. Hornibrook manufactured the 2400 precast ribs and 4000 roof panels in an on-site factory and also developed the construction processes.[28] The achievement of this solution avoided the need for expensive formwork construction by allowing the use of precast units (it also allowed the roof tiles to be prefabricated in sheets on the ground, instead of being stuck on individually at height). Ove Arup and Partners' site engineer supervised the construction of the shells, which used an innovative adjustable steel-trussed \\"erection arch\\" to support the different roofs before completion. On 6 April 1962, it was estimated that the Opera House would be completed between August 1964 and March 1965.\\r\\nStage III, the interiors, started with Utzon moving his entire office to Sydney in February 1963. However, there was a change of government in 1965, and the new Robert Askin government declared the project under the jurisdiction of the Ministry of Public Works. Due to the Ministry's criticism of the project's costs and time,[38] along with their impression of Utzon's designs being impractical, this ultimately led to his resignation in 1966 (see below).\\r\\nThe cost of the project so far, even in October 1966, was still only $22.9?million,[39] less than a quarter of the final $102?million cost. However, the projected costs for the design were at this stage much more significant.\\r\\nThe second stage of construction was progressing toward completion when Utzon resigned. His position was principally taken over by Peter Hall, who became largely responsible for the interior design. Other persons appointed that same year to replace Utzon were E. H. Farmer as government architect, D. S. Littlemore and Lionel Todd.\\r\\nFollowing Utzon's resignation, the acoustic advisor, Lothar Cremer, confirmed to the Sydney Opera House Executive Committee (SOHEC) that Utzon's original acoustic design allowed for only 2000 seats in the main hall and further stated that increasing the number of seats to 3000 as specified in the brief would be disastrous for the acoustics. According to Peter Jones, the stage designer, Martin Carr, criticised the \\"shape, height and width of the stage, the physical facilities for artists, the location of the dressing rooms, the widths of doors and lifts, and the location of lighting switchboards.\\"[40]\\r\\nThe Opera House was formally completed in 1973, having cost $102?million.[43] H.R. \\"Sam\\" Hoare, the Hornibrook director in charge of the project, provided the following approximations in 1973: Stage I: podium Civil & Civic Pty Ltd approximately $5.5m. Stage II: roof shells M.R. Hornibrook (NSW) Pty Ltd approximately $12.5m. Stage III: completion The Hornibrook Group $56.5m. Separate contracts: stage equipment, stage lighting and organ $9.0m. Fees and other costs: $16.5m.\\r\\nThe original cost and scheduling estimates in 1957 projected a cost of S3,500,000 ($7?million) and completion date of 26 January 1963 (Australia Day).[30] In reality, the project was completed ten years late and 1,357% over budget in real terms.\\r\\nBefore the Sydney Opera House competition, J?rn Utzon had won seven of the 18 competitions he had entered but had never seen any of his designs built.[44] Utzon's submitted concept for the Sydney Opera House was almost universally admired and considered groundbreaking. The Assessors Report of January 1957, stated:\\r\\nThe drawings submitted for this scheme are simple to the point of being diagrammatic. Nevertheless, as we have returned again and again to the study of these drawings, we are convinced that they present a concept of an Opera House which is capable of becoming one of the great buildings of the world.\\r\\nFor the first stage, Utzon worked successfully with the rest of the design team and the client, but, as the project progressed, the Cahill government insisted on progressive revisions. They also did not fully appreciate the costs or work involved in design and construction. Tensions between the client and the design team grew further when an early start to construction was demanded despite an incomplete design. This resulted in a continuing series of delays and setbacks while various technical engineering issues were being refined. The building was unique, and the problems with the design issues and cost increases were exacerbated by commencement of work before the completion of the final plans.\\r\\nAfter the 1965 election of the Liberal Party, with Robert Askin becoming Premier of New South Wales, the relationship of client, architect, engineers and contractors became increasingly tense. Askin had been a \\"vocal critic of the project prior to gaining office.\\"[45] His new Minister for Public Works, Davis Hughes, was even less sympathetic. Elizabeth Farrelly, an Australian architecture critic, wrote that:\\r\\nat an election night dinner party in Mosman, Hughes' daughter Sue Burgoyne boasted that her father would soon sack Utzon. Hughes had no interest in art, architecture or aesthetics. A fraud, as well as a philistine, he had been exposed before Parliament and dumped as Country Party leader for 19 years of falsely claiming a university degree. The Opera House gave Hughes a second chance. For him, as for Utzon, it was all about control; about the triumph of homegrown mediocrity over foreign genius.[45]\\r\\nDifferences ensued. One of the first was that Utzon believed the clients should receive information on all aspects of the design and construction through his practice, while the clients wanted a system (notably drawn in sketch form by Davis Hughes) where architect, contractors, and engineers each reported to the client directly and separately. This had great implications for procurement methods and cost control, with Utzon wishing to negotiate contracts with chosen suppliers (such as Ralph Symonds for the plywood interiors) and the New South Wales government insisting contracts be put out to tender.[28]\\r\\nUtzon was highly reluctant to respond to questions or criticism from the client's Sydney Opera House Executive Committee (SOHEC).[46] However, he was greatly supported throughout by a member of the committee and one of the original competition judges, Harry Ingham Ashworth. Utzon was unwilling to compromise on some aspects of his designs that the clients wanted to change.\\r\\nUtzon's ability was never in doubt, despite questions raised by Davis Hughes, who attempted to portray Utzon as an impractical dreamer. Ove Arup actually stated that Utzon was \\"probably the best of any I have come across in my long experience of working with architects\\"[47] and: \\"The Opera House could become the world's foremost contemporary masterpiece if Utzon is given his head.\\"\\r\\nIn October 1965, Utzon gave Hughes a schedule setting out the completion dates of parts of his work for stage III.[citation needed] Utzon was at this time working closely with Ralph Symonds, a manufacturer of plywood based in Sydney and highly regarded by many, despite an Arup engineer warning that Ralph Symonds's \\"knowledge of the design stresses of plywood, was extremely sketchy\\" and that the technical advice was \\"elementary to say the least and completely useless for our purposes.\\" Australian architecture critic Elizabeth Farrelly has referred to Ove Arup's project engineer Michael Lewis as having \\"other agendas\\".[45] In any case, Hughes shortly after withheld permission for the construction of plywood prototypes for the interiors,[citation needed] and the relationship between Utzon and the client never recovered. By February 1966, Utzon was owed more than $100,000 in fees.[48] Hughes then withheld funding so that Utzon could not even pay his own staff. The government minutes record that following several threats of resignation, Utzon finally stated to Davis Hughes: \\"If you don't do it, I resign.\\" Hughes replied: \\"I accept your resignation. Thank you very much. Goodbye.\\"[49]\\r\\nUtzon left the project on 28 February 1966. He said that Hughes's refusal to pay him any fees and the lack of collaboration caused his resignation and later famously described the situation as \\"Malice in Blunderland\\". In March 1966, Hughes offered him a subordinate role as \\"design architect\\" under a panel of executive architects, without any supervisory powers over the House's construction, but Utzon rejected this. Utzon left the country never to return.\\r\\nFollowing the resignation, there was great controversy about who was in the right and who was in the wrong. The Sydney Morning Herald initially opined: \\"No architect in the world has enjoyed greater freedom than Mr Utzon. Few clients have been more patient or more generous than the people and the Government of NSW. One would not like history to record that this partnership was brought to an end by a fit of temper on the one side or by a fit of meanness on the other.\\" On 17 March 1966, the Herald offered the view that:[50] \\"It was not his [Utzon's] fault that a succession of Governments and the Opera House Trust should so signally have failed to impose any control or order on the project .... his concept was so daring that he himself could solve its problems only step by step .... his insistence on perfection led him to alter his design as he went along.\\"\\r\\nThe Sydney Opera House opened the way for the immensely complex geometries of some modern architecture. The design was one of the first examples of the use of computer-aided design to design complex shapes. The design techniques developed by Utzon and Arup for the Sydney Opera House have been further developed and are now used for architecture, such as works of Gehry and blobitecture, as well as most reinforced concrete structures. The design is also one of the first in the world to use araldite to glue the precast structural elements together and proved the concept for future use.\\r\\nIt was also a first in mechanical engineering. Another Danish firm, Steensen Varming, was responsible for designing the new air-conditioning plant, the largest in Australia at the time, supplying over 600,000 cubic feet (17,000?m3) of air per minute,[51] using the innovative idea of harnessing the harbour water to create a water-cooled heat pump system that is still in operation today.[52]\\r\\nAfter the resignation of Utzon, the Minister for Public Works, Davis Hughes, and the Government Architect, Ted Farmer, organised a team to bring the Sydney Opera House to completion. The architectural work was divided between three appointees who became the Hall, Todd, Littlemore partnership. David Littlemore would manage construction supervision, Lionel Todd contract documentation, while the crucial role of design became the responsibility of Peter Hall.[53]:45\\r\\nPeter Hall (1931ÿ1995) completed a combined arts and architecture degree at Sydney University. Upon graduation a travel scholarship enabled him to spend twelve months in Europe during which time he visited Utzon in Helleb?k.[54] Returning to Sydney, Hall worked for the Government Architect, a branch of the NSW Public Works Department. While there he established himself as a talented design architect with a number of court and university buildings, including the Goldstein Hall at the University of New South Wales, which won the Sir John Sulman Medal in 1964.\\r\\nHall resigned from the Government Architects office in early 1966 to pursue his own practice. When approached to take on the design role, (after at least two prominent Sydney architects had declined), Hall spoke with Utzon by phone before accepting the position. Utzon reportedly told Hall: he (Hall) would not be able to finish the job and the Government would have to invite him back.[53](p46) Hall also sought the advice of others, including architect Don Gazzard who warned him acceptance would be a bad career move as the project would \\"never be his own\\".[53]:47\\r\\nHall agreed to accept the role on the condition there was no possibility of Utzon returning. Even so, his appointment did not go down well with many of his fellow architects who considered that no one but Utzon should complete the Sydney Opera House.[54] Upon Utzon's dismissal, a rally of protest had marched to Bennelong Point. A petition was also circulated, including in the Government Architects office. Peter Hall was one of the many who had signed the petition that called for Utzon's reinstatement.[54]\\r\\nWhen Hall agreed to the design role and was appointed in April 1966, he imagined he would find the design and documentation for the Stage III well advanced. What he found was an enormous amount of work ahead of him with many aspects completely unresolved by Utzon in relation to seating capacity, acoustics and structure.[53]:42 In addition Hall found the project had proceeded for nine years without the development of a concise client brief. To bring himself up to speed, Hall investigated concert and opera venues overseas and engaged stage consultant Ben Schlange and acoustic consultant Wilhelm Jordan, while establishing his team. In consultation with all the potential building users the first Review of Program was completed in January 1967. The most significant conclusion reached by Hall was that concert and opera were incompatible in the same hall.[53]:53 Although Utzon had sketched ideas using plywood for the great enclosing glass walls their structural viability was unresolved when Hall took on the design role.[53]:49 With the ability to delegate tasks and effectively coordinate the work of consultants, Hall guided the project for over five years until the opening day in 1973.\\r\\nA former Government Architect, Peter Webber, in his book Peter Hall: the Phantom of the Opera House, concludes: when Utzon resigned no one was better qualified (than Hall) to rise to the challenge of completing the design of the Opera House.[53]:126\\r\\nThe Sydney Opera House was formally opened by Elizabeth II, Queen of Australia, on 20 October 1973. A large crowd attended. Utzon was not invited to the ceremony, nor was his name mentioned. The opening was televised and included fireworks and a performance of Beethoven's Symphony No. 9.[55]\\r\\nDuring the construction phase, lunchtime performances were often arranged for the workers, with American vocalist Paul Robeson the first artist to perform, in 1960.\\r\\nVarious performances were presented prior to the official opening:\\r\\nAfter the opening:\\r\\nIn the late 1990s, the Sydney Opera House Trust resumed communication with Utzon in an attempt to effect a reconciliation and to secure his involvement in future changes to the building. In 1999, he was appointed by the Trust as a design consultant for future work.[60]\\r\\nIn 2004, the first interior space rebuilt to an Utzon design was opened, and renamed \\"The Utzon Room\\" in his honour. It contains an original Utzon tapestry (14.00 x 3.70 metres) called Homage to Carl Philipp Emmanuel Bach.[61] In April 2007, he proposed a major reconstruction of the Opera Theatre, as it was then known.[62] Utzon died on 29 November 2008.[63]\\r\\nA state memorial service, attended by Utzon's son Jan and daughter Lin, celebrating his creative genius, was held in the Concert Hall on 25 March 2009 featuring performances, readings and recollections from prominent figures in the Australian performing arts scene.\\r\\nRefurbished Western Foyer and Accessibility improvements were commissioned on 17 November 2009, the largest building project completed since Utzon was re-engaged in 1999. Designed by Utzon and his son Jan, the project provided improved ticketing, toilet and cloaking facilities. New escalators and a public lift enabled enhanced access for the disabled and families with prams. The prominent paralympian athlete Louise Sauvage was announced as the building's \\"accessibility ambassador\\" to advise on further improvements to aid people with disabilities.[64]\\r\\nOn 29 March 2016, an original 1959 tapestry by Le Corbusier (2.18 x 3.55 metres), commissioned by Utzon to be hung in the Sydney Opera House and called Les Ds Sont Jets (The Dice Are Cast), was finally unveiled in situ after being owned by the Utzon family and held at their home in Denmark for over 50 years. The tapestry was bought at auction by the Sydney Opera House in June 2015. It now hangs in the building's Western Foyer and is accessible to the public.\\r\\nIn the second half of 2017, the Joan Sutherland Theatre was closed to replace the stage machinery and for other works. The Concert Hall is scheduled for work in 2020-2021.\\r\\nIn 1993, Constantine Koukias was commissioned by the Sydney Opera House Trust in association with REM Theatre to compose Icon, a large-scale music theatre piece for the 20th anniversary of the Sydney Opera House [65]\\r\\nDuring the 2000 Summer Olympics, the venue served as the focal point for the triathlon events. The event had a 1.5?km (0.9?mi) swimming loop at Farm Cove, along with competitions in the neighbouring Royal Botanical Gardens for the cycling and running portions of the event.[66]\\r\\nSince 2013, a group of residents from the nearby Bennelong Apartments (better known as 'The Toaster'), calling themselves the Sydney Opera House Concerned Citizens Group, have been campaigning against Forecourt Concerts on the grounds that they exceed noise levels outlined in the development approval (DA). In February 2017 the NSW Department of Planning and the Environment handed down a $15,000 fine to the Sydney Opera House for breach of allowed noise levels at a concert held in November 2015. However the DA was amended in 2016 to allow an increase in noise levels in the forecourt by 5 decibels. The residents opposing the concerts contend that a new DA should have been filed rather than an amendment.[67][68]\\r\\nThe Sydney Opera House sails formed a graphic projection-screen in a lightshow mounted in connection with the International Fleet Review in Sydney Harbour on 5 October 2013.[69]\\r\\nOn 31 December 2013, the venue's 40th anniversary year, a New Year firework display was mounted for the first time in a decade.[70]\\r\\nThe Sydney Opera House hosted an event, 'the biggest blind date' on Friday 21 February 2014 that won an historic Guinness World Record.[71]\\r\\n This Wikipedia article was originally based on the Sydney Opera House, listed on the \\"New South Wales State Heritage Register\\" published by the Government of New South Wales under CC-BY 3.0 AU licence (accessed on 3 September 2017).","input":"When did construction start on the sydney opera house?"},{"output":"Pride Lands","context":"The Lion King is a 1994 American animated epic musical film produced by Walt Disney Feature Animation and released by Walt Disney Pictures. It is the 32nd Disney animated feature film, and the fifth animated film produced during a period known as the Disney Renaissance. The Lion King was directed by Roger Allers and Rob Minkoff, produced by Don Hahn, and has a screenplay credited to Irene Mecchi, Jonathan Roberts, and Linda Woolverton. Its original songs were written by composer Elton John and lyricist Tim Rice, and original scores were written by Hans Zimmer. The film features an ensemble voice cast that includes Matthew Broderick, James Earl Jones, Jeremy Irons, Jonathan Taylor Thomas, Moira Kelly, Nathan Lane, Ernie Sabella, Rowan Atkinson, Robert Guillaume, Madge Sinclair, Whoopi Goldberg, Cheech Marin, and Jim Cummings. The story takes place in a kingdom of lions in Africa and was influenced by William Shakespeare's Hamlet.\\r\\nThe Lion King tells the story of Simba, a young lion who is to succeed his father, Mufasa, as King of the Pride Lands; however, after Simba's uncle Scar (Mufasa's jealous younger brother), murders Mufasa, Simba is manipulated into thinking he was responsible and flees into exile. Upon maturation living with two wastrels, Simba is given some valuable perspective from his childhood friend, Nala, and his shaman, Rafiki, before returning to challenge Scar to end his tyranny and take his place in the Circle of Life as the rightful King.\\r\\nDevelopment of The Lion King began in 1988 during a meeting between Jeffrey Katzenberg, Roy E. Disney, and Peter Schneider while promoting Oliver & Company in Europe. Thomas Disch wrote a film treatment, and Woolverton developed the first scripts while George Scribner was signed on as director, being later joined by Allers. Production began in 1991 concurrently with Pocahontas, which wound up attracting most of Disney's top animators. Some time after the staff traveled to Hell's Gate National Park in Kenya to research on the film's setting and animals, Scribner left production disagreeing with the decision to turn the film into a musical and was replaced by Minkoff. When Hahn joined the project, he was dissatisfied with the script and the story was promptly rewritten. Nearly 20 minutes of animation sequences were produced at Disney-MGM Studios in Florida. Computer animation was also used in several scenes, most notably in the wildebeest stampede sequence.\\r\\nThe Lion King was released on June 15, 1994, to a positive reaction from critics, who praised the film for its music, story, and animation; it finished its theatrical run as the highest-grossing release of 1994 and the second highest-grossing film of all time. It is also the highest-grossing traditionally animated film of all time. The Lion King garnered two Academy Awards for its achievement in music and the Golden Globe Award for Best Motion Picture?ÿ Musical or Comedy. The film has led to many derived works, such as a Broadway adaptation; two direct-to-video follow-upsthe sequel, The Lion King II: Simba's Pride (1998), and the prequel/parallel, The Lion King 1? (2004); two television series, Timon and Pumbaa and The Lion Guard; and a 3D re-release, in 2011.\\r\\nIn 2016, the film was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as being \\"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\\". A CGI remake of the film directed by Jon Favreau is scheduled for a July 19, 2019 release in the United States.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the Pride Lands of Africa, a lion rules over the animal kingdom from Pride Rock. King Mufasa's newborn son, Simba, is presented to the assembled animals by Rafiki, a mandrill who serves as shaman and advisor. Mufasa shows young Simba the Pride Lands and explains to him the responsibilities of kingship and the \\"circle of life\\" which connects all living things. Mufasa's younger brother, Scar, covets the throne and plots to eliminate Mufasa and Simba so he may become king. He tricks Simba and his best friend Nalato whom Simba is betrothedinto exploring a forbidden elephants' graveyard, where they are attacked by three spotted hyenas who are in league with Scar. Mufasa is alerted to the danger by his majordomo, the hornbill Zazu, and rescues the cubs. Though angry with Simba, Mufasa forgives him and explains that the great kings of the past watch over them from the night sky, from which he will one day watch over Simba.\\r\\nScar sets a trap for his brother and nephew, luring Simba into a gorge and having the hyenas drive a large herd of wildebeest into a stampede that will trample him. He informs Mufasa of Simba's peril, knowing the king will rush to save his son. Mufasa saves Simba but ends up hanging perilously from the gorge's edge and is betrayed by Scar, who sends him falling to his death. Scar convinces Simba that the tragedy was Simba's own fault and advises him to flee the kingdom. He orders the hyenas to kill the cub, but Simba escapes. Scar tells the pride that both Mufasa and Simba were killed in the stampede and steps forward as the new king, allowing a large pack of hyenas to live in the Pride Lands.\\r\\nSimba collapses in a desert and is rescued by Timon and Pumbaa, a meerkat and warthog who are fellow outcasts. Simba grows up in the jungle with his two new friends, living a carefree life under the motto \\"hakuna matata\\" (\\"no worries\\" in Swahili). Now a young adult, Simba rescues Timon and Pumbaa from a hungry lioness who turns out to be Nala. She and Simba reunite and fall in love, and she urges him to return home, telling him the Pride Lands have become a drought-stricken wasteland under Scar's reign. Feeling guilty over his father's death, Simba refuses and storms off. He encounters Rafiki, who tells him that Mufasa' spirit lives on in Simba. Simba is visited by the ghost of Mufasa in the night sky, who tells him he must take his rightful place as king. Realizing he can no longer run from his past, Simba decides to return home.\\r\\nAided by his friends, Simba sneaks past the hyenas at Pride Rock and confronts Scar. Scar taunts him over his role in Mufasa's death and backs him to the edge of the rock, where he reveals to Simba that he murdered Mufasa. Enraged, Simba pins Scar to the ground and forces him to reveal the truth to the rest of the pride. Timon, Pumbaa, Rafiki, Zazu, and the lionesses fend off the hyenas while Scar, attempting to escape, is cornered by Simba at the top of Pride Rock. Scar begs for mercy and attempts to blame the hyenas for his actions; Simba spares his life but orders him to leave the Pride Lands forever. Scar attacks his nephew, but Simba manages to toss him from the top of the rock. Scar survives the fall but is killed by the hyenas, who overheard him betray them to Simba. With his enemies gone, Simba takes over the kingship as the rains begin to fall, restoring life to the land.\\r\\nLater, with Pride Rock restored to its former glory, Rafiki presents Simba and Nala's newborn cub to the assembled animals, continuing the circle of life.\\r\\nThe idea for The Lion King was conceived in late 1988 during a conversation between Jeffrey Katzenberg, Roy E. Disney and Peter Schneider on a plane to Europe to promote Oliver & Company. During the conversation, the topic of a story set in Africa came up, and Katzenberg immediately jumped at the idea.[5] The idea was then developed by Walt Disney Feature Animation's vice president for creative affairs Charlie Fink.[6] Katzenberg decided to add elements involving coming of age and death, and ideas from personal life experiences, such as some of his trials in his bumpy road in politics, saying about the film, \\"It is a little bit about myself.\\"[7] In November of that year Thomas Disch (author of The Brave Little Toaster) wrote a treatment entitled King of the Kalahari,[8] and afterwards, Linda Woolverton spent a year writing drafts of the script, which was titled King of the Beasts and then King of the Jungle.[6] The original version of the film was very different from the final film. The plot was centered in a battle being between lions and baboons with Scar being the leader of the baboons, Rafiki being a cheetah,[7] and Timon and Pumbaa being Simba's childhood friends.[9] Simba would also not leave the kingdom but become a \\"lazy, slovenly, horrible character\\" due to manipulations from Scar, so Simba could be overthrown after coming of age. By 1990, producer Thomas Schumacher, who had just completed The Rescuers Down Under, decided to attach himself to the project \\"because lions are cool\\".[6] Schumacher likened the script for King of the Jungle to \\"an animated National Geographic special\\".[10]\\r\\nOliver & Company director George Scribner was the initial director of the film,[11] being later joined by Roger Allers, who was the lead story man on Beauty and the Beast in October 1991.[5] Allers brought with him Brenda Chapman, who would become the head of story.[6] Afterwards, several of the lead crew members, including Allers, Scribner, Hahn, Chapman, and production designer Chris Sanders, took a trip to Hell's Gate National Park in Kenya, in order to study and gain an appreciation of the environment for the film.[12] After six months of story development work Scribner decided to leave the project, as he clashed with Allers and the producers on their decision to turn the film into a musical, as Scribner's intention was of making a documentary-like film more focused on natural aspects.[5][13] Rob Minkoff replaced Scribner,[12] and producer Don Hahn joined the production as Schumacher became only an executive producer due to Disney promoting him to Vice President of Development for Feature Animation.[10] Hahn found the script unfocused and lacking a clear theme, and after establishing the main theme as \\"leaving childhood and facing up to the realities of the world\\", asked for a final retool. Allers, Minkoff, Chapman and Hahn then rewrote the story across two weeks of meetings with directors Kirk Wise and Gary Trousdale, who had just finished Beauty and the Beast.[12] The script also had its title changed from King of the Jungle to The Lion King, as the setting was not the jungle but the savannah.[5]\\r\\nThe Lion King was the first Disney animated feature to be an original story, rather than be based on an already existing work. The filmmakers have said that the story of The Lion King was inspired by the lives of Joseph and Moses, from the Bible, and William Shakespeare's Hamlet.[14] During the summer of 1992, the team was joined by screenwriter Irene Mecchi, with a second screenwriter, Jonathan Roberts, joining a few months later. Mecchi and Roberts took charge of the revision process, fixing unresolved emotional issues in the script and adding comic business for Pumbaa, Timon, and the hyenas.[3] Lyricist Tim Rice worked closely with the writing team, flying to California at least once a month because his songs needed to work in the narrative continuity. Rice's lyricswhich were reworked up to the production's endwere pinned to the storyboards during development.[12] Rewrites were frequent, with animator Andreas Deja saying that completed scenes would be delivered, only for the response to be that parts needed to be reanimated because of dialog changes.[6]\\r\\nThe voice actors were chosen for how they fit and could add to the charactersfor instance, James Earl Jones was cast because the directors found his voice \\"powerful\\" and similar to a lion's roar.[15] Jones commented that during the years of production, Mufasa \\"became more and more of a dopey dad instead of [a] grand king\\".[16]\\r\\nNathan Lane originally auditioned for Zazu, and Ernie Sabella, for one of the hyenas. Upon meeting each other at the recording studio, the actors, who at the time both co-starred in Guys and Dolls, were asked to record together as hyenas. The directors laughed at their performance and decided to cast them as Timon and Pumbaa.[15][17] For the hyenas, the original intention was to reunite Cheech & Chong, but while Cheech Marin accepted to play Banzai, Tommy Chong was unavailable. Thus his role was changed into a female hyena, Shenzi, who was voiced by Whoopi Goldberg.[9]\\r\\nMatthew Broderick was cast as adult Simba early during production, and during the three years of voice acting only recorded with another actor once, and only discovered Moira Kelly voiced Nala at the premiere.[18] English actors Tim Curry and Malcolm McDowell were originally considered for the role of Scar,[19] however, Curry left the role due to Home Alone 2: Lost in New York, and it was ultimately won by English actor Jeremy Irons.[20] Irons had at first refused the role due to not being comfortable going from the dramatic performance as Claus von Blow in Reversal of Fortune to a comedic role. But once he came in, Irons' performance even inspired the writers to incorporate more of his acting as von Blowadding one of that character's lines, \\"You have no idea\\"and animator Andreas Deja to watch both Reversal of Fortune and Damage to pick up Irons's facial traits and tics.[16][21]\\r\\nThe development of The Lion King coincided with that of Pocahontas, which most of the animators of Walt Disney Feature Animation decided to work on instead, believing it would be the more prestigious and successful of the two.[14] The story artists also did not have much faith in the project, with Chapman declaring she was reluctant to accept the job \\"because the story wasn't very good\\",[6] and writer Burny Mattinson saying to co-worker Joe Ranft \\"I don't know who is going to want to watch that one.\\"[13] Most of the leading animators either were doing their first major work supervising a character, or had much interest in animating an animal.[7] Thirteen of these supervising animators, both in California and in Florida, were responsible for establishing the personalities and setting the tone for the film's main characters. The animation leads for the main characters included Mark Henn on young Simba, Ruben A. Aquino on adult Simba, Andreas Deja on Scar, Aaron Blaise on young Nala, Anthony DeRosa on adult Nala, and Tony Fucile on Mufasa.[3] Nearly 20 minutes of the film, including the \\"I Just Can't Wait to Be King\\" sequence,[9] were animated at the Disney-MGM Studios facility. More than 600 artists, animators, and technicians contributed to The Lion King.[11] Weeks before the film was to be released, the 1994 Northridge earthquake shut down the studio and required the animators to finish their work from home.[22]\\r\\nThe character animators studied real-life animals for reference, as was done for the 1942 Disney film Bambi. Jim Fowler, renowned wildlife expert, visited the studios on several occasions with an assortment of lions and other savannah inhabitants to discuss behavior and help the animators give their drawings authenticity.[12] The animators also studied animal movements at the Miami MetroZoo under guidance from wildlife expert Ron Magill.[23] The Pride Lands are modeled on the Kenyan national park visited by the crew. Varied focal lengths and lenses were employed to differ from the habitual portrayal of Africa in documentarieswhich employ telephoto lenses to shoot the wildlife from a distance. The epic feel drew inspiration from concept studies by artist Hans Bacherwhich, following Scribner's request for realism, tried to depict effects such as lens flareand the works of painters Charles Marion Russell, Frederic Remington and Maxfield Parrish.[12][24] Because the characters were not anthropomorphized, all the animators had to learn to draw four-legged animals, and the story and character development was done through use of longer shots following the characters.[9]\\r\\nComputers helped the filmmakers present their vision in new ways. For the \\"wildebeest stampede\\" sequence, several distinct wildebeest characters were created in a 3D computer program, multiplied into hundreds, cel shaded to look like drawn animation, and given randomized paths down a mountainside to simulate the real, unpredictable movement of a herd.[25] Five specially trained animators and technicians spent more than two years creating the two-and-a-half-minute stampede.[3] The CAPS helped simulate camera movements such as tracking shots, and was employed in coloring, lighting, and particle effects.[9]\\r\\nLyricist Tim Rice, who was working with composer Alan Menken on songs for Aladdin, was invited to write the songs, and accepted on the condition of finding a composing partner. As Menken was unavailable, the producers accepted Rice's suggestion of Elton John,[15] after Rice's invitation of ABBA fell through due to Benny Andersson being busy with the musical Kristina fr?n Duvem?la.[7] John expressed an interest in writing \\"ultra-pop songs that kids would like; then adults can go and see those movies and get just as much pleasure out of them\\", mentioning a possible influence of The Jungle Book, where he felt the \\"music was so funny and appealed to kids and adults\\".[26]\\r\\nJohn and Rice wrote five original songs for the film (\\"Circle of Life\\", \\"I Just Can't Wait to Be King\\", \\"Be Prepared\\", \\"Hakuna Matata\\" and \\"Can You Feel the Love Tonight\\"), with John's performance of \\"Can You Feel the Love Tonight\\" playing over the end credits.[27] The IMAX and DVD releases added another song, \\"The Morning Report\\", based on a song discarded during development that eventually featured in the live musical version of The Lion King.[28] The score was composed by Hans Zimmer, who was hired based on his work in two films in African settings, The Power of One and A World Apart,[12] and supplemented the score with traditional African music and choir elements arranged by Lebo M.[27] Zimmer's partners Mark Mancina and Jay Rifkin helped with arrangements and song production.[29]\\r\\nThe Lion King original motion picture soundtrack was released by Walt Disney Records on July 13, 1994. It was the fourth-best-selling album of the year on the Billboard 200 and the top-selling soundtrack.[30] It is the only soundtrack for an animated film to be certified Diamond (10G platinum) by the Recording Industry Association of America. Zimmer's complete instrumental score for the film was never originally given a full release, until the soundtrack's commemorative 20th anniversary re-release in 2014.[31] The Lion King also inspired the 1995 release Rhythm of the Pride Lands, with eight songs by Zimmer, Mancina, and Lebo M.[32]\\r\\nThe use of the song \\"The Lion Sleeps Tonight\\" in a scene with Timon and Pumbaa led to disputes between Disney and the family of South African Solomon Linda, who composed the song (originally titled \\"Mbube\\") in 1939. In July 2004, Linda's family filed suit, seeking $1.6 million in royalties from Disney. In February 2006, Linda's heirs reached a legal settlement with Abilene Music, who held the worldwide rights and had licensed the song to Disney for an undisclosed amount of money.[33]\\r\\nFor The Lion King's first film trailer, Disney opted to feature a single scene, the entire opening sequence with the song \\"Circle of Life\\". Buena Vista Pictures Distribution president Dick Cook said the decision was made for such an approach because \\"we were all so taken by the beauty and majesty of this piece that we felt like it was probably one of the best four minutes of film that we've seen\\", and Don Hahn added that \\"Circle of Life\\" worked as a trailer as it \\"came off so strong, and so good, and ended with such a bang\\". The trailer was released in November 1993, accompanying The Three Musketeers in theaters, as only a third of The Lion King had been completed.[34][35] Audience reaction was enthusiastic, causing Hahn to have some initial concerns as he became afraid of not living up to the expectations raised by the preview.[34] Prior to the film's release, Disney did 11 test screenings.[36]\\r\\nUpon release, The Lion King was accompanied by an extensive marketing campaign which included tie-ins with Burger King, Mattel, Kodak, Nestl and Payless ShoeSource, and various merchandise,[37] accounting 186 licensed products.[38][39] In 1994, Disney earned approximately $1 billion with products based on the film,[40] with $214 million for Lion King toys during Christmas 1994 alone.[41]\\r\\nThe Lion King was first released on VHS and laserdisc in the United States on March 3, 1995, under Disney's \\"Masterpiece Collection\\" video series. The VHS tape contained a special preview for Walt Disney Pictures' then-upcoming animated film Pocahontas, in which the title character (voiced by Judy Kuhn) sings the musical number \\"Colors of the Wind\\".[42] In addition, Deluxe Editions of both formats were released. The VHS Deluxe Edition included the film, an exclusive lithograph of Rafiki and Simba (in some editions), a commemorative \\"Circle of Life\\" epigraph, six concept art lithographs, another tape with the half-hour TV show The Making of The Lion King, and a certificate of authenticity. The CAV laserdisc Deluxe Edition also contained the film, six concept art lithographs and The Making of The Lion King, and added storyboards, character design artwork, concept art, rough animation, and a directors' commentary that the VHS edition did not have, on a total of four double sided discs. The VHS tape quickly became the best-selling videotape of all time: 4.5 million tapes were sold on the first day[43] and ultimately sales totaled more than 30 million[44] before these home video versions went into moratorium in 1997.[45]\\r\\nOn October 7, 2003, the film was re-released on VHS and released on DVD for the first time, titled The Lion King: Platinum Edition, as part of Disney's Platinum Edition line of animated classic DVDs. The DVD release featured two versions of the film on the first disc, a remastered version created for the 2002 IMAX release and an edited version of the IMAX release purporting to be the original 1994 theatrical version.[46] A second disc, with bonus features, was also included in the DVD release. The film's soundtrack was provided both in its original Dolby 5.1 track and in a new Disney Enhanced Home Theater Mix, making this one of the first Disney DVDs so equipped.[47] By means of seamless branching, the film could be viewed either with or without a newly created scene?ÿ a short conversation in the film replaced with a complete song (\\"The Morning Report\\"). A Special Collector's Gift Set was also released, containing the DVD set, five exclusive lithographed character portraits (new sketches created and signed by the original character animators), and an introductory book entitled The Journey.[45] The Platinum Edition of The Lion King featured changes made to the film during its IMAX re-release, including re-drawn crocodiles in the \\"I Just Can't Wait to Be King\\" sequence as well as other alterations.[46] More than two million copies of the Platinum Edition DVD and VHS units were sold on the first day of release.[43] A DVD boxed set of the three The Lion King films (in two-disc Special Edition formats) was released on December 6, 2004. In January 2005, the film, along with the sequels, went back into moratorium.[48]\\r\\nWalt Disney Studios Home Entertainment released the Diamond Edition of The Lion King on October 4, 2011.[49] This marks the time that the film has been released in high-definition Blu-ray and on Blu-ray 3D.[49][50] The initial release was produced in three different packages: a two-disc version with Blu-ray and DVD; a four-disc version with Blu-ray, DVD, Blu-ray 3D, and digital copy; and an eight-disc box set that also includes the sequels The Lion King 2: Simba's Pride and The Lion King 1?.[49][50] A standalone single-disc DVD release also followed on November 15, 2011.[49] The Diamond Edition topped the Blu-ray charts with over 1.5 million copies sold.[51] The film sold 3.83 million Blu-ray units in total, leading to a $101.14 million income.[52]\\r\\nThe Lion King was once again released to home media as part of the Walt Disney Signature Collection;[53] first released on Digital HD on August 15, 2017 and on Blu-ray and DVD on August 29, 2017.[54]\\r\\nThe Lion King earned $422,783,777 in North America and an $545,700,000 in other territories for a worldwide total of $968,483,777.[2] It is currently the 29th highest-grossing film,[55] the seventh highest-grossing animated film of all time worldwide and the third highest-grossing film of Walt Disney Animation Studios (behind Frozen and Zootopia).[56] The film was also the highest-grossing motion picture of 1994 worldwide.[57] After its initial run, having earned $763.4 million,[58] it ranked as the second-highest-grossing film of all time worldwide, behind Jurassic Park .[59] It held the record for the highest-grossing animated feature film (in North America, outside North America, and worldwide) until it was surpassed by the computer animated Finding Nemo (2003), Shrek 2 (2004), Ice Age: Dawn of the Dinosaurs (2009), and Toy Story 3 (2010) prior to the 2011 re-release. With the earnings of the 3D run, The Lion King surpassed all the aforementioned films but Toy Story 3 to rank as the second-highest-grossing animated film worldwidelater downgraded to sixth after Frozen (2013), Minions (2015), and Zootopia (2016)and it remains the highest-grossing hand-drawn animated film.[60] It is also the biggest animated movie of the last 50 years in terms of estimated attendance.[61]\\r\\nThe Lion King had a limited release in North America on June 15, 1994, playing in only two theaters, El Capitan Theater in Los Angeles and Radio City Music Hall in New York City.[62] It still earned $1,586,753 across the weekend of June 17ÿ19, standing at the tenth place of the box office ranking.[63] The average of $793,377 per theater stands as the largest ever achieved during a weekend.[64] The wide release followed on June 24, 1994, in 2,550 screens. The digital surround sound of the film led many of those theaters to implement Dolby Laboratories' newest sound systems.[65] The Lion King grossed $40.9 million?ÿ which at the time was the fourth biggest opening weekend earning ever and the highest sum for a Disney film ?ÿ to top the weekend box office.[11] It also earned a rare \\"A+\\" rating from CinemaScore.[66] By the end of its theatrical run, in spring 1995, it had earned $312,855,561,[2] being the second-highest-grossing 1994 film in North America behind Forrest Gump.[67] Outside North America, it earned $455.8 million during its initial run, for a worldwide total of $768.6 million.[58] Box Office Mojo estimates that the film sold over 74 million tickets in the US in its initial theatrical run.[68]\\r\\nThe film was re-issued on December 25, 2002 for IMAX and large-format theaters. Don Hahn explained that eight years after The Lion King got its original release, \\"there was a whole new generation of kids who haven't really seen it, particularly on the big screen.\\" Given the film had already been digitally archived during production, the restoration process was easier, while also providing many scenes with enhancements that covered up original deficiencies.[36][69] An enhanced sound mix was also provided to, as Hahn explained, \\"make the audience feel like they're in the middle of the movie.\\"[36] On its first weekend, The Lion King made $2.7 million from 66 locations, a $27,664 per theater average. This run ended with $15,686,215 on May 30, 2003.[70]\\r\\nIn 2011, The Lion King was converted to 3D for a two-week limited theatrical re-issue and subsequent 3D Blu-ray release.[49][71] The film opened at the number one spot on Friday, September 16, 2011 with $8.9 million[72] and finished the weekend with $30.2 million, ranking number one at the box office. This made The Lion King the first re-issue release to earn the number-one slot at the American weekend box office since the re-issue of Return of the Jedi in March 1997.[60] The film also achieved the fourth-highest September opening weekend of all time.[73] It held off very well on its second weekend, again earning first place at the box office with a 27 percent decline to $21.9 million.[74] Most box-office observers had expected the film to fall about 50 percent in its second weekend and were also expecting Moneyball to be at first place.[75]\\r\\nAfter its initial box-office success, many theaters decided to continue to show the film for more than two weeks, even though its 3D Blu-ray release was scheduled for two-and-a-half weeks after its theatrical release.[74] In North America, the 3D re-release ended its run in theaters on January 12, 2012 with a gross $94,242,001. Outside North America, it earned $83,400,000.[76] The successful 3D re-release of The Lion King made Disney and Pixar plan 3D theatrical re-releases of Beauty and the Beast, Finding Nemo, Monsters, Inc., and The Little Mermaid during 2012 and 2013.[77] However, none of the re-releases of the first three films achieved the enormous success of The Lion King 3D and theatrical re-release of The Little Mermaid was ultimately cancelled.[78] In 2012, Ray Subers of Box Office Mojo wrote that the reason why the 3D version of The Lion King succeeded was because, \\"the notion of a 3D re-release was still fresh and exciting, and The Lion King (3D) felt timely given the movie's imminent Blu-ray release. Audiences have been hit with three 3D re-releases in the year since, meaning the novelty value has definitely worn off.\\"[79]\\r\\nThe Lion King was released to critical acclaim. On Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds a rating of 91%, based on 113 reviews, with an average rating of 8.3 out of 10. It also ranked 56th on their \\"Top 100 Animation Movies\\".[80] The site's critical consensus reads, \\"Emotionally stirring, richly drawn, and beautifully animated, The Lion King stands tall within Disney's pantheon of classic family films.\\"[81] On Metacritic, the film has a score of 83 out of 100, based on 14 critics, indicating \\"universal acclaim\\".[82] CinemaScore reported that audiences gave the film a rare \\"A+\\" grade.[83]\\r\\nRoger Ebert gave it 3 1/2 out of 4-stars and called the film \\"a superbly drawn animated feature\\" and, in his print review wrote, \\"The saga of Simba, which in its deeply buried origins owes something to Greek tragedy and certainly to Hamlet, is a learning experience as well as an entertainment.\\"[84] On the television program Siskel & Ebert, the film was praised but received a mixed reaction when compared to previous Disney films. Ebert and his partner Gene Siskel both gave the film a \\"Thumbs Up\\" but Siskel said that it was not as good as earlier films such as Beauty and the Beast and was \\"a good film, not a great one\\".[85] Hal Hinson of The Washington Post called it \\"an impressive, almost daunting achievement\\" and felt that the film was \\"spectacular in a manner that has nearly become commonplace with Disney's feature-length animations\\", but was less enthusiastic toward the end of his review saying, \\"Shakespearean in tone, epic in scope, it seems more appropriate for grown-ups than for kids. If truth be told, even for adults it is downright strange.\\"[86]\\r\\nOwen Gleiberman of Entertainment Weekly praised the film, writing that it \\"has the resonance to stand not just as a terrific cartoon but as an emotionally pungent movie\\".[87] Rolling Stone film critic Peter Travers praised the film and felt that it was \\"a hugely entertaining blend of music, fun and eye-popping thrills, though it doesn't lack for heart\\".[88] James Berardinelli from ReelViews praised the film saying, \\"With each new animated release, Disney seems to be expanding its already-broad horizons a little more. The Lion King is the most mature (in more than one sense) of these films, and there clearly has been a conscious effort to please adults as much as children. Happily, for those of us who generally stay far away from 'cartoons', they have succeeded.\\"[89]\\r\\nSome reviewers still had problems with the film's narrative. The staff of TV Guide wrote that while The Lion King was technically proficient and entertaining, it \\"offers a less memorable song score than did the previous hits, and a hasty, unsatisfying dramatic resolution.\\"[90] The New Yorker's Terrence Rafferty considered that despite the good animation, the story felt like \\"manipulat[ing] our responses at will\\", as \\"Between traumas, the movie serves up soothingly banal musical numbers and silly, rambunctious comedy\\".[91]\\r\\nThe Lion King received four Golden Globe and Academy Award nominations. The film would go on to win two Golden Globes; for Best Motion Picture?ÿ Musical or Comedy and Best Original Score,[92] as well as two Academy Awards, for Best Original Score (Hans Zimmer) and Best Original Song with \\"Can You Feel the Love Tonight\\" by Elton John and Tim Rice.[93] The songs \\"Circle of Life\\" and \\"Hakuna Matata\\" were also nominated.[93] \\"Can You Feel the Love Tonight\\" also won the Grammy Award for Best Male Vocal Performance.[94] The Lion King also won Annie Awards for Best Animated Feature, Best Achievement in Voice Acting (for Jeremy Irons) and Best Individual Achievement for Story Contribution in the Field of Animation.[95]\\r\\nAt the Saturn Awards, the film was nominated in two categories, Best Fantasy Film and Best Performance by a Younger Actor although it did not win in either category.[96] The film also received two nominations at the British Academy Film Awards, for Best Sound as well as the Anthony Asquith Award for Film Music although it lost in both categories to Speed and Backbeat respectively.[97] The film received two BMI Film & TV Awards for Film Music and Most Performed Song with \\"Can You Feel the Love Tonight.\\"[98] At the 1995 MTV Movie Awards, the film received nominations for Best Villain and Best Song, though it lost in both categories.[99] The Lion King won the Kids' Choice Award for Favorite Movie at the 1995 Kids' Choice Awards.[100]\\r\\nIn 2008, The Lion King was ranked as the 319th greatest film ever made by Empire magazine,[101] and in June 2011, TIME named it one of \\"The 25 All-TIME Best Animated Films\\".[102] In June 2008, the American Film Institute listed The Lion King as the fourth best film in the animation genre in its AFI's 10 Top 10 list,[103] having previously put \\"Hakuna Matata\\" as 99th on its AFI's 100 Years...100 Songs ranking.[104]\\r\\nIn 2016, the film was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as being \\"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\\".\\r\\nCertain elements of the film were considered to bear a resemblance to a 1960s Japanese anime television series, Jungle Emperor (known as Kimba the White Lion in the United States), with characters having similar analogues, and various individual scenes being similar in composition to the show. Matthew Broderick believed initially that he was, in fact, working on an American version of Kimba since he was familiar with the Japanese original.[105] However, The Lion King director, Roger Allers, claimed he was unfamiliar with the show:\\r\\nThe whole time I worked on The Lion King the name of that show never came up. At least I never heard it. I had never seen the show and really only became aware of it as Lion King was being completed, and someone showed me images of it. I worked with George Scribner and Linda Woolverton to develop the story in the early days but then left to help out on Aladdin. If one of them were familiar with Kimba they didn't say. Of course, it's possible... Many story ideas developed and changed along the way, always just to make our story stronger. I could certainly understand Kimba's creators feeling angry if they felt we had stolen ideas from them. If I had been inspired by Kimba I would certainly acknowledge my inspiration. All I can offer is my respect to those artists and say that their creation has its loyal admirers and its assured place in animation history.[106]\\r\\nCo-director Rob Minkoff also stated that he was unfamiliar with it: \\"I know for a fact that [Kimba] has never been discussed as long as I've been on the project... In my experience, if Disney becomes aware of anything like that, they say you will not do it. People are claiming copyright infringement all the time.\\" He also stated that whenever a story is based in Africa, it is \\"not unusual to have characters like a baboon, a bird or hyenas.\\"[107] Yoshihiro Shimizu, of Tezuka Productions, which created Kimba the White Lion, has refuted rumors that the studio was paid hush money by Disney but explains that they rejected urges from within the industry to sue because, \\"we're a small, weak company. It wouldn't be worth it anyway?... Disney's lawyers are among the top twenty in the world!\\"[108]\\r\\nProtests were raised against one scene where it appears as if the word \\"SEX\\" might have been embedded into the dust flying in the sky when Simba flops down,[109] which conservative activist Donald Wildmon asserted was a subliminal message intended to promote sexual promiscuity. One of the animators, Tom Sito, has stated that the letters spell \\"SFX\\" (a common abbreviation for \\"special effects\\"), not with an \\"E\\" instead of the \\"F\\", and were intended as an innocent \\"signature\\" created by the effects animation team.[110]\\r\\nHyena biologists protested against the animal's portrayal: one hyena researcher sued Disney studios for defamation of character,[111] and anotherwho had organized the animators' visit to the University of California's Field Station for Behavioural Research, where they would observe and sketch captive hyenas[112] included boycotting The Lion King among the ways it would help preserve hyenas in the wild.[113] The hyenas have also been interpreted to represent an anti-immigrant allegory, where the hyenas would be black and Latino ethnic communities.[114][115][116][117] The film has also been criticised for advancing a fascist narrative in its portrayal of the lion kingdom and the circle of life where \\"only the strong and the beautiful triumph, and the powerless survive only by serving the strong.\\"[118]\\r\\nThe first Lion King-related animated projects involved the characters of Timon and Pumbaa. First, the duo starred in the animated short \\"Stand by Me\\", featuring Timon singing the eponymous song, which was released in 1995 accompanying the theatrical release of Tom and Huck. The duo then received their own animated series, The Lion King's Timon and Pumbaa, which ran for three seasons and 85 episodes between 1995 and 1999. Ernie Sabella continued to voice Pumbaa, while Timon was voiced by Quinton Flynn and Kevin Schon in addition to Nathan Lane.[119]\\r\\nDisney released two direct-to-video films related to The Lion King. The first was sequel The Lion King II: Simba's Pride, released in 1998 on VHS. The film centers around Simba and Nala's daughter, Kiara, who falls in love with Kovu, a male lion who was raised in a pride of Scar's followers, the Outsiders.[120] 2004 saw the release of another Lion King film on DVD, The Lion King 1?. It is a prequel in showing how Timon and Pumbaa met each other, and also a parallel in that it also depicts what the characters were retconned to have done during the events of the original movie.[121]\\r\\nIn June 2014, it was announced that a new TV series based on the film would be released called The Lion Guard, featuring Kion, the second-born cub of Simba and Nala. The Lion Guard is a sequel to The Lion King and takes place during the time-gap within The Lion King II: Simba's Pride.[122] It was first broadcast on Disney Channel as a television film titled The Lion Guard: Return of the Roar in November 2015 before airing as a series on Disney Junior in January 2016.[123][124]\\r\\nIn September 2016, following the critical and financial success of The Jungle Book, Walt Disney Pictures announced that they were developing a CGI remake of The Lion King by the same name, with Jon Favreau directing.[125] The following month, Jeff Nathanson was hired to write the script for the film.[126] Favreau originally planned shoot it back to back with the sequel to The Jungle Book.[125][127] However, it was reported in early 2017 that the latter film was put on hold in order for Favreau to instead focus mainly on The Lion King.[128] In February 2017, Favreau announced that Donald Glover had been cast as Simba and that James Earl Jones would be reprising the role of Mufasa.[129] The following month, it was reported that Beyonc was Favreau's top choice to voice Nala, but she had not accepted the role yet due to a pregnancy.[130] In April 2017, Billy Eichner and Seth Rogen joined the film as Timon and Pumbaa, respectively.[131] Two months later, John Oliver was cast as Zazu.[132] At the end of July 2017, Beyonc had reportedly entered final negotiations to play Nala and contribute the soundtrack as well.[133] The following month, Chiwetel Ejiofor entered talks to play Scar.[134] Later on, Alfre Woodard and John Kani joined the film as Sarabi and Rafiki, respectively.[135][136] On November 1, 2017, Beyonc and Chiwetel Ejiofor were officially confirmed to voice Nala and Scar with Eric Andre, Florence Kasumba, Keegan-Michael Key, J.D. McCrary and Shahadi Wright Joseph joining the cast as the voices of Azizi, Shenzi and Kamari, young Simba and young Nala, respectively while Hans Zimmer would return to score the film's music.[137][138][139][140][141]\\r\\nProduction for the film began in May 2017.[142] It is scheduled for release on July 19, 2019.[143]\\r\\nAlong with the film release, three different video games based on The Lion King were released by Virgin Interactive in December 1994. The main title was developed by Westwood Studios, and published for PC and Amiga computers and the consoles SNES and Sega Mega Drive/Genesis. Dark Technologies created the Game Boy version, while Syrox Developments handled the Master System and Game Gear version.[144] The film and sequel Simba's Pride later inspired another game, Torus Games' The Lion King: Simba's Mighty Adventure (2000) for the Game Boy Color and PlayStation.[145] Timon and Pumbaa also appeared in Timon & Pumbaa's Jungle Games, a 1995 PC game collection of puzzle games by 7th Level, later ported to the SNES by Tiertex.[146]\\r\\nThe Square Enix series Kingdom Hearts features Simba as a recurring summon,[147][148] as well as a playable in the Lion King world, known as Pride Lands, in Kingdom Hearts II. There the plotline is loosely related to the later part of the original film, with all of the main characters except Zazu and Sarabi.[149] The Lion King also provides one of the worlds featured in the 2011 action-adventure game Disney Universe,[150] and Simba was featured in the Nintendo DS title Disney Friends (2008).[151]\\r\\nWalt Disney Theatrical produced a musical stage adaptation of the same name, which premiered in Minneapolis, Minnesota in July 1997, and later opened on Broadway in October 1997 at the New Amsterdam Theatre. The Lion King musical was directed by Julie Taymor[152] and featured songs from both the movie and Rhythm of the Pride Lands, along with three new compositions by Elton John and Tim Rice. Mark Mancina did the musical arrangements and new orchestral tracks.[153] The musical became one of the most successful in Broadway history, winning six Tony Awards including Best Musical, and despite moving to the Minskoff Theatre in 2006, is still running to this day in New York, becoming the third longest-running show and highest grossing Broadway production in history. The show's financial success led to adaptations all over the world.[10][154][155]\\r\\nThe Lion King inspired two attractions retelling the story of the film at Walt Disney Parks and Resorts. The first, \\"The Legend of the Lion King\\", featured a recreation of the film through life-size puppets of its characters, and ran from 1994 to 2002 at Magic Kingdom in Walt Disney World.[156] Another that is still running is the live-action 30-minute musical revue of the movie, \\"Festival of the Lion King\\", which incorporates the musical numbers into gymnastic routines with live actors, along with animatronic puppets of Simba and Pumba and a costumed actor as Timon. The attraction opened in April 1998 at Disney World's Animal Kingdom,[157] and in September 2005 in Hong Kong Disneyland's Adventureland.[158] A similar version under the name \\"The Legend of the Lion King\\" was featured in Disneyland Paris from 2004 to 2009.[159][160]","input":"Where do most lions live in lion king?"},{"output":"Herkimer County, New York","context":"Old Forge is a hamlet (and census-designated place) on New York State Route 28 in the town of Webb in Herkimer County, New York.

As one of the western gateway communities of Adirondack Park, Old Forge forms an extensive business district, primarily directed at tourism especially during the summer months. The local school is the Town of Webb UFSD, a K-12 institution with the Eskimo as their mascot. Old Forge often records the lowest winter temperatures in New York.

The land was unsuitable for farming, these attempts failed, and the area was abandoned by 1803.\\r\\nIn 1811 John Brown's son-in-law Charles Frederick Herreshoff moved to the area and attempted to raise sheep, opened an iron mine, and built the first forge.

Cheese's is a chain of American family entertainment centers and restaurants. The chain is the primary brand of CEC Entertainment, Inc. and is headquartered in Irving, Texas.[1][2] The establishment serves pizza and other menu items, complemented by arcade games, amusement rides, and animatronic displays as a focus of entertainment for the entire family.[3] The brand derives its name from its main animatronic character Chuck E. Cheese, a comedic mouse who sings and interacts with guests.[3][4]\\r\\nChuck E. Cheese's Pizza Time Theatre in San Jose, California, was the first location to open on May 17, 1977.[5][6][7][8] The concept was authored by Atari co-founder Nolan Bushnell, credited with bringing video games such as Pong to the mainstream. The Pizza Time Theatre was the first family restaurant to integrate food, animated entertainment, and an indoor arcade.[3] Following a filing for bankruptcy, the chain was acquired by competitor Showbiz Pizza Place in 1984, forming Showbiz Pizza Time, Inc.[9] In 1990, the company began unifying the two brands with the goal of renaming every location to Chuck E. Cheese's Pizza.[10][11] They redesigned the logo in 1994, dropping Pizza from each store's name.[9] In 1998, Showbiz Pizza Time, Inc. became CEC Entertainment, Inc.[9] As of 2017, 523 Chuck E. Cheese stores are open.[1][2]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nChuck E. Cheeses Pizza Time Theatre was founded by Atari founder Nolan Bushnell, who was seeking to expand the purview of video game arcades beyond more adult locations like pool halls to a kid and family friendly venue.[3][12] Bushnells experience in the amusement park industry, as well as his fondness of The Walt Disney Company, was influential in the conceptualization of the Pizza Time Theatre concept.[13] The first location opened in San Jose, California in 1977, and was labeled as the first family restaurant to integrate food, cheap animated entertainment, and an indoor arcade.[3][9] In 1978, Bushnell purchased the Pizza Time Theatre concept from Atari's then-corporate parent, Warner Communications.[14] Gene Landrum then resigned from Atari and was made President and Chief Operating Officer of Chuck E. Cheese's Pizza Time Theatre.[15][16]\\r\\nBushnell has said of his decision to open a pizza restaurant, \\"It was my pet project...I chose pizza because of the wait time and the build schedule: very few components and not too many ways to screw it up.\\"[17] After finding out from employees working on the animatronics that the costume he bought was a rodent rather than the coyote he thought he was buying, Bushnell says he suggested changing the name of the establishment from the planned \\"Coyote Pizza\\" to \\"Rick Rat's Pizza\\". Marketing people disliked that and proposed \\"Chuck E. Cheese\\" instead, which is what was used.[18]\\r\\nTo expand beyond California and the west coast, Nolan began to franchise, resulting in a co-development agreement between himself and Robert Brock of Topeka Inn Management in 1979. The agreement handed Brock exclusive franchising rights for opening Pizza Time Theatres in sixteen states across the Southern and Midwestern United States,[14] while also forming a company subdivision, \\"Pizza Show Biz\\", to develop the Pizza Time Theatres.[14]\\r\\nIn November 1979, Brock met Aaron Fechter of Creative Engineering, Inc. Concerned that Fechter's animatronics would be too strong a competition for Bushnells work, Brock requested that Bushnell release him from the co-development agreement, citing misrepresentation.[14] In December 1979, Brock and Fechter formed Showbiz Pizza Place Inc, severing Brock's business relationship with Bushnell.[14][19] ShowBiz Pizza Place was conceptually identical to Pizza Time Theatre in all aspects except for animation, which would be provided by Creative Engineering.[14] Showbiz Pizza Place opened its first location on March 3, 1980, in Kansas City, Missouri.[9]\\r\\nUpon the opening of ShowBiz Pizza Place, Bushnell sued Brock and Topeka Inn Management over breach of contract.[14] Brock immediately issued a counter-suit against Bushnell, citing misrepresentation.[14] The court case began in March 1980, eventually settling out of court with Showbiz agreeing to pay Pizza Time Theatre a portion of its profits over the following decade.[14] During this period, Topeka Inn Management also changed its name to Brock Hotel Corporation and moved its headquarters to Irving, Texas.[14] Both restaurants experienced increased success as the video game industry became more robust,[14] and, to maintain competition, both franchises continually modified and diversified their animatronic shows.\\r\\nIn 1981, Pizza Time Theatre went public; however, the evolving video game industry and the video game crash of 1983 resulted in significant losses for Pizza Time Theatre, which lost $15 million in 1983, and by 1984, Bushnells debts were insurmountable, resulting in the filing of Chapter 11 bankruptcy for Pizza Time Theatre Inc.[9] Showbiz then bought the foundering company, recreating itself as Showbiz Pizza Time Inc.[9]\\r\\nAfter the merger, both restaurant chains continued operating under their respective titles, while major financial restructuring had begun.[9] During this period, Creative Engineering began to sever ties with ShowBiz Pizza Time (officially splitting in September 1990), resulting in the unification of the two brands. By 1992, all restaurants assumed the name of Chuck E. Cheeses Pizza.[10] The name was then shortened to Chuck E. Cheese's by March of 1995 after a redesigned concept.[9][20] In 1998, Showbiz Pizza Time renamed itself CEC Entertainment, Inc. to reflect the remaining chain brand.[2][9]\\r\\nIn the early 1980s, the restaurant franchise debuted in Australia under the name Charlie Cheese's Pizza Playhouse. The name change had to do with the common meaning of the word \\"chuck\\", which in Australia is a reference to the phrase \\"to throw up\\".[21] Pizza Time Theater also opened at least one restaurant in Hong Kong, which closed shortly thereafter as a result of the initial company's 1984 bankruptcy.[21]\\r\\nFurther locations were opened under the unified Chuck E. Cheese's brand in Chile, Colombia, Costa Rica, Guatemala, Honduras, Mexico, Panama, Peru, Saudi Arabia, Trinidad and Tobago, and United Arab Emirates.[22]\\r\\nThe company was supposed to open a branch in the Philippines at Glorietta but it was scrapped due to the discrepancies in the mall's design which standards of CEC locations must be followed. The location of the first branch is still being proposed.[23]\\r\\nIn February 2014, Apollo Global Management acquired CEC Entertainment, Inc. for $54 per share, or about $950 million.[24][25]\\r\\nIn August 2017, the company began to pilot a new design concept at seven remodeled locations (three in Kansas City, three in San Antonio, one in Selma, TX), branded as Chuck E. Cheese Pizzeria & Games. These locations feature more upscale decor with a \\"muted\\" interior color scheme, an open kitchen, the \\"Play Pass\\" card system to replace arcade tokens, and the animatronic stage show replaced by a dance floor area. These changes, along with expansions to food offerings, are intended to help the chain provide an experience that can appeal better to adult visitors, and encourage family dining as opposed to primarily parties.[26][27]\\r\\nWhile its primary focus is pizza, Chuck E. Cheese's also offers cold-cut sandwiches, chicken wings, salad bars and desserts. Some stores are also used as \\"test\\" locations which feature new Chuck E. Cheese foods.[28] Certain Chuck E. Cheese locations also offer beer and wine.[29]\\r\\nStarting on November 13, 2012, new gluten-free menu items are available at more than 500 locations in the U.S. and Canada. This currently includes a choice of a personal-size cheese pizza and new items such as chocolate or vanilla sheet cakes and cotton candy.[30]\\r\\nFrom the time of the company's inception to today, one of the main draws for the stores has been the arcade.[3][2] The arcade games primarily consist of either redemption games or video arcade games.[31]\\r\\nThe brass tokens issued by the company for use in their arcades exist in numerous varieties, and are collected by exonumia enthusiasts.[32] The company once tested a card access method for use with their arcade and skill games in one location. The test location would no longer use tokens, and instead use a refillable card to access credits, which replace tokens, and points, which replace tickets. However, this was later scrapped. It was tested under different names, including \\"Chuck E.'s Super Discount Card\\" and \\"Chuck E. Token Card\\".[33][34] This method is currently being tested in some markets again. Instead of electronic tickets like the former cards, Patrons still carry paper tickets and the card just take the place of the metal tokens. CECE, or CEC Entertainment, has called the new system \\"Play Pass\\".\\r\\nAlong with the arcade, the other main draw for the centers since the beginning was its animatronic show, until the mid-1990s. More recently, less attention has been placed on animatronics. However, there are now several different styles of animatronic shows in use within the company, depending on when the location opened, whether it was renovated, and other factors.[35]\\r\\nWhen the first location opened in 1977, the animatronic characters were featured in framed portraits hanging on the walls of the main dining area, but they are no longer in use today. The show featured Crusty The Cat (the first character to face retirement as he was soon replaced with Mr. Munch in 1978), Pasqually the singing chef, Jasper T. Jowls, the Warblettes, and the main focus of the show, Chuck E. Cheese.[36] Later, restaurants also added \\"Cabaret\\" shows in separate rooms of each restaurant.[3] They also frequently changed out the sole female character, named Helen Henny, in the main show. They achieved this by applying a cosmetic change to the existing robot, as well as a change of stage backdrop, to match the performer. The in-house control system which consisted of a 6502-based controller in a card cage with various driver boards was called \\"Cyberamics\\".[37][38]\\r\\nBeginning in 1998, the company's show installed into new stores, referred to as \\"Studio C\\", consists of a single animated Chuck E. Cheese character created by Garner Holt alongside large television monitors, lighting effects, and interactive elements[39]. The other characters appear as puppets on the TV screens. The control system dubbed \\"Cyberstar\\" was re-designed from the ground up and produced by Dave Philipsen. In some markets, the company has also tried a new store concept that omits the animated show entirely. This is the Circle of Lights stage which either consists of a live Chuck E. Cheese costume character or an animatronic in a futuristic light stage with large television monitors. In 2017, the Chuck E. Cheese announced that animatronic shows would be removed in favor of a modernized dance floor.[40] The move is being piloted in a handful of locations prior to being implemented company-wide.[40]\\r\\nThe members that performed in the animatronic shows were:[41]\\r\\nThere are two types of costumed shows used by Chuck E. Cheese's: the LIVE! show and the Road show. The LIVE! show is performed at the front of the stage in the showroom, whenever a child is celebrating a birthday. The live show is a way of pumping up the crowd before a customized rendition of \\"Happy Birthday\\" is sung to the child that is celebrating the birthday (\\"I say Happy, you say Birthday...\\"). A costumed Chuck E. Cheese dances with the guests and sings, while being accompanied by the cast members.[42] The Road show is a performance by a costumed Chuck E. Cheese character, and is performed outside the normal showroom. Children are gathered via the public announcement system or by Chuck E. Cheese himself. Chuck E. Cheese wants the kids to dance in order to win free tickets. The free tickets are thrown at the end of the performance for all the kids that participated. Chuck E. comes out every hour on the half hour (12:30, 1:30, etc.). The songs Chuck E. and the kids dance to are usually well-known classic songs such as \\"If You're Happy and You Know It\\" and \\"Head, Shoulders, Knees, and Toes\\".","input":"When was the first chuck e cheese opened?"},{"output":"10.80%","context":"Poverty in Canada remains prevalent within some segments of society and according to a 2008 report by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, the rate of poverty in Canada, is among the highest of the OECD member nations, the world's wealthiest industrialized nations.[1] There is no official government definition and therefore, measure, for poverty in Canada. However, Dennis Raphael, author of Poverty in Canada: Implications for Health and Quality of Life[2][3] reported that the United Nations Development Program, the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF), the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development and Canadian poverty researchers[notes 1][4] find that relative poverty is the \\"most useful measure for ascertaining poverty rates in wealthy developed nations such as Canada.\\"[1][5][6][7] In its report released the Conference Board.[8]\\r\\nCurrently, an income inequality measure known as low income cut-off (LICO) published by Statistics Canada is frequently used as a poverty rate and is 10.8% as of 2005.[9] The Central Intelligence Agency uses the LICO as the relative measure results in a higher poverty figure than an absolute one. The Fraser Institute, a conservative think-tank, alleges that the federal Canadian government exaggerates poverty rates, and publishes their own measure, known as the basic needs poverty measure. According to this measure, poverty has declined significantly over the past 60 years and is 4.9% as of 2004.[10][10] Statistics Canada has refused to endorse any metric as a measure of poverty, including the low-income cut off it publishes, without a mandate to do so from the federal government.\\r\\nSome elements that work towards reducing poverty in Canada include Canada's strong economic growth, government transfers to persons of $164 billion per annum as of 2008,[11] universal medical and public education systems, and minimum wage laws in each of the provinces and territories of Canada.\\r\\nIn recent times, after a spike in poverty and low-income rates around the 1996 recession, relative poverty has continued to decline. Certain groups experience higher low-income rates. These include children,[12] families with single-parent mothers, aboriginals, the mentally ill, the physically handicapped, recent immigrants,[13][14] and students.[citation needed]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCanada's history is marked by identified periods of growth and recession, and an evolving response of government intervention to assist low-income Canadians.\\r\\nReflecting the practice in the British Isles, organized assistance to the poor was largely the realm of churches.[15] In the early 20th century, the Catholic Encyclopedia reported that there were eighty-seven hospitals in Canada under the control and direction of various Catholic religious communities.[16]\\r\\nAfter the Great Depression, Bennett and Mackenzie King spurred the first stages of Canada's welfare state, and the size and role of the government began to grow immensely over the next decades. Many social programs developed during this time designed to increase the Canadian citizen's quality of life.\\r\\nAccording to one estimate, 15% of Canadians lived in poverty by 1961,[17] while at the end of the Sixties, Statistics Canada estimated that the number of Canadians living in poverty (using measurements drawn up by Jenny Podoluk) had fallen from about 25% of the population in 1961 to about 18% in 1969.[18] A Senate inquiry in 1969, however, estimated that as many as 1 in 4 Canadians were living in poverty that year.[19] From 1969 to 1982, the proportion of families with incomes below the poverty line fell from 20.8% to 13.9%.[20] According to one definition, nearly two-fifths of Canadians lived in poverty in 1951, falling slightly to more than one-fifth in 1961 and to slightly less than one-fifth by 1968.[21]\\r\\nIn recent years, newly arrived immigrants have higher than average low-income rates, although each immigrant arrival cohort year experiences a declining low-income rate over time.\\r\\nThe most widely discussed conceptual issue related to poverty is the definition of poverty, specifically the difference between absolute and relative poverty.[22][notes 2][5][23]\\r\\nCanada has no official poverty measure because Statistics Canada has stated that unless politicians express a social consensus on the definition of poverty, there will be no measure because they feel that it is not Statistics Canada's role to determine what constitutes a necessity.[24] There is a debate on whether an absolute or relative measure is more useful. An absolute measure of poverty can provide insight on deprivation, or the inability to provide for basic needs, while a relative measure of poverty encompasses the issues of social exclusion and inequality.[25]\\r\\nSome researchers and governments instead use multiple measures to measure the depth and extent of poverty in Canada.[26][27]\\r\\nThe basic needs approach is one of the major approaches to the measurement of absolute poverty in developing countries. It attempts to define the absolute minimum resources necessary for long-term physical well-being, usually in terms of consumption goods. The poverty line is then defined as the amount of income required to satisfy those needs. The 'basic needs' approach was introduced by the International Labour Organization's World Employment Conference in 1976.[28][29] \\"Perhaps the high point of the WEP was the World Employment Conference of 1976, which proposed the satisfaction of basic human needs as the overriding objective of national and international development policy. The basic needs approach to development was endorsed by governments and workers' and employers' organizations from all over the world. It influenced the programmes and policies of major multilateral and bilateral development agencies, and was the precursor to the human development approach.\\"[28][29]\\r\\nA traditional list of immediate \\"basic needs\\" is food (including water), shelter and clothing.[30] Many modern lists emphasize the minimum level of consumption of 'basic needs' of not just food, water, and shelter, but also sanitation, education, and healthcare. Different agencies use different lists.\\r\\nProfessor Chris Sarlo, an economist at Nipissing University in North Bay, Canada and a senior fellow of the Fraser Institute, uses Statistics Canada's socio-economic databases, particularly the Survey of Household Spending to determine the cost of a list of household necessities. This is calculated for various communities across Canada and adjusted for family size. Sarlo's basic needs measure is based on various data sources including Statistics Canada's databases (for example Survey of Household Spending) and CMHC housing information to determine the cost of a list of household necessities (food, shelter, clothing, health care, personal care, essential furnishings, transportation and communication, laundry, home insurance, and miscellaneous) for various communities across Canada and then, based on family size, determines how many households have insufficient income to afford those necessities. Before 2004, the determination of the poverty rate was based on pre-tax income inclusive of government social program income such as welfare, employment insurance, and old-age pensions. Taxes were not particularly relevant as households at or beneath the poverty rate would pay little or no income tax. More recently, the after-tax incomes have been used as the indicator of household well-being. Like most measures, it is based on reported income and is therefore subject to error related to unreported employment and the underground economy. With this information, he determines the proportion of Canadian households that have insufficient income to afford those necessities. Based on his basic needs poverty threshold, the poverty rate has declined from about 12% of Canadian households to about 5% since the 1970s.[31] Based on Sarlo's basic needs, the poverty rate in Canada has fallen dramatically over the past 51 years. In 2004 it was 4.9%, representing 1.6 million Canadians.[10]\\r\\nThe Government of Canada's Department of Human Resources and Skills Development Canada constructed their own absolute measure through the creation the Market Basket Measure (MBM) in 2003. The MBM costs a broader range of essential goods and services than the Fraser Institute measure.[32][33] MBM thresholds take into account community size, location and household and composition, estimating the disposable income required to meet basic needs.[34][35] Forty eight Canadian communities have been included in the measure.[27]\\r\\nThe government of Newfoundland and Labrador are now developing a market basket measure which is more granular, costing out a set of basic goods in over 400 communities in the province.[27]\\r\\nRelative poverty measures, the most prominent being income distribution measures, also known as income inequality metrics, reveal information about disparities of income within a population. So, for instance, if a society becomes richer, even those in the bottom income bands may see their incomes rise as well. A measure which accounts for this rise, increasing with the average income of the society, is known as a \\"relative measure of poverty.\\"[36] Relative poverty measures are considered by some to be the most useful for advanced industrial nations like Canada.[notes 3] According to a 2008 report by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), the rate of poverty in Canada, is among the highest of the OECD member nations, the world's wealthiest industrialized nations.[1] There is no official government definition and therefore, measure, for poverty in Canada. However, Dennis Raphael, author of Poverty in Canada: Implications for Health and Quality of Life[2][3] reported that the United Nations Development Program (UNDP), the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF), the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) and Canadian poverty researchers[notes 4][4] find that relative poverty is the \\"most useful measure for ascertaining poverty rates in wealthy developed nations such as Canada.\\"[1][5][6][7][8]\\r\\nIn lieu of an official poverty measure, the LICO is regarded as a poverty measure by various groups. It has been referred to as \\"the most accepted measure\\" of poverty.[37] Internationally, the Low Income Measure and the Gini coefficient are a prominent income distribution metrics.\\r\\nLow-income cut-off (LICO) rates are often quoted by the media as a measure of poverty[37] even though Statistics Canada has stated it is not a poverty measure.[24] It is also used by statistics collators like the Central Intelligence Agency in lieu of an official measure, although the CIA also notes that it \\"results in higher figures than found in many comparable economies.\\"[38]\\r\\nThe measure has been reported by Statistics Canada since the 1960s.[39] They were reported only in their \\"pre-tax\\" form until 2000, at which point Statistics Canada started to publish both pre and after-tax LICO rates. After-tax LICO rates have been retroactively calculated back to 1986. The measure is intended to represent an income threshold below which a family will likely devote a larger share of its income on the necessities of food shelter and clothing than the average family.[40] As of 2011, 8.8% of Canadians are in a family whose income is below the after-tax low-income cut-off.[41]\\r\\nThere are 7 family sizes and 5 community sizes, resulting in 35 total LICO groups, each one evaluated on a pre and after-tax basis (70 calculations in total). The LICO is currently set at 63% of the average family income within each group. This stems from the 1992 Family Expenditures Survey, which showed the average family spent 43% of its after-tax income on food, shelter and clothing, plus Statistics Canada added an additional 20% margin.\\r\\nStatistics Canada prefers using the after-tax LICO over the pre-tax LICO \\"to draw conclusions about [families] overall economic well-being\\";[42] however, the pre-tax measures are needed depending on the study being conducted because some sources of data, such as the census, contain only pre-tax income information. It can also be useful to know the pre-tax income profile of groups before the effects of progressive tax rates.\\r\\nThe Low Income Measure is a purer measure of relative income. It is defined as 50% of median income, adjusted for family size. In effect, this measure indicates the percentage or number of people in the bottom income quartile.\\r\\nIt is considered an especially useful measure for international comparisons, and is popular with anti-poverty groups and some foreign governments (e.g., Ireland).[36] It results in a higher measure of poverty compared to other measures. In 2011, it was estimated to be 12.6% on an after-tax basis.[41]\\r\\nThe Gini coefficient is a measure of statistical dispersion most prominently used as a measure of inequality of income distribution or inequality of wealth distribution. It is defined as a ratio with values between 0 and 1: the numerator is the area between the Lorenz curve of the distribution and the uniform distribution line; the denominator is the area under the uniform distribution line. Thus, a low Gini coefficient indicates more equal income or wealth distribution, while a high Gini coefficient indicates more unequal distribution. 0 corresponds to perfect equality (everyone having exactly the same income) and 1 corresponds to perfect inequality (where one person has all the income, while everyone else has zero income). The Gini coefficient requires that no one have a negative net income or wealth.\\r\\nSerious consideration of the Gini coefficient for public policy implications is rare in Canada. Discussion of income inequality in the Canadian media generally implies that income inequality should be continually reduced as an objective, whereas international economists evaluating Gini coefficients generally focus on the idea of targeting an optimal range for the Gini coefficient. Some researchers have suggested the optimal Gini coefficient range is about .25-.40 (Wolfgang Kitterer, 2006, More Growth through Redistribution?). As of 2004, the Gini coefficient for Canada was estimated to be 0.315 on an after-tax basis.[43]\\r\\nSeveral Canadian provinces are introducing poverty reduction strategies, following the examples set by the European Union, Ireland and the United Kingdom. Newfoundland & Labrador, Nova Scotia, Quebec, Ontario and Manitoba are all developing provincial strategies. Quebec and Manitoba have enshrined their efforts in legislation. Newfoundland & Labrador has established a provincial ministry. Ontario has set a cabinet roundtable to address child poverty, as per the Liberals's campaign promise.\\r\\nBecause of these moves, each province is exploring the development of a measurement tool to track any progress made on reducing poverty, such as the use of a Deprivation Index.\\r\\nAs of 2015, there is no federal plan to reduce poverty.\\r\\nAccording to a left-wing think tank, the Canadian Centre for Policy Alternatives, \\"Based on data from the 2006 census, this study found that the average child poverty rate for all children in Canada is 17%, while the average child poverty rate for all Indigenous children is more than twice that figure, at 40%.\\" \\"50%  of status First Nations children live below the poverty line. This number grows to 62% in Manitoba and 64% in Saskatchewan.\\"[44] The study referred to used the Low Income Measure as their definition for poverty, which always shows a high rate. Nonetheless, the much higher LIM statistics for indigenous families indicates a much higher level of poverty among that demographic.\\r\\nThe Canadian income tax system is highly progressive. This can be seen by comparing the 2005 pre-tax low-income cut-off rate of 15.3%[45] with the after-tax rate of only 10.8%.[46] It is also evident in the Gini coefficient, which was estimated to be 0.428 on a pre-tax basis but only 0.315 on an after-tax basis.[43] The Conference Board of Canada 2013 study noted the Canadian system provides relief to the poor which contributes to lowering poverty rates in Canada. Their 2013 report stated that without Canada's tax system and transfers, the poverty rate would have been 23 per cent not the current 12 per cent.[4]\\r\\nThe Conference Board of Canada 2013 study noted \\"that due to the tax system and transfers to the poor, income inequality is 27 per cent lower than it otherwise would be.\\"[4] Canada has a wide range of government transfers to persons, which totaled $176.6 billion in 2009.[11] Some of the transfers designed to assist low-income people in Canada include Welfare and Old age security. There is also an extensive mandatory Employment Insurance program designed to assist workers who have become unemployed to lessen the chance of them falling into poverty.\\r\\nIn addition to government transfers, there are number of other publicly funded services and social programs that benefit those with low-incomes like Medicare, Public education for grade school; subsidized post-secondary education, Subsidized housing, and Employment equity programs, which often target various groups of people who are deemed to be susceptible to having low-incomes.\\r\\nThe WITB was introduced in 2007 to encourage low income people to enter the labour force, and to provide them with increased financial support. The WITB has been expanded considerably since its introduction. As of 2012, it is worth up to $970 for a single individual, $1762 for couples and single parent families.[47] A person or couple must have at least $3,000 in employment income, and not be a student, to be eligible for WITB. Benefits increase, and then decrease, with income, and are completely clawed back at an income of $11,011 for singles, $15,205 for couples or single parents (in 2012).These credits are not taxed (see Income taxes in Canada#Income not taxed).\\r\\nLow-income Canadians are eligible for the Canada Child Tax Benefit (a federal benefit), and provincial child tax credits or benefits and Qubec family allowances. For example, Ontario pays a benefit scheduled to grow to $180 per month by 2011 for a family earnings less than $20,000 with two children.[48] These credits are not taxed (see Income taxes in Canada#Income not taxed).\\r\\nUnder the Constitution of Canada, the responsibility for enacting and enforcing labour laws including minimum wages in Canada rests with the ten provinces, the three territories also having been granted this power by virtue of federal legislation. This means that each province and territory has its own minimum wage. The lowest general minimum wage currently in force is that of the Northwest Territories ($10.00/hour), the highest is that of Nunavut and Ontario ($11.50/hour).[49] Some provinces allow lower wages to be paid to liquor servers and other tip earners, and/or to inexperienced employees\\r\\nAlthough listed here under assistance, some theories suggest that minimum wage laws are a net detriment to low-income people as a whole, because they reduce the attractiveness of hiring low-skilled staff (see Minimum wage#Debate over consequences).","input":"What is considered below the poverty line in canada?"},{"output":"a phrase used to describe leading professional services firms in the United States, particularly firms that have been in existence for more than a century and represent Fortune 500 companies","context":"White-shoe firm is a phrase used to describe leading professional services firms in the United States, particularly firms that have been in existence for more than a century and represent Fortune 500 companies.

The term historically had antisemitic connotations, as many of the New York firms known as \\"white shoe\\" were considered off-limits to Jewish lawyers until the 1960s.[3][4] The phrase has since lost some of this connotation, but is still defined by Princeton University's WordNet as \\"denoting a company or law firm owned and run by members of the WASP elite who are generally conservative,\\" which shows that the original connotation has not changed entirely.[5] A 2010 column in The Economist described the term as synonymous with \\"big, old, east-coast and fairly traditional.\\"[6] In the 21st century, the term is sometimes used in a general sense to refer to firms that are perceived as prestigious or high-quality; it is also sometimes used in a derogatory manner to denote stodginess, elitism, or a lack of diversity.[3]\\r\\nA similar term in Australia, \\"white shoe brigade\\", has been used in the past to describe a group of Queensland property developers who backed, and benefitted from, former Queensland State Premier Sir Joh Bjelke-Petersen.[7] The term is a contemptuous allusion to the lower social class antecedents of such men, revealed by their gaudy and tasteless choice of clothing, which included brightly coloured or patterned shirts, slacks with white stripes or in pastel shades, and shoes and belts of white leather, these often having gold or gilt buckles.

It was followed by four TV films. Among the most successful and longest-running television shows in history, it averaged more than 30 million viewers per week in its prime (sometimes hitting above 40 million viewers), and was a staple of the CBS Sunday night lineup for a decade.[6] In syndication, the series is still highly successful throughout the world.\\r\\n\\r\\nLansbury was nominated for ten Golden Globes and 12 Emmy Awards for her work on Murder, She Wrote. She holds the record for the most Golden Globe nominations and wins for Best Actress in a television drama series and the most Emmy nominations for Outstanding Lead Actress in a Drama Series for Murder, She Wrote, with those nominations netting her four Golden Globe awards. The series received three nominations in the Outstanding Drama Series category at the Emmys. It was nominated for a Golden Globe in the same category six times and won twice.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter the series finished in 1996, four TV movies were released between 1997 and 2003. In 2009, a point-and-click video game was released for the PC platform,[7] followed in 2012 by a sequel.[8] A spin-off book series continues publication at present.\\r\\n\\r\\nSeries producers Peter S. Fischer, Richard Levinson and William Link thought Lansbury would be perfect for the part of Jessica Fletcher but did not think that she would be interested in a television series. Earlier, she had acted in two film adaptations of Agatha Christie's mystery novels: as Salome Otterbourne in Death on the Nile and as the famous sleuth Miss Marple in The Mirror Crack'd (1980). When the latter film did poorlydespite an all star cast including Rock Hudson, Elizabeth Taylor, Kim Novak, and Tony Curtisthe offer for Lansbury to reprise Miss Marple in three more films never materialized.[9]\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen she made it known she would be available if the right project came along, the trio of creators sent her the script and almost immediately, Lansbury felt she could do something with the role of Jessica Fletcher. With Murder, She Wrote debuting on Sunday, September 30, 1984, the producers were able to parlay their \\"mystery writer/amateur detective\\" premise into a 12-year hit for CBS. It also made Lansbury, known previously for her motion picture and Broadway stage work, a household name for millions of television viewers. The title comes from Murder, She Said, which was the title of a 1961 film adaptation of Agatha Christie's Miss Marple novel 4:50 from Paddington.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe show revolves around the day-to-day life of Jessica Fletcher, a childless, widowed, retired English teacher who becomes a successful mystery writer. Despite fame and fortune, Jessica remains a resident of Cabot Cove, a small coastal community in Maine, and maintains her links with all of her old friends, never letting her success go to her head. Exterior shots of Cabot Cove were filmed in Mendocino, California. The fictional \\"Cabot Cove\\" name for the series' coastal town was derived from the name of an actual bay harbor inlet in Kennebunkport, Maine, located near the town's center, on the road where motels and lobster shack dives are located.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe show mostly starts with a preview of the episode's events, with Jessica stating: \\"Tonight on Murder, She Wrote...\\" Jessica invariably proves more perceptive than the official investigators of a case, who are almost always willing to arrest the most likely suspect. By carefully piecing the clues together and asking astute questions, she always manages to trap the real murderer. Murder occurred with such regularity in her vicinity that the term \\"Cabot Cove syndrome\\" was coined to describe the constant appearance of dead bodies in remote locations. Indeed, if Cabot Cove existed in real life, it would top the FBI's national crime statistics in numerous categories, with some analysis suggesting that the homicide rate in Cabot Cove exceeds even that of the real-life murder capital of the world.[10]\\r\\n\\r\\nJessica's relationship with law enforcement officials varies from place to place. Both sheriffs of Cabot Cove resign themselves to having her meddle in their cases. However, most detectives and police officers do not want her anywhere near their crime scenes, until her accurate deductions convince them to listen to her. Some are happy to have her assistance from the start, often because they are fans of her books. With time, she makes friends in many police departments across the U.S., as well as with a British police officer attached to Scotland Yard. At the start of season eight, more of the stories were set in New York City with Jessica moving into an apartment there part-time in order to teach criminology.\\r\\n\\r\\nSome programmes appeared to allegorise contemporaneous events.  For example, the Season 5 (1988ÿ89) Episode (No. 102) \\"From Russia With Blood\\" could represent the Soviet Union's beginnings on introducing Glasnost and Perestroika.[11]\\r\\n\\r\\nBy August 1988, when Lansbury expressed weariness of her commitment, the series was expected to end in May 1989. Nevertheless, she continued in the role, with a few changes made. For the next two seasons, Lansbury reduced her appearances in several episodes, only appearing at the beginning and the end, to introduce stories starring several friends of Jessica, like PI Harry McGraw, reformed thief Dennis Stanton or MI5 agent Michael Hagarty. The \\"experiment\\" ended in 1991.[12]\\r\\n\\r\\nBy the end of the 1994ÿ95 season, Murder, She Wrote's 11th season, CBS moved the network's then-longest-running weekly series to Thursday nights at 8 p.m. This put the series in direct competition with the first hour of NBC's Must See TV lineup, which had been drawing the highest ratings of the week for any network for years. Despite protests of many of the show's fans (who believed CBS was intentionally setting the show up to fail in its new timeslot), CBS refused to budge on the new timeslot. Murder, She Wrote plummeted from eighth to 58th in the yearly ratings; the series lost nearly 6 million viewers as the audience was not willing to follow it to Thursday, which left CBS with little choice but to end Murder, She Wrote after 12 seasons in August 1996.\\r\\n\\r\\nTo soften the blow, the network agreed to air the final four episodes in its original Sunday night timeslot, as well as commission four Murder, She Wrote movies over the next few years: the first was South by Southwest (1997), with three more following as A Story to Die For (2000), The Last Free Man (2001), and The Celtic Riddle (2003).[13]\\r\\n\\r\\nLansbury stated in May 2011 that she would like to make a comeback appearance as Jessica Fletcher.[14]\\r\\n\\r\\nHowever, in a 2015 interview, Lansbury quashed the idea of reprising the much beloved character stating, \\"I think it would be a downer. In some way, wed have to show her as a much older woman, and I think its better to maintain that picture we have in our minds eye of her as a vigorous person. Im still pretty vigorous, especially in the garden  but if I wanted to transform myself back into the woman I looked like then, it would be ridiculous. And I can't do that.\\"[15] She then expressed interest in revisiting the character again in 2017.[16]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Third Season episode of Murder, She Wrote entitled \\"Magnum on Ice\\" concludes a crossover that began on the Seventh Season Magnum, P.I. episode \\"Novel Connection\\". In the episode's plot, Jessica comes to Hawaii to investigate an attempt to murder Robin Masters' guests, then tries to clear Magnum when he's accused of killing the hitman. The Magnum, P.I. episode originally aired on 11/19/86 with the concluding Murder, She Wrote episode following four days later on 11/23/86.[citation needed]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Magnum, P.I. episode of the crossover is included on the Murder, She Wrote Season 3 DVD set, as well as the Complete Series Set. The Magnum, P.I. Season 7 DVD set, as well as its Complete Series set, includes the Murder, She Wrote episode.[citation needed]\\r\\n\\r\\nOver its twelve-year run Murder, She Wrote received numerous award nominations. Lansbury herself holds the record for the most Emmy nominations for outstanding lead actress in a drama series with twelve, one for each season. She never won, which is also a record. Mary Dodson, the art director for 102 of the series' 264 episodes, received three Emmy nominations for her work on Murder, She Wrote.[18]\\r\\n\\r\\nMurder, She Wrote maintained extremely high ratings finishing in the top 15 of shows for eleven of its 12 seasons (eight of which it was in the top 10), even well into its late seasons. By its 11th season, Murder, She Wrote was still averaging 25 million viewers per week. At its very peak, the show even hit above 40 million US viewers. However, at the beginning of its 12th season in 1995, CBS moved the show from its extremely popular Sunday night time slot to Thursday night forcing it to compete with NBC's Must See TV line up, and as a result the ratings plummeted. The show rated as the following:\\r\\n\\r\\nDeadline Hollywood reported in October 2013 that NBC was planning a reboot of the series, starring Oscar-winning actress Octavia Spencer as a \\"hospital administrator and amateur sleuth who self-publishes her first mystery novel.\\"[32]\\r\\n\\r\\nLansbury commented that she was not a fan of using the title, saying \\"I think it's a mistake to call it 'Murder, She Wrote,' because 'Murder, She Wrote' will always be about Cabot Cove and this wonderful little group of people who told those lovely stories and enjoyed a piece of that place, and also enjoyed Jessica Fletcher, who is a rare and very individual kind of person.\\" Early on it was decided by producers that Spencer's character would not be named Jessica Fletcher, for only Lansbury could play Jessica Fletcher.[33] It was announced on January 21, 2014, that the reboot would not be going forward.[34]\\r\\n\\r\\nSince its original run on CBS, Murder, She Wrote has been syndicated in many countries around the world.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1985, Warren Company released a Murder, She Wrote board game. In the game, one player takes the hidden role of a killer and the other players try to determine which player is the killer through deduction.  The killer is successful if he or she can kill five of the characters on the game-board and escape, while the detective players win by correctly deducing the identity of the killer.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn December 2009, casual game developer and publisher Legacy Interactive, under license with Universal Pictures Digital Platforms Group (UPDPG), announced the release a PC and Macintosh video game based on the television series. In the game, players help Jessica Fletcher to solve five unusual murders.[38][39] A sequel, Murder She Wrote 2, was launched by Legacy Interactive in November 2012.[40]","input":"When did jessica fletcher moved to new york?"},{"output":"the California Highway Patrol (CHP, hence the name CHiPs)","context":"CHiPs is an American television drama series that originally aired on NBC from September 15, 1977, to May 1, 1983. CHiPs followed the lives of two motorcycle police officers of the California Highway Patrol (CHP). The series ran for 139 episodes over six seasons, plus one reunion TV movie from October 27, 1998.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHiPs is an action crime dramedy. Over-the-top freeway pileups, which occurred frequently, especially in the later seasons, were a signature of the show. There was little violence on CHiPs, and the show can be classified as a light drama. The episodes filled a standard hour-long time slot, which at the time required 48 minutes of actual programming. For filming, traffic on Los Angeles freeways was non-existent and most chase scenes were done on back roads, usually dirt roads.\\r\\nThe show was created by Rick Rosner, and starred Erik Estrada as macho, rambunctious Officer Francis (\\"Frank\\") Llewellyn \\"Ponch\\" Poncherello and Larry Wilcox as his straitlaced partner, Officer Jonathan (\\"Jon\\") Andrew Baker. With Ponch the more trouble-prone of the pair, and Jon generally the more level-headed one trying to keep him out of trouble with the duo's gruff yet fatherly commanding officer Sergeant Joseph Getraer (Robert Pine), the two were Highway Patrolmen of the Central Los Angeles office of the California Highway Patrol (CHP, hence the name CHiPs).\\r\\nAs real-life CHP motor officers rarely ride in pairs, in early episodes this was explained away by placing the trouble-prone Ponch on probationary status, with Jon assigned as his field training officer. Eventually, by the end of the first season, this subplot faded away (Ponch completed his probation) as audiences were used to seeing the two working as a team.\\r\\nIn the fifth season (1981ÿ82), Estrada went on strike over a dispute over syndication profits. As a result, he did not appear in seven episodes; for that period he was replaced by Jenner (Officer Steve McLeish).[1][2]\\r\\nDespite their successful pairing on-screen, Wilcox and Estrada did not always get along behind the camera.[3] However, it was Wilcox's falling-out with the producers over what he saw as continual favoritism toward Estrada that saw Wilcox not return for the sixth and final season. Wilcox was replaced by Tom Reilly (Officer Bobby Nelson).\\r\\nBruce Penhall, a native of Balboa Island, Newport Beach and a Motorcycle speedway rider who had won the 1981 and 1982 Speedway World Championships, was also introduced as cadetÿprobationary officer Bruce Nelson, Bobby's younger brother in 1982ÿ83. The season 6 episode \\"Speedway Fever\\" (aired November 7, 1982) centered on Penhall's character Nelson winning the 1982 Speedway World Final at the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum, with scenes filmed in the pits during the meeting. The episode also used television coverage of the final (with dubbed commentary). Penhall later admitted that having a bodyguard and having to have makeup done in the pits in full view of his competitors at the World Final only added to the pressure he was under both as a rider and a rookie actor and that it felt weird having to \\"buddy up to Ponch\\" in front of the other riders while the World Final was taking place. In order to become a full-time member of the CHiPs cast, Penhall had officially announced his retirement from speedway racing on the podium of the 1982 World Final.\\r\\nEstrada apparently did not approve of Reilly's work ethic[citation needed] and was very displeased with Reilly's real life arrest by the Los Angeles Police Department (LAPD) for possession of controlled substances during a traffic stop. As a result, Bobby was featured somewhat less prominently in later episodes of the season, with Bruce becoming Ponch's partner in the third to last episode, \\"Fast Company.\\"\\r\\nAccording to a 1998 TV Guide article, show creator Rick Rosner was a reserve deputy with the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department.[citation needed] During a coffee break on an evening patrol shift in the mid-1970s he saw two young CHP officers on motorcycles which gave him the idea for this series. He later created 240-Robert, which seemed like a hybrid of CHiPs and Emergency!.[citation needed]\\r\\nEpisodes occasionally reference Jon Baker's service in Vietnam. This makes his character one of the earliest regular (and one of the more positive) portrayals of a Vietnam veteran on television.[citation needed] Larry Wilcox served 13?months in Vietnam as a Marine artilleryman.\\r\\nDespite the Ford Motor Company's credit as a vehicle provider for nearly 4?of the series' 6?seasons, cars and trucks were supplied by several manufacturers; many of the police cars seen were Dodge models.\\r\\nAlthough doubles were used for far-off shots and various stunt or action sequences, Wilcox and Estrada did a great deal of their own motorcycle riding, and performed many smaller stunts themselves. Although Wilcox emerged relatively injury-free, Estrada suffered various injuries several times throughout the run of the series. In several early first season episodes, a huge bruise or scar can be seen on his arm after he was flung from one of the motorcycles and skidded along the ground. But his worst accident came when he was seriously injured in a motorcycle accident while filming a season three episode in August 1979, fracturing several ribs and breaking both wrists. The accident and Estrada's subsequent hospitalization was incorporated into the series' storyline.\\r\\nPrior to being cast in CHiPs Estrada had no experience with motorcycles, so he underwent an intensive eight-week course, learning how to ride. In 2007 it was revealed that he did not hold a motorcycle license at the time CHiPs was in production, and only qualified for a license after three attempts, while preparing for an appearance on the reality television show Back to the Grind.\\r\\nEstrada and Wilcox never drew their firearms over the course of the series. (This did occur in \\"National Lampoon's Loaded Weapon 1\\" and in the made-for-TV reunion movie CHiPs '99.) The only character on the series depicted as drawing his firearm was Baricza (Brodie Greer), and he did so three times. The first was his radio car's Ithaca 37 shotgun in season 1's episode \\"Rainy Day\\",[4] where the CHiPs conduct a felony traffic stop of a motorhome-based casino.[5] The second was in season 2's premiere, \\"Peaks and Valleys\\", against two hillbillies armed with a Tommy-gun and a double-barrel shotgun who had ambushed his unattended patrol car for fun. Here the action was only implied, with his hand motion just below camera range. The last was in season 4's \\"Karate\\", in which a karate-trained car burglar (Danny Bonaduce) attacked him with a B, but Baricza drew his gun to stop Bonaduce.\\r\\nNBC aired reruns of this series on its 1982 daytime schedule from April to September.\\r\\nDuring the original run of the series, syndicated reruns of older episodes were retitled CHiPs Patrol to avoid confusion.[6] Later syndicated reruns after the show went out of production reverted to the original title.\\r\\nCHiPs episodes were usually a combination of light comedy and drama. A typical episode would start with Ponch and Jon on routine patrol or being assigned to an interesting beat, such as Malibu or the Sunset Strip. In roll call briefing, Sgt. Getraer would alert his officers to be on the lookout for a particular criminal operation, such as people staging accidents as part of an insurance scam or punks breaking into cars. A few interesting, unrelated vignettes often transpired during \\"routine\\" traffic enforcement.\\r\\nA light-hearted subplot would also be included, such as Harlan trying to hide a stray dog from Getraer at the office. A more serious theme, such as Ponch trying to keep a kid from his old neighborhood out of a potential life of crime, might also be included. After a few failed attempts to apprehend the gang that had been menacing L.A.'s freeways, the episode would invariably culminate in Ponch and Jon leading a chase of the suspects (often assisted by other members of their division), climaxing with a spectacular series of stunt vehicle crashes.\\r\\nThe show then typically featured a dnouement of Ponch and Jon participating in a new activity (such as jet skiing or skydiving), designed to showcase the pair's glamorous Southern California lifestyle. Often, Ponch would attempt to impress a woman he had met during the episode with his athletic prowess or disco dancing, only to fail and provide Jon, Getraer, and others with many laughs. As the preliminary end credits would start, the image would freeze multiple times, showing various characters laughing or otherwise enjoying the social scene.\\r\\nSome of the more outlandish plots included Ponch and his Season 6 partner Bobby Nelson helping a girl who believed that she was being targeted by UFOs and them racing against time to defuse a battery about to explode on an intelligent experimental police robot.\\r\\nCHP Officers almost never drew their guns in the series; in the TV Movie however, guns were used more prominently, especially in one of the final scenes in which Jon and McFall are held hostage on a tour bus, the entire CHP are shown holding guns at the bus.\\r\\n(all times Eastern/Pacific Time; subtract one hour for Central/Mountain Time)\\r\\nNBC aired reruns of the series weekdays at 3PM EST between April 26, 1982 ÿ September 10, 1982 Currently the show airs on Me-TV.\\r\\nIn the United Kingdom, the series was broadcast by ITV but was not simulcast nationally. The series started in January 1979 in the London region, but began with Season Two (the first episode shown was episode 2x02 \\"The Volunteers\\") by February most other ITV regions originally screened in the Saturday tea-time slot around 17:35 but moved to the Sunday teatime slot in 1980. By 1981, as with many imported programmes of the era, the series was being broadcast at different times during the weekend throughout the year by the different ITV regions. The series shared its Saturday teatime slot with other series such as The A-Team, Knight Rider, Magnum, P.I. and Whiz Kids.\\r\\nDuring 1984, most ITV station continued with the Saturday teatime slot except for Anglia Television, Scottish Television (STV) and Television South West (TSW), who broadcast episodes during the weekend mornings or Sunday afternoons. By early 1985, the series was being broadcast during Saturday mornings by Anglia, Central, Grampian, Granada, STV and Tyne Tees, who all completed the series by end of the 1985. HTV and Yorkshire completed the series by 1986, while LWT, TVS and TSW finished series six in 1987 after starting in 1985. A few companies repeated the series in 1987.\\r\\nThe entire series was shown in New Zealand on TVNZ in the 1980s.\\r\\nCHiPs debuted in France on channel Antenne 2 as an eight-episode mini-series beginning September 18, 1983 at 2:25pm. The episodes included in the mini-series are from season 1 and 2. On April 24, 1986, CHiPs began airing on La Cinq at 8pm. La Cinq aired the first two seasons until August 28, 1987. On May 30, 1988, CHiPs began airing on TF1, showing all episodes of the series.[7]\\r\\nWarner Home Video released the first two seasons of CHiPs on DVD in Regions 1,?2?&?4 between 2007/2008. On March 3, 2015 (over 6?years later), the third season was released on DVD in Region 1.[8] The fourth season was released in Region 1 on March 15, 2016.[9] The fifth season was released in Region 1 on March 14, 2017.[10][11][12] The sixth season and the complete series were released in Region 1 on June 6, 2017.[13]\\r\\nAll 139 episodes are at the iTunes Store.[14][15]\\r\\nCHiPs '99 is a 1998 made-for-television film and a sequel to the series. It was directed by Jon Cassar. Several cast members from the original series make a return. Original cast with promotions were Jon Baker as a Captain and Joe Getraer as the CHP Commissioner. Other original cast members were Officer Frank Poncherello returning from a 15-year hiatus with the CHP, Officer Barry Baricza and Arthur (Artie) \\"Grossie\\" Grossman as a Detective. Bruce Penhall also returns as newly promoted Sergeant Bruce Nelson.\\r\\nIn 2005, a theatrical release motion picture version of the show was announced, starring Wilmer Valderrama as Ponch,[16] though as of 2013 this production was still \\"stalled\\".[17] Erik Estrada and Larry Wilcox were rumored to make cameo appearances. In a 2002 episode of MADtv, Valderrama and fellow That '70s Show cast member Danny Masterson were featured in two parodies of CHiPs, which featured the two actors as Ponch and Baker respectively. Mila Kunis also appeared in the second sketch. In a 2002 episode of That '70s Show, Valderrama's character, Fez, was seen in the \\"most likely\\" section of the yearbook as \\"most likely to appear as Ponch in a musical version of CHiPs\\".\\r\\nOn September 2, 2014, Warner Bros. Pictures announced a film adaptation of the show, which Andrew Panay would be producing along with Dax Shepard.[18] Shepard will also write, direct and star in the film as Officer Jon Baker; Michael Pe?a will play Frank \\"Ponch\\" Poncherello while Vincent DOnofrio is in negotiations to play the villain.[19][20]\\r\\nA series of 3?3?4\\" action figures was released by Mego in the late 1970s. Due to the materials used to construct the figures, many of them have discolored (typically turning green) or started to decompose over the years, making good conditioned examples quite hard to find on the collectors market.[citation needed] There was also a series of six die-cast model vehicles produced by Imperial Toys.\\r\\nIn the UK, as was common with many popular US series of the era, a series of tie-in annuals were produced by World International Publishing Ltd, containing stories, photos, puzzles and features on the stars. There are four annuals in total, one each for 1980ÿ83.[citation needed]\\r\\nIn 2006, a limited edition soundtrack was released on CD by Turner Classic Movies' music division via Film Score Monthly, featuring the original recordings of the main theme by John Parker (Parker's theme replaced an unused composition by Mike Post and Pete Carpenter, who scored the pilot) and in-episode musical scores from many episodes of the second season, as composed and conducted by Alan Silvestri, the series' primary (and from seasons three to five sole) composer until the final season. Silvestri also arranged the theme as heard from season two onwards, and it is this version that is heard here??the soundtrack album also includes the \\"Trick or Treat\\" score composed and conducted by Bruce Broughton, his only work for the series.[21] In 2008, music from the third season was released; an album of music from the fourth season followed in 2010.\\r\\nIn the Galactica 1980 episode \\"The Super Scouts, Part I\\", a California Highway Patrol motor officer references CHiPs by lamenting to his partner, \\"How come this never happens to those two guys on TV?\\" when the two Colonial Warriors, Captain Troy (Kent McCord) and Lieutenant Dillon (Barry Van Dyke), escape the CHP duo by using flying motorcycles.[22]\\r\\nThe alternative rock band Seven Mary Three gets its name from Jon's call sign.[23]\\r\\nBoth Estrada and Wilcox reprised their roles in the 1993 film National Lampoon's Loaded Weapon 1.\\r\\nThe show was referenced in the Hawaii Five-0 episode \\"He Kane Hewa?ole\\" (An Innocent Man), in which cops pursue a suspect on the Kamehameha Highway and discover a severed head inside the suspect's car, sparking a murder investigation.\\r\\nThe 2014 Walt Disney Pictures film Planes: Fire & Rescue features a parody TV series titled CHoPs, with Estrada providing the voice of helicopter officer Nick \\"Loop'n\\" Lopez.[24]\\r\\nOn February 2, 2014, Estrada reprised his role as Ponch in the RadioShack Super Bowl XLVIII commercial \\"The '80s Called\\".[25]","input":"What does c h i p s stand for?"},{"output":"when British Columbia joined the Canadian Confederation in 1871","context":"","input":"When did victoria became the capital of bc?"},{"output":"Alex Rodriguez","context":"The highest paid player in Major League Baseball (MLB) from the 2013 season is New York Yankees' third baseman Alex Rodriguez with an annual salary of $29,000,000, $4 million higher than the second-highest paid player, Cliff Lee. MLB does not have a hard salary cap, instead employing a luxury tax which applies to teams whose total payroll exceeds certain set thresholds for a given season.[1][2] Free agency did not exist in MLB prior to the end of the reserve clause in the 1970s, allowing owners before that time to wholly dictate the terms of player negotiations and resulting in significantly lower salaries. Babe Ruth, widely regarded as one of the greatest baseball players ever, earned an estimated $910,696 ($14,654,832 inflation-adjusted from 1931 dollars) over his entire playing career.[3] When asked whether he thought he deserved to earn $80,000 a year ($1,171,952 inflation-adjusted), while the president, Herbert Hoover, had a $75,000 salary, Ruth famously remarked, \\"What the hell has Hoover got to do with it? Besides, I had a better year than he did.\\"[4][5]\\r\\nRodriguez has signed two record-breaking contracts over the course of his career.

Their team payroll for 2013 was $228,835,490, roughly $12 million above the second-largest Los Angeles Dodgers.[12] The Yankees have drawn criticism for their payroll, with some claiming it undermines the parity of MLB.[13][14]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThis table refers to the salary for 2017 alone, not the overall average value of the contract.\\r\\nNew York Yankees\\r\\nHouston Astros","input":"Who is the most paid player in mlb?"},{"output":"chicken","context":"Orange chicken (simplified Chinese: z; traditional Chinese: ѕ; pinyin: chnghu jؐ; Jyutping: caang2 faa1 gai1) is a Chinese dish of Hunan origin.[1]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe variety of orange chicken most commonly found at North American Chinese restaurants consists of chopped, battered, and fried chicken pieces coated in a sweet orange-flavored chili sauce, which thickens or caramelizes to a glaze.

He wrote the first web browser computer program in 1990 while employed at CERN in Switzerland.[2][3] The Web browser was released outside CERN in 1991, first to other research institutions starting in January 1991 and to the general public on the Internet in August 1991.\\r\\nThe World Wide Web has been central to the development of the Information Age and is the primary tool billions of people use to interact on the Internet.[4][5][6] Web pages are primarily text documents formatted and annotated with Hypertext Markup Language (HTML).[7] In addition to formatted text, web pages may contain images, video, audio, and software components that are rendered in the user's web browser as coherent pages of multimedia content.\\r\\nEmbedded hyperlinks permit users to navigate between web pages. Multiple web pages with a common theme, a common domain name, or both, make up a website. Website content can largely be provided by the publisher, or interactively where users contribute content or the content depends upon the users or their actions. Websites may be mostly informative, primarily for entertainment, or largely for commercial, governmental, or non-governmental organisational purposes.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nTim Berners-Lee's vision of a global hyperlinked information system became a possibility by the second half of the 1980s. By 1985, the global Internet began to proliferate in Europe and the Domain Name System (upon which the Uniform Resource Locator is built) came into being. In 1988 the first direct IP connection between Europe and North America was made and Berners-Lee began to openly discuss the possibility of a web-like system at CERN.[8] In March 1989 Berners-Lee issued a proposal to the management at CERN for a system called \\"Mesh\\" that referenced ENQUIRE, a database and software project he had built in 1980, which used the term \\"web\\" and described a more elaborate information management system based on links embedded in readable text: \\"Imagine, then, the references in this document all being associated with the network address of the thing to which they referred, so that while reading this document you could skip to them with a click of the mouse.\\" Such a system, he explained, could be referred to using one of the existing meanings of the word hypertext, a term that he says was coined in the 1950s. There is no reason, the proposal continues, why such hypertext links could not encompass multimedia documents including graphics, speech and video, so that Berners-Lee goes on to use the term hypermedia.[9]\\r\\nWith help from his colleague and fellow hypertext enthusiast Robert Cailliau he published a more formal proposal on 12 November 1990 to build a \\"Hypertext project\\" called \\"WorldWideWeb\\" (one word) as a \\"web\\" of \\"hypertext documents\\" to be viewed by \\"browsers\\" using a clientÿserver architecture.[10] At this point HTML and HTTP had already been in development for about two months and the first Web server was about a month from completing its first successful test. This proposal estimated that a read-only web would be developed within three months and that it would take six months to achieve \\"the creation of new links and new material by readers, [so that] authorship becomes universal\\" as well as \\"the automatic notification of a reader when new material of interest to him/her has become available.\\" While the read-only goal was met, accessible authorship of web content took longer to mature, with the wiki concept, WebDAV, blogs, Web 2.0 and RSS/Atom.[11]\\r\\nThe proposal was modelled after the SGML reader Dynatext by Electronic Book Technology, a spin-off from the Institute for Research in Information and Scholarship at Brown University. The Dynatext system, licensed by CERN, was a key player in the extension of SGML ISO 8879:1986 to Hypermedia within HyTime, but it was considered too expensive and had an inappropriate licensing policy for use in the general high energy physics community, namely a fee for each document and each document alteration. A NeXT Computer was used by Berners-Lee as the world's first web server and also to write the first web browser, WorldWideWeb, in 1990. By Christmas 1990, Berners-Lee had built all the tools necessary for a working Web:[12] the first web browser (which was a web editor as well) and the first web server. The first web site,[13] which described the project itself, was published on 20 December 1990.[14]\\r\\nThe first web page may be lost, but Paul Jones of UNC-Chapel Hill in North Carolina announced in May 2013 that Berners-Lee gave him what he says is the oldest known web page during a 1991 visit to UNC. Jones stored it on a magneto-optical drive and on his NeXT computer.[15] On 6 August 1991, Berners-Lee published a short summary of the World Wide Web project on the newsgroup alt.hypertext.[16] This date is sometimes confused with the public availability of the first web servers, which had occurred months earlier. As another example of such confusion, several news media reported that the first photo on the Web was published by Berners-Lee in 1992, an image of the CERN house band Les Horribles Cernettes taken by Silvano de Gennaro; Gennaro has disclaimed this story, writing that media were \\"totally distorting our words for the sake of cheap sensationalism.\\"[17]\\r\\nThe first server outside Europe was installed at the Stanford Linear Accelerator Center (SLAC) in Palo Alto, California, to host the SPIRES-HEP database. Accounts differ substantially as to the date of this event. The World Wide Web Consortium's timeline says December 1992,[18] whereas SLAC itself claims December 1991,[19][20] as does a W3C document titled A Little History of the World Wide Web.[21] The underlying concept of hypertext originated in previous projects from the 1960s, such as the Hypertext Editing System (HES) at Brown University, Ted Nelson's Project Xanadu, and Douglas Engelbart's oN-Line System (NLS). Both Nelson and Engelbart were in turn inspired by Vannevar Bush's microfilm-based memex, which was described in the 1945 essay \\"As We May Think\\".[22]\\r\\nBerners-Lee's breakthrough was to marry hypertext to the Internet. In his book Weaving The Web, he explains that he had repeatedly suggested that a marriage between the two technologies was possible to members of both technical communities, but when no one took up his invitation, he finally assumed the project himself. In the process, he developed three essential technologies:\\r\\nThe World Wide Web had a number of differences from other hypertext systems available at the time. The Web required only unidirectional links rather than bidirectional ones, making it possible for someone to link to another resource without action by the owner of that resource. It also significantly reduced the difficulty of implementing web servers and browsers (in comparison to earlier systems), but in turn presented the chronic problem of link rot. Unlike predecessors such as HyperCard, the World Wide Web was non-proprietary, making it possible to develop servers and clients independently and to add extensions without licensing restrictions. On 30 April 1993, CERN announced that the World Wide Web would be free to anyone, with no fees due.[24] Coming two months after the announcement that the server implementation of the Gopher protocol was no longer free to use, this produced a rapid shift away from Gopher and towards the Web. An early popular web browser was ViolaWWW for Unix and the X Windowing System.\\r\\nScholars generally agree that a turning point for the World Wide Web began with the introduction[25] of the Mosaic web browser[26] in 1993, a graphical browser developed by a team at the National Center for Supercomputing Applications at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign (NCSA-UIUC), led by Marc Andreessen. Funding for Mosaic came from the U.S. High-Performance Computing and Communications Initiative and the High Performance Computing Act of 1991, one of several computing developments initiated by U.S. Senator Al Gore.[27] Prior to the release of Mosaic, graphics were not commonly mixed with text in web pages and the web's popularity was less than older protocols in use over the Internet, such as Gopher and Wide Area Information Servers (WAIS). Mosaic's graphical user interface allowed the Web to become, by far, the most popular Internet protocol. The World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) was founded by Tim Berners-Lee after he left the European Organization for Nuclear Research (CERN) in October 1994. It was founded at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology Laboratory for Computer Science (MIT/LCS) with support from the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA), which had pioneered the Internet; a year later, a second site was founded at INRIA (a French national computer research lab) with support from the European Commission DG InfSo; and in 1996, a third continental site was created in Japan at Keio University. By the end of 1994, the total number of websites was still relatively small, but many notable websites were already active that foreshadowed or inspired today's most popular services.\\r\\nConnected by the Internet, other websites were created around the world. This motivated international standards development for protocols and formatting. Berners-Lee continued to stay involved in guiding the development of web standards, such as the markup languages to compose web pages and he advocated his vision of a Semantic Web. The World Wide Web enabled the spread of information over the Internet through an easy-to-use and flexible format. It thus played an important role in popularising use of the Internet.[28] Although the two terms are sometimes conflated in popular use, World Wide Web is not synonymous with Internet.[29] The Web is an information space containing hyperlinked documents and other resources, identified by their URIs.[30] It is implemented as both client and server software using Internet protocols such as TCP/IP and HTTP. Berners-Lee was knighted in 2004 by Queen Elizabeth II for \\"services to the global development of the Internet\\".[31][32]\\r\\nThe terms Internet and World Wide Web are often used without much distinction. However, the two are not the same. The Internet is a global system of interconnected computer networks. In contrast, the World Wide Web is a global collection of documents and other resources, linked by hyperlinks and URIs. Web resources are usually accessed using HTTP, which is one of many Internet communication protocols.[33]\\r\\nViewing a web page on the World Wide Web normally begins either by typing the URL of the page into a web browser, or by following a hyperlink to that page or resource. The web browser then initiates a series of background communication messages to fetch and display the requested page. In the 1990s, using a browser to view web pagesand to move from one web page to another through hyperlinkscame to be known as 'browsing,' 'web surfing' (after channel surfing), or 'navigating the Web'. Early studies of this new behaviour investigated user patterns in using web browsers. One study, for example, found five user patterns: exploratory surfing, window surfing, evolved surfing, bounded navigation and targeted navigation.[34]\\r\\nThe following example demonstrates the functioning of a web browser when accessing a page at the URL http://www.example.org/home.html. The browser resolves the server name of the URL (www.example.org) into an Internet Protocol address using the globally distributed Domain Name System (DNS). This lookup returns an IP address such as 203.0.113.4 or 2001:db8:2e::7334. The browser then requests the resource by sending an HTTP request across the Internet to the computer at that address. It requests service from a specific TCP port number that is well known for the HTTP service, so that the receiving host can distinguish an HTTP request from other network protocols it may be servicing. The HTTP protocol normally uses port number 80. The content of the HTTP request can be as simple as two lines of text:\\r\\nThe computer receiving the HTTP request delivers it to web server software listening for requests on port 80. If the web server can fulfil the request it sends an HTTP response back to the browser indicating success:\\r\\nfollowed by the content of the requested page. HyperText Markup Language (HTML) for a basic web page might look like this:\\r\\nThe web browser parses the HTML and interprets the markup (<title>, <p> for paragraph, and such) that surrounds the words to format the text on the screen. Many web pages use HTML to reference the URLs of other resources such as images, other embedded media, scripts that affect page behavior, and Cascading Style Sheets that affect page layout. The browser makes additional HTTP requests to the web server for these other Internet media types. As it receives their content from the web server, the browser progressively renders the page onto the screen as specified by its HTML and these additional resources.\\r\\nMost web pages contain hyperlinks to other related pages and perhaps to downloadable files, source documents, definitions and other web resources. In the underlying HTML, a hyperlink looks like this: <a href=\\"http://www.example.org/home.html\\">Example.org Homepage</a>\\r\\nSuch a collection of useful, related resources, interconnected via hypertext links is dubbed a web of information. Publication on the Internet created what Tim Berners-Lee first called the WorldWideWeb (in its original CamelCase, which was subsequently discarded) in November 1990.[10]\\r\\nThe hyperlink structure of the WWW is described by the webgraph: the nodes of the web graph correspond to the web pages (or URLs) the directed edges between them to the hyperlinks. Over time, many web resources pointed to by hyperlinks disappear, relocate, or are replaced with different content. This makes hyperlinks obsolete, a phenomenon referred to in some circles as link rot, and the hyperlinks affected by it are often called dead links. The ephemeral nature of the Web has prompted many efforts to archive web sites. The Internet Archive, active since 1996, is the best known of such efforts.\\r\\nJavaScript is a scripting language that was initially developed in 1995 by Brendan Eich, then of Netscape, for use within web pages.[35] The standardised version is ECMAScript.[35] To make web pages more interactive, some web applications also use JavaScript techniques such as Ajax (asynchronous JavaScript and XML). Client-side script is delivered with the page that can make additional HTTP requests to the server, either in response to user actions such as mouse movements or clicks, or based on elapsed time. The server's responses are used to modify the current page rather than creating a new page with each response, so the server needs only to provide limited, incremental information. Multiple Ajax requests can be handled at the same time, and users can interact with the page while data is retrieved. Web pages may also regularly poll the server to check whether new information is available.[36]\\r\\nMany hostnames used for the World Wide Web begin with www because of the long-standing practice of naming Internet hosts according to the services they provide. The hostname of a web server is often www, in the same way that it may be ftp for an FTP server, and news or nntp for a USENET news server. These host names appear as Domain Name System (DNS) or subdomain names, as in www.example.com. The use of www is not required by any technical or policy standard and many web sites do not use it; the first web server was nxoc01.cern.ch.[37] According to Paolo Palazzi,[38] who worked at CERN along with Tim Berners-Lee, the popular use of www as subdomain was accidental; the World Wide Web project page was intended to be published at www.cern.ch while info.cern.ch was intended to be the CERN home page, however the DNS records were never switched, and the practice of prepending www to an institution's website domain name was subsequently copied. Many established websites still use the prefix, or they employ other subdomain names such as www2, secure or en for special purposes. Many such web servers are set up so that both the main domain name (e.g., example.com) and the www subdomain (e.g., www.example.com) refer to the same site; others require one form or the other, or they may map to different web sites. The use of a subdomain name is useful for load balancing incoming web traffic by creating a CNAME record that points to a cluster of web servers. Since, currently, only a subdomain can be used in a CNAME, the same result cannot be achieved by using the bare domain root.[citation needed]\\r\\nWhen a user submits an incomplete domain name to a web browser in its address bar input field, some web browsers automatically try adding the prefix \\"www\\" to the beginning of it and possibly \\".com\\", \\".org\\" and \\".net\\" at the end, depending on what might be missing. For example, entering 'microsoft' may be transformed to http://www.microsoft.com/ and 'openoffice' to http://www.openoffice.org. This feature started appearing in early versions of Firefox, when it still had the working title 'Firebird' in early 2003, from an earlier practice in browsers such as Lynx.[39][unreliable source?] It is reported that Microsoft was granted a US patent for the same idea in 2008, but only for mobile devices.[40]\\r\\nIn English, www is usually read as double-u double-u double-u.[41] Some users pronounce it dub-dub-dub, particularly in New Zealand. Stephen Fry, in his \\"Podgrams\\" series of podcasts, pronounces it wuh wuh wuh.[42] The English writer Douglas Adams once quipped in The Independent on Sunday (1999): \\"The World Wide Web is the only thing I know of whose shortened form takes three times longer to say than what it's short for\\".[43] In Mandarin Chinese, World Wide Web is commonly translated via a phono-semantic matching to wn wi wҊng (čW), which satisfies www and literally means \\"myriad dimensional net\\",[44][better?source?needed] a translation that reflects the design concept and proliferation of the World Wide Web. Tim Berners-Lee's web-space states that World Wide Web is officially spelled as three separate words, each capitalised, with no intervening hyphens.[45] Use of the www prefix has been declining, especially when Web 2.0 web applications sought to brand their domain names and make them easily pronounceable.[46] As the mobile Web grew in popularity, services like Gmail.com, Outlook.com, Myspace.com, Facebook.com and Twitter.com are most often mentioned without adding \\"www.\\" (or, indeed, \\".com\\") to the domain.\\r\\nThe scheme specifiers http:// and https:// at the start of a web URI refer to Hypertext Transfer Protocol or HTTP Secure, respectively. They specify the communication protocol to use for the request and response. The HTTP protocol is fundamental to the operation of the World Wide Web, and the added encryption layer in HTTPS is essential when browsers send or retrieve confidential data, such as passwords or banking information. Web browsers usually automatically prepend http:// to user-entered URIs, if omitted.\\r\\nFor criminals, the Web has become a venue to spread malware and engage in a range of cybercrimes, including identity theft, fraud, espionage and intelligence gathering.[47] Web-based vulnerabilities now outnumber traditional computer security concerns,[48][49] and as measured by Google, about one in ten web pages may contain malicious code.[50] Most web-based attacks take place on legitimate websites, and most, as measured by Sophos, are hosted in the United States, China and Russia.[51] The most common of all malware threats is SQL injection attacks against websites.[52] Through HTML and URIs, the Web was vulnerable to attacks like cross-site scripting (XSS) that came with the introduction of JavaScript[53] and were exacerbated to some degree by Web 2.0 and Ajax web design that favours the use of scripts.[54] Today by one estimate, 70% of all websites are open to XSS attacks on their users.[55] Phishing is another common threat to the Web. \\"SA, the Security Division of EMC, today announced the findings of its January 2013 Fraud Report, estimating the global losses from phishing at $1.5 Billion in 2012\\".[56] Two of the well-known phishing methods are Covert Redirect and Open Redirect.\\r\\nProposed solutions vary. Large security companies like McAfee already design governance and compliance suites to meet post-9/11 regulations,[57] and some, like Finjan have recommended active real-time inspection of programming code and all content regardless of its source.[47] Some have argued that for enterprises to see Web security as a business opportunity rather than a cost centre,[58] while others call for \\"ubiquitous, always-on digital rights management\\" enforced in the infrastructure to replace the hundreds of companies that secure data and networks.[59] Jonathan Zittrain has said users sharing responsibility for computing safety is far preferable to locking down the Internet.[60]\\r\\nEvery time a client requests a web page, the server can identify the request's IP address and usually logs it. Also, unless set not to do so, most web browsers record requested web pages in a viewable history feature, and usually cache much of the content locally. Unless the server-browser communication uses HTTPS encryption, web requests and responses travel in plain text across the Internet and can be viewed, recorded, and cached by intermediate systems. When a web page asks for, and the user supplies, personally identifiable informationsuch as their real name, address, e-mail address, etc.web-based entities can associate current web traffic with that individual. If the website uses HTTP cookies, username and password authentication, or other tracking techniques, it can relate other web visits, before and after, to the identifiable information provided. In this way it is possible for a web-based organization to develop and build a profile of the individual people who use its site or sites. It may be able to build a record for an individual that includes information about their leisure activities, their shopping interests, their profession, and other aspects of their demographic profile. These profiles are obviously of potential interest to marketeers, advertisers and others. Depending on the website's terms and conditions and the local laws that apply information from these profiles may be sold, shared, or passed to other organizations without the user being informed. For many ordinary people, this means little more than some unexpected e-mails in their in-box or some uncannily relevant advertising on a future web page. For others, it can mean that time spent indulging an unusual interest can result in a deluge of further targeted marketing that may be unwelcome. Law enforcement, counter terrorism, and espionage agencies can also identify, target and track individuals based on their interests or proclivities on the Web.\\r\\nSocial networking sites try to get users to use their real names, interests, and locations, rather than pseudonyms. These website's leaders believe this makes the social networking experience more engaging for users. On the other hand, uploaded photographs or unguarded statements can be identified to an individual, who may regret this exposure. Employers, schools, parents, and other relatives may be influenced by aspects of social networking profiles, such as text posts or digital photos, that the posting individual did not intend for these audiences. On-line bullies may make use of personal information to harass or stalk users. Modern social networking websites allow fine grained control of the privacy settings for each individual posting, but these can be complex and not easy to find or use, especially for beginners.[61] Photographs and videos posted onto websites have caused particular problems, as they can add a person's face to an on-line profile.

These disabilities may be visual, auditory, physical, speech-related, cognitive, neurological, or some combination. Accessibility features also help people with temporary disabilities, like a broken arm, or ageing users as their abilities change.[62] The Web receives information as well as providing information and interacting with society. The World Wide Web Consortium claims that it is essential that the Web be accessible, so it can provide equal access and equal opportunity to people with disabilities.[63] Tim Berners-Lee once noted, \\"The power of the Web is in its universality. Access by everyone regardless of disability is an essential aspect.\\"[62] Many countries regulate web accessibility as a requirement for websites.[64] International cooperation in the W3C Web Accessibility Initiative led to simple guidelines that web content authors as well as software developers can use to make the Web accessible to persons who may or may not be using assistive technology.[62][65]\\r\\nThe W3C Internationalisation Activity assures that web technology works in all languages, scripts, and cultures.[66] Beginning in 2004 or 2005, Unicode gained ground and eventually in December 2007 surpassed both ASCII and Western European as the Web's most frequently used character encoding.[67] Originally RFC 3986 allowed resources to be identified by URI in a subset of US-ASCII. RFC 3987 allows more charactersany character in the Universal Character Setand now a resource can be identified by IRI in any language.[68]\\r\\nBetween 2005 and 2010, the number of web users doubled, and was expected to surpass two billion in 2010.[69] Early studies in 1998 and 1999 estimating the size of the Web using capture/recapture methods showed that much of the web was not indexed by search engines and the Web was much larger than expected.[70][71] According to a 2001 study, there was a massive number, over 550 billion, of documents on the Web, mostly in the invisible Web, or Deep Web.[72] A 2002 survey of 2,024 million web pages[73] determined that by far the most web content was in the English language: 56.4%; next were pages in German (7.7%), French (5.6%), and Japanese (4.9%). A more recent study, which used web searches in 75 different languages to sample the Web, determined that there were over 11.5 billion web pages in the publicly indexable web as of the end of January 2005.[74] As of March?2009[update], the indexable web contains at least 25.21 billion pages.[75] On 25 July 2008, Google software engineers Jesse Alpert and Nissan Hajaj announced that Google Search had discovered one trillion unique URLs.[76] As of May?2009[update], over 109.5 million domains operated.[77][not in citation given] Of these, 74% were commercial or other domains operating in the generic top-level domain com.[77] Statistics measuring a website's popularity, such as the Alexa Internet rankings, are usually based either on the number of page views or on associated server \\"hits\\" (file requests) that it receives.\\r\\nA web cache is a server computer located either on the public Internet, or within an enterprise that stores recently accessed web pages to improve response time for users when the same content is requested within a certain time after the original request.

Full-time employment often comes with benefits that are not typically offered to part-time, temporary, or flexible workers, such as annual leave, sickleave, and health insurance. Part-time jobs are mistakenly thought by some to not be careers. However, legislation exists to stop employers from discriminating against part-time workers so this should not be a factor when making decisions on career advancement. They generally pay more than part-time jobs per hour, and this is similarly discriminatory if the pay decision is based on part-time status as a primary factor. The Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA) does not define full-time employment or part-time employment. This is a matter generally to be determined by the employer (US Department of Labor). The definition by employer can vary and is generally published in a company's Employee Handbook. Companies commonly require from 35 to 40 hours per week to be defined as full-time and therefore eligible for benefits.\\r\\nFull-Time status varies between company and is often based on the shift the employee must work during each work week. The \\"standard\\" work week consists of five eight-hour days, commonly served between 9:00 AM to 5:00 PM or 10:00 AM to 6:00 PM totaling 40 hours. While a four-day week generally consists of four ten-hour days; it may also consist of as little as nine hours for a total of a 36-hour work week. Twelve-hour shifts are often three days per week, unless the company has the intention of paying out the employee overtime. Overtime is legally paid out anytime an employee works more than 40 hours per week. The legal minimum for overtime starts at Base Pay + One-Half. The increased payout is considered to compensate slightly for the increased fatigue which a person experiences on such long shifts. Shifts can also be very irregular, as in retail, but are still full-time if the required number of hours is reached. There are some situations where a person who needs full-time work is dropped to part-time, which is sometimes a form of constructive dismissal to avoid paying unemployment benefits to a laid-off worker.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nFull-time workweeks:\\r\\nA person working more than full-time is working overtime, and may be entitled to extra per-hour wages (but not salary).\\r\\nFull-time can also be used in reference to a student (usually in higher education) who takes a full load of course work each academic term. The distinction between a full-time and part-time student varies markedly from country to country. As an example, in the United States a student is commonly defined as being in full-time education when they undertake 12 or more credit hours. This translates to 12 \\"hours\\" (often of 50 minutes instead of 60 minutes each) in class per week. \\"Lab hours\\" often count for less, only as one-half or one-third of a credit hour.\\r\\nInternational students must maintain full-time status for student visas.[13] Adult students (typically up to age 22 or 23) may also fall under their parents' health insurance (and possibly car insurance and other services) if they are full-time, except for one term per year (usually summer). Students may also be eligible for elected office in student government or other student organizations only if they are full-time. The Department of Labor has a full-time student program which allows employers to pay no less than 85% of the minimum wage to the student/employee.[14]","input":"How many hours is considered a full-time job?"},{"output":"the Thai New Year's national holiday","context":"\\r\\n\\r\\nSongkran (Thai: ??, pronounced?[t??t.s.k?n s?.kr?n]; Khmer: ?; Burmese: ??; Lao: ) is the Thai New Year's national holiday. Songkran is 13 April every year, but the holiday period extends from 14ÿ15 April. In 2018 the Thai cabinet extended the festival nationwide to five days, 12ÿ16 April, to enable citizens to travel home for the holiday.[1] The word \\"Songkran\\" comes from the Sanskrit word sa?krnti (Devangarؐ: ),[2] literally \\"astrological passage\\", meaning transformation or change. The term was borrowed from Makar Sankranti, the name of a Hindu harvest festival celebrated in India in January to mark the arrival of spring. It coincides with the rising of Aries on the astrological chart[3] and with the New Year of many calendars of South and Southeast Asia, in keeping with the Buddhist/Hindu solar calendar.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn Thailand, New Year is now officially celebrated on January 1, Songkran was the official New Year until 1888, when it was switched to a fixed date of  April 1. Then in 1940, this date was shifted to 1 January. The traditional Thai New Year Songkran was transformed into a national holiday.[4]\\r\\n\\r\\nSongkran derives from Sanskrit meaning 'shift' or 'movement'. It derives from the movement of the sun from one position to another in the zodiac. According to its literal meaning in Sanskrit, a songkran occurs every month. However, the period that Thai people refer to as songkran happens when the sun moves from Pisces to Aries in the zodiac. The correct name for this period should actually be Maha Songkran ('great songkran') because it coincides with the arrival of a New Year. The songkran festival is, therefore, a celebration of the New Year in accordance with the solar calendar. The celebration covers a period of three days: 13 April is regarded as Maha Songkran, the day that the sun moves into Aries on the zodiac or the last day of the old year. The next day, 14 April is called Wan Nao, the transitional day between the old and the new years, and 15 April is called Wan Thaloeng Sok (Thai: ? 'to begin a new era or year'), New Year's day itself.[5]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1989, the Thai cabinet fixed Songkran at 12ÿ14 April, despite the correct starting date (13 April at 20:57).[6][n 1] Songkran, however, was traditionally computed according to the method described in Suriyayart (Thai: ?), the Thai version of Surya Siddhanta. The celebration starts when the sun enters Aries according to the sidereal zodiac system. This is called Maha Songkran day (Thai: ??). The final day marks the new solar year and is called Wan Thaloengsok (Thai: ?). The astrologers, local or royal, then make predictions about the economy, agriculture, rainfall, and political affairs according to observations between both days.[7] The king, or chief royal astrologer on his behalf, issued an official notification on the new year to the public. The announcement, called Prakat Songkran (Thai: ??, Songkran notification), contained the information on Maha Songkran, Thaloengsok, lunisolar calendar, and religious and royal ceremonies.[8] The government strictly adhered to the announcement and arranged some ceremonies according to the computation made by the royal astrologer.[9][10][n 2]\\r\\n\\r\\nAccording to the scripture, 800 years equals 292,207 days.[11][12][n 3] In other words, each solar year lasts 292,207 kammaja (Thai: , lit. one produced by karma), where 1 kammaja equals 108 seconds and 800 kammaja corresponds to 1 day. Timekeeping began as Kali Yuga started in 3102 BCE (ÿ3101 CE). At the start of each year, it is possible to compute the number of days since Kali Yuga commenced using following formula[13][14]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nS\\r\\nD\\r\\n=\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n292207\\r\\nG\\r\\n\\r\\n(\\r\\n\\r\\nK\\r\\nE\\r\\n\\r\\n)\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n800\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n=\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n292207\\r\\nG\\r\\n\\r\\n(\\r\\n\\r\\nC\\r\\nE\\r\\n+\\r\\n3101\\r\\n\\r\\n)\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n800\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n=\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n292207\\r\\nG\\r\\n\\r\\n(\\r\\n\\r\\nB\\r\\nE\\r\\n+\\r\\n2558\\r\\n\\r\\n)\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n800\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n,\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n{\\\\displaystyle SD={\\\\frac {292207\\\\times \\\\left(KE\\\\right)}{800}}={\\\\frac {292207\\\\times \\\\left(CE+3101\\\\right)}{800}}={\\\\frac {292207\\\\times \\\\left(BE+2558\\\\right)}{800}},}\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nwhere \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nK\\r\\nE\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n{\\\\displaystyle KE}\\r\\n\\r\\n, \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nC\\r\\nE\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n{\\\\displaystyle CE}\\r\\n\\r\\n, \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nB\\r\\nE\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n{\\\\displaystyle BE}\\r\\n\\r\\n denote Kaliyuga, common and Buddhist era respectively. \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nS\\r\\nD\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n{\\\\displaystyle SD}\\r\\n\\r\\n is Suriyayart day number, which can vary according to the calendar era being used.

Government Savings Bank still prints a one-page lunisolar calendar, which is different from multiple-page solar calendar commonly seen. The calendar features the image of Songkran goddess with her vehicle and subordinates, led by Chinese zodiac animal holding a flag with Thai script for that zodiac. It also contains a comprehensive information on the correct Songkran day and religious days.[16] Some astrologers, especially in northern Thailand, still issue their own Songkran notif\\r\\nication containing predictions and other information.[17] In 2013, Chiang Mai provincial council decided to defy the government-set holiday by rescheduling the ceremony according to the correct calculation.[18]\\r\\n\\r\\nFollowing table lists start and end dates of Songkran festival obtained from the formulae discussed above. Chinese zodiac for each year is also given since it is also used in Thai astrology. However, Chinese zodiac in Chinese astrology changes on Lichun, just before the Chinese New Year, in February, while Thai astrology uses the first day of fifth lunar month (roughly new moon in lateÿMarch to earlyÿApril).[19][20] Before the cut off date, astrologer uses zodiac of the last year.\\r\\n\\r\\nAccording to the Buddhist scripture at Wat Pho, Songkran originated from the death of Kapila Brahma Thai: ?? (lit. reddish Brahma)[21]. In the past there was a wealthy man and his heavy drinking neighbour. The drunkard, who had two sons, belittled the rich man for being childless. The rich man was humiliated and beseeched the Sun and the Moon gods to grant him a son. His attempts failed until he offered cooked rice to the tree god living in a banyan tree. The tree god asked Indra grant the man's wish. The child, named Thammabal (Thai: ?, or Dhammapala), 'one who protects righteousness', was born. \\r\\n\\r\\nThammabal was a clever child who learned three vedas and bird language and also taught people to avoid sin. A god named Kabillaprom learned of the child and wanted to test the child's cleverness. The god asked, \\"Where is the glory of men (sri)\\r\\nlocated in the morning, during the day, and in the evening?\\" The loser would have his head chopped off. The boy thought in vain for six days, but could not find a solution to the riddles. He lay beneath a sugar palm tree and overheard a conversation between a pair of eagles. \\"What are you going to eat tomorrow?\\", female bird said. \\"We are going to eat a dead body of Dhammapala, who will fail to answer three riddles?\\", the male bird replied. The female eagle asked her mate whether he knew the answer. He answered, \\"In the morning, the sri appears on the face, so people wash their faces every morning. At noon, the sri is at the chest where people spray perfume every noon. In the evening, the sri goes to the feet, so people wash their feet every evening.\\" The boy remembered everything. On the seventh day, the god met the boy and demaned an answer. The boy repeated what he had learned from the eagles, the correct answer. Kabillaprom summoned his seven daughters and told them that he must cut his head off. However, if his head fell to earth, it would create an inferno that would engulf the world. If his head was thrown into the air, the rains would stop. And if his head was dropped into the ocean, all seawater would dry up. To prevent these calamities Kabillaprom told his daughters to place his head on an elevated tray. Thungsa, his eldest child, stored her father's head in the cave in Mount Kailash.[5]\\r\\n\\r\\nEvery year when the Sun enters Aries, one of Kabillaprom's children, called Nang Songkran Thai: ??, and other angels form a procession. One of them takes a phan with Kabillaprom's head. The lady stands, sits, reclines or sleeps on the back of the animal depending on the time. From the dawn to midday, the lady will stand on the back of her conveyance. After midday until the sunset, she will sit down. Between the sunset and midnight, the lady lies down on her vehicle but leaves her eyes open. After midnight, she sleeps[14]. These postures and other details were previously drawn as part of Songkran notification and now being part of the lunisolar calendar. The procession lasts for 60 minutes around the Mount Meru. This event is subsequently called Maha Songkran in order to distinguish from other Songkrans that occurs when the Sun moves from one to another zodiac. For simplicity, the name was later shortened as Songkran[22][23].\\r\\n\\r\\nFollowing table lists names of Lady Songkran and her characteristics.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Songkran celebration is rich with symbolic traditions. Mornings begin with merit-making. Visiting local temples and offering food to the Buddhist monks is commonly practiced. On this specific occasion, performing water pouring on Buddha statues and the young and elderly is a traditional ritual on this holiday. It represents purification and the washing away of one's sins and bad luck.[3] As a festival of unity, people who have moved away usually return home to their loved ones and elders. Paying reverence to ancestors is an important part of Songkran tradition.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe holiday is known for its water festival. Major streets are closed to traffic, and are used as arenas for water fights. Celebrants, young and old, participate in this tradition by splashing water on each other. Traditional parades are held and in some venues \\"Miss Songkran\\" is crowned.[24] where contestants are clothed in traditional Thai dress. \\r\\n\\r\\nSongkran at Wat Thai, Los Angeles\\r\\n\\r\\nWater fights along the west moat, Chiang Mai\\r\\n\\r\\nPeople in a tuk-tuk getting soaked during Songkran, Chiang Mai\\r\\n\\r\\nThe use of chalk (Thai: ??) is also very common having originated in the chalk used by monks to mark blessings.\\r\\n\\r\\nCentral Region People in this region clean their houses when Songkran approaches. All dress up in colorful clothing or Thai dress. After offering food to the monks, people will offer a requiem to their ancestors. People make merit offerings such as giving sand to the temple for construction or repair. Other forms of merit include releasing birds and fish. Nowadays, people also release other kinds of animals such as buffaloes and cows.\\r\\n\\r\\nSouth Southerners have three Songkran rules: Work as little as possible and avoid spending money; do not hurt other persons or animals; do not tell lies.\\r\\n\\r\\nNorth In northern Thailand 13 April is celebrated with gunfire or firecrackers to repel bad luck. On the next day, people prepare food and useful things to offer to the monks at the temple. People have to go to temple to make merit and bathe Buddha's statue and after that they pour water on the hands of elders and ask for their blessings.\\r\\n\\r\\nEast The eastern region has activities similar to the other part of Thailand, but people in the east always make merit at the temple throughout all the days of the Songkran Festival and create the sand pagoda. Some people, after making merit at the temple, prepare food to be given to the elderly members of their family.\\r\\n\\r\\nSongkran is celebrated by the Malaysian Siamese community, particularly in the states of Kedah, Kelantan, Penang, Perak, Perlis and Terengganu where most Siamese are located.[25][26]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe festival is celebrated as Sangken in northeastern areas of India and as Bizu, Boisuk, Shangrai, and Boisabi in the Chittagong Hill Tracts of Bangladesh, which is the traditional New Year's Day by the indigenous people and Buddhist community. The Sangken festival is celebrated by the people of the Khampti tribe. The festival is also celebrated by Singpho, Khamyang, Tikhaks (Tangsa) and Phakyal community of Arunachal Pradesh, and Tai Phake community of Assam. Sangken generally falls in the month of 'Naun Ha', the fifth month of the year of the Khampti Lunar calendar coinciding with the month of April. It is celebrated in the last days of the old year and the lunar new year begins on the day just after the end of the festival.\\r\\n\\r\\nVishu, a Hindu religious festival, celebrated mainly in the South Indian State of Kerala (and some parts of Tamil Nadu), also falls during the same timeframe. It is predominantly a harvest festival.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn some villages in south India, especially Karnataka, a festival called \\"Okhali\\" or \\"Okhli\\" is celebrated in which every household keeps a barrel of water mixed with chalk and turmeric to throw on passers-by. The date of Okhali coincides with that of Songkran in Thailand and Thingyan in Myanmar, not with the dates of Holi, which is a north Indian festival.\\r\\n\\r\\nSongkran is celebrated annually on the U.S. territory of Wake Island by Air Force members and American and Thai contractors.[27]\\r\\n\\r\\nSongkran occurs at the same time as that given by Bede for festivals of Eostreand Easter weekend occasionally coincides with Songkran (most recently 1979, 1990, and 2001, but not again until 2085.[28])\\r\\n\\r\\nPolice statistics show that the death toll from road accidents doubles during the annual Songkran holiday. Between 2009 and 2013 there were about 27 road deaths per day during non-holiday periods and an average of 52 road deaths per day during Songkran. Thailand has the second-highest traffic fatality rate in the world, with 44 deaths per 100,000 residents. Approximately 70ÿ80 percent of the accidents that occur during the long holiday period are motorcycle accidents.[30] About 10,000 people per year die in motorcycle accidents.[29]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe National Council for Peace and Order (NCPO) says a total of 110,909 people were arrested and 5,772 vehicles impounded at road safety checkpoints across the country between 9ÿ16 April 2016.[31] In 2018 the number of offenders arrested at 2,029 checkpoints had risen to 146,589. Of these, 39,572 had failed to wear crash helmets and 37,779 carried no driving licence.[30] Reacting to the numbers, the prime minister \\"ordered stricter enforcement of the law\\"; the interior minister said he would \\"propose greater efforts in raising awareness as an additional measure, insisting that traffic laws were [already] strictly enforced\\"; and deputy prime minister Prawit Wongsuwon said he would \\"work harder to ensure motorcyclists wore helmets.\\"[32]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 2014 \\"Celebrate Singapore,\\" a large two-day Songkran-style water festival,[38] was planned for Singapore and the event was promoted as the \\"largest water festival party in Singapore\\". However, controversy emerged when the Tourism Authority of Thailand (TAT) Deputy Governor for Tourism Products, Vilaiwan Twichasri, claimed that Thailand holds exclusive rights to celebrate Songkran and planned to consult with officials at the Department of Intellectual Property, Ministry of Commerce and Ministry of Culture to discuss a potential lawsuit. The Deputy Governor's view was supported by numerous Thai citizens on social media websites.[39] Chai Nakhonchai, Cultural Promotion Department chief, pointed out that Songkran is a traditional festival shared by many countries throughout Southeast Asia, while historian Charnvit Kasetsiri stated that no single nation can claim ownership of a tradition.[40] On 25 March 2014, the Bangkok Post reported that the Singaporean government had intervened in the festival's content and there would be no water-throwing, no water pistols and no public drinking.

Satyamurti, Chittaranjan Das and Motilal Nehru were among a contrasting group of Swarajists who laid the foundation for parliamentary democracy in India.\\r\\n\\r\\nAlthough Gandhi's aim of totally implementing the concepts of Swaraj in India was not achieved, the voluntary work organisations which he founded for this purpose did serve as precursors and role models for people's movements, voluntary organisations, and some of the non-governmental organisations that were subsequently launched in various parts of India.[5] The student movement against oppressive local and central governments, led by Jayaprakash Narayan, and the Bhoodan movement, which presaged demands for land reform legislation throughout India, and which ultimately led to India's discarding of the Zamindari system of land tenure and social organisation, were also inspired by the ideas of Swaraj.\\r\\n\\r\\nSwami Dayanand Saraswati, founder of the Arya Samaj and a Hindu reformer, defined swaraj as the \\"administration of self\\" or \\"democracy\\". Swami Dayanand Saraswati, beginning with the premise that God had created people free to perform any work they were inclined to choose, then questioned the legitimacy of the foreign British occupation to make the Indian nation slaves on their own land? In the Swami's view, swaraj was the basis for freedom fighting. Dadabhai Navroji said that he had learnt the word swaraj from the Satyarth Prakash of Saraswati.[citation needed]\\r\\n\\r\\nSwaraj warrants a stateless society. According to Mahatma Gandhi, the overall impact of the state on the people is harmful. He called the state a \\"soulless machine\\" which, ultimately, does the greatest harm to mankind.[6] The raison d'etre of the state is that it is an instrument of serving the people. But Gandhi feared that in the name of moulding the state into a suitable instrument of serving people, the state would abrogate the rights of the citizens and arrogate to itself the role of grand protector and demand abject acquiescence from them. This would create a paradoxical situation where the citizens would be alienated from the state and at the same time enslaved to it, which, according to Gandhi, was demoralising and dangerous. If Gandhi's close acquaintance with the working of the state apparatus in South Africa and in India strengthened his suspicion of a centralised, monolithic state, his intimate association with the Congress and its leaders confirmed his fears about the corrupting influence of political power and his skepticism about the efficacy of the party systems of power politics (due to which he resigned from the Congress on more than one occasion only to be persuaded back each time) and his study of the British parliamentary systems convinced him that representative democracy was incapable of meting out justice to people.[7]\\r\\n\\r\\nGandhi thought it necessary to evolve a mechanism to achieve the twin objectives of empowering the people and 'empowering' the state. It was for this that he developed the two pronged strategy of resistance (to the state) and reconstruction (through voluntary and participatory social action).[citation needed]\\r\\n\\r\\nAlthough the word \\"Swaraj\\" means self-rule, Gandhi gave it the content of an integral revolution that encompasses all spheres of life: \\"At the individual level Swaraj is vitally connected with the capacity for dispassionate self-assessment, ceaseless self-purification and growing self-reliance.\\"[8] Politically, swaraj is self-government and not good government (for Gandhi, good government is no substitute for self-government) and it means a continuous effort to be independent of government control, whether it is foreign government or whether it is national. In other words, it is sovereignty of the people based on pure moral authority. Economically, Swaraj means full economic freedom for the toiling millions. And in its fullest sense, Swaraj is much more than freedom from all restraints, it is self-rule, self-restraint, and could be equated with moksha or salvation.[9]\\r\\n\\r\\nAdopting Swaraj means implementing a system whereby the state machinery is virtually nil, and the real power directly resides in the hands of people. Gandhi said: \\"Power resides in the people, they can use it at any time.\\"[10] This philosophy rests inside an individual who has to learn to be master of his own self and spreads upwards to the level of his community which must be dependent only on itself. Gandhi said: \\"In such a state (where swaraj is achieved) everyone is his own ruler. He rules himself in such a manner that he is never a hindrance to his neighbour.\\"[11] He summarised the core principle like this: \\"It is Swaraj when we learn to rule ourselves.\\"[12]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nGandhi explained his vision in 1946: \\r\\nIndependence begins at the bottom... A society must be built in which every village has to be self-sustained and capable of managing its own affairs... It will be trained and prepared to perish in the attempt to defend itself against any onslaught from without... This does not exclude dependence on and willing help from neighbours or from the world. It will be a free and voluntary play of mutual forces... In this structure composed of innumerable villages, there will be ever-widening, never-ascending circles. Growth will not be a pyramid with the apex sustained by the bottom. But it will be an oceanic circle whose center will be the individual. Therefore the outermost circumference will not wield power to crush the inner circle but will give strength to all within and derive its own strength from it.[13]\\r\\n\\r\\nGandhi was undaunted by the task of implementing such a utopian vision in India. He believed that by transforming enough individuals and communities, society at large would change. He said: \\"It may be taunted with the retort that this is all Utopian and, therefore not worth a single thought... Let India live for the true picture, though never realisable in its completeness. We must have a proper picture of what we want before we can have something approaching it.\\"[14]\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter Gandhi's assassination Vinoba Bhave formed the Sarva Seva Sangh at the national level and Sarvodya Mandals at the regional level to the carry on integrated village service? with the end purpose of achieving the goal of Swaraj. Two major nonviolent movements for socio-economic and political revolution in India: the Bhoodan movement led by Vinoba Bhave and the Total Revolution movement led by Jayaprakash Narayan were actually formed under the aegis of the ideas of Swaraj. These movements had some success, but due to the socialist tendencies of Nehruvian India were not able to unleash the kind of revolution that was aimed at.\\r\\n\\r\\nGandhi's model of Swaraj was almost entirely discarded by the Indian government. He had wanted a system of a classless, stateless direct democracy.[15]\\r\\n\\r\\nAdditionally, modern India has kept in place many aspects of British (and Western) influence, including widespread use of the English language, the common law, industrialisation, liberal democracy, military organisation, and bureaucracy.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Aam Aadmi Party was founded in late 2012, by Arvind Kejriwal and some erstwhile activists of India Against Corruption movement, with the aim of empowering people by applying the concept of swaraj enunciated by Gandhi, in the present day context by changing the system of governance.[16]","input":"Who used the word 'swaraj' firstly?"},{"output":"black powder manufacturing","context":"The Du Pont family is an American family descended from Pierre Samuel du Pont de Nemours (1739ÿ1817). Since the 19th century, the Du Pont family has been one of the richest families in America.[1]\\r\\nMany former Du Pont family estates have been opened to the public as museums, gardens, or parks, such as Nemours Mansion and Gardens, Longwood Gardens, and Winterthur Museum, Garden and Library. The family's first American estate, located at Hagley Museum and Library, has been designated a National Historic Landmark. In recent years, the family has continued to be known for its association with political and business ventures, as well as philanthropic efforts on behalf of various organizations such as The Jockey Club,[2] the Philadelphia Orchestra,[3] the Delaware Art Museum, and the Grand Opera House.[4]\\r\\nTwo family members were the subjects of well-publicized criminal cases. Heir John Eleuthre du Pont was convicted of murdering wrestling coach Dave Schultz in 1996[5] and heir Robert H. Richards IV was convicted of raping his 3-year-old daughter in 2009.[6]\\r\\nThe family is depicted in the 2014 biographical film Foxcatcher with Steve Carell playing John Eleuthre du Pont and Vanessa Redgrave playing Jean du Pont, the wife of William du Pont, Jr.\\r\\nThe family fortune as of 2016 was $14.3 billion with over 3,500 living cousins around the world, most of whom do not know one another.[1]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nPierre Samuel du Pont de Nemours was the son of a Parisian watchmaker and a member of a Burgundian Huguenot family, and descendant of a minor noble family on his mother's side. He and his sons, Victor Marie du Pont and leuthre Irne du Pont, emigrated from France in 1800 to the United States and used the resources of their Huguenot heritage to found one of the most prominent of American families, and one of its most successful corporations, E. I. du Pont de Nemours and Company, initially established by leuthre Irne as a gunpowder manufacturer.\\r\\nIn 1802, leuthre Irne du Pont established a gunpowder mill on the banks of the Brandywine River near Wilmington, Delaware. The location provided all the necessities to operate the mill: a water flow sufficient to power it, available timber (mainly willow trees) that could be turned into charcoal fine enough to use for gunpowder, close proximity to the Delaware River to allow for shipments of sulfur and saltpeter, the other ingredients used in the manufacture of gunpowder. There were also nearby stone quarries to provide needed building materials.[7]\\r\\nOver time the Du Pont company grew into the largest black powder manufacturing firm in the world. The family remained in control of the company up through the 1960s[8] and family trusts still own a substantial amount of the company's stock. This and other companies run by the Du Pont family employed up to 10 percent of Delaware's population at its peak.[9] During the 19th century, the Du Pont family maintained their family wealth by carefully arranged marriages between cousins[10] which, at the time, was the norm for many families.\\r\\nThe family played a large part in politics during the 18th and 19th centuries and assisted in negotiations for the Treaty of Paris and the Louisiana purchase. Both T. Coleman and Henry A. du Pont served as U.S. senators, and Pierre S. du Pont, IV served as Governor of Delaware.\\r\\nThe family has also played an important role in historic preservation and land conservation, including helping to found the National Trust for Historic Preservation, preserving President James Madison's home Montpelier, and establishing numerous museums such as Winterthur and the Delaware Museum of Natural History. The Brandywine Conservancy founded by family member George Alexis Weymouth owns around 2,350 acres (951?ha) of land in Pennsylvania and Delaware, and owns permanent conservation easements on an additional 37,000 acres (14,973?ha).[11][12] In 2013, Lammot du Pont Copeland's Mt. Cuba Center contributed over $20 million to purchase land for donation to the federal government to form the First State National Historical Park.[13]\\r\\nBeginning with William du Pont, Jr. and his sister, Marion duPont Scott, many members of the Du Pont family have been involved in the breeding and racing of thoroughbred racehorses, as well as establishing racehorse venues and training tracks.[14]\\r\\nThe usual spelling of the family name is du Pont when quoting an individual's full name and Du Pont when speaking of the family as a whole; some individual Du Ponts have chosen to spell it differently, such as Samuel Francis Du Pont. However, the name of the chemical company founded by the family is commonly referred to as DuPont, or, in the long form, E.

The Falcons compete in the National Football League (NFL) as a member club of the league's National Football Conference (NFC) South division. The Falcons joined the NFL in 1965[2] as an expansion team, after the NFL offered then-owner Rankin Smith a franchise to keep him from joining the rival American Football League (AFL).\\r\\nIn their 51 years of existence, the Falcons have compiled a record of 350ÿ450ÿ6 (341ÿ437ÿ6 in the regular season and 9ÿ13 in the playoffs), winning division championships in 1980, 1998, 2004, 2010, 2012, and 2016. The Falcons have appeared in two Super Bowls, the first being during the 1998 season in Super Bowl XXXIII, where they lost to the Denver Broncos 34ÿ19,[3] and the second being a 34ÿ28 overtime defeat by the New England Patriots in Super Bowl LI.\\r\\nThe Falcons played their home games at the Georgia Dome in downtown Atlanta from the 1992 to 2016 NFL seasons. Construction began on Mercedes-Benz Stadium in May 2014, and play began there in the 2017 season. Their headquarters and practice facilities are located at a 50-acre site in Flowery Branch, Georgia.[4]\\r\\n.\\r\\nProfessional football first came to Atlanta in 1962, when the American Football League staged two preseason contests, with one featuring the Denver Broncos vs. the Houston Oilers and the second pitting the Dallas Texans against the Oakland Raiders. Two years later, the AFL held another exhibition, this time with the New York Jets taking on the San Diego Chargers.\\r\\nIn 1965, after the AtlantaÿFulton County Stadium (then known simply as Atlanta Stadium) was built, the city of Atlanta felt the time was right to start pursuing professional football. One independent group which had been active in NFL exhibition promotions in Atlanta applied for franchises in both the American Football League and the National Football League, acting entirely on its own with no guarantee of stadium rights. Another group reported it had deposited earnest money for a team in the AFL.[5]\\r\\nWith everyone running in different directions, some local businessmen worked out a deal and were awarded an AFL franchise on June 7, 1965, contingent upon acquiring exclusive stadium rights from city officials. NFL Commissioner Pete Rozelle, who had been moving slowly in Atlanta matters, was spurred by the AFL interest and headed on the next plane down to Atlanta to block the rival league's claim on the city of Atlanta.[2] He forced the city to make a choice between the two leagues. By June 30, the city picked Rankin Smith and the NFL.\\r\\nThe Atlanta Falcons franchise began on June 30, 1965, when NFL Commissioner Pete Rozelle granted ownership to 41-year-old Rankin Smith Sr. Smith, an Executive Vice President of Life Insurance Company of Georgia at the time, paid $8.5 million the highest price in NFL history at the time for a franchise.[2] Former commissioner Pete Rozelle and Smith made the deal in about five minutes and the Atlanta Falcons brought the largest and most popular sport to the city of Atlanta. The Atlanta expansion franchise became the 15th NFL franchise, and they were awarded the first pick in the 1966 NFL draft as well as the final pick in each of the first five rounds.[6] The Falcons drafted All-American linebacker Tommy Nobis from the University of Texas with the first pick of the draft, making him the first-ever Falcon. The league also held the 1966 NFL Expansion Draft six weeks later in which the Falcons selected unprotected players from existing franchises. Although the Falcons selected many good players in those drafts, they still were not able to win right away.[2]\\r\\nThe Atlanta Falcons Football Club received its nickname on August 29, 1965. Miss Julia Elliott, a school teacher from Griffin, Georgia, was singled out from many people who suggested \\"Falcons\\" as the nickname for the new franchise. Elliott wrote: \\"the Falcon is proud and dignified, with great courage and fight. It never drops its prey. It is deadly and has a great sporting tradition.\\"[7][8]\\r\\nThe Falcons had their first season in 1966, and their first preseason game on August 1, 1966, losing to the Philadelphia Eagles. Under head coach Norb Hecker they lost their first nine regular-season games in 1966 and secured their first victory on the road against the New York Giants. The team finished the 1960s with only 12 wins. The Falcons had their first Monday Night Football game in Atlanta during the 1970 season, losing 20ÿ7 to the Miami Dolphins. The only two winning seasons in this twelve-year period were 1971 and 1973.\\r\\nIn the 1978 season, the Falcons qualified for the playoffs for the first time and won the Wild Card game against the Eagles 14ÿ13. The following week, they lost to the Dallas Cowboys 27ÿ20 in the Divisional Playoffs.\\r\\nIn the 1980 season, after a nine-game winning streak, the Falcons posted a franchise then-best record of 12ÿ4 and captured their first NFC West division title. The next week, their dream season ended at home with a loss to the Cowboys 30ÿ27 in the divisional playoffs. In the strike-shortened 1982 season, the Falcons made the playoffs but lost to the Minnesota Vikings, 30ÿ24. Falcons coach Leeman Bennett was fired after the loss. The team would then have losing seasons for the next eight years.\\r\\nIn 1989, the Falcons drafted cornerback Deion Sanders in the first round, who helped them for the next four years, setting many records for the franchise. \\"Neon Deion\\" (a.k.a. \\"Prime Time\\") had a flashy appeal and helped bring media attention to one of the league's most anonymous franchises. Sanders was also famous for playing on major league baseball teams (the New York Yankees and the Atlanta Braves) while simultaneously playing in the NFL.\\r\\nAfter defeating the New Orleans Saints in the NFC Wild Card game, the Falcons' 1991 season ended in a divisional playoff loss to the Washington Redskins. In 1991, the Falcons drafted Brett Favre as the thirty-third overall pick. During his rookie season, he played in two games where he amassed a record of 4 passing attempts with 0 receptions and 2 interceptions. The following February, Favre was traded to the Green Bay Packers.\\r\\nIn 1992, the Atlanta Falcons opened a new chapter in their history moving into the newly constructed Georgia Dome, where the team has defeated all 31 other NFL teams at least during its time there.\\r\\nIn 1998, under recently acquired head coach Dan Reeves, quarterback Chris Chandler and running back Jamal Anderson the \\"Dirty Bird\\" Falcons had their greatest season to date. On November 8, they beat the New England Patriots 41ÿ10, ending a streak of 22 losses at cold-weather sites. The team finished with a franchise-best 14ÿ2 regular season record and the NFC West division championship. On January 17, 1999, the Falcons upset the top-seeded Vikings at the Hubert H. Humphrey Metrodome in the NFC Championship Game 30ÿ27, in an exciting overtime victory. However, in their first-ever Super Bowl appearance, they lost 34ÿ19 to the defending champion Denver Broncos in Super Bowl XXXIII.\\r\\nIn the second game of the Falcons 1999 season, running back Jamal Anderson, who had been a key player in the Falcons' 1998 success, suffered a season-ending knee injury. The Falcons finished the season with a very disappointing 5ÿ11 regular season record.[2] In 2000, the Falcons suffered through another horrendous season finishing 4ÿ12 and once again missing the playoffs.\\r\\nIn the 2001 NFL draft, the Falcons orchestrated a trade with the San Diego Chargers, acquiring the first overall pick (which was used on quarterback Michael Vick) in exchange for wide receiver-return specialist Tim Dwight and the fifth overall pick (used on running back LaDainian Tomlinson).\\r\\nThe Falcons finished the 2001 season with a record of 7ÿ9 and missed the playoffs. Jessie Tuggle retired following 14 seasons in Atlanta. On December 6, 2001, Arthur M. Blank reached a preliminary agreement with the Falcons' Taylor Smith to purchase the team. In a special meeting prior to Super Bowl XXXVI in New Orleans on February 2, 2002, NFL owners voted unanimously to approve the purchase.[9]\\r\\nThe 2002 season saw the Falcons return to the playoffs with a regular season record of 9ÿ6ÿ1, tying the Pittsburgh Steelers. It was Vick's first year as the starter, and the team, with newly acquired running back Warrick Dunn, delivered the Green Bay Packers their first home playoff loss ever. A 20-6 loss to the Donovan McNabb-led Philadelphia Eagles the following week, however, ended the Falcons' season.\\r\\nOn March 19, 2003, the Falcons presented their new logo.[10][2] During the 2003 preseason Vick broke his leg and missed the first twelve games of the season. After losing 7 straight games, the decision was made to release head coach Dan Reeves. Wade Phillips acted as interim coach for the final 3 games. Although the Falcons won 3 of their last 4 games after the return of Vick, they ended up with a 5ÿ11 record that year. In 2004, a new head coach, Jim L. Mora, was hired and Vick returned for the full season. The Falcons went 11ÿ5, winning their third division title and earning a first-round bye into the playoffs. In the divisional playoffs, the Falcons defeated the St. Louis Rams, 47ÿ17, in the Georgia Dome, advancing to the NFC Championship Game, which they lost to the Eagles, 27ÿ10.\\r\\nThe Falcons again fell short of achieving back-to-back winning seasons in 2005, going 8ÿ8. In 2006, Michael Vick became the first quarterback in league history to rush for more than 1,000 yards in a season, with 1,039. After finishing the season 7ÿ9, however, coach Jim Mora was dismissed and Bobby Petrino, the University of Louisville's football coach, replaced him. Before the 2007 season began, Vick was suspended indefinitely by the NFL after pleading guilty to charges involving dog fighting in the state of Virginia. On December 10, 2007, Vick received a 23-month prison sentence and was officially cut from the Atlanta roster.\\r\\nFor the 2007 season, the Falcons were forced to start Joey Harrington at quarterback. On December 11, 13 games into his first NFL season as head coach, Bobby Petrino resigned without notice to coach at the University of Arkansas, leaving the beleaguered players only a note in the locker room. Secondary Coach Emmitt Thomas was named interim coach for the final three games of the season on December 12. The Falcons ended the year with a dismal 4ÿ12 record.\\r\\nAfter the tumultuous and disappointing 2007 season, the Falcons made a number of moves, hiring a new General Manager and head coach, drafting a new starting quarterback, and signing a starting running back.\\r\\nOn January 13, 2008, the Falcons named former Patriots director of college football scouting Thomas Dimitroff General Manager.[11] On January 23, Jacksonville Jaguars defensive coach and former linebackers coach for the 2000 Super Bowl champion Baltimore Ravens Mike Smith was named the Falcons' new head coach.[12] Chargers back-up RB Michael Turner agreed to a 6-year deal, $30 million deal on March 2.[13] On April 26, Matt Ryan (quarterback from Boston College) was drafted third overall in the 2008 NFL draft by the Falcons.\\r\\nThe Falcons finished the 2008 regular season with a record of 11ÿ5, and the #5 seed in the playoffs.[14] On December 21, 2008, Atlanta beat the Minnesota Vikings 24ÿ17 to clinch a wild card spot, earning a trip to the playoffs for the first time since 2004. The Falcons would go on to lose in the wild-card round of the 2008 NFL playoffs to the eventual NFC champion Arizona Cardinals, 30ÿ24.\\r\\nMatt Ryan started all 16 games in his rookie season and was named the Associated Press Offensive Rookie of the Year.[15] First-year head coach Mike Smith was named 2008 NFL Coach of the Year.\\r\\nAlthough they failed to make the playoffs in 2009 the team rallied to win their final three regular season games to record back-to-back winning seasons for the first time in franchise history. The Falcons defeated the Tampa Bay Buccaneers 20ÿ10 in the final game of the season to improve their record to 9ÿ7.[3]\\r\\nIn 2010, with a regular season record of 13ÿ3, the Falcons secured a third straight winning season, their fourth overall divisional title, and the top overall seed in the NFC playoffs; however, the Falcons were overpowered by the eventual Super Bowl XLV champion Green Bay Packers in the NFC Divisional Playoffs 48ÿ21. The Falcons scored 414 points ÿ the fifth-most in franchise history.[3] The team sent an NFL-high and franchise-best nine players to the 2011 Pro Bowl.[citation needed]\\r\\nThe Falcons made a surprise trade up with the Cleveland Browns in the 2011 NFL draft to select Alabama wide receiver Julio Jones sixth overall. In exchange, the Falcons gave up their first-, second- and fourth-round draft picks in 2011, and their first and fourth draft picks in 2012. Jones, along with teammates Tony Gonzalez and Roddy White, have since been dubbed Atlanta's \\"Big Three\\" (based on their total number of reception yards).[16] On August 30, 2011, Sports Illustrated senior writer Peter King, who correctly predicted the 2011 Super Bowl, made his predictions for the 2011 season and picked the Falcons to defeat the San Diego Chargers in the 2012 Super Bowl.[17] The Falcons finished the season at 10ÿ6, securing the fifth seed after a Week 17 beatdown of Tampa Bay in which the Falcons pulled their starters after leading 42ÿ0 just 23 minutes into the game.\\r\\nThe Falcons then went on to play the New York Giants in a 2011 NFC Wild Card Game at MetLife Stadium in East Rutherford, New Jersey. The first half was a defensive struggle, with the first points coming off of a safety by the Falcons, giving Atlanta a 2ÿ0 lead. In the 2nd quarter, though, Eli Manning connected with Hakeem Nicks for a short touchdown pass to make it 7ÿ2 Giants heading into the 2nd half. Then the Giants took control, as Manning threw for two more TD passes to Mario Manningham and Nicks and the defense completed its shutout of the Falcons to give the New York Giants the win, 24ÿ2, and the Falcons their third straight playoff loss with Matt Ryan and Mike Smith. After the season Defense Coordinator Brian VanGorder accepted a coaching job at Auburn University, and the offensive coordinator Mike Mularkey took the head coaching job in Jacksonville.\\r\\nAtlanta exploded out of the gate, going a franchise best 8ÿ0 and remaining the last unbeaten team in the NFL that year. Their hopes to get an undefeated season came to an end with a 27ÿ31 loss to the division rival Saints. Julio Jones had a remarkable second year, grabbing 10 touchdowns and 1,198 yards. The Falcons finished the season 13ÿ3, and clinched the number one seed in the NFC playoffs.\\r\\nThe Falcons played the Seattle Seahawks in their first playoff game. Although they went down 28ÿ27 with only 31 seconds left on the clock, Matt Ryan led the team to their first playoff victory, 30ÿ28. It was the only playoff victory in the Mike Smith era.\\r\\nThe Atlanta Falcons then advanced to face the San Francisco 49ers. The Falcons seized control of the game early with a Matt Bryant field goal, a trio of Matt Ryan touchdown passes caught by Julio Jones and Tony Gonzalez coupled with outstanding defensive play. By the end of the half, the score was 24ÿ14. The tides of the game began to shift in the second half as the 49ers rallied back with a pair of Frank Gore touchdown runs. Atlanta's offense attempted to reply but were ultimately shut down by the 49er defense. A few series later, late in the 4th quarter with little time remaining, Atlanta found themselves in a 4th and 4 situation at the 10-yard line. The Falcons needed just 10 more yards to secure victory and advance to their first Super Bowl berth in 14 years. Matt Ryan fired a pass to Roddy White which was ultimately broken up by inside linebacker NaVorro Bowman, resulting in a 28ÿ24 defeat.\\r\\nFollowing the success of the previous season, the Falcons were an expected Super Bowl contender. However, injuries hampered the team's performance and the team finished the season 4ÿ12. With that, the streak of consecutive winning seasons came to an end and Mike Smith had his first losing season as a head coach. Tony Gonzalez, in his final season in the NFL, was selected to the 2014 Pro Bowl as a starter representing Team Rice. Following the conclusion of the 2012 season, director of player personnel Les Snead departed the team to join the St. Louis Rams and Dave Caldwell, assistant to general manager Thomas Dimitroff, left the team to join the Jacksonville Jaguars. Scott Pioli, former GM of the New England Patriots, was announced as the Falcons' new assistant GM. Mike Smith was given a one-year extension on his contract as head coach. The Falcons had the 6th overall pick in the 2014 NFL draft with which they selected Jake Matthews, who played as offensive tackle for Texas A&M.\\r\\nDespite having another rough season, the Falcons still had an opportunity to qualify for the playoffs at the end of the regular season. The Falcons hosted the Carolina Panthers in their regular season finale, with the winners clinching the NFC South division. Unfortunately, the Falcons lost in a 34ÿ3 blowout as Matt Ryan threw two interceptions that were returned for touchdowns and got sacked six times. The Falcons finished the season 6ÿ10, marking the second consecutive losing season for the team.[18] The following day, Mike Smith was fired after seven seasons as head coach.[19] The Falcons would soon hire Seattle Seahawks defensive coordinator Dan Quinn as the team's 16th head coach.[20] The Falcons had the 8th overall pick in the 2015 NFL draft with which they selected Vic Beasley, a defensive end from Clemson University.[21]\\r\\nIn February 2015, the team was investigated by the NFL for alleged use of artificial crowd noise in the Georgia Dome.[22] The Falcons lost a 2016 NFL Draft selection as a result of the league's investigation.[23]\\r\\nDan Quinn's first season saw a 5ÿ0 start, the team's best start in four years. They would then struggle throughout the rest of the season by losing 8 of their last 11 games, resulting in an 8ÿ8 record. They did, however, give the Panthers their only regular season loss. The Falcons used their first-round pick in the 2016 NFL Draft on safety Keanu Neal from the University of Florida.\\r\\nIn the Falcons' 25th and final season in the Georgia Dome, Atlanta lost their Week 1 game to the Buccaneers 24ÿ31. The Falcons would then win their next four including one over the Panthers, when the franchise set new records. Matt Ryan threw for 503 yards, and Julio Jones caught twelve passes for 300 yards. With a 41ÿ13 thrashing of the San Francisco 49ers in Week 15, the Falcons improved to 9ÿ5 and secured their first winning season since 2012. One week later, the Falcons defeated the Panthers in Charlotte, North Carolina and clinched their first NFC South division title since 2012. In their last regular season game at the Georgia Dome, the Falcons defeated the New Orleans Saints, and secured an 11ÿ5 record and a first round bye.\\r\\nIn the divisional round of the playoffs, Atlanta defeated the Seahawks 36ÿ20 in the Georgia Dome, and hosted their last game at the Dome against the Green Bay Packers in the NFC Championship Game on January 22, 2017. The Falcons defeated the Packers 44ÿ21 to advance to Super Bowl LI as the NFC champions. Atlanta was up 28ÿ3 late in the third quarter, and the New England Patriots scored 31 unanswered points, with the last 6 in the first-ever overtime in the Super Bowl. The Patriots' 25-point comeback was the largest in Super Bowl history.[24]\\r\\nIn 2016, the Falcons scored 540 points in the regular season, the seventh-most in NFL history, tied with the Greatest Show on Turf (the 2000 St. Louis Rams).[25] However, the Falcons defense gave up 406 points, 27th in the league.[26]\\r\\nThe Falcons moved into their new home, the Mercedes-Benz Stadium, this season. Their first game ever played at the new stadium was a preseason loss to the Arizona Cardinals. The first regular season game at the new stadium was a rematch of the 2016ÿ17 NFC Championship, with Atlanta defeating Green Bay 34ÿ23.\\r\\nThe Falcons have called only two stadiums home in their 51 years of existence, and will have a third home in their history in the late summer of 2017. The first was the AtlantaÿFulton County Stadium, sharing with the Atlanta Braves Major League Baseball team until 1991. In 1992, the Georgia Dome was built, and the Falcons played there from its opening to the 2016 season. The Dome has been frequently used for college football, including Georgia State football and college bowl games such as the Peach Bowl.\\r\\nIn an effort to replace the aging Georgia Dome and potentially host a future Super Bowl, team owner Arthur Blank proposed a deal with the city of Atlanta to build a new state-of-the-art stadium not far from where the Georgia Dome is located. Blank will contribute $800 million and the city of Atlanta will contribute an additional $200 million via bonds backed by the city's hotel/motel tax towards the construction of a retractable roof stadium. Blank will contribute additional money for cost overruns if it is needed. The team will provide up to $50 million towards infrastructure costs that weren't included in the construction budget and to retire the remaining debt on the Georgia Dome. In addition, Blank's foundation and the city will each provide $15 million for development in surrounding neighborhoods. Though the total cost of the stadium was initially estimated to be around $1 billion,[27] the total cost was revised to $1.5 billion according to Blank.[28] In March 2013, the Atlanta City Council voted 11ÿ4 in favor of building the stadium.[29] The retractable roof Mercedes-Benz Stadium broke ground in May 2014, and will begin hosting the Falcons' and Atlanta United's Major League Soccer games in 2017.\\r\\nThe Atlanta Falcons' colors are red, black, silver and white.[30] When the team debuted in 1966, the Falcons wore red helmets with a black falcon crest logo. In the center of the helmet was a center black stripe surrounded by two gold stripes and two white stripes. These colors represented the two college rival schools in the state of Georgia; rival schools Georgia Tech Yellow Jackets (White and Gold) and the Georgia Bulldogs (Red and Black). Although the gold was later taken out, the white remains to this day. They wore white pants and either black or white jerseys. At first, the falcon crest logo was also put on the jersey sleeves, but it was replaced by a red and white stripe pattern four years later. They switched from black to red jerseys in 1971, and the club began to wear silver pants in 1978.\\r\\nA prototype white helmet was developed for the team prior to the 1974 season but was never worn.\\r\\nIn 1990, the uniform design changed to black helmets, silver pants, and either black or white jerseys. The numbers on the white jerseys were black, but were changed to red in 1997. (The red numerals could be seen on the away jerseys briefly in 1990.)\\r\\nBoth the logo and uniforms changed in 2003. The logo was redesigned with red and silver accents to depict a more powerful, aggressive falcon, which now more closely resembles the capital letter F.[10]\\r\\nAlthough the Falcons still wore black helmets, the new uniforms featured jerseys and pants with red trim down the sides. The uniform design consisted of either black or white jerseys, and either black or white pants. During that same year, a red alternate jersey with black trim was also introduced. The Falcons also started wearing black cleats with these uniforms.[31]\\r\\nIn 2004, the red jerseys became the primary jerseys, and the black ones became the alternate, both worn with white pants. In select road games, the Falcons wear black pants with white jerseys. The Falcons wore an all-black combination for home games against their archrivals, the New Orleans Saints, winning the first two contests (24ÿ21 in 2004 and 36ÿ17 in 2005), but losing 31ÿ13 in 2006. The Falcons wore the all black combination against the New Orleans Saints for four straight seasons starting in 2004, With the last time being in 2007, losing 34ÿ14. They wore the combination again in 2006, against the Tampa Bay Buccaneers in Week 2. The Falcons won that game, 14ÿ3. The Falcons also wore their all-black uniform in 2007 against the New York Giants, and in 2008 against the Carolina Panthers and against the Tampa Bay Buccaneers (for the second time).\\r\\nIn the 1980s, the Falcons wore their white uniforms at home most of the time because of the heat. When the Falcons started playing in a dome, the team switched to their dark uniforms for home games but have worn their white uniforms at home a few times since switching to the dome. It was announced at the 2009 state of the franchise meeting that the Falcons would wear 1966 throwback uniforms for a couple games during the 2009 season. The Atlanta Falcons wore 1966 throwback jerseys for two home games in 2009 ÿ against the Carolina Panthers on September 20 and against the Tampa Bay Buccaneers on November 29. The Falcons won both of those games. They donned the throwbacks again for 2 games in 2010, against Baltimore and San Francisco, winning both of those games as well.\\r\\nIn every season except for their debut season, the Falcons have shared a division with the New Orleans Saints (first the NFC West, and now the NFC South). Over this time, a heated rivalry has developed between the two cities' franchises. Atlanta leads the series 51ÿ45.\\r\\nIn addition, the Falcons share a similar, yet smaller, rivalry with the Carolina Panthers, with both teams having been in the NFC West from the Panthers' founding in 1995 to the NFL realignment in 2002, where they have been in the NFC South since then. The Falcons lead the series 27ÿ17.\\r\\nIncludes postseason records[32]\\r\\nSource:[33]\\r\\nNote: W = Wins, L = Losses, T = Ties\\r\\nRunning backs\\r\\nWide receivers\\r\\nTight ends\\r\\nDefensive linemen\\r\\nDefensive backs\\r\\nSpecial teams\\r\\nPractice squad\\r\\nRoster updated September 19, 2017\\r\\nDepth chart ?

MSG as a flavor enhancer balances, blends, and rounds the perception of other tastes.[4][5]\\r\\nThe U.S. Food and Drug Administration has given MSG its generally recognized as safe (GRAS) designation.[Gov. 2] A popular belief is that large doses of MSG can cause headaches and other feelings of discomfort, known as \\"Chinese restaurant syndrome,\\" but double-blind tests fail to find evidence of such a reaction.[Gov. 2][6] The European Union classifies it as a food additive permitted in certain foods and subject to quantitative limits. MSG has the HS code 29224220 and the E number E621.[Gov. 3]\\r\\nPure MSG is reported not to have a pleasant taste until it is combined with a savory aroma.[Manuf. 2] The basic sensory function of MSG is attributed to its ability to enhance savory taste-active compounds when added in the proper concentration.[4] The optimum concentration varies by food; in clear soup, the pleasure score rapidly falls with the addition of more than one gram of MSG per 100 mL.[7]\\r\\nThe sodium content (in mass percent) of MSG, 12%, is about one-third of that in sodium chloride (39%), due to the greater mass of the glutamate counterion.[Manuf. 3] Although other salts of glutamate have been used in low-salt soups, they are less palatable than MSG.[Manuf. 4]\\r\\nA popular belief is that MSG can cause headaches and other feelings of discomfort but double-blind tests have found no evidence to support this.[6] MSG has been used for more than 100 years to season food, with a number of studies conducted on its safety. Consumption and manufacture of high-salt and high-glutamate foods, which contain both sodium and glutamate, stretch back far longer, with evidence of cheese manufacture as early as 5,500 BC.[8] International and national bodies governing food additives currently consider MSG safe for human consumption as a flavor enhancer.[Gov. 4] Under normal conditions, humans can metabolize relatively large quantities of glutamate, which is naturally produced in the gut in the course of protein hydrolysis. The median lethal dose (LD50) is between 15 and 18 g/kg body weight in rats and mice, respectively, five times greater than the LD50 of salt (3 g/kg in rats). The use of MSG as a food additive and the natural level of glutamic acid in foods are not toxicological concerns in humans.[Gov. 4]\\r\\nA 1995 report from the Federation of American Societies for Experimental Biology (FASEB) for the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) concluded that MSG is safe when \\"eaten at customary levels\\" and, although a subgroup of otherwise-healthy individuals develop an MSG symptom complex when exposed to 3 g of MSG in the absence of food, MSG as a cause has not been established because the symptom reports are anecdotal.[9]\\r\\nAccording to the report, no data support the role of glutamate in chronic disease. A controlled, double-blind, multiple-location clinical trial failed to demonstrate a relationship between the MSG symptom complex and actual MSG consumption. No statistical association has been demonstrated, and the few responses were inconsistent. No symptoms were observed when MSG was administered with food.[10][11][12][13]\\r\\nAdequately controlling for experimental bias includes a double-blind, placebo-controlled experimental design (DBPC) and administration by capsule, because of the unique aftertaste of glutamates.[12] In a study by Tarasoff and Kelly (1993), 71 fasting participants were given 5 g of MSG and then a standard breakfast. One reaction (to the placebo, in a self-identified MSG-sensitive individual) occurred.[10] A study by Geha et al. (2000) tested the reaction of 130 subjects with a reported sensitivity to MSG. Multiple DBPC trials were performed, with subjects exhibiting at least two symptoms continuing. Two people out of the 130 responded to all four challenges. Because of the low prevalence, the researchers concluded that a response to MSG was not reproducible.[14]\\r\\nStudies exploring MSG's role in obesity have yielded mixed results.[15][16]\\r\\nAlthough several studies have investigated anecdotal links between MSG and asthma, current evidence does not support a causal association.[17] Since glutamates are important neurotransmitters in the human brain, playing a key role in learning and memory, ongoing neurological studies indicate a need for further research.[18]\\r\\nA hypothetical MSG symptom complex, named \\"Chinese restaurant syndrome\\", attracted attention in the period after 1968, when Robert Ho Man Kwok reported symptoms he felt after an American-Chinese meal. Kwok suggested possible reasons for his symptoms, including alcohol (from cooking with wine), sodium, and MSG; however, a number of symptoms have become associated with MSG.[10]\\r\\nFood Standards Australia New Zealand (FSANZ) MSG technical report concludes, \\"There is no convincing evidence that MSG is a significant factor in causing systemic reactions resulting in severe illness or mortality. The studies conducted to date on Chinese restaurant syndrome (CRS) have largely failed to demonstrate a causal association with MSG. Symptoms resembling those of CRS may be provoked in a clinical setting in small numbers of individuals by the administration of large doses of MSG without food. However, such effects are neither persistent nor serious and are likely to be attenuated when MSG is consumed with food. In terms of more serious adverse effects such as the triggering of bronchospasm in asthmatic individuals, the evidence does not indicate that MSG is a significant trigger factor.\\"[Gov. 5][Gov. 6]\\r\\nHowever, the FSANZ MSG report says that although no data are available on average MSG consumption in Australia and New Zealand, \\"data from the United Kingdom indicates an average intake of 590?mg/day, with extreme users (97.5th percentile consumers) consuming 2330?mg/day\\" (Rhodes et al. 1991). In a highly seasoned restaurant meal, intakes as high as 5000?mg or more may be possible (Yang et al. 1997). When very large doses of MSG (>5 g MSG in a bolus dose) are ingested, plasma glutamate concentration will significantly increase. However, the concentration typically returns to normal within two hours. In general, foods providing metabolizable carbohydrate significantly attenuate peak plasma glutamate levels at doses up to 150?mg/kg body weight. Two earlier studiesthe 1987 Joint FAO/WHO Expert Committee on Food Additives (JECFA) and the 1995 Federation of American Societies for Experimental Biology (FASEB)concluded, \\"there may be a small number of unstable asthmatics who respond to doses of 1.5 ÿ 2.5g of MSG in the absence of food\\". The FASEB evaluation concluded, \\"sufficient evidence exists to indicate some individuals may experience manifestations of CRS when exposed to a 3g bolus dose of MSG in the absence of food\\".[Gov. 5]\\r\\nMSG has been produced by three methods: hydrolysis of vegetable proteins with hydrochloric acid to disrupt peptide bonds (1909ÿ1962); direct chemical synthesis with acrylonitrile (1962ÿ1973), and bacterial fermentation (the current method).[Manuf. 5] Wheat gluten was originally used for hydrolysis because it contains more than 30 g of glutamate and glutamine in 100 g of protein. As demand for MSG increased, chemical synthesis and fermentation were studied. The polyacrylic fiber industry began in Japan during the mid-1950s, and acrylonitrile was adopted as a base material to synthesize MSG.[Manuf. 6]\\r\\nCurrently (2016), most global MSG is produced by bacterial fermentation in a process similar to making vinegar or yogurt. Sodium is added later, for neutralization. During fermentation, Corynebacterium species, cultured with ammonia and carbohydrates from sugar beets, sugar cane, tapioca or molasses, excrete amino acids into a culture broth from which L-glutamate is isolated. The Kyowa Hakko Kogyo Company developed industrial fermentation to produce L-glutamate.[Manuf. 7]\\r\\nThe conversion yield and production rate (from sugars to glutamate) continues to improve in the industrial production of MSG, keeping up with demand.[Manuf. 5] The product, after filtration, concentration, acidification, and crystallization, is glutamate, sodium, and water.\\r\\nThe compound is usually available as the monohydrate, a white, odorless, crystalline powder. The solid contains separate sodium cations Na+ and glutamate anions in zwitterionic form, ?OOC-CH(NH+\\r\\n3)-(CH\\r\\n2)2-COO?.[19] In solution it dissociates into glutamate and sodium ions.\\r\\nMSG is freely soluble in water, but it is not hygroscopic and is insoluble in common organic solvents (such as ether).[20] It is generally stable under food-processing conditions. MSG does not break down during cooking and, like other amino acids, will exhibit a Maillard reaction (browning) in the presence of sugars at very high temperatures.[Manuf. 8]\\r\\nGlutamic acid was discovered and identified in 1866 by the German chemist Karl Heinrich Ritthausen, who treated wheat gluten (for which it was named) with sulfuric acid.[21] Kikunae Ikeda of Tokyo Imperial University isolated glutamic acid as a taste substance in 1908 from the seaweed Laminaria japonica (kombu) by aqueous extraction and crystallization, calling its taste umami.[Manuf. 9] Ikeda noticed that dashi, the Japanese broth of katsuobushi and kombu, had a unique taste not yet scientifically described (not sweet, salty, sour, or bitter).[Manuf. 9] To verify that ionized glutamate was responsible for umami, he studied the taste properties of glutamate salts: calcium, potassium, ammonium, and magnesium glutamate. All these salts elicited umami and a metallic taste due to the other minerals. Of them, sodium glutamate was the most soluble, most palatable, and easiest to crystallize.[citation needed] Ikeda called his product \\"monosodium glutamate\\", and submitted a patent to produce MSG;[Gov. 7] the Suzuki brothers began commercial production of MSG in 1909 as Aji-no-moto (輰\\\\, \\"essence of taste\\").[Manuf. 5][Manuf. 8][22]\\r\\nIt has been suggested that a fear of MSG may reflect anti-Asian racism, with MSG being seen as an \\"Oriental\\", alien arrival in Western cooking, likely to be dangerous.[23][24][25] Food critic Jeffrey Steingarten argued that fear of MSG should be seen as a Western-centric mindset, lacking awareness of its common use in Far Eastern cooking without apparent problems: \\"If MSG is a problem, why doesn't everyone in China have a headache?\\"[26][27]\\r\\nMSG is one of several forms of glutamic acid found in foods, in large part because glutamic acid (an amino acid) is pervasive in nature. Glutamic acid and its salts may be present in a variety of other additives, including hydrolyzed vegetable protein, autolyzed yeast, hydrolyzed yeast, yeast extract, soy extracts, and protein isolate, which must be specifically labeled. Since 1998, MSG cannot be included in the term \\"spices and flavorings\\". The ribonucleotide food additives disodium inosinate and disodium guanylate are usually used with monosodium glutamate-containing ingredients. However, the term \\"natural flavor\\" is used by the food industry for glutamic acid (chemically similar to MSG, lacking only the sodium ion). The Food and Drug Administration does not require disclosure of components and amounts of \\"natural flavor.\\"[Gov. 8]\\r\\nThe FDA considers labels such as \\"no MSG\\" or \\"no added MSG\\" misleading if the food has ingredients which are sources of free glutamate, such as hydrolyzed protein. In 1993, it proposed adding \\"contains glutamate\\" to the common names of certain hydrolyzed proteins with substantial amounts of glutamate.[citation needed]\\r\\nStandard 1.2.4 of the Australia and New Zealand Food Standards Code requires MSG to be labeled in packaged foods. The label must have the food-additive class name (e.g. \\"flavour enhancer\\"), followed by the name of the additive (\\"MSG\\") or its International Numbering System (INS) number, 621.[Gov. 9]\\r\\nThe following are alternative names for MSG:[Gov. 1][Manuf. 10][Manuf. 11]","input":"What is the common use of monosodium glutamate?"},{"output":"in the second half of the 19th century with its root in 1758 as establishment of Cox & Kings Ltd","context":"\\r\\n\\r\\nA travel agency is a private retailer or public service that provides travel and tourism related services to the public on behalf of suppliers such as activities, airlines, car rentals, cruise lines, hotels, railways, travel insurance, and package tours. In addition to dealing with ordinary tourists, most travel agencies have a separate department devoted to making travel arrangements for business travelers; some travel agencies specialize in commercial and business travel only. There are also travel agencies that serve as general sales agents for foreign travel companies, allowing them to have offices in countries other than where their headquarters are located.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe modern travel agency first appeared in the second half of the 19th century with its root in 1758 as establishment of Cox & Kings Ltd.[1] In the year 1970, Cox & Kings the longest established travel company[2] centered its focus on its business of travel and tourism. Lately Thomas Cook also established a chain of agencies in the last quarter of the 19th century, in association with the Midland Railway. They not only sold their own tours to the public, but in addition, represented other tour companies. Other British pioneer travel agencies were Dean & Dawson,[3] the Polytechnic Touring Association, and the Co-operative Wholesale Society. The oldest travel agency in the United States is Brownell Travel; on 4 July 1887, Walter T. Brownell led ten travelers on a European tour, setting sail from New York on the SS Devonia.[4]\\r\\n\\r\\nTravel agencies became more commonplace with the development of commercial aviation, starting in the 1920s. Originally, travel agencies largely catered to middle and upper class customers, but the post-war boom in mass-market package holidays resulted in the proliferation of travel agencies on the main streets of most British towns, catering to a working class clientele looking for a convenient way to book overseas beach holidays.[5]\\r\\n\\r\\nA travel agency's main function is to act as an agent, selling travel products and services on behalf of a supplier. Consequently, unlike other retail businesses, they do not keep a stock in hand, unless they have pre-booked hotel rooms and/or cabins on a cruise ship for a group travel event such as a wedding, honeymoon, or a group event. A package holiday or a ticket is not purchased from a supplier unless a customer requests that purchase. The holiday or ticket is supplied to the agency at a discount. The profit is therefore the difference between the advertised price which the customer pays and the discounted price at which it is supplied to the agent. This is known as the commission. In many countries, all individuals or companies that sell tickets are required to be licensed as a travel agent.[citation needed][6]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn some countries, airlines have stopped giving commissions to travel agencies. Therefore, travel agencies are now forced to charge a percentage premium or a standard flat fee, per sale. However, some companies pay travel agencies a set percentage for selling their product. Major tour companies can afford to do this, because if they were to sell a thousand trips at a cheaper rate, they would still come out better than if they sold a hundred trips at a higher rate. This process benefits both parties.[7] It is also cheaper to offer commissions to travel agents rather than engage in advertising and distribution campaigns without using agents.[8]\\r\\n\\r\\nOther commercial operations are undertaken, especially by the larger chains. These can include the sale of in-house insurance, travel guide books, and public transport timetables, car rentals, and the services of an on-site bureau de change, dealing in the most popular holiday currencies.\\r\\n\\r\\nA travel agent is supposed to offer impartial travel advice to the customer, as well as coordinating travel details and assisting the customer in booking travel. However, this function almost disappeared with the mass market package holiday, and some agency chains seemed to develop a \\"holiday supermarket\\" concept, in which customers choose their holiday from brochures on racks and then book it from a counter. Again, a variety of social and economic changes[which?] have now contrived to bring this aspect to the fore once more, particularly with the advent of multiple, no-frills, low-cost airlines.[which?][when?][citation needed]\\r\\n\\r\\nTraditionally, travel agencies' principal source of income was, and continues to be, commissions paid for bookings of car rentals, cruise lines, hotels, railways, sightseeing tours, tour operators, etc. A fixed percentage of the main element of the price is paid to the agent as a commission. Commissions may vary depending on the type of product and the supplier. Commissions are not paid on the tax component of the price. Travel agencies also receive a large variety of bonuses, benefits, and other incentives from travel and tourism related companies as inducements for travel agents to promote their products. The customer is normally not made aware of how much the travel agent is earning in commissions and other benefits. Other sources of income may include the sale of insurance, travel guide books, public transport timetables and money exchange.[9]\\r\\n\\r\\nSince 1995, many airlines around the world and most airlines in the United States now do not pay any commission to travel agencies. In this case, an agency adds a service fee to the net price. Reduced commissions started in 1995 in the United States, with the introduction of a cap of $50 on return trips and $25 on one way. In 1999, European airlines began eliminating or reducing commissions, while Singapore Airlines did so in parts of Asia. In 2002, Delta Air Lines announced a zero-commission base for the U.S. and Canada; after a few months United Airlines, American Airlines, Continental Airlines, Northwest Airlines, US?Airways and American Trans Air all followed suit.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe majority of travel agents have felt the need to protect themselves and their clients against the possibilities of commercial failure, either their own or a supplier's. They will advertise the fact that they are surety bonded, meaning in the case of a failure, the customers are guaranteed either an equivalent holiday to that which they have lost or, if they prefer, a refund. Many British and American agencies and tour operators are bonded with the International Air Transport Association (IATA),[10] for those who issue air tickets, Air Travel Organisers' Licensing (ATOL) for those who order tickets in, and the Association of British Travel Agents (ABTA) or the American Society of Travel Agents (ASTA), for those who sell package holidays on behalf of a tour company.[11]\\r\\n\\r\\nThere are three different types of agencies in the UK: multiples, miniples,[12] and independent agencies. Multiples comprises a number of national chains, often owned by international conglomerates, like Thomson Holidays, now a subsidiary of TUI Group, the German multinational.[13] It is now common for the large mass market tour companies to purchase a controlling interest in a chain of travel agencies, in order to control the distribution of their product. (This is an example of vertical integration.) The smaller chains are often based in particular regions or districts.[citation needed]\\r\\n\\r\\nFive different types of agencies exist in the United States: independent, host, franchise, consortium, and mega agencies. American Express and the American Automobile Association (AAA) are examples of mega travel agencies.[14] Carlson Wagonlit Travel is an example of a consortium agency consisting of various types of specialty agencies. An example of an independent travel agency, is one that is started by a sole proprietorship, or partnership between individuals that have no business partnerships with competition agencies. Each type of travel agency has its pros and cons.[15][16]\\r\\n\\r\\nWithin Australia, many small businesses are sole traders, and often franchisees. They operate online, with a shopfront or as a franchisee. The Australian travel agency industry has increased substantially due to the growth of franchise chains, with small business and sole traders joining franchise networks such as Helloworld Travel, giving them access to internal systems for product and bookings.[17] Flight Centre Travel Group has almost 2,800 company-owned operations and is one of the largest in the world.[18] Booking.com is Australia's most widely used online travel agent.[19]\\r\\n\\r\\nIndependent agencies usually cater to a special or niche market, such as the needs of residents in an upmarket commuter town or suburb, or a particular group interested in a similar activity, such as sporting events, like football, golf, or tennis.[20]\\r\\n\\r\\nTravel agencies choose between two approaches. One is the traditional, multi-destination, outbound travel agency, based in the traveler's originating location; the other is the destination focused, inbound travel agency, that is based in the destination and delivers an expertise on that location. At present, the former is usually a larger operator while the latter is often a smaller, independent operator.[21]\\r\\n\\r\\nAirline consolidators, tour operators, and other types of travel consolidators and wholesalers are high volume sales companies that specialize in selling to niche markets.[22] They may or may not offer various types of services, at a single point of access. These can be hotel reservations, flights or car-rentals. Sometimes the services are combined into vacation packages, that include transfers to the location and lodging. These companies do not usually sell directly to the public, but act as wholesalers to retail travel agencies. Commonly, the sole purpose of consolidators is to sell to ethnic niches in the travel industry. Usually no consolidator offers everything; they may only have contracted rates to specific destinations. Today, there are no domestic consolidators, with some exceptions for business class contracts.[citation needed]\\r\\n\\r\\nWith general public access to the Internet since the mid-1990s, many airlines and other travel companies began to sell directly to passengers. As a consequence, airlines no longer needed to pay the commissions to travel agents on each ticket sold. Since 1997, travel agencies have gradually been dis-intermediated, by the reduction in costs caused by removing layers from the package holiday distribution network.[23][24] However, travel agents remain dominant in some areas such as cruise vacations where they represent 77% of bookings and 73% of packaged travel.[25]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn response, travel agencies have developed an internet presence of their own by creating travel websites, with detailed information and online booking capabilities. Travel agencies also use the services of the major computer reservations systems companies, also known as Global Distribution Systems (GDS), including: Amadeus CRS, Galileo CRS, SABRE, and Worldspan, which is a subsidiary of Travelport, allowing them to book and sell airline tickets, car rentals, hotels, and other travel related services. Some online travel websites allow visitors to compare hotel and flight rates with multiple companies for free; they often allow visitors to sort the travel packages by amenities, price, and proximity to a city or landmark.[26]\\r\\n\\r\\nAll travel sites that sell hotels online work together with GDS, suppliers, and hotels directly to search for room inventory. Once the travel site sells a hotel room, the site will try to get a confirmation for this hotel. Once confirmed or not, the customer is contacted with the result. This means that booking a hotel on a travel website will not necessarily result in an instant confirmation. Only some hotels on a travel website can be confirmed instantly (which is normally marked as such on each site).[citation needed] As different travel websites work with different suppliers, each site has different hotels that it can confirm instantly.[citation needed] Some examples of such online travel websites that sell hotel rooms are Expedia, Orbitz, and Priceline.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe comparison sites, such as Kayak.com and TripAdvisor, search the reseller sites all at once to save time searching. None of these sites actually sells hotel rooms.[27]\\r\\n\\r\\nOften tour operators have hotel contracts,[clarification needed] allotments,[clarification needed] and free sell agreements[clarification needed] which allow for the immediate confirmation of hotel rooms for vacation bookings.[citation needed]\\r\\n\\r\\nMainline service providers are those that actually produce the direct service, like various hotels chains or airlines that have a website for online bookings.[original research?]\\r\\n\\r\\nPortals serve as a consolidator of various airlines and hotels on the internet.

The staple food of a specific society may be eaten as often as every day or every meal, and most people live on a diet based on just a small number of staples.[1]\\r\\nStaple foods vary from place to place, but typically they are inexpensive or readily-available foods that supply one or more of the three organic macronutrients needed for survival and health: carbohydrates, proteins, and fats. Typical examples of staples include tubers and roots; and grains, legumes, and other seeds. Early agricultural civilizations valued the foods that they established as staples because, in addition to providing necessary nutrition, they generally are suitable for storage over long periods of time without decay. Such nonperishable foods are the only possible staples during seasons of shortage, such as dry seasons or cold temperate winters, against which times harvests have been stored. During seasons of plenty, wider choices of foods may be available.\\r\\nMain staple foods are derived either from vegetables and animal products, including cereals (such as rice, wheat, maize, millet, or sorghum), starchy tubers or root vegetables (such as potatoes, cassava, yams, or taro), meat, fish, eggs, milk, and cheese.[1] Other staple foods include pulses (dried legumes),[2] sago (derived from the pith of the sago palm tree),[3] and fruits (such as breadfruit and plantains).[4] Staple foods may also contain (depending on the region): olive oil, coconut oil and sugar (e.g., from plantains).[5][6][7]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nOf the more than 50,000 edible plant species in the world, only a few hundred contribute significantly to human food supplies. Although there are over 10,000 species in the cereal family, just a few have been widely cultivated over the past 2,000 years.\\r\\nThe staple food in different parts of the world is a function of weather patterns, local terrain, farming constraints, acquired tastes and ecosystems. For example, the main energy source staples in the average African diet are cereals (46 percent), roots and tubers (20 percent) and animal products (seven percent). In Western Europe the main staples in the average diet are animal products (33 percent), cereals (26 percent), and roots and tubers (four percent).\\r\\nMost of the global human population lives on a diet based on one or more of the following staples: rice, wheat, maize (corn), millet, sorghum, roots and tubers (potatoes, cassava, yams and taro), and animal products such as meat, milk, eggs, cheese and fish. Regional staples include rye, soybeans, barley, oats, and teff.\\r\\nJust 15 crop plants provide 90 percent of the world's food energy intake (exclusive of meat), with rice, maize, and wheat comprising two-thirds of human food consumption. The three are the staples of about 80 percent of the world population,[8] and rice feeds almost half of humanity.\\r\\nRoots and tubers, meanwhile, are important staples for over one billion people in the developing world, accounting for roughly 40 percent of the food eaten by half the population of sub-Saharan Africa. Roots and tubers are high in carbohydrates, calcium, and vitamin C, but low in protein. Cassava root is a major staple food in the developing world, providing a basic diet for around 500 million people.\\r\\nWith economic development and free trade, many countries have shifted away from low-nutrient-density staple foods to higher-nutrient-density staples, as well as towards greater meat consumption. Despite this trend, there is growing recognition of the importance of traditional staple crops in nutrition.[citation needed] Efforts are underway to identify better strains with superior nutrition, disease resistance, and higher yields.[citation needed]\\r\\nSome foods like quinoa  a pseudocereal grain that originally came from the Andes  were also staple foods centuries ago.[9] Oca, ulluku and amaranth seed are other foods claimed to be historical Andean staples.[10] Pemmican was a staple of the Plains Indians of North America.[11] In 2010, the global consumption of \\"speciality grains\\" such as quinoa was very small compared to other staples such as rice, wheat, and maize.[citation needed] These grains, once popular but then forgotten, are being reevaluated and reintroduced.[citation needed]\\r\\nMost staple food is produced using modern and conventional farming practices. However, the production of staple food using organic farming methods is growing.\\r\\nRice is most commonly cooked and eaten as entire grains, but most other cereals are milled into flour or meal, which is used to make bread, noodles/ pasta, porridges and \\"mushes\\" like mealie pap. Mashed root vegetables can be used to make porridge-like dishes, including poi and fufu. Pulses (such as chickpeas, from which gram flour is made) and starchy root vegetables such as canna rhizomes can also be made into flour.\\r\\nAlthough nutritious, vegetable staples generally do not provide a full range of nutrients, so other foods need to be added to the diet, to ward off malnutrition. The deficiency disease pellagra is associated with a diet consisting primarily of maize; the disease beriberi with a diet of white (refined) rice.[17]\\r\\nResearch published in the journal Nature has indicated that the nutritional value of some staple foods are negatively impacted by higher levels of carbon dioxide.[18]\\r\\nThe following table shows the nutrient content of major staple vegetable foods in raw form, with the caveat that raw grains are not edible and cannot be digested. Raw grains must be sprouted, or prepared and cooked for human consumption.

The scientific name Crotalus is derived from the Greek ?ϫ, meaning \\"castanet\\".[2] The name Sistrurus is the Latinized form of the Greek word for \\"tail rattler\\" (ҷ??, seistrouros) and shares its root with the ancient Egyptian musical instrument the sistrum, a type of rattle.[3] The 36 known species of rattlesnakes have between 65 and 70 subspecies,[4] all native to the Americas, ranging from southern Alberta and Saskatchewan and southern British Columbia in Canada to central Argentina.\\r\\n\\r\\nRattlesnakes are predators that live in a wide array of habitats, hunting small animals such as birds and rodents.\\r\\n\\r\\nRattlesnakes receive their name from the rattle located at the end of their tails, which makes a loud rattling noise when vibrated that deters predators or serves as a warning to passers-by.[5] However, rattlesnakes fall prey to hawks, weasels, king snakes, and a variety of other species. Rattlesnakes are heavily preyed upon as neonates, while they are still weak and immature. Large numbers of rattlesnakes are killed by humans. Rattlesnake populations in many areas are severely threatened by habitat destruction, poaching, and extermination campaigns.\\r\\n\\r\\nRattlesnakes are the leading contributor to snakebite injuries in North America. However, rattlesnakes rarely bite unless provoked or threatened; if treated promptly, the bites are seldom fatal.\\r\\n\\r\\nRattlesnakes are native to the Americas, living in diverse habitats from southwestern Canada to central Argentina. The large majority of species lives in the American Southwest and Mexico. Four species may be found east of the Mississippi River, and two in South America. In the United States, the states with the most types of rattlesnakes are Texas and Arizona.\\r\\n\\r\\nRattlesnakes are found in almost every type of habitat capable of supporting terrestrial ectothermic vertebrates, but individual species can have extremely specific habitat requirements, only able to live within certain plant associations in a narrow range of altitudes. Most species live near open, rocky areas. Rocks offer them cover from predators, plentiful prey (e.g. rodents, lizards, insects, etc. that live amidst the rocks), and open basking areas. However, rattlesnakes can also be found in a wide variety of other habitats including prairies, marshes, deserts, and forests.[6] Rattlesnakes prefer a temperature range between 80 and 90F (26 and 32C), but can survive temperatures below freezing, recovering from brief exposure to temperatures as low as 4F (?16C), and surviving for several days in temperatures as low as 37F (3C).[7]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe most probable ancestral area of rattlesnakes is the Sierra Madre Occidental region in Mexico. The most probable vegetation or habitat of the ancestral area appears to be pine-oak forests.[8] Feeding habits play an important ecological role by limiting the size of rodent populations, which prevents crop damage and stabilizes ecosystems.[9]\\r\\n\\r\\nRattlesnakes consume mice, rats, small birds, and other small animals.[10] They lie in wait for their prey, or hunt for it in holes.[11] The prey is killed quickly with a venomous bite as opposed to constriction. If the bitten prey moves away before dying, the rattlesnake can follow it by its scent.[12][13] When it locates the fallen prey, it checks for signs of life by prodding with its snout, flicking its tongue, and using its sense of smell. Once the prey has become incapacitated, the rattlesnake locates its head by odors emitted from the mouth. The prey is then ingested head-first, which allows wings and limbs to fold at the joints in a manner which minimizes the girth of the meal.[14] The gastric fluids of rattlesnakes are extremely powerful, allowing for the digestion of flesh, as well as bone. Optimal digestion occurs when the snake maintains a body temperature between 80 and 85?F (25 and 29?C). If the prey is small, the rattlesnake often continues hunting. If it was an adequate meal, the snake finds a warm, safe location in which to coil up and rest until the prey is digested.[15]\\r\\n\\r\\nRattlesnakes are believed to require at least their own body weight in water annually to remain hydrated. The method in which they drink depends on the water source. In larger bodies of water (streams, ponds, etc.), they  submerge their heads and ingest water by opening and closing their jaws, which sucks in water. If drinking dew, or drinking from small puddles, they sip the liquid either by capillary action or by flattening and flooding their lower jaws.[16]\\r\\n\\r\\nNewborn rattlesnakes are heavily preyed upon by a variety of species, including ravens, crows, roadrunners, raccoons, opossums, skunks, coyotes, weasels, whipsnakes, kingsnakes, and racers. Neonates of the smaller crotaline species are frequently killed and eaten by small predatory birds such as jays, kingfishers, and shrikes. Some species of ants in the genus Formica are known to prey upon neonates, and  Solenopsis invicta (fire ants) likely do, as well. On occasion, hungry adult rattlesnakes cannibalize neonates. The small proportion (often as few as 20%) of rattlesnakes that make it to their second year are heavily preyed upon by a variety of larger predators including coyotes, eagles, hawks, owls, falcons, feral pigs, badgers, indigo snakes, and kingsnakes.[17]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe common kingsnake (Lampropeltis getula), a constrictor, is immune to the venom of rattlesnakes and other vipers, and rattlesnakes form part of its natural diet. Rattlesnakes sense kingsnakes' presence by their odor.[18] When they realize a kingsnake is nearby, they begin enacting a set of defensive postures known as \\"body bridging\\". Unlike its normal erect and coiled defensive-striking posture, the rattlesnake keeps its head low to the ground in an attempt to prevent the kingsnake from gaining a hold on it (the head being the first part of the rattlesnake to be ingested). The rattlesnake jerks its body about, while bridging its back upwards, forming an elevated coil which faces the kingsnake. The elevated coil is used to strike the attacker, and is also used to shield the head from the kingsnake.[19]\\r\\n\\r\\nLike all pit vipers, rattlesnakes have two organs that can sense radiation: their eyes, and a set of heat-sensing \\"pits\\" on their faces that enable them to locate prey and move towards it, based on the prey's thermal radiation signature. These pits have a relatively short effective range of about 1?ft, but give the rattlesnake a distinctive advantage in hunting for warm-blooded creatures at night.[20][21]\\r\\n\\r\\nAside from this pair of simple eyes, rattlesnakes are able to detect thermal radiation emitted by warm-blooded organisms in their environment.  Functioning optically like a pinhole camera eye, thermal radiation, in the form of infrared wavelength light, enters, passes through the opening of the pit and strikes the pit membrane located in the back wall, warming this part of the organ. Due to the extremely high density of these heat-sensitive receptors innervating this membrane, the rattlesnake can detect temperature changes of 0.003?C or less in its immediate surroundings. Infrared cues from these receptors are transmitted to the brain by the trigeminal nerve, where they are used to create thermal maps of the snakes surroundings. Due to the small sizes of the pit openings, typically these thermals images are low in resolution and contrast. Nevertheless, rattlesnakes superimpose visual images created from information from the eyes with these thermal images from the pit organs to more accurately visualize their surroundings in low levels of light.  Research conducted recently on the molecular mechanism of this ability suggests the temperature sensitivity of these pit organs is closely linked to the activity of transient receptor potential ankyrin 1, a temperature-sensitive ion channel saturated in the pit membrane.\\r\\n\\r\\nRattlesnake eyes, which contain a large number of rod cells, are well adapted to nocturnal use.[22][23] However, rattlesnakes are not exclusively nocturnal, and their vision is more acute during daylight conditions.[23] Rattlesnakes also possess cone cells, which means  they are capable of some form of color vision. The rattlesnake eye lacks a fovea, making it impossible for them to see sharply defined images. Instead, they mostly rely on the perception of movement.[22] Rattlesnake eyes are capable of horizontal rotation, but they do not appear to move their eyeballs to follow moving objects.[24]\\r\\n\\r\\nRattlesnakes have an exceptionally keen sense of smell. They can sense olfactory stimuli both through their nostrils and by flicking their tongues, which carry scent-bearing particles to the Jacobson's organs in the roof of their mouths.[25][26]\\r\\n\\r\\nLike all snakes, rattlesnakes lack external ear openings, and the structures of their middle ear are not as highly specialized as those of other vertebrates, such as mammals. Thus, their sense of hearing is not very effective, but they are capable of sensing vibrations in the ground, passed by the skeleton to the auditory nerve.[22]\\r\\n\\r\\nRattlesnake fangs are connected by venom ducts to large venom glands near the outer edge of the upper jaw, towards the rear of the head. When the rattlesnake bites, muscles on the sides of the venom glands contract, which squeezes the venom through the ducts and into the fangs. When the fangs are not in use, they remain folded against the palate.[27][28]\\r\\n\\r\\nRattlesnakes are born with fully functioning fangs and venom, and are capable of killing prey at birth.[17][29] Adult rattlesnakes shed their fangs every 6ÿ10 weeks. At least three pairs of replacement fangs lie behind the functional pair.[30]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe venom is hemotoxic, destroying tissue, causing necrosis and coagulopathy (disrupted blood clotting).[31] In the U.S., the tiger rattlesnake (C. tigris) and some varieties of the Mojave rattlesnake (C. scutulatus) also have a presynaptic neurotoxic venom component known as Mojave type A toxin, which can cause severe paralysis.[31][32][33] Although it has a comparatively low venom yield,[34] the venom toxicity of C. tigris is considered to be among the highest of all rattlesnake venoms, and among the highest of all snakes in the Western Hemisphere based on LD50 studies conducted on laboratory mice. C. scutulatus is also widely regarded as producing one of the most toxic snake venoms in the Americas, based on LD50 studies in laboratory mice.[35]\\r\\n\\r\\nRattlesnake venom is a mixture of five to 15 enzymes, various metal ions, biogenic amines, lipids, free amino acids, proteins, and polypeptides. It contains components designed to immobilize and disable the prey, as well as digestive enzymes which break down tissue to prepare for later ingestion.[26][30] The venom is very stable, and retains its toxicity for many years in storage.[26]\\r\\n\\r\\nOlder snakes possess more potent venom, and larger snakes are frequently capable of storing larger volumes of it.[36]\\r\\n\\r\\nAccording to Rubio, \\"The most widely accepted hypothesis for the evolution of the rattle is that the rattle is a warning device for predatory animals that might be a threat to the rattlesnake. It produces a signal to drive them away.\\"[37]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe rattle is composed of a series of hollow, interlocked segments made of keratin, which are created by modifying the scales that cover the tip of the tail. The contraction of special \\"shaker\\" muscles in the tail causes these segments to vibrate against one another, making the rattling noise (which is amplified because the segments are hollow) in a behavior known as tail vibration.[1][38][39] The muscles that cause the rattle to shake are some of the fastest known, firing 50 times per second on average, sustained for up to three hours.[40]\\r\\n\\r\\nAt birth, a prebutton is present at the tip of the snake's tail; it is replaced by the button several days later when the first skin is shed. However, no sound can be made by the rattle until a second segment is added when the skin is shed again.[41] A new rattle segment is added each time the snake sheds its skin, and the snake may shed its skin several times a year, depending on food supply and growth rate.\\r\\n\\r\\nRattlesnakes travel with their rattles held up to protect them from damage, but in spite of this precaution, their day-to-day activities in the wild still cause them to regularly break off end segments. Because of this, the age of a rattlesnake is not related to the number of rattles on its tail.[1][39][40]\\r\\n\\r\\nOne of the differentiating features of males and females is the males have thicker and longer tails (because they contain the inverted hemipenes). Also, the tails of males taper gradually from the body, whereas the tails of females narrow abruptly at the vent.[42]\\r\\n\\r\\nRattlesnake skin has  a set of overlapping scales which cover the entire body, providing protection from a variety of threats including dehydration and physical trauma.[43] The typical rattlesnake, genus Crotalus, has the top of its head covered with small scales, except, with a few species, a few crowded plates directly over the snout.[44]  The skin of snakes is highly sensitive to contact, tension, and pressure; they are capable of feeling pain.[45]\\r\\n\\r\\nAn important function of the skin is the sensation of changes in air temperature, which can guide the snakes towards warm basking/shelter locations.[46] All snakes are ectotherms. To maintain a stable body temperature, they exchange heat with their external environments. Snakes often move into open, sunny areas to absorb heat from the sun and warmed earth, a behavior known as basking. Nerves in the skin regulate the flow of blood into the veins near the surface. Rubio states, \\"The skin's acceptance of radiant energy, its ability to determine the temperature, and the snake's ability to move toward or away from one temperature gradient to another are among the most important behavioral actions in its daily life.\\"[45]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe skin of rattlesnakes is intricately patterned in a manner that camouflages them from their predators.[46][47] Rattlesnakes do not generally have bright or showy colors (reds, yellows, blues, etc.), instead relying on subtle earth tones that resemble the surrounding environment.[48]\\r\\n\\r\\nCreases in the epidermal tissue connect the scales of rattlesnakes. When ingesting large prey, these creases can unfold, allowing the skin to expand to envelop a much greater volume. The skin appears to tightly stretch to accommodate the meal, but in reality, the skin is simply smoothing out from its creased state and is not under very high tension.[49]\\r\\n\\r\\nMost rattlesnake species mate during the summer or fall, while some species mate only in the spring, or during both the spring and fall.[50]\\r\\n\\r\\nFemales secrete small amounts of sex pheromones, which leave a trail the males follow using their tongues and Jacobson's organs as  guides.[50] Once a receptive female has been located, the male  often spends several days following her around (a behavior not common outside of the mating season), frequently touching and rubbing her in an attempt to stimulate her.[51][52]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe males of some species, such as timber rattlesnakes (C. horridus), fight each other during the mating season, in competition over females. These fights known as \\"combat dances\\" consist of the two males intertwining the anterior portion of their bodies, often with their heads and necks held vertically. The larger males usually end up driving the smaller males away.[53][54]\\r\\n\\r\\nAlthough many kinds of snakes and other reptiles are oviparous (lay eggs), rattlesnakes are ovoviviparous (give birth to live young after carrying eggs inside).[55] The female produces the ova (\\"eggs\\") in her ovaries, after which they pass through the body cavity and into one of her two oviducts. The ova are arranged in a continuous chain in a coiled section of the oviduct, known as the \\"tuba\\".[51] Male rattlesnakes have sexual organs known as hemipenes, located in the base of the tail. The hemipenis is retracted inside of the body when mating is not occurring. Females can store semen for months in internal recesses known as spermathecae, which permits them to mate during the fall, but not fertilize the ova until the following spring.[51] The Arizona black rattlesnake (C. oreganus cerberus), has been observed to exhibit complex social behavior reminiscent of that in mammals. Females often remain with their young in nests for several weeks, and mothers have been observed cooperatively parenting their broods.[56]\\r\\n\\r\\nRattlesnakes generally take several years to mature, and females usually reproduce only once every three years.[57]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the colder winter months, some rattlesnake species enter a period of brumation, which is dormancy similar to hibernation.\\r\\nThey often gather together for brumation in  large numbers (sometimes over 1,000 snakes), huddling together inside underground \\"rattlesnake dens\\" or hibernacula.[58][59] Rattlesnakes regularly share their winter burrows with a wide variety of other species (such as turtles, small mammals, invertebrates, and other types of snakes).[58]\\r\\n\\r\\nRattlesnakes often return to the same den, year after year, sometimes traveling several miles to get there. It is not known exactly how the rattlesnakes find their way back to the dens each year, but may use a combination of pheromone trails and visual cues (e.g., topography, celestial navigation, and solar orientation).[60]\\r\\n\\r\\nSpecies with long periods of brumation tend to have much lower reproductive rates than those with shorter brumation periods, or those that do not brumate all. Female timber rattlesnakes in high peaks in the Appalachian Mountains of New England reproduce every three years on average; the lance-headed rattlesnake (C. polystictus), native to the warm climate of Mexico, reproduces annually.[61]\\r\\n\\r\\nLike most other snakes, rattlesnakes aestivate during very hot or dry periods, which is why they are rarely seen during the hottest and driest months of summer.[62]\\r\\n\\r\\nRattlesnakes tend to avoid developed areas, preferring undisturbed, natural habitats. Rapid habitat destruction by humans, mass killings during events such as rattlesnake round-ups, and deliberate extermination campaigns all pose threats to rattlesnake populations in many areas. Several species of rattlesnakes, such as the timber rattlesnake, massasauga, and canebrake rattlesnake, are listed as threatened or endangered in many U.S. states.[63]\\r\\n\\r\\nA large number of rattlesnakes die from being run over by cars.[17]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn more heavily populated and trafficked areas, reports have been increasing of rattlesnakes that do not rattle. This phenomenon is commonly attributed to selective pressure by humans, who often kill the snakes when they are discovered.[64] Non-rattling snakes are more likely to go unnoticed, so survive to reproduce offspring that, like themselves, are less likely to rattle.\\r\\n\\r\\nRattlesnakes are the leading cause of snakebite injuries in North America and a significant cause in Central and South America.[33][65]\\r\\n\\r\\nRattlesnakes tend to avoid wide-open spaces where they cannot hide from predators, and generally avoid humans if they are aware of their approach.[66] Rattlesnakes rarely bite unless they feel threatened or provoked. A majority of victims (about 72%[67]) are males, often young and intoxicated. Around half of bites occur in cases where the victim saw the snake, yet made no effort to move away.[26]\\r\\n\\r\\nCaution is advised even when snakes are believed to be dead; rattlesnake heads can see, flick the tongue, and inflict venomous bites for up to an hour after being severed from the body.[68][69]\\r\\n\\r\\nAn estimated 7,000 to 8,000 people are bitten by venomous snakes in the United States each year, with about five deaths.[70] The most important factor in survival following a severe envenomation is the time elapsed between the bite and treatment. Most deaths occur between six and 48 hours after the bite. If antivenom treatment is given within two hours of the bite, the probability of recovery is greater than 99%.[71]\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen a bite occurs, the amount of venom injected is under voluntary control by the snake. The amount released depends on a variety of factors, including the condition of the snake (e.g., having long, healthy fangs and a full venom sack) and its temperament (an angry, hungry snake that has just been stepped on vs. a satiated snake that was merely surprised by walking near it).[72] About 20% of bites result in no envenomation at all. A lack of burning pain and edema 3?8?in (1?cm) away from the fang marks after one hour suggests either no or minimal envenomation occurred. A lack of edema or erythema in the area of the bite after eight hours indicates a lack of envenomation for most rattlesnake bites.[73]\\r\\n\\r\\nCommon symptoms include swelling, severe pain, tingling, weakness, anxiety, nausea and vomiting, hemorrhaging, perspiration, and eventually heart failure.[72][74] Local pain following envenomation is often intense, increasing with the ensuing edema.[72] Children generally experience more severe symptoms because they receive a larger amount of venom per unit of body mass.[73]\\r\\n\\r\\nAntivenin, often referred to as antivenom, is commonly used to treat the effects of local and systemic pit viper envenomations.[75] The first step in the production of crotaline antivenin is collecting (\\"milking\\") the venom of a live rattlesnakeusually from the western diamondback (Crotalus atrox), eastern diamondback (Crotalus adamanteus), South American rattlesnake (Crotalus durissis terrificus), or fer-de-lance (Bothrops atrox). The extracted venom is then diluted and injected into horses, goats, or sheep, whose immune systems produce antibodies that protect from the toxic effects of the venom. These antibodies accumulate in the blood, which is then extracted and centrifuged to separate the red blood cells. The resulting serum is purified into a lyophilized powder, which is packaged for distribution and later use by human patients.[76][77]\\r\\n\\r\\nBecause antivenin is derived from animal antibodies, people generally display an allergic response during infusion, known as serum sickness.[78][79]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the United States, more than 15,000 domesticated animals are bitten by snakes each year. Rattlesnake envenomations account for 80% of the deadly incidents.[80]\\r\\n\\r\\nDogs are most commonly bitten on the front legs and head. Horses generally receive bites on the muzzle, and cattle on their tongues and muzzles. If a domesticated animal is bitten, the hair around the bite should be removed, so  the wound can be clearly seen. The crotaline Fab antivenin has been shown to be effective in the treatment of canine rattlesnake bites. Symptoms include swelling, slight bleeding, sensitivity, shaking, and anxiety.[36]\\r\\n\\r\\nAztec paintings, Central American temples, and the great burial mounds in the southeastern United States are frequently adorned with depictions of rattlesnakes, often within the symbols and emblems of the most powerful deities.[81]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Feathered Serpent of Mesoamerican religion was depicted as having the combined features of the quetzal and rattlesnake.[82] The Ancient Maya considered the rattlesnake to be a \\"vision serpent\\" that acted as a conduit to the \\"otherworld\\".[83]\\r\\n\\r\\nRattlesnakes are a key element in Aztec mythology and were widely represented in Aztec art, including sculptures, jewelry, and architectural elements.\\r\\n\\r\\nMembers of some Christian sects in the southern United States are regularly bitten while participating in \\"snake handling\\" rituals. Snake handling is when people hold venomous snakes, unprotected, as part of a religious service inspired by a literal interpretation of the Bible verses Mark 16:17-18 which reads, \\"In my name ... they will pick up snakes with their hands\\".[26][84]\\r\\n\\r\\nJournalist Alistair Cooke claimed that rattlesnake tastes \\"just like chicken, only tougher\\".[85] Others have compared the flavor to a wide range of other meats, including veal, frog, tortoise, quail, fish, rabbit, and even canned tuna.[86] Methods of preparation include barbecueing[87] and frying; author Maud Newton, following a recipe by Harry Crews, described the taste, \\"at least when breaded and fried, like a sinewy, half-starved tilapia.\\"[88]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe rattlesnake became a symbolic animal for the Colonials during the Revolutionary War period, and is depicted prominently on the Gadsden Flag.

In practice, this means that they often retain a limited discrimination along the redÿgreen axis of color space, although their ability to separate colors in this dimension is reduced. Color blindness very rarely refers to complete monochromatism.[3]\\r\\nDichromats often confuse red and green items. For example, they may find it difficult to distinguish a Braeburn apple from a Granny Smith or red from green of traffic lights without other cluesfor example, shape or position. Dichromats tend to learn to use texture and shape clues and so may be able to penetrate camouflage that has been designed to deceive individuals with normal color vision.[4]\\r\\nColors of traffic lights are confusing to some dichromats as there is insufficient apparent difference between the red/amber traffic lights and sodium street lamps; also, the green can be confused with a grubby white lamp. This is a risk on high-speed undulating roads where angular cues cannot be used. British Rail color lamp signals use more easily identifiable colors: The red is blood red, the amber is yellow and the green is a bluish color. Most British road traffic lights are mounted vertically on a black rectangle with a white border (forming a \\"sighting board\\") and so dichromats can more easily look for the position of the light within the rectangletop, middle or bottom. In the eastern provinces of Canada horizontally mounted traffic lights are generally differentiated by shape to facilitate identification for those with color blindness.[citation needed] In the United States, this is not done by shape but by position, as the red light is always on the left if the light is horizontal, or on top if the light is vertical. However, a lone flashing light (e.g. red for stop, yellow for caution) is still problematic.\\r\\nNormal sight\\r\\nDeuteranopia sight\\r\\nTritanopia sight\\r\\nMonochromacy sight\\r\\nColor vision deficiencies can be classified as acquired or inherited.\\r\\nColor blindness is typically an inherited genetic disorder. It is most commonly inherited from mutations on the X chromosome but the mapping of the human genome has shown there are many causative mutationsmutations capable of causing color blindness originate from at least 19 different chromosomes and 56 different genes (as shown online at the Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man (OMIM)). Two of the most common inherited forms of color blindness are protanomaly (and, more rarely, protanopia ÿ the two together often known as \\"protans\\") and deuteranomaly (or, more rarely, deuteranopia ÿ the two together often referred to as \\"deutans\\").[12] Both \\"protans\\" and \\"deutans\\" (of which the deutans are by far the most common) are known as \\"redÿgreen color-blind\\" which is present in about 8 percent of human males and 0.6 percent of females of Northern European ancestry.[13]\\r\\nSome of the inherited diseases known to cause color blindness are:\\r\\nInherited color blindness can be congenital (from birth), or it can commence in childhood or adulthood. Depending on the mutation, it can be stationary, that is, remain the same throughout a person's lifetime, or progressive. As progressive phenotypes involve deterioration of the retina and other parts of the eye, certain forms of color blindness can progress to legal blindness, i.e., an acuity of 6/60 (20/200) or worse, and often leave a person with complete blindness.\\r\\nColor blindness always pertains to the cone photoreceptors in retinas, as the cones are capable of detecting the color frequencies of light.\\r\\nAbout 8 percent of males, and 0.6 percent of females, are red-green color blind in some way or another, whether it is one color, a color combination, or another mutation.[14] The reason males are at a greater risk of inheriting an X linked mutation is that males only have one X chromosome (XY, with the Y chromosome carrying altogether different genes than the X chromosome), and females have two (XX); if a woman inherits a normal X chromosome in addition to the one that carries the mutation, she will not display the mutation. Men do not have a second X chromosome to override the chromosome that carries the mutation. If 8% of variants of a given gene are defective, the probability of a single copy being defective is 8%, but the probability that two copies are both defective is 0.08 G 0.08 = 0.0064, or just 0.64%.\\r\\nOther causes of color blindness include brain or retinal damage caused by shaken baby syndrome, accidents and other trauma which produce swelling of the brain in the occipital lobe, and damage to the retina caused by exposure to ultraviolet light (10ÿ300?nm). Damage often presents itself later on in life.\\r\\nColor blindness may also present itself in the spectrum of degenerative diseases of the eye, such as age-related macular degeneration, and as part of the retinal damage caused by diabetes. Another factor that may affect color blindness includes a deficiency in Vitamin A.[15]\\r\\nSome subtle forms of colorblindness may be associated with chronic solvent-induced encephalopathy (CSE), caused by longtime exposure to solvent vapors.[16]\\r\\nRedÿgreen color blindness can be caused by ethambutol,[17] a drug used in the treatment of tuberculosis.\\r\\nBased on clinical appearance, color blindness may be described as total or partial. Total color blindness is much less common than partial color blindness.[18] There are two major types of color blindness: those who have difficulty distinguishing between red and green, and who have difficulty distinguishing between blue and yellow.[19][20]\\r\\nImmunofluorescent imaging is a way to determine redÿgreen color coding. Conventional color coding is difficult for individuals with redÿgreen color blindness (protanopia or deuteranopia) to discriminate. Replacing red with magenta or green with turquoise improves visibility for such individuals.[21]\\r\\nThe different kinds of inherited color blindness result from partial or complete loss of function of one or more of the different cone systems. When one cone system is compromised, dichromacy results. The most frequent forms of human color blindness result from problems with either the middle or long wavelength sensitive cone systems, and involve difficulties in discriminating reds, yellows, and greens from one another. They are collectively referred to as \\"redÿgreen color blindness\\", though the term is an over-simplification and is somewhat misleading. Other forms of color blindness are much more rare. They include problems in discriminating blues from greens and yellows from reds/pinks, and the rarest forms of all, complete color blindness or monochromacy, where one cannot distinguish any color from grey, as in a black-and-white movie or photograph.\\r\\nProtanopes, deuteranopes, and tritanopes are dichromats; that is, they can match any color they see with some mixture of just two primary colors (whereas normally humans are trichromats and require three primary colors). These individuals normally know they have a color vision problem and it can affect their lives on a daily basis. Two percent of the male population exhibit severe difficulties distinguishing between red, orange, yellow, and green. A certain pair of colors, that seem very different to a normal viewer, appear to be the same color (or different shades of same color) for such a dichromat. The terms protanopia, deuteranopia, and tritanopia come from Greek and literally mean \\"inability to see (anopia) with the first (prot-), second (deuter-), or third (trit-) [cone]\\", respectively.\\r\\nAnomalous trichromacy is the least serious type of color deficiency.[22] People with protanomaly, deuteranomaly, or tritanomaly are trichromats, but the color matches they make differ from the normal. They are called anomalous trichromats. In order to match a given spectral yellow light, protanomalous observers need more red light in a red/green mixture than a normal observer, and deuteranomalous observers need more green. From a practical standpoint though, many protanomalous and deuteranomalous people have very little difficulty carrying out tasks that require normal color vision. Some may not even be aware that their color perception is in any way different from normal.\\r\\nProtanomaly and deuteranomaly can be diagnosed using an instrument called an anomaloscope, which mixes spectral red and green lights in variable proportions, for comparison with a fixed spectral yellow. If this is done in front of a large audience of males, as the proportion of red is increased from a low value, first a small proportion of the audience will declare a match, while most will see the mixed light as greenish; these are the deuteranomalous observers. Next, as more red is added the majority will say that a match has been achieved. Finally, as yet more red is added, the remaining, protanomalous, observers will declare a match at a point where normal observers will see the mixed light as definitely reddish.[citation needed]\\r\\nProtanopia, deuteranopia, protanomaly, and deuteranomaly are commonly inherited forms of redÿgreen color blindness which affect a substantial portion of the human population. Those affected have difficulty with discriminating red and green hues due to the absence or mutation of the red or green retinal photoreceptors.[12][23] It is sex-linked: genetic redÿgreen color blindness affects males much more often than females, because the genes for the red and green color receptors are located on the X chromosome, of which males have only one and females have two. Females (46, XX) are redÿgreen color blind only if both their X chromosomes are defective with a similar deficiency, whereas males (46, XY) are color blind if their single X chromosome is defective.[24]\\r\\nThe gene for redÿgreen color blindness is transmitted from a color blind male to all his daughters who are heterozygote carriers and are usually unaffected. In turn, a carrier woman has a fifty percent chance of passing on a mutated X chromosome region to each of her male offspring. The sons of an affected male will not inherit the trait from him, since they receive his Y chromosome and not his (defective) X chromosome. Should an affected male have children with a carrier or colorblind woman, their daughters may be colorblind by inheriting an affected X chromosome from each parent.[24]\\r\\nBecause one X chromosome is inactivated at random in each cell during a woman's development, deuteranomalous heterozygotes (i.e. female carriers of deuteranomaly) are potentially tetrachromats, because they will have the normal long wave (red) receptors, the normal medium wave (green) receptors, the abnormal medium wave (deuteranomalous) receptors and the normal autosomal short wave (blue) receptors in their retinas.[25][26][27] The same applies to the carriers of protanomaly (who have two types of short wave receptors, normal medium wave receptors, and normal autosomal short wave receptors in their retinas). If, by chance, a woman is heterozygous for both protanomaly and deuteranomaly she could be pentachromatic. This situation could arise if, for instance, she inherited the X chromosome with the abnormal long wave gene (but normal medium wave gene) from her mother who is a carrier of protanomaly, and her other X chromosome from a deuteranomalous father. Such a woman would have a normal and an abnormal long wave receptor, a normal and abnormal medium wave receptor, and a normal autosomal short wave receptor ÿ 5 different types of color receptors in all. The degree to which women who are carriers of either protanomaly or deuteranomaly are demonstrably tetrachromatic and require a mixture of four spectral lights to match an arbitrary light is very variable. In many cases it is almost unnoticeable, but in a minority the tetrachromacy is very pronounced.[25][26][27] However, Jameson et al.[28] have shown that with appropriate and sufficiently sensitive equipment all female carriers of red-green color blindness (i.e. heterozygous protanomaly, or heterozygous deuteranomaly) are tetrachromats to a greater or lesser extent.\\r\\nSince deuteranomaly is by far the most common form of red-green blindness among men of northwestern European descent (with an incidence of 8%), then the carrier frequency (and of potential deuteranomalous tetrachromacy) among the females of that genetic stock is 14.7% (= [92% G 8%] G 2).[24]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThose with tritanopia and tritanomaly have difficulty discriminating between bluish and greenish hues, as well as yellowish and reddish hues.\\r\\nColor blindness involving the inactivation of the short-wavelength sensitive cone system (whose absorption spectrum peaks in the bluish-violet) is called tritanopia or, loosely, blueÿyellow color blindness. The tritanope's neutral point occurs near a yellowish 570?nm; green is perceived at shorter wavelengths and red at longer wavelengths.[31] Mutation of the short-wavelength sensitive cones is called tritanomaly. Tritanopia is equally distributed among males and females. Jeremy H. Nathans (with the Howard Hughes Medical Institute) demonstrated that the gene coding for the blue receptor lies on chromosome 7, which is shared equally by males and females. Therefore, it is not sex-linked. This gene does not have any neighbor whose DNA sequence is similar. Blue color blindness is caused by a simple mutation in this gene. \\r\\n\\r\\nTotal color blindness is defined as the inability to see color. Although the term may refer to acquired disorders such as cerebral achromatopsia also known as color agnosia, it typically refers to congenital color vision disorders (i.e. more frequently rod monochromacy and less frequently cone monochromacy).[33][34]\\r\\nIn cerebral achromatopsia, a person cannot perceive colors even though the eyes are capable of distinguishing them. Some sources do not consider these to be true color blindness, because the failure is of perception, not of vision. They are forms of visual agnosia.[34]\\r\\nMonochromacy is the condition of possessing only a single channel for conveying information about color. Monochromats possess a complete inability to distinguish any colors and perceive only variations in brightness. It occurs in two primary forms:\\r\\nThe typical human retina contains two kinds of light cells: the rod cells (active in low light) and the cone cells (active in normal daylight). Normally, there are three kinds of cone cells, each containing a different pigment, which are activated when the pigments absorb light. The spectral sensitivities of the cones differ; one is most sensitive to short wavelengths, one to medium wavelengths, and the third to medium-to-long wavelengths within the visible spectrum, with their peak sensitivities in the blue, green, and yellow-green regions of the spectrum, respectively. The absorption spectra of the three systems overlap, and combine to cover the visible spectrum. These receptors are known as short (S), medium (M), and long (L) wavelength cones, but are also often referred to as blue, green, and red cones, although this terminology is inaccurate.[36]\\r\\nThe receptors are each responsive to a wide range of wavelengths. For example, the long wavelength \\"red\\" receptor has its peak sensitivity in the yellow-green, some way from the red end (longest wavelength) of the visible spectrum. The sensitivity of normal color vision actually depends on the overlap between the absorption ranges of the three systems: different colors are recognized when the different types of cone are stimulated to different degrees. Red light, for example, stimulates the long wavelength cones much more than either of the others, and reducing the wavelength causes the other two cone systems to be increasingly stimulated, causing a gradual change in hue.\\r\\nMany of the genes involved in color vision are on the X chromosome, making color blindness much more common in males than in females because males only have one X chromosome, while females have two. Because this is an X-linked trait, an estimated 2ÿ3% of women have a 4th color cone[25] and can be considered tetrachromats. One such woman has been reported to be a true or functional tetrachromat, as she can discriminate colors most other people can't.[26][27]\\r\\nThe Ishihara color test, which consists of a series of pictures of colored spots, is the test most often used to diagnose redÿgreen color deficiencies.[37] A figure (usually one or more Arabic digits) is embedded in the picture as a number of spots in a slightly different color, and can be seen with normal color vision, but not with a particular color defect. The full set of tests has a variety of figure/background color combinations, and enable diagnosis of which particular visual defect is present. The anomaloscope, described above, is also used in diagnosing anomalous trichromacy.\\r\\nPosition yourself about 75cm from your monitor so that the colour test image you are looking at is at eye level, read the description of the image and see what you can see!! It is not necessary in all cases to use the entire set of images. In a large scale examination the test can be simplified to six tests; test, one of tests 2 or 3, one of tests 4, 5, 6, or 7, one of tests 8 or 9, one of tests 10, 11, 12, or 13 and one of tests 14 or 15.[this quote needs a citation]\\r\\nBecause the Ishihara color test contains only numerals, it may not be useful in diagnosing young children, who have not yet learned to use numbers. In the interest of identifying these problems early on in life, alternative color vision tests were developed using only symbols (square, circle, car).\\r\\nBesides the Ishihara color test, the US Navy and US Army also allow testing with the Farnsworth Lantern Test. This test allows 30% of color deficient individuals, whose deficiency is not too severe, to pass.\\r\\nAnother test used by clinicians to measure chromatic discrimination is the Farnsworth-Munsell 100 hue test. The patient is asked to arrange a set of colored caps or chips to form a gradual transition of color between two anchor caps.[38]\\r\\nThe HRR color test (developed by Hardy, Rand, and Rittler) is a redÿgreen color test that, unlike the Ishihara, also has plates for the detection of the tritan defects.[39]\\r\\nMost clinical tests are designed to be fast, simple, and effective at identifying broad categories of color blindness. In academic studies of color blindness, on the other hand, there is more interest in developing flexible tests to collect thorough datasets, identify copunctal points, and measure just noticeable differences.[40]\\r\\nThere is generally no treatment to cure color deficiencies. The American Optometric Association reports a contact lens on one eye can increase the ability to differentiate between colors, though nothing can make you truly see the deficient color.[41]\\r\\nOptometrists can supply colored spectacle lenses or a single red-tint contact lens to wear on the non-dominant eye, but although this may improve discrimination of some colors, it can make other colors more difficult to distinguish. A 1981 review of various studies to evaluate the effect of the X-chrom contact lens concluded that, while the lens may allow the wearer to achieve a better score on certain color vision tests, it did not correct color vision in the natural environment.[42] A case history using the X-Chrom lens for a rod monochromat is reported[43] and an X-Chrom manual is online.[44]\\r\\nLenses that filter certain wavelengths of light can allow people with a cone anomaly, but not dichromacy, to see better separation of colors, especially those with classic \\"red/green\\" color blindness. They work by notching out wavelengths that strongly stimulate both red and green cones in a deuter- or protanomalous person, improving the distinction between the two cones' signals. As of 2013, sunglasses that notch out color wavelengths are available commercially.[45]\\r\\nMany applications for iPhone and iPad have been developed to help colorblind people to view the colors in a better way. Many applications launch a sort of simulation of colorblind vision to make normal-view people understand how the color-blinds see the world. Others allow a correction of the image grabbed from the camera with a special \\"daltonizer\\" algorithm.\\r\\nThe GNOME desktop environment provides colorblind accessibility using the gnome-mag and the libcolorblind software. Using a gnome applet, the user may switch a color filter on and off, choosing from a set of possible color transformations that will displace the colors in order to disambiguate them. The software enables, for instance, a colorblind person to see the numbers in the Ishihara test.\\r\\nColor blindness affects a large number of individuals, with protanopia and deuteranopia being the most common types.[12] In individuals with Northern European ancestry, as many as 8 percent of men and 0.4 percent of women experience congenital color deficiency.[47]\\r\\nThe number affected varies among groups. Isolated communities with a restricted gene pool sometimes produce high proportions of color blindness, including the less usual types. Examples include rural Finland, Hungary, and some of the Scottish islands.[citation needed] In the United States, about 7 percent of the male populationor about 10.5 million menand 0.4 percent of the female population either cannot distinguish red from green, or see red and green differently from how others do (Howard Hughes Medical Institute, 2006[clarification needed]). More than 95 percent of all variations in human color vision involve the red and green receptors in male eyes. It is very rare for males or females to be \\"blind\\" to the blue end of the spectrum.[48]\\r\\nThe first scientific paper on the subject of color blindness, Extraordinary facts relating to the vision of colours, was published by the English chemist John Dalton in 1798[50] after the realization of his own color blindness. Because of Dalton's work, the general condition has been called daltonism, although in English this term is now used only for deuteranopia.\\r\\nColor codes present particular problems for those with color deficiencies as they are often difficult or impossible for them to perceive.\\r\\nGood graphic design avoids using color coding or using color contrasts alone to express information;[51] this not only helps color blind people, but also aids understanding by normally sighted people by providing them with multiple reinforcing cues.[citation needed]\\r\\nDesigners need to take into account that color-blindness is highly sensitive to differences in material. For example, a redÿgreen colorblind person who is incapable of distinguishing colors on a map printed on paper may have no such difficulty when viewing the map on a computer screen or television. In addition, some color blind people find it easier to distinguish problem colors on artificial materials, such as plastic or in acrylic paints, than on natural materials, such as paper or wood. Third, for some color blind people, color can only be distinguished if there is a sufficient \\"mass\\" of color: thin lines might appear black, while a thicker line of the same color can be perceived as having color.[citation needed]\\r\\nDesigners should also note that redÿblue and yellowÿblue color combinations are generally safe. So instead of the ever-popular \\"red means bad and green means good\\" system, using these combinations can lead to a much higher ability to use color coding effectively. This will still cause problems for those with monochromatic color blindness, but it is still something worth considering.[52]\\r\\nWhen the need to process visual information as rapidly as possible arises, for example in an emergency situation, the visual system may operate only in shades of gray, with the extra information load in adding color being dropped.[citation needed] This is an important possibility to consider when designing, for example, emergency brake handles or emergency phones.\\r\\nColor blindness may make it difficult or impossible for a person to engage in certain occupations. Persons with color blindness may be legally or practically barred from occupations in which color perception is an essential part of the job (e.g., mixing paint colors), or in which color perception is important for safety (e.g., operating vehicles in response to color-coded signals). This occupational safety principle originates from the Lagerlunda train crash of 1875 in Sweden. Following the crash, Professor Alarik Frithiof Holmgren, a physiologist, investigated and concluded that the color blindness of the engineer (who had died) had caused the crash. Professor Holmgren then created the first test using different-colored skeins to exclude people from jobs in the transportation industry on the basis of color blindness.[53] However, there is a claim that there is no firm evidence that color deficiency did cause the collision, or that it might have not been the sole cause.[54]\\r\\nColor vision is important for occupations using telephone or computer networking cabling, as the individual wires inside the cables are color-coded using green, orange, brown, blue and white colors.[55] Electronic wiring, transformers, resistors, and capacitors are color-coded as well, using black, brown, red, orange, yellow, green, blue, violet, gray, white, silver, gold.[56]\\r\\nSome countries have refused to grant driving licenses to individuals with color blindness. In Romania, there is an ongoing campaign to remove the legal restrictions that prohibit colorblind citizens from getting drivers' licenses.[57]\\r\\nThe usual justification for such restrictions is that drivers of motor vehicles must be able to recognize color-coded signals, such as traffic lights or warning lights.[52]\\r\\nWhile many aspects of aviation depend on color coding, only a few of them are critical enough to be interfered with by some milder types of color blindness. Some examples include color-gun signaling of aircraft that have lost radio communication, color-coded glide-path indications on runways, and the like. Some jurisdictions restrict the issuance of pilot credentials to persons who suffer from color blindness for this reason. Restrictions may be partial, allowing color-blind persons to obtain certification but with restrictions, or total, in which case color-blind persons are not permitted to obtain piloting credentials at all.[citation needed]\\r\\nIn the United States, the Federal Aviation Administration requires that pilots be tested for normal color vision as part of their medical clearance in order to obtain the required medical certificate, a prerequisite to obtaining a pilot's certification. If testing reveals color blindness, the applicant may be issued a license with restrictions, such as no night flying and no flying by color signalssuch a restriction effectively prevents a pilot from holding certain flying occupations, such as that of an airline pilot, although commercial pilot certification is still possible, and there are a few flying occupations that do not require night flight and thus are still available to those with restrictions due to color blindness (e.g., agricultural aviation). The government allows several types of tests, including medical standard tests (e.g., the Ishihara, Dvorine, and others) and specialized tests oriented specifically to the needs of aviation. If an applicant fails the standard tests, they will receive a restriction on their medical certificate that states: \\"Not valid for night flying or by color signal control\\". They may apply to the FAA to take a specialized test, administered by the FAA. Typically, this test is the \\"color vision light gun test\\". For this test an FAA inspector will meet the pilot at an airport with an operating control tower. The color signal light gun will be shone at the pilot from the tower, and they must identify the color. If they pass they may be issued a waiver, which states that the color vision test is no longer required during medical examinations. They will then receive a new medical certificate with the restriction removed. This was once a Statement of Demonstrated Ability (SODA), but the SODA was dropped, and converted to a simple waiver (letter) early in the 2000s.[58]\\r\\nResearch published in 2009 carried out by the City University of London's Applied Vision Research Centre, sponsored by the UK's Civil Aviation Authority and the US Federal Aviation Administration, has established a more accurate assessment of color deficiencies in pilot applicants' redÿgreen and yellowÿblue color range which could lead to a 35% reduction in the number of prospective pilots who fail to meet the minimum medical threshold.[59]\\r\\nInability to distinguish color does not necessarily preclude the ability to become a celebrated artist. The 20th century expressionist painter Clifton Pugh, three-time winner of Australia's Archibald Prize, on biographical, gene inheritance and other grounds has been identified as a protanope.[60] 19th century French artist Charles Mryon became successful by concentrating on etching rather than painting after he was diagnosed as having a redÿgreen deficiency.[61]\\r\\nA Brazilian court ruled that people with color blindness are protected by the Inter-American Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Person with Disabilities.[62][63][64]\\r\\nAt trial, it was decided that the carriers of color blindness have a right of access to wider knowledge, or the full enjoyment of their human condition.\\r\\nIn the United States, under federal anti-discrimination laws such as the Americans with Disabilities Act, color vision deficiencies have not been found to constitute a disability that triggers protection from workplace discrimination.[65]\\r\\nA famous traffic light on Tipperary Hill in Syracuse, New York, is upside-down due to the sentiments of its Irish American community,[66] but has been criticized due to the potential hazard it poses for color-blind persons.[67]\\r\\nSome tentative evidence finds that color blind people are better at penetrating certain color camouflages. Such findings may give an evolutionary reason for the high rate of redÿgreen color blindness.[4] There is also a study suggesting that people with some types of color blindness can distinguish colors that people with normal color vision are not able to distinguish.[68] In World War II, color blind observers were used to penetrate camouflage.[69]\\r\\nIn September 2009, the journal Nature reported that researchers at the University of Washington and University of Florida were able to give trichromatic vision to squirrel monkeys, which normally have only dichromatic vision, using gene therapy.[70]\\r\\nIn 2003, a cybernetic device called eyeborg was developed to allow the wearer to hear sounds representing different colors.[71] Achromatopsic artist Neil Harbisson was the first to use such a device in early 2004; the eyeborg allowed him to start painting in color by memorizing the sound corresponding to each color. In 2012, at a TED Conference, Harbisson explained how he could now perceive colors outside the ability of human vision.[72]","input":"What are the two types of color blindness?"},{"output":"Speaker of the United States House of Representatives","context":"The speaker of a deliberative assembly, especially a legislative body, is its presiding officer, or the chair.

The President of the Australian Senate is the presiding officer of the Australian Senate, the upper house of the Parliament of Australia.\\r\\nItalian parliamentarism is centered on the Presidents of the two Houses, vested in defense of the members and of the assembly as a whole;[4] so \\"the Speaker invites the representative of the Government not to deviate from the rules of parliamentary behavior\\".[5] Now constitutional community highlights changes also in this role.[6]\\r\\nIn Canada, the Speaker of the House of Commons is the individual elected to preside over the House of Commons, the elected lower house. The speaker is a Member of Parliament (MP) and is elected at the beginning of each new parliament by fellow MPs. The Speaker's role in presiding over Canada's House of Commons is similar to that of speakers elsewhere in other countries that use the Westminster system. The Speaker does not vote except in the case of a tie. By convention, if required to vote, the Speaker will vote in favour of continuing debate on a matter, but will not ultimately vote for a measure to be approved.\\r\\nThe Speaker of the Senate of Canada is the presiding officer of the Senate of Canada, the appointed upper house. The Speaker represents the Senate at official functions, rules on questions of parliamentary procedure and parliamentary privilege, and presides over debates and voting in the \\"Red Chamber\\". The Speaker of the Senate is appointed by the Governor General of Canada from amongst sitting senators upon the advice of the Prime Minister. The Speaker has a vote on all matters. In the event of a tie, the matter fails.\\r\\nAt the provincial level, the presiding officer of the provincial legidslatures is called the \\"Speaker\\" in all provinces except Quebec, where the term \\"President\\" is used. The presiding officer fulfills the same role as the Speaker of the House of Commons.\\r\\nIn Singapore, the Speaker of the Parliament of Singapore is the head officer of the country's legislature. By recent tradition, the Prime Minister nominates a person, who may or may not be an elected Member of Parliament (MP), for the role. The person's name is then proposed and seconded by the MPs, before being elected as Speaker.[7] The Constitution states that Parliament has the freedom to decide how to elect its Speaker.[8]\\r\\nWhile the Speaker does not have to be an elected MP, they must possess the qualifications to stand for election as an MP as provided for in the Constitution.[9] The Speaker also cannot be a Cabinet Minister or Parliamentary Secretary[10], and must resign from those positions prior to being elected as Speaker.\\r\\nThe Speaker is one of the few public sector roles which allow its office-holder to automatically qualify as a candidate in the Singapore presidential elections.[11]\\r\\nIn the United Kingdom, the Speaker of the House of Commons is the individual elected to preside over the elected House of Commons. The speaker is a Member of Parliament (MP) and is elected at the beginning of each new parliament by fellow MPs.\\r\\nThe Lord Speaker is the presiding officer of the House of Lords. The commonly used \\"Speaker of the House of Lords\\" is not correct. The presiding officer of the House of Lords was until recently the Lord Chancellor, who was also a member of the government (a cabinet member) and the head of the judicial branch. The Lord Chancellor did not have the same authority to discipline members of the Lords that the speaker of the Commons has in that house. The Lord Speaker is elected by the members of the House of Lords and is expected to be politically impartial.\\r\\nThe Speaker of the United States House of Representatives presides over the lower house of Congress, the House of Representatives. This post is second in line to the presidencyafter the vice presidentand is therefore the third highest-ranking national office overall. In practice, this post is the highest-ranking in Congress, because the president of the US Senate is the vice president, who has his/her office, and predominant responsibilities, at the White House, and therefore does not have a day-to-day presence at the Congress.\\r\\nIn the forty-nine states that have a bicameral legislature, the highest position in the lower house is usually called the \\"speaker\\". In Nebraskathe only state with a unicameral legislaturethe senators elect one senator to serve as \\"Speaker of the Nebraska Legislature\\". In Tennessee, the senators elect a \\"Speaker of the Senate\\" who presides over the Tennessee Senate and serves as lieutenant governor.\\r\\nThe presiding officer for an upper house of a bicameral legislature usually has a different title, although substantially the same duties.\\r\\nWhen the upper house is called a senate, the equivalent title is often President of the Senate. Australia, Chile, the United States and many other countries have upper houses with presiding officers titled \\"president\\". In several American republics, the vice president of the country serves as the president of the upper house.\\r\\nThis pattern is not universal, however. Some upper houses, including those of Canada, have a speaker.\\r\\nThe Presiding Officer of the National Assembly for Wales, Presiding Officer of the Scottish Parliament, and Presiding Officer of the Northern Ireland Assembly fulfill the same role as the speaker.","input":"Who is the presiding officer of the legislative house?"},{"output":"first published in 1886","context":"Strange Case of Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde is a gothic novella by the Scottish author Robert Louis Stevenson first published in 1886. The work is also known as The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde, Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde, or simply Jekyll & Hyde.[1] It is about a London lawyer named Gabriel John Utterson who investigates strange occurrences between his old friend, Dr Henry Jekyll,[2][3] and the evil Edward Hyde. The novella's impact is such that it has become a part of the language, with the very phrase \\"Jekyll and Hyde\\" coming to mean a person who is vastly different in moral character from one situation to the next.[4][5]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nStevenson had long been intrigued by the idea of how personalities can affect a human and how to incorporate the interplay of good and evil into a story. While still a teenager, he developed a script for a play about Deacon Brodie, which he later reworked with the help of W. E. Henley and which was produced for the first time in 1882.[6] In early 1884, he wrote the short story \\"Markheim\\", which he revised in 1884 for publication in a Christmas annual. According to his essay, \\"A Chapter on Dreams\\" (Scribner's, Jan. 1888), he racked his brains for an idea for a story and had a dream, and upon wakening had the intuition for two or three scenes that would appear in the story Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde. Biographer Graham Balfour quoted Stevenson's wife Fanny Stevenson:\\r\\nIn the small hours of one morning,[...]I was awakened by cries of horror from Louis. Thinking he had a nightmare, I awakened him. He said angrily: \\"Why did you wake me? I was dreaming a fine bogey tale.\\" I had awakened him at the first transformation scene.[7]\\r\\nLloyd Osbourne, Stevenson's stepson, wrote: \\"I don't believe that there was ever such a literary feat before as the writing of Dr Jekyll. I remember the first reading as though it were yesterday. Louis came downstairs in a fever; read nearly half the book aloud; and then, while we were still gasping, he was away again, and busy writing. I doubt if the first draft took so long as three days.\\"[7]\\r\\nInspiration may also have come from the writer's friendship with Edinburgh-based French teacher Eugene Chantrelle, who was convicted and executed for the murder of his wife in May 1878.[8] Chantrelle, who had appeared to lead a normal life in the city, poisoned his wife with opium. According to author Jeremy Hodges,[9] Stevenson was present throughout the trial and as \\"the evidence unfolded he found himself, like Dr Jekyll, 'aghast before the acts of Edward Hyde'.\\" Moreover, it was believed that the doctor had committed other murders both in France and Britain by poisoning his victims at supper parties with a \\"favourite dish of toasted cheese and opium\\".[10]\\r\\nLouis Vivet, a mental patient who was suffering from multiple personality disorder, caught Frederic W. H. Myers's attention and he wrote to Stevenson after the story was published. Stevenson was polite in his response but rejected that reading. As was customary, Mrs Stevenson would read the draft and offer her criticisms in the margins. Robert Stevenson was confined to bed at the time from a haemorrhage. Therefore, she left her comments with the manuscript and Robert in the toilet. She said that in effect the story was really an allegory, but Robert was writing it as a story. After a while, Robert called her back into the bedroom and pointed to a pile of ashes: he had burnt the manuscript in fear that he would try to salvage it, and in the process forced himself to start again from nothing, writing an allegorical story as she had suggested. Scholars debate whether he really burnt his manuscript; there is no direct factual evidence for the burning, but it remains an integral part of the history of the novella.[11]\\r\\nStevenson re-wrote the story in three to six days. A number of later biographers have alleged that Stevenson was on drugs during the frantic re-write; for example, William Gray's revisionist history A Literary Life (2004) said he used cocaine while other biographers said he used ergot.[12] However, the standard history, according to the accounts of his wife and son (and himself), says he was bed-ridden and sick while writing it. According to Osbourne, \\"The mere physical feat was tremendous and, instead of harming him, it roused and cheered him inexpressibly\\". He continued to refine the work for four to six weeks after the initial re-write. The novella was written in the southern English seaside town of Bournemouth, where Stevenson had moved due to ill health, to benefit from its sea air and warmer southern climate.[citation needed]\\r\\nThe name Jekyll was borrowed from Reverend Walter Jekyll, a friend of Stevenson and younger brother of horticulturalist and landscape designer Gertrude Jekyll.[13]\\r\\nGabriel John Utterson and his cousin Richard Enfield reach the door of a large house on their weekly walk. Enfield tells Utterson that months ago he saw a sinister-looking man named Edward Hyde trample a young girl after accidentally bumping into her. Enfield forced Hyde to pay S100 to avoid a scandal. Hyde brought them to this door and provided a cheque signed by a reputable gentleman (later revealed to be Dr. Henry Jekyll, a friend and client of Utterson). Utterson is disturbed because Jekyll recently changed his will to make Hyde the sole beneficiary. Utterson fears that Hyde is blackmailing Jekyll. When Utterson tries to discuss Hyde with Jekyll, Jekyll turns pale and asks that Hyde be left alone.\\r\\nOne night in October, a servant sees Hyde beat to death Sir Danvers Carew, another of Utterson's clients. The police contact Utterson, who leads officers to Hyde's apartment. Hyde has vanished, but they find half of a broken cane. Utterson recognizes the cane as one he had given to Jekyll. Utterson visits Jekyll, who shows Utterson a note, allegedly written to Jekyll by Hyde, apologising for the trouble that he has caused. However, Hyde's handwriting is similar to Jekyll's own, leading Utterson to conclude that Jekyll forged the note to protect Hyde.\\r\\nFor two months, Jekyll reverts to his former sociable manner, but in early January, he starts refusing visitors. Dr. Hastie Lanyon, a mutual acquaintance of Jekyll and Utterson, dies of shock after receiving information relating to Jekyll. Before his death, Lanyon gives Utterson a letter to be opened after Jekyll's death or disappearance. In late February, during another walk with Enfield, Utterson starts a conversation with Jekyll at a window of his laboratory. Jekyll suddenly slams the window and disappears. In early March, Jekyll's butler, Mr. Poole, visits Utterson and says Jekyll has secluded himself in his laboratory for weeks. Utterson and Poole break into the laboratory, where they find Hyde wearing Jekyll's clothes and apparently dead from suicide. They find a letter from Jekyll to Utterson. Utterson reads Lanyon's letter, then Jekyll's. Lanyon's letter reveals his deterioration resulted from the shock of seeing Hyde drink a serum that turned him into Jekyll. Jekyll's letter explains that he had indulged in unstated vices and feared discovery. He found a way to transform himself and thereby indulge his vices without fear of detection. Jekyll's transformed personality, Hyde, was evil, self-indulgent, and uncaring to anyone but himself. Initially, Jekyll controlled the transformations with the serum, but one night in August, he became Hyde involuntarily in his sleep.\\r\\nJekyll resolved to cease becoming Hyde. One night, he had a moment of weakness and drank the serum. Hyde, furious at having been caged for so long, killed Carew. Horrified, Jekyll tried more adamantly to stop the transformations. Then, in early January, he transformed involuntarily while awake. Far from his laboratory and hunted by the police as a murderer, Hyde needed help to avoid capture. He wrote to Lanyon (in Jekyll's hand), asking his friend to bring chemicals from his laboratory. In Lanyon's presence, Hyde mixed the chemicals, drank the serum, and transformed into Jekyll. The shock of the sight instigated Lanyon's deterioration and death. Meanwhile, Jekyll's involuntary transformations increased in frequency and required ever larger doses of serum to reverse. It was one of these transformations that caused Jekyll to slam his window shut on Enfield and Utterson.\\r\\nEventually, one of the chemicals used in the serum ran low, and subsequent batches prepared from new stocks failed to work. Jekyll speculated that one of the original ingredients must have some unknown impurity that made it work. Knowing he would become Hyde permanently, Jekyll decided to write his \\"confession\\". He ended the letter by writing, \\"I bring the life of that unhappy Henry Jekyll to an end.\\"\\r\\nDr Jekyll is a \\"large, well-made, smooth-faced man of fifty with something of a slyish cast\\",[14] who occasionally feels he is battling between the good and evil within himself, upon leading to the struggle between his dual personalities of Henry Jekyll and Edward Hyde. He has spent a great part of his life trying to repress evil urges that were not fitting for a man of his stature. He creates a serum, or potion, in an attempt to mask this hidden evil within his personality. However, in doing so, Jekyll transpired into the smaller, younger, cruel, remorseless, evil Hyde. Jekyll has many friends and an amiable personality, but as Hyde, he becomes mysterious and violent. As time goes by, Hyde grows in power. After taking the potion repeatedly, he no longer relies upon it to unleash his inner demon, i.e., his alter ego. Eventually, Hyde grows so strong that Jekyll becomes reliant on the potion to remain conscious.\\r\\nGabriel John Utterson, a lawyer and loyal friend of Jekyll's (and Lanyon's), is the character the narrator focuses on and follows in Utterson's quest to discover the identity of Hyde. Utterson is a measured and at all times emotionless, bachelor ÿ who nonetheless seems believable, trustworthy, tolerant of the faults of others, and indeed genuinely likeable. Utterson has been close friends with Lanyon and Dr Jekyll. However, Utterson is not immune to guilt, as, while he is quick to investigate and judge the faults of others even for the benefit of his friends, Stevenson states that \\"he was humbled to the dust by the many ill things he had done\\". Whatever these \\"ill things\\" may be, he does not partake in gossip or other views of the upper class out of respect for his fellow man. Often the last remaining friend of the down-falling, he finds an interest in others' downfalls, which creates a spark of interest not only in Jekyll but also regarding Hyde. He comes to the conclusion that human downfall results from indulging oneself in topics of interest. As a result of this line of reasoning, he lives life as a recluse and \\"dampens his taste for the finer items of life\\". Utterson concludes that Jekyll lives life as he wishes by enjoying his occupation. Utterson is a good, kind, loyal and honest friend to Henry Jekyll.\\r\\nRichard Enfield is Utterson's cousin and is a well known \\"man about town.\\" He first sees Hyde at about three in the morning in an episode that is well documented as Hyde is running over a little girl. He is the person who mentions to Utterson the actual personality of Jekyll's friend, Hyde. Enfield witnessed Hyde running over a little girl in the street recklessly, and the group of witnesses, with the girl's parents and other residents, force Hyde into writing a cheque for the girl's family. Enfield discovers that Jekyll signed the cheque, which is genuine. He says that Hyde is disgusting looking but finds himself stumped when asked to describe the man.\\r\\nA longtime friend of Jekyll's, Hastie Lanyon disagrees with Jekyll's \\"scientific\\" concepts, which Lanyon describes as \\"...too fanciful\\". He is the first person to discover Hyde's true identity (Hyde transforms himself back into Jekyll in Lanyon's presence). Lanyon helps Utterson solve the case when he describes the letter given to him by Jekyll and his thoughts and reactions to the transformation. When Lanyon witnesses the transformation process (and subsequently hears Jekyll's private confession, made to him alone), Lanyon becomes critically ill and later dies of shock.\\r\\nPoole is Jekyll's butler who has lived with him for many years. Upon noticing the reclusiveness and changes of his master, Poole goes to Utterson with the fear that his master has been murdered and his murderer, Mr Hyde, is residing in the chambers. Poole serves Jekyll faithfully and attempts to do a good job and be loyal to his master. Yet events finally drive him into joining forces with Utterson to find the truth.\\r\\nUtterson joins this Scotland Yard inspector after the murder of Sir Danvers Carew. They explore Hyde's loft in Soho and discover evidence of his depraved life. He is driven by professional ambition and sees the murder of Sir Danvers Carew as a way to further his career.\\r\\nA kind, white-haired old man and an important Member of Parliament. The maid claims that Hyde, in a murderous rage, killed Carew in the streets of London on the night of 18 October (sometime between 11?pm and 2?am by the testimony of the maid). At the time of his death, Carew is 70 years old and is carrying on his person a letter addressed to Utterson. As a result, the police subsequently interview Utterson with regard to the murder.\\r\\nA maid, whose employer Hyde had once visited, is the only person who claims to have witnessed a murder of Sir Danvers Carew. She states that she saw that Mr Hyde murdered Carew with Jekyll's cane and his feet. Having fainted after seeing what happened, she then wakes up and rushes to the police, thus initiating the murder case of Sir Danvers Carew.\\r\\nLiterary genres which critics have applied as a framework for interpreting the novel include religious allegory, fable, detective story, sensation fiction, Doppelg?nger literature, Scottish devil tales, and gothic novel.\\r\\nThe novella is frequently interpreted as an examination of the duality of human nature, usually expressed as an inner struggle between good and evil, with variations such as human versus animal, civilization versus barbarism sometimes substituted, the main thrust being that of an essential inner struggle between the one and other, and that the failure to accept this tension results in evil, or barbarity, or animal violence, being projected onto others.[15] In Freudian theory, the thoughts and desires banished to the unconscious mind motivate the behaviour of the conscious mind. If someone banishes all evil to the unconscious mind in an attempt to be wholly and completely good, it can result in the development of a Mr Hyde-type aspect to that person's character.[15] This failure to accept the tension of duality is related to Christian theology, where Satan's fall from Heaven is due to his refusal to accept that he is a created being (that he has a dual nature) and is not God.[15] This idea is suggested when Hyde says to Lanyon, shortly before drinking the famous potion ÿ \\"...and your sight shall be blasted by a prodigy to stagger the unbelief of Satan.\\" This is because in Christianity, pride (to consider oneself as without sin or without evil) is the greatest sin, as it is the precursor to evil itself.[15]\\r\\nIn his discussion of the novel, Vladimir Nabokov argues that the \\"good versus evil\\" view of the novel is misleading, as Jekyll himself is not, by Victorian standards, a morally good person in some cases.[16]\\r\\nThe work is commonly associated today with the Victorian concern over the public and private division, the individual's sense of playing a part and the class division of London [4] In this respect, the novella has also been noted as \\"one of the best guidebooks of the Victorian era\\" because of its piercing description of the fundamental dichotomy of the 19th century \\"outward respectability and inward lust,\\" as this period had a tendency for social hypocrisy.[17]\\r\\nAnother common interpretation sees the novella's duality as representative of Scotland and the Scottish character. In this reading, the duality represents the national and linguistic dualities inherent in Scotland's relationship with the wider Britain and the English language, respectively, and also the repressive effects of the Church of Scotland on the Scottish character.[11] A further parallel is also drawn with the city of Edinburgh itself, Stevenson's birthplace, which consists of two distinct parts: the old medieval section historically inhabited by the city's poor, where the dark crowded slums were rife with all types of crime, and the modern Georgian area of wide spacious streets representing respectability.[11][18][19]\\r\\nStrange Case of Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde was an immediate success and is one of Stevenson's best-selling works. Stage adaptations began in Boston and London and soon moved all across England and then towards his home Scotland.[4]\\r\\nStrange Case of Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde was initially sold as a paperback for one shilling in the UK and one dollar in the U.S. The American publisher issued the book on 5 January 1886, four days before the first appearance of the UK edition issued by Longmans; Scribner's published 3000 copies, only 1250 of them bound in cloth. Initially, stores would not stock it until a review appeared in The Times, on 25 January 1886, giving it a favourable reception. Within the next six months, close to forty thousand copies were sold. As Stevenson's biographer, Graham Balfour, wrote in 1901, the book's success was probably due rather to the \\"moral instincts of the public\\" than to any conscious perception of the merits of its art. It was read by those who never read fiction and quoted in pulpit sermons and in religious papers.[20] By 1901, it was estimated to have sold over 250,000 copies in the United States.[21]\\r\\nThere have been numerous adaptations of the novella including over 120 stage and film versions alone.[22]\\r\\nThere have also been many audio recordings of the novella, with some of the more famous readers including Tom Baker, Roger Rees, Christopher Lee, Anthony Quayle, Martin Jarvis, Tim Pigott-Smith, John Hurt, Ian Holm, and Gene Lockhart.\\r\\nS.

Chester Zoo was opened in 1931 by George Mottershed and his family.[2] It is one of the UK's largest zoos at 125 acres (51?ha).[1] The zoo has a total land holding of approximately 400 acres (160?ha).\\r\\nChester Zoo is operated by the North of England Zoological Society, a registered charity founded in 1934. The zoo receives no government funding. It is the most-visited wildlife attraction in Britain with more than 1.4 million visitors in 2014.[3] In 2007 Forbes described it as one of the best fifteen zoos in the world.[4] In 2017 it was named as the best zoo in the UK and third in the world by TripAdvisor.[5]\\r\\nThe Mottershead family's market garden business was based in Shavington near Crewe. George Mottershead collected animals such as lizards and insects that arrived with exotic plants imported by the business. A visit to Belle Vue Zoo in Manchester as a boy in 1903 fuelled his developing interest in creating a zoo of his own.\\r\\nMottershead was wounded in the First World War and spent several years in a wheelchair. Despite this, his collection of animals grew and he began to search for a suitable home for his zoo. He chose Oakfield Manor in Upton by Chester, which was a country village then but now is a suburb of Chester. He bought Oakfield Manor for S3,500 in 1930.[6] The house had 9 acres (3.6?ha) of gardens and provided easy access to the railways and to Manchester and Liverpool. There were local objections, but Mottershead prevailed, and Chester Zoo opened to the public on 10 June 1931.[7] The first animals were displayed in pens in the courtyard.[6]\\r\\nRapid expansion followed after the Second World War, despite the difficulty of sourcing materials. Mottershead had to be resourceful; the polar bear exhibit (1950) was built from recycled wartime road blocks and pillboxes.[6] \\"Always building\\" was the zoo's slogan at the time. Mottershead received the OBE, an honorary degree of MSc, and served as President of the International Union of Zoo Directors. He died in 1978 aged 84.\\r\\nMottershead wanted to build a zoo without the traditional Victorian iron bars to cage the animals.[8] He was influenced by the ideas of Carl Hagenbeck, who invented the modern zoo concept and by Heini Hediger, a pioneer of ethology.\\r\\nAt Chester, Mottershead took Hagenbeck's idea for moats and ditches as an alternative to cage bars, and extended their use throughout the zoo, often with species that Hagenbeck had not considered. For example, when chimpanzees were released into their new enclosure at Chester in 1956, a group of grassy islands, they were separated from visitors by no more than a 12-foot (3.7?m) strip of water. Nobody knew then if chimps could swim. It turned out that they could not, and today the chimp islands are a centrepiece of Chester Zoo.\\r\\nIn 1986 the zoo was enclosed with a fence, in line with the Zoo Licensing Act 1981.[9]\\r\\nRealm of the Red Ape, an Indonesian-forest-themed exhibit, featuring threatened Sumatran and Bornean orangutans, opened in May 2007.[10]\\r\\nIn January 2009, Chester Zoo unveiled Natural Vision, a S225 million plan to transform itself into the largest conservation attraction in Europe. The first phase of the plan was to be a S90 million, 56-hectare (140-acre) enclosed African-rainforest-themed sanctuary containing a band of gorillas and a troop of chimpanzees, as well as okapi and a variety of tropical birds, amphibians, reptiles, fishes, and invertebrates, moving freely among lush vegetation. It included a water ride to take visitors through the exhibit. Natural Vision was to eventually include a 90-room hotel, a Conservation College, and a revamped main entrance that would link the zoo to a marina to be developed on zoo land, all to be completed by 2018.[11] Plans went before the public for comment in June 2009.[12]\\r\\nThe projected Heart of Africa bio-dome, along with plans for the hotel, were shelved in 2011 due to the loss of S40m potential funding when the North West Regional Development Agency was abolished.[13]\\r\\nIn December 2012 planning permission was gained for a later phase of the Natural Vision masterplan. One of the largest zoo developments in Europe, Islands at Chester Zoo is a S40million redevelopment project to extend the zoo's footprint and recreate six island habitats of Southeast Asia.[14]\\r\\nThe North of England Zoological Society (NEZS) is the organisation that runs Chester Zoo and the conservation campaign, Act for Wildlife. It was formed in 1934 by the zoo's founder, George Mottershead.[15]\\r\\nThe zoo is managed by an executive team led by Dr Mark Pilgrim, the director general. He is responsible for the zoological teams, science and education, and field conservation and research, as well as the whole zoo site. Jamie Christon is the managing director and responsible for development, finance, guest and business operations, marketing, human resources, and health and safety. Both report to the Board of Trustees for The North of England Zoological Society.[16]\\r\\nMobility scooters and locker and buggy hire are available near the main entrance.[citation needed]\\r\\nThe zoo is bisected by a public bridleway, Flag Lane. For many years, a single bridge (now called Elephants' Bridge), drivable by zoo vehicles and powered wheelchairs, near the elephant exhibit was the only crossing place within the grounds. A second crossing, passable by pedestrians and mobility scooters, called Bats' Bridge, opened in April 2008 near the Twilight Zone, has improved the ability of visitors to circulate.\\r\\nThere are other ways to travel around the zoo:\\r\\nVisitors must pay extra for using the monorail, but the boat trip in Islands is included in normal zoo admission.\\r\\nChester's catering facilities include Bemb Kitchen near the main entrance which opened in 2006. June's Pavilion is on the west of the zoo and Manado Street Kitchen is found on Sulawesi in the Islands exhibit. The Oakfield Restaurant, in a Victorian mansion house near the lion enclosure, and the Acorn Bar, are both used for private functions as well as catering to zoo visitors.\\r\\nThere are children's play areas, shops, kiosks and several picnic lawns around the zoo. A second pedestrian entrance is located in the southeast corner of the zoo behind Oakfield House.\\r\\nFor a long time the public entrance was at the east end off Caughall Road. In recent years the public entrance has moved to the north side with dedicated access off the A41 Chester By-Pass. Thus the zoo is entered in the 'newer' part west of Flag Lane, near the elephants, and the old car parks at the east end are being built over with service and educational buildings.\\r\\nThe zoo owns land outside the public area, and uses that land to grow food for its herbivorous animals.\\r\\nA monorail system was built and installed by Computerised People Mover International at a cost of $4?million and then opened by the Duchess of Kent in 1991.[17][18][19] The system is 1 mile (1? km) long and travels on an elevated guideway to give views of the park grounds ÿ the track crosses Flag Lane twice on its one-way circular shape. The two halves of the park are connected by the system and there is one station in each part, one near the lion enclosure and one near the monkey building. Each train on the system can seat 24 passengers[20] between its four cars and a full tour takes around fifteen minutes.[21]\\r\\nThe system is a straddle beam monorail. The layout has a separate depot and control room[17][20] and carries approximately 2,000 passengers per day.[22] T&M Machine Tool Electronics made improvements totalling S300,000 to the monorail's drive system and electrics in 2009, including more than 25 miles (40?km) of new cabling. The monorail was re-launched by music producer Pete Waterman during a visit on 23 July 2009, when Waterman drove the first loop of the new system.[20] The upgraded system uses pairs of 2.2-kilowatt (3?hp) AC motors for each carriage, with remote monitoring managed over a 5Ghz wireless link.[23] One week later a power failure occurred, requiring the first eight visitors of the day to be escorted off the monorail using a hydraulic lift.[24][25]\\r\\nIn May 2012, Queen Elizabeth II took a tour of Chester Zoo in a specially redecorated monorail set painted in a Union Flag theme for her Diamond Jubilee.[26][27][28][29]\\r\\nChester Zoo holds a large and diverse collection. At the end of 2007, over half the species at the zoo appeared on the IUCN Red List and 155 were classified as threatened species. 134 species were kept as part of a managed captive breeding programme. The zoo manages the studbooks for Congo buffalo, jaguar, blue-eyed cockatoo, Madagascan tree boa, gemsbok (all ESB species), black rhinoceros, Ecuadorian amazon parrot, Mindanao writhe-billed hornbill and Rodrigues flying fox (all EEP species). In addition, Chester holds 265 threatened plant species. At the end of 2015, Chester zoo became the first zoo outside of New Zealand to breed the tuatara.[30]\\r\\nThe zoo opened Islands at Chester Zoo in July 2015,[31] a project extending the footprint of the zoo by 15 acres and built to the south of the west half of the current site.\\r\\nIslands showcases areas where the zoo is involved in conservation programmes, including Sumatra, the Philippines and Indonesia.[32] Visitors are able to walk between the islands via a series of bridges and also view the animals via on a boat trip. The project also includes educational exhibits, play areas and a restaurant, the Manado Street Kitchen.[33] The exhibit is opening in phases[34] with phase one including a boat trip around the enclosures for visitors to view some of the zoo's key species from South East Asia, including Visayan warty pigs, southern cassowary, Javan banteng, lowland anoa and North Sulawesi Babirusa; plus a walk-through bird aviary featuring the critically endangered Bali Starling, as well as Java Sparrows, Pied Imperial Pigeons and Yellow-Backed Chattering Lorys.\\r\\nPhase two opened later in the summer[34] and includes Sumatran tigers, Sunda gharials, and other reptiles, birds and invertebrates. That phase including Monsoon Forest is now complete and open with the installation of the Sumatran orang utans and the arrival of a breeding pair of Javan silvery gibbons in December 2015.

The third phase included new exhibits for Malayan sun bear, Binturongs, Malayan tapir, and a new songbird aviary featuring various birds from Indonesia as well as the Critically Endangered Javan Green Magpie.\\r\\nA exhibit for Dusky pademelons and Goodfellow's tree kangaroo will be completed in 2018.\\r\\nChester was the first zoo in the UK to successfully breed Asian elephants in captivity. The most famous of these was Jubilee (1977ÿ2003), so named as he was born in 1977, the year of the Queen's Silver Jubilee. The zoo has a breeding herd of eight elephants, composed of two males and six females ÿ the breeding male Aung-Bo, ageing female Maya, Thi Hi Way, her daughters Sithami Hi Way and Nandita Hi Way and Sithami's son, Aayu Hi Way who was born in January 2017 and daughter Sundara Hi Way and her daughter Indali Hi Way who was born in December 2016. The elephant house also used to house African elephants, rhinos, hippos and tapirs. Motty, a hybrid African-Asian elephant calf was born in July 1978, but died in infancy.\\r\\nA S2 million breeding facility modelled on an Assam (India) rainforest called Elephants of the Asian Forest opened in Easter 2006, as a major alteration of the zoo's previous elephant house. Inside the elephant house, other indigenous Asian species are exhibited, including wrinkled hornbills, azure-winged magpies, red-billed blue magpies, Sumatran prevost's squirrels, belanger's tree shrews, northern Luzon giant cloud rats, The former arowana aquarium now holds McCord's Snake-Necked Turtles.[36]\\r\\nOn 10 February 2011 Sheba, the matriarch of Chester Zoos Asian elephant herd, had to be put down because of digestive tract illness caused by inability to chew her food because her last molar teeth were worn to stumps.\\r\\nSpirit of the Jaguar[37] was opened in 2001 and is sponsored by Jaguar Cars and was designed by McCormick Architecture.[38] The exhibit is split into four sections. The two inside are modelled on a rainforest and a dry savannah, and the two outside contain rivers and pools so that the jaguars can exercise their swimming skills. A new breeding pair of Jaguar, Napo (Spotted male) and Goshi (Black female) arrived from separate French zoos in Spring 2013. Spirit of the Jaguar is also home to a colony of leaf-cutter ants, sloths, and an aquarium featuring numerous rainforest fish such as Discus fish and shoals of tetra. The exhibit went through another makeover in late 2011, and now has a theme focusing on human/wildlife conflict.[39][40] An outdoor enclosure for two-toed sloths is located just outside which is set to also house Azara's agouti in the future.\\r\\nRealm of the Red Ape is a S3.5 million extension to the existing orangutan house, home to Bornean orangutans, and was the most expensive capital project in the zoo's history before the construction of Islands.[41] The exhibit opened to the public on 26 May 2007 after a two-year construction period. It comprises a new two-story building linked to the existing orangutan house with three indoor and two outdoor enclosures, providing accommodation for a larger number of apes. The outdoor areas can be viewed from a first floor public gallery and feature mesh roofs supported by tree-like structures which act as climbing frames for the apes. A further enclosure houses a group of lar gibbons.\\r\\nAnimals and plants from Indonesia are exhibited inside Realm of the Red Ape in a rainforest-themed setting. Birds on display include blue-crowned hanging parrots, Timor sparrows, chestnut-backed thrushes, roul-roul partridges, superb fruit doves and black-naped fruit doves. Crocodile monitors, reticulated pythons, red-tailed racers, Bell's Angle-Head Lizards, Chinese water dragons, emerald tree monitors, white-lipped tree vipers and green tree pythons feature among the reptiles. Invertebrates include Rhinoceros beetles, Golden Silk Spiders, jungle nymphs, Common Crows, Malaysian Katydids and leaf insects.\\r\\nLocated next to Realm of the Red Ape is an enclosure for oriental small-clawed otters. The zoos Sumatran Orang-utans were relocated from Realm of the Red Ape to a new exhibit in the Islands development during January 2016\\r\\nThis pavilion was opened in 1989 by Diana, Princess of Wales and Countess of Chester, and is home to 26 common chimpanzees. This is the largest colony of chimps in Europe, housed in the Roundhouse, a conical indoor enclosure linked to an outside moated island. The island is planted with many bushes and has large poles for the chimps to climb on. The inside area has a climbing frame that allows the chimps to stay close together on several levels of platform. There are seven interconnected off-show dens.\\r\\nThe zoo's black rhinoceros exhibit, modelled on the Tsavo National Park in Kenya, was opened in 2003 at a cost of GBP2 million. The zoo has a successful rhinoceros breeding programme and currently keeps eight rhinos. Meerkats and crested porcupines are kept in a co-habitated enclosure nearby, and a nearby paddock is home to warthogs.\\r\\nThe Wetlands is a large aviary alongside Tsavo and is home to a variety of Storks, Cranes and waterfowl. In 2009, a walk-through bird safari with African bird species opened. It currently houses von der decken's hornbills, lilac-breasted rollers, hamerkops, weaver birds, Blacksmith Plovers, Red-Winged Starlings and a variety of waterfowl, amongst other species. At the other side of the Bird Safari is a Large pen for wattled cranes and Black crowned cranes.\\r\\nFruit Bat Forest is the largest free-flying bat cave in Europe. The cave holds two species of bat: Rodrigues fruit bats, and Seba's short-tailed bats. It is also home to a varied collection of other species including, common tenrecs and blind cave fish.\\r\\nMonkey Islands was opened in 1997, replacing the old monkey house, and is currently home to four monkey species: Colombian black spider monkeys, mandrills, lion-tailed macaques and Buffy-headed capuchins. Campbell's guenons and porcupines were formerly housed with the mandrills, and Sulawesi crested macaques were kept here until they moved to 'Islands' in 2015. Visitors enter the monkey house and view the animals from a central corridor. Each species has a glass-fronted indoor enclosure with climbing apparatus and an outdoor enclosure, moated and heavily planted.\\r\\nMiniature Monkeys, opened in May 2004, consists of two enclosures. The first is home to a pair of pied tamarins with pygmy marmosets, and the second is shared by three emperor tamarins and three golden-headed lion tamarins. Azara's agoutis, Geoffrey's marmosets, black-tailed marmosets, black lion tamarins, Red Titi and white-faced sakis have also been housed here in the past but have been moved out for various reasons.\\r\\nBears of the Cloud Forest opened in 2004 and is home to a pair of spectacled bears and other South American animals. The purpose-built exhibit is designed to mimic the bear's natural habitat by providing trees and a rocky terrain. Nearby are paddocks housing capybaras, Giant anteater and Brazilian tapirs.\\r\\nGuanaco and Vicuna were previously housed with Rhea. The zoo's first spectacled bear cub was born in January 2017.\\r\\nFormerly the camel house, this enclosure adjoining the giraffe house was remodelled in 2006 to house okapi. Initially two males were kept: Dicky arrived from Marwell Wildlife in 2005 and Mbuti came from Bristol Zoo in the same year. In 2006 Dicky left for London Zoo to make way for a female named Stuma from Germany. In 2009 Mbuti and Dicky were swapped back, with Mbuti going to London Zoo and Dicky coming back to Chester. Other animals that can be seen here include Red forest duikers, Gambian pouched rats, butterfly barbs, Gaboon vipers and short-eared elephant shrews. Mount Kulal spiny mice and Mesic four-striped grass mice have also been kept here in the past along with various other small species. The Okapi bred for the first time in 2012, producing a female calf named Tafari. The success was repeated in 2014 with the birth of a new male calf.\\r\\nThis exhibit is primarily a herpetarium for the zoo's Komodo dragons, Jantan who arrived from Prague Zoo and three juvenile dragons called Sathi, Lara and Mia who came from Colchester zoo in 2014 and Mezcal, a young female who arrived from Los Angeles Zoo, originating from the Lesser Sunda Islands. It was opened in 1998 and extended in 2003 to include an outdoor enclosure used by the dragons in the warmer summer months. The exhibit is built on the site of the zoo's former bird house. In 2007, several young baby Komodo dragons were put on display after one of the zoo's two females laid eggs which hatched although the female had not been mated; this is parthenogenesis, the first such case recorded in this species.[42] The exhibit was revamped in 2009 to house Caribbean iguanas in one section of the building. It now currently houses spiny hill turtles, golden coin turtles, and Indochinese Box Turtles in one side and the critically endangered Mountain Chicken Frogs with some Caribbean Hermit Crabs in the other.\\r\\nDragons in Danger also houses various Indonesian and Philippine rainforest birds, such as Palawan peacock-pheasants, pheasant pigeons, Montserrat orioles and Visayan tarictic hornbills. Recently added was a pair of Philippine mouse deer which have successfully bred. Also housed here are Ploughshare tortoises, collared iguanas and Montserrat Tarantulas which Chester bred in 2016 for the first time in captivity. Species formerly kept in the exhibit include Socorro doves, Mindanao bleeding-hearts, Papuan lorikeets and Saint Lucia parrots.\\r\\nLocated near the former tiger enclosure, this area used to be a petting farm, but was closed due to an outbreak of foot-and-mouth disease. The petting farm is now a picnic lawn and a former kune kune pig enclosure has been demolished in favour of a food stall.\\r\\nMongoose Mania, which houses dwarf mongooses features tunnels beneath the enclosure which allow children to crawl through, popping up their heads into plastic domes to give them a mongoose's eye view of the world.\\r\\nIn early 2010, the Californian sea lions left the collection. Over the late winter the pool was converted to house a new species to the zoo. The giant otters went on show for the first time on 26 March 2010. The zoo bred their first pups in 2013.\\r\\nIn the neighbouring enclosure, a large breeding group of over 50 Humboldt penguins have their own pool, and visitors can watch the birds from an underwater viewing window.\\r\\nChester's Tropical Realm is Britain's largest tropical house at over 26,000 cubic metres. Opened in 1964, most of the interior is an open-plan space extending to roof level and themed with pools and mature tropical plants, with pathways for visitors through the undergrowth. Here, more than 30 species of birds are free-flying, including Nicobar pigeons, various species of starlings and ground birds such as crested partridges.\\r\\nAviaries and vivaria are arranged around the sides of the building; those on the upper level were originally designed for birds of paradise and the hornbill aviaries were originally made for gorillas. The aviaries currently house birds such as great Indian hornbills, rhinoceros hornbills, two pairs of tarictic hornbill (one pure-bred and one hybrid), writhed-billed hornbills, red-crested turacos, Palawan peacock-pheasants, Congo peafowl, Bali starlings, blue-crowned pigeons, fairy-bluebirds, white-rumped shama, white-crested turacos, snowy-crowned robin chats, Mindanao bleeding-hearts Green Aracari and Luzon Scops Owls. At the entrance is an aviary for Sumatran laughingthrushes and grey-winged blackbird.\\r\\nThe Tropical Realm is also the centre of the reptile collection. The crocodile pools (which formerly housed West African dwarf crocodiles, American alligators and Philippine crocodiles) currently house spectacled caimans in one and white-winged wood ducks and a yellow-Faced myna in the other. Near the entrance is an enclosure for tuataras. This lizard-like species from New Zealand is the last surviving sphenodont, a prehistoric group of reptiles, and Chester is the only British zoo to exhibit them. In February 2016, a tuatara hatched for the first time outside of New Zealand, leading Chester Zoo to be the only zoo to have bred them anywhere else. There were many varieties of snakes and lizards in the past (many had to depart as a result)?; emerald tree boas and Moellendorf's Ratsnakes now being the only remaining. The lizard collection is now made up of Serrated Casquehead Iguanas, Graham's Anoles, Jamaican Anoles, caiman lizards, and a Parson's chameleon.\\r\\nTortoises are represented by Galpagos and radiated. Amphibians include Poison Dart Frogs, Golden Mantellas, Blue-Legged Mantellas, a Rio Cauca caecilian, Borneo Eared Frogs and Morelet's Tree Frogs.\\r\\nThere is also a pair of Philippine mouse-deer near the poison dart frogs.\\r\\nIn the Winter of 2015/2016 the former Yellow Breasted Capuchin exhibit at the rear of Tropical Realm was converted to house a pair of Aye-Aye and a group of Malagasy Giant Jumping Rats.\\r\\nThis aviary was formerly home to Andean Condors but is now the home to a variety of European birds after Europe on the Edge was demolished in late 2017. The species include here consist of European black vultures and griffon vultures, and the rarer of the two European storks, the black stork. There are spoonbills, ibises and egrets as well as a selection of waterfowl. Smaller birds include rock doves, northern lapwings, red-legged partridges and the native but rare red-billed chough.\\r\\nParrots on display here include red-vented cockatoos, lesser sulphur-crested cockatoos, red-and-blue lories, yellow-backed chattering lories, Mount Apo lorikeets and blue-and-yellow macaws. The only ones on show are Ecuador Amazons. Most of the birds were moved to the Rare Parrot Breeding Centre from the old parrot house when it was demolished in 2005 to make way for Realm of the Red Ape.\\r\\nThis exhibit consists of two aviaries housing rare and endangered South American parrots and macaws. These include hyacinth macaws, in the aviary outside the Tropical Realm and Blue-throated macaws and an Inca Jay are housed in the other.\\r\\nThe aquarium is a small and traditional building (one of the oldest at the zoo, built by George Mottershead's daughter and son-in-law in the 1950s) housing a varied collection of freshwater and marine fish, aquatic invertebrates and amphibians. It has had notable success breeding seahorses and achieved the first captive breeding of the freshwater motoro stingray.\\r\\nOther notable fish include Pinstripe Dambas, Mudskippers, tropical reef fish and various Lake Malawi cichlids. Invertebrates such as starfish, sea urchins and several species of coral and shrimps are housed with the fish.\\r\\nIn 2008, Asian Plains received its official opening.[43] Based around a mixed-species paddock featuring Burmese brow-antlered deer, the exhibit has recently been extended to include new enclosures for greater one-horned rhinoceros and cheetah. The male rhino was joined by a female in 2008 to form a pair which the zoo hoped would breed. Sadly in November 2009 the male Indian rhino \\"Patna\\" was put down due to a longstanding leg injury. The zoo obtained a replacement male from Edinburgh Zoo in March 2010. Since they were closely related the previous female departed for a zoo in Spain shortly after, and the zoo are in the progress of creating a breeding situation ÿ Baabu has now been exchanged for 'Beni' from Pilsen Zoo. The paddocks formerly housed barasingha, Ankole cattle, blackbuck and sitatunga.\\r\\nOther paddocks on the west side of the zoo support grazing herds of Grvy's zebras, sitatunga, Kirk's dik-diks, eastern bongo, and roan antelope.\\r\\nPrzewalski's horses left the collection in 2009 to make way for the new African hunting dog enclosure. Other animals formerly housed here were Pre David's deer, red-necked wallabies, ostriches and emus.\\r\\nIn 2011, a new exhibit housing African painted dogs on the site of the former Przewalski's horse paddock was opened. In the style of an African Research Station with an African Village, the exhibit has a dry landscape with fake kopje stones. A pack of four African painted dogs are the main exhibit, however aardvarks and rock hyraxes are nearby.\\r\\nThe north east area of the zoo is where many forest-dwelling species are kept. As well as the chimpanzees, okapis, jaguars, condors and Tropical Realm, there are enclosures for Congo buffalo, red river hogs and Lowland anoa. Nearby is a large paddock and house for the zoo's Rothschild's giraffe herd. The area between the rear of Tropical Realm and the Spirit of the Jaguar has enclosures for various species including a group of native sand lizards, and a mixed enclosure for red-billed curassows and Inca Jays.\\r\\nAnimals formerly displayed in forest zone include maned wolves, babirusa, warthogs, Chilean pud~, Mallorcan midwife toads, golden-bellied capuchins, visayan warty pigs, ring-tailed coatis and bactrian camels.\\r\\nAn enclosure formerly housing maned wolves was demolished and replaced in 2008 by a heated butterfly house called Butterfly Journey, which is based around the life cycle of a butterfly, featuring free-flying butterflies and moths (The exotic species on show include blue morphos, giant owls, glasswings, swallowtails and Atlas moths), a cabinet of cocoons, and an area with caterpillars. Also featured in this exhibit is an area for a variety of different invertebrates and a mesh enclosure for some panther chameleons.\\r\\nAs well as jaguars, Chester Zoo keeps lions, tigers and cheetahs[44] in its big cat collection. The lions are the Asiatic subspecies found only in the Gir Forest in India in the wild. The zoo's former resident male Asoka was joined by a female, Asha, from Rome in 2006. The pair have bred on three occasions, but so far their only offspring to survive has been a male cub, Tejas, born and hand-reared in 2007. His upbringing was featured prominently in the first series of Zoo Days. Tejas left Chester Zoo for Besancon early in 2008 as part of the European breeding programme for this subspecies. Asoka left the zoo in early 2010, he was moved to Rome Zoo as part of the European breeding programme. His replacement is 3-year-old Iblis, who arrived from Planckendael Zoo in Belgium. In late summer 2011, Asha retired to Santillana Zoo and was replaced by four-year females Kiburi and Kumari.\\r\\nIn 2007, a male Sumatran tiger called Kepala arrived from Dudley Zoo to join the two resident female Bengal tigers, who left in 2008. The same year, the zoo acquired a female tiger named Kirana, but unfortunately it was discovered that the pair were related. Kepala departed to Dublin Zoo and a new male named Fabi was brought in from Prague Zoo to form a breeding pair of Sumatrans, a critically endangered subspecies in the wild.[45] Kirana and Fabi bred and have so far bred successfully on three occasions since 2011.[46]\\r\\nThe zoo welcomed its first ever cheetah cubs in June 2011. The cheetahs are the vulnerable Sudanese subspecies - a second litter was born in 2013\\r\\nBactrian camels and onagers in a large paddock in the centre of the zoo, formerly the zebra exhibit. A paddock which was only visible from the monorail but can now be seen from the Bats' Bridge holds a group of Philippine spotted deer.\\r\\nBordering the paddocks is a waterway running north-south along which the water bus formerly travelled, past island groups of white-faced sakis, Alaotran bamboo lemurs and howler monkeys. A variety of callitrichids, including cotton-top tamarins, were formerly housed on the Bamboo lemur Island, whilst the howler monkey and white-faced saki exhibits were formerly home to black-and-white ruffed lemurs and red ruffed lemurs. A nearby island viewable from Bats Bridge has previously held lowland anoa and is now holding Babirusia In the southeast corner of the zoo are enclosures housing an assortment of animals including bush dogs, red pandas, Southern pudu, dusky pademelons, Azara's agouti, Red-Billed Blue Magpies and the wetland bird nursery. The former Cassowary exhibit next to the pademelons is currently empty. The pademelons are set to move to Islands in 2018.\\r\\nNear the Rare Parrot Breeding Centre is an aviary currently housing spectacled owls and formerly home to macaws and keas the remainder of the zoo's owl collection are seen nearby. The owl aviaries were recently modified.\\r\\nAlongside the Arara lawn is a set of recently refurbished aviaries that house various species of Asian songbirds and pheasants.\\r\\nFlocks of Chilean and Caribbean flamingos live in shallow water alongside a large island housing a group of ring-tailed lemurs and a pair ofblack and white ruffed lemurs. The lemurs are to be moved to a new Madagascar themed walk through enclosure in 2018 along with Fossa. New indoor accommodation for the flamingos was completed in 2007.\\r\\nIn 2011 and 2012 there was a display of animatronic dinosaurs: Triceratops, Edmontosaurus and its eggs and hatchlings, Dilophosaurus (which squirts water from its mouth), Allosaurus, Rugops, Omeisaurus, Apatosaurus, Baryonyx, Dimetrodon, Tyrannosaurus rex. A second exhibition was made in 2012 with other anamatronic dinosaurs featuring: a Stegosaurus, a Dilophosaurus and young (which both spit water), a Megalosaurus, a Styracosaurus and hatchlings, a Brachiosaurus, a Quetzalcoatlus, an Edmontonia, a Pachycephalosaurus, two Coelophysis, a Parasaurolophus, a Deinonychus and a Tyrannosaurus rex and young.\\r\\nThe zoo has a scheme whereby people can adopt an animal of their choice, they are also given two complimentary tickets to allow them to visit the animals.[47] They can also become members which allows them to visit Chester and a range of other zoos across England free of charge for a year. Every three months, members and adopters receive Z magazine, which provides updates and information about what is happening at the zoo.[48]\\r\\nDuring summer 2007, television crews from Granada filmed at Chester for the documentary series Zoo Days, a behind the scenes look at the day-to-day running of the zoo, narrated by Jane Horrocks. British broadcast rights were sold to Five and the first 20-part series began airing on British terrestrial TV on 8 October 2007, transmitting on weekday evenings in a regular 6:30 pm slot. A second 20-part series of Zoo Days was swiftly commissioned and began airing on 3 March 2008.[49] The third 20-part series was broadcast from Colchester Zoo, before returning to Chester for the fourth 20-part series on 10 November 2008.[50]\\r\\nIn February 2009, \\"The History of Chester Zoo\\" was a contestant's chosen subject on Mastermind.[51]\\r\\nIn 2014 the zoo was the subject of BBC One Drama Our Zoo, telling the story of the founding of Chester Zoo by the Mottershead family in the 1930s.[52] During the six-part series, the show reached audiences in excess of five million viewers and was nominated for two National TV awards.[53]\\r\\nIn spring 2016, Channel 4 began broadcasting a six-part series, The Secret Life of the Zoo, following the keepers and animals at Chester Zoo and narrated by Olivia Colman. A second series began broadcasting in November 2016. A third series began broadcasting in February 2017","input":"Which is the largest zoo in the uk?"},{"output":"Baptism","context":"There are seven sacraments of the Catholic Church, which according to Catholic theology were instituted by Jesus and entrusted to the Church. Sacraments are visible rites seen as signs and efficacious channels of the grace of God to all those who receive them with the proper disposition. The sevenfold list of sacraments is often organized into three categories: the sacraments of initiation (into the Church, the body of Christ), consisting of Baptism, the Eucharist, and Confirmation; the sacraments of healing, consisting of Reconciliation and Anointing of the Sick; and the sacraments of service: Holy Orders and Matrimony.[1]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Catechism of the Catholic Church lists the sacraments as follows: \\"The whole liturgical life of the Church revolves around the Eucharistic sacrifice and the sacraments. There are seven sacraments in the Church: Baptism, Confirmation or Chrismation, Eucharist, Penance, Anointing of the Sick, Holy Orders, and Matrimony.\\"[2]\\r\\n\\r\\nThese seven sacraments were codified in the documents of the Council of Trent[3] (1545ÿ1563), which stated:\\r\\n\\r\\nCANON I.- If any one saith, that the sacraments of the New Law were not all instituted by Jesus Christ, our Lord; or that they are more, or less, than seven, to wit, Baptism, Confirmation, the Eucharist, Penance, Extreme Unction, Order, and Matrimony; or even that any one of these seven is not truly and properly a sacrament; let him be anathema.\\r\\n\\r\\nCANON IV.- If any one saith, that the sacraments of the New Law are not necessary unto salvation, but superfluous; and that, without them, or without the desire thereof, men obtain of God, through faith alone, the grace of justification; -though all (the sacraments) are not necessary for every individual; let him be anathema.[4]\\r\\n\\r\\nDogma includes divine revelation, i.e., the word of God (bible and tradition) and the word of God incarnate (Jesus),[5][6] and truths connected to divine revelation.[7] The sacraments, divinely instituted, are dogma[8] and are part of the liturgy, that is, public worship.[9] As dogma is immutable,[10] Baptism cannot be changed to allow a non-Trinitarian formula,[11] the Eucharist cannot be changed to allow unrepentant sinners to receive Jesus,[12] Matrimony cannot be changed to allow gay marriage,[13] and Holy Orders cannot be changed to allow priestesses.[14]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Catholic Church teaches that the sacraments are \\"efficacious signs of grace, instituted by Christ and entrusted to the Church, by which divine life is dispensed to us. The visible rites by which the sacraments are celebrated signify and make present the graces proper to each sacrament. They bear fruit in those who receive them with the required dispositions.\\"[15]\\r\\n\\r\\nWhile the Church itself is the universal sacrament of salvation,[16][17] the sacraments of the Catholic Church in the strict sense[18] are seven sacraments that \\"touch all the stages and all the important moments of Christian life: they give birth and increase, healing and mission to the Christian's life of faith\\".[19] \\"The Church affirms that for believers the sacraments of the New Covenant are necessary for salvation\\", although not all are necessary for every individual,[20] and has placed under anathema those who deny it: \\"If any one saith, that the sacraments of the New Law are not necessary unto salvation, but superfluous; and that, without them, or without the desire thereof, men obtain of God, through faith alone, the grace of justification;-though all (the sacraments) are not indeed necessary for every individual; let him be anathema.\\"[21]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Church further teaches that the effect of a sacrament comes ex opere operato, by the very fact of being administered, regardless of the personal holiness of the minister administering it.[22] However, a recipient's own lack of proper disposition to receive the grace conveyed can block the effectiveness of the sacrament in that person. The sacraments presuppose faith and through their words and ritual elements, nourish, strengthen and give expression to faith.[23]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Compendium of the Catechism of the Catholic Church states: \\"Christian initiation is accomplished by means of the sacraments which establish the foundations of Christian life. The faithful born anew by Baptism are strengthened by Confirmation and are then nourished by the Eucharist.\\"[24]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Catholic Church sees baptism as the first and basic sacrament of Christian initiation.[25] In the Western or Latin Church, baptism is usually conferred today by pouring water three times on the recipient's head, while reciting the baptismal formula: \\"I baptize you in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit\\" (cf. Matthew 28:19). In the Eastern Catholic Churches of Byzantine Rite immersion or submersion is used, and the formula is: \\"The servant of God, N., is baptized in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit.\\"[26] Though sprinkling is not normally used, its validity is accepted, provided that the water flows over the skin, since otherwise it is not a washing.[27][28]\\r\\n\\r\\nConfirmation or Chrismation is the second sacrament of Christian initiation.[29] \\"It is called Chrismation (in the Eastern Churches: anointing with holy myron or chrism) because the essential rite of the sacrament is anointing with chrism. It is called Confirmation because it confirms and strengthens baptismal grace.\\"[30] It is conferred by \\"the anointing with Sacred Chrism (oil mixed with balsam and consecrated by the bishop), which is done by the laying on of the hand of the minister who pronounces the sacramental words proper to the rite.\\"[31] These words, in both their Western and Eastern variants, refer to a gift of the Holy Spirit that marks the recipient as with a seal. Through the sacrament the grace given in baptism is \\"strengthened and deepened.\\"[32] Like baptism, confirmation may be received only once, and the recipient must be in a state of grace (meaning free from any known unconfessed mortal sin) in order to receive its effects. The \\"originating\\" minister of the sacrament is a validly consecrated bishop; if a priest (a \\"presbyter\\") confers the sacrament  as is done ordinarily in the Eastern Churches and in special cases (such as the baptism of an adult or in danger of the death of a young child) in the Latin Church (CCC 1312ÿ1313)  the link with the higher order is indicated by the use of oil (known as \\"chrism\\" or \\"myron\\") blessed by the bishop on Holy Thursday itself or on a day close to it. In the East, which retains the ancient practice, the sacrament is administered by the parish priest immediately after baptism. In the West, where the sacrament is normally reserved for those who can understand its significance, it came to be postponed until the recipient's early adulthood; in the 20th century, after Pope Pius X introduced first Communion for children on reaching the age of discretion, the practice of receiving Confirmation later than the Eucharist became widespread;[33] but the traditional order, with Confirmation administered before First Communion, is being increasingly restored.[33][34]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Eucharist, also called the Blessed Sacrament, is the sacrament (the third of Christian initiation,[35] the one that the Catechism of the Catholic Church says \\"completes Christian initiation\\")[36] by which Catholics partake of the Body and Blood of Jesus Christ and participate in his one sacrifice. The first of these two aspects of the sacrament is also called Holy Communion. The bread (which must be wheaten, and which is unleavened in the Latin, Armenian and Ethiopic Rites, but is leavened in most Eastern Rites) and wine (which must be from grapes) used in the Eucharistic rite are, in Catholic faith, transformed in their inner reality, though not in appearance, into the Body and Blood of Christ, a change that is called transubstantiation. \\"The minister who is able to confect the sacrament of the Eucharist in the person of Christ is a validly ordained priest alone.\\"[37] The word \\"priest\\" here (in Latin sacerdos) includes both bishops and those priests who are also called presbyters.[38] Deacons as well as priests (sacerdotes) are ordinary ministers of Holy Communion, and lay people may be authorized in limited circumstances to act as extraordinary ministers of Holy Communion. The Eucharist is seen as \\"the source and summit\\" of Christian living, the high point of God's sanctifying action on the faithful and of their worship of God, the point of contact between them and the liturgy of heaven. So important is it that participation in the Eucharistic celebration (see Mass) is seen as obligatory on every Sunday and holy day of obligation and is recommended on other days. Also recommended for those who participate in the Mass is reception, with the proper dispositions, of Holy Communion. This is seen as obligatory at least once a year,  during Eastertide.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs a growing trend during the second half of the 2010s, many US dioceses of Latin Rite are officially returning to the traditional order of the three sacraments of Christian initiation, that is: Baptism, Confirmation and, lastly, the first Communion[39].\\r\\n\\r\\nThis order of Sacraments has ever refererred in the Catechism of Roman Catholic Church (n. 1212), and ?The holy Eucharist completes our Christian initiation (N. 1322). \\r\\n\\r\\nThe current order -with Eucharist preceding the Confirmation- was started in 1910 with the decree by Pope Pius X, Quam Singulari Christus Amore (transl.: How Special Christs Love), which said Communion should not be delayed beyond when a child reaches the age of reason. U.S. dioceses complied at that time, but they did not bring confirmation forward with it in a subsequent age[39][40][41].\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Sacrament of Penance is the first of two sacraments of healing. The Catechism of the Catholic Church mentions in the following order and capitalization different names of the sacrament, calling it the sacrament of conversion, Penance, confession, forgiveness and Reconciliation.[42] It is the sacrament of spiritual healing of a baptized person from the distancing from God resulting from sins committed. When people sin after baptism, they cannot have baptism as a remedy; Baptism, which is a spiritual regeneration, cannot be given a second time.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe sacrament involves four elements:\\r\\n\\r\\n\\"Many sins wrong our neighbour. One must do what is possible in order to repair the harm (e.g., return stolen goods, restore the reputation of someone slandered, pay compensation for injuries). Simple justice requires as much. But sin also injures and weakens the sinner himself, as well as his relationships with God and neighbour. Absolution takes away sin, but it does not remedy all the disorders sin has caused. Raised up from sin, the sinner must still recover his full spiritual health by doing something more to make amends for the sin: he must 'make satisfaction for' or 'expiate' his sins. This satisfaction is also called 'penance'\\" (CCC 1459). In early Christian centuries, this element of satisfaction was quite onerous and generally preceded absolution, but now it usually involves a simple task for the penitent to perform later, in order to make some reparation and as a medicinal means of strengthening against further temptation.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe priest is bound by the \\"seal of confession\\", which is inviolable. \\"Accordingly, it is absolutely wrong for a confessor in any way to betray the penitent, for any reason whatsoever, whether by word or in any other fashion.\\"[43] A confessor who directly violates the sacramental seal incurs an automatic excommunication whose lifting is reserved to the Holy See.[44]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn some dioceses, certain sins are \\"reserved\\" which means only certain confessors can absolve them. Some sins, such as violation of the sacramental seal, consecration of bishops without authorization by the Holy See, direct physical attacks on the Pope, and intentional desecration of the Eucharist are reserved to the Holy See. A special case-by-case faculty from the Sacred Penitentiary is normally required to absolve these sins.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnointing of the Sick is the second sacrament of healing. In this sacrament a priest anoints the sick with oil blessed specifically for that purpose. \\"The anointing of the sick can be administered to any member of the faithful who, having reached the use of reason, begins to be in danger by reason of illness or old age\\" (canon 1004; cf. CCC 1514). A new illness or a worsening of health enables a person to receive the sacrament a further time.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen, in the Western Church, the sacrament was conferred only on those in immediate danger of death, it came to be known as \\"Extreme Unction\\", i.e. \\"Final Anointing\\", administered as one of the Last Rites. The other Last Rites are Confession (if the dying person is physically unable to confess, at least absolution, conditional on the existence of contrition, is given), and the Eucharist, which when administered to the dying is known as \\"Viaticum\\", a word whose original meaning in Latin was \\"provision for a journey\\".\\r\\n\\r\\nHoly Orders is the Sacrament by which a man is made a bishop, a priest, or a deacon, and thus dedicated to be an image of Christ. The three degrees are referred to as the episcopate, the presbyterate and the diaconate.[45] A bishop is the minister of this sacrament. Ordination as a bishop confers the fullness of the sacrament, making the bishop a member of the body of successors of the Apostles, and giving him the mission to teach, sanctify, and govern, along with the care of all the Churches. Ordination as a priest configures the priest to Christ the Head of the Church and the one essential High Priest, and conferring on him the power, as the bishops' assistant, to celebrate the sacraments and other liturgical acts, especially the Eucharist. Ordination as a deacon configures  him at the service of the bishop, especially in the Church's exercising of Christian charity towards the poor and preaching of the word of God.\\r\\n\\r\\nAspirants to the priesthood are required by canon law (canon 1032 of the Code of Canon Law) to go through a seminary program that includes, as well as graduate level philosophical and theological studies, a formation program that includes spiritual direction, retreats, apostolate experience, Latin training, etc. The course of studies in preparation for ordination as a permanent deacon is decided by the episcopal conference concerned.\\r\\n\\r\\nMatrimony, or Marriage, is another sacrament that consecrates for a particular mission in building up the Church, and that provides grace for accomplishing that mission. This sacrament, seen as a sign of the love uniting Christ and the Church, establishes between the spouses a permanent and exclusive bond, sealed by God. Accordingly, a marriage between baptized people, validly entered into and consummated, cannot be dissolved. The sacrament confers on them the grace they need for attaining holiness in their married life and for responsible acceptance and upbringing of their children. As a condition for validity, the sacrament is celebrated in the presence of the local Ordinary or Parish Priest or of a cleric delegated by them (or in certain limited circumstances a lay person delegated by the diocesan Bishop with the approval of the Episcopal Conference and the permission of the Holy See) and at least two other witnesses,[46] though in the theological tradition of the Latin Church the ministers of the sacrament uniquely are the couple themselves. For a valid marriage, a man and a woman must express their conscious and free consent to a definitive self-giving to the other, excluding none of the essential properties and aims of marriage. If one of the two is a non-Catholic Christian, their marriage is licit only if the permission of the competent authority of the Catholic Church is obtained. If one of the two is not a Christian (i.e. has not been baptized), the competent authority's dispensation is necessary for validity.\\r\\n\\r\\nCorpus Juris Canonici\\r\\n\\r\\nAncient Church Orders\\r\\n\\r\\nCollections of ancient canons\\r\\n\\r\\nOther\\r\\n\\r\\nHoly Orders\\r\\n\\r\\nConfession\\r\\n\\r\\nEucharist\\r\\n\\r\\nTribunal Officers\\r\\n\\r\\nTribunal Procedure\\r\\n\\r\\nJuridic persons\\r\\n\\r\\nAs stated above, the effect of the sacraments comes ex opere operato (by the very fact of being administered). Since it is Christ who works through them, their effectiveness does not depend on the worthiness of the minister.  The belief that the validity of the sacrament is dependent upon the holiness of the administrator was rejected in the Donatist crisis.\\r\\n\\r\\nHowever, an apparent administration of a sacrament is invalid, if the person acting as minister does not have the necessary power (as if a deacon were to celebrate Mass). They are also invalid if the required \\"matter\\" or \\"form\\" is lacking. The matter is the perceptible material object, such as water in baptism or wheaten bread and grape wine for the Eucharist, or the visible action. The form is the verbal statement that specifies the signification of the matter, such as, (in the Western Church), \\"N., I baptize thee in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost\\". Furthermore, if the minister positively excludes some essential aspect of the sacrament, the sacrament is invalid. This last condition lies behind the 1896 judgement of the Holy See denying the validity of Anglican Orders.\\r\\n\\r\\nA sacrament may be administered validly, but illicitly, if a condition imposed by canon law is not observed. Obvious cases are administration of a sacrament by a priest under a penalty of excommunication or suspension, or an episcopal ordination without the Pontifical mandate (except in certain circumstances outlined in Canon Law).\\r\\n\\r\\nCanon law specifies impediments to reception of the sacraments of orders and marriage. Those concerning the first of these two sacraments only concern liceity, but \\"a diriment impediment renders a person incapable of validly contracting a marriage\\" (canon 1073).\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the Latin Church, only the Holy See can authentically declare when divine law prohibits or invalidates a marriage, and only the Holy See has the right to establish for those who are baptised other impediments to marriage (canon 1075). But individual Eastern Catholic Churches, after having fulfilled certain requirements that include consulting (but not necessarily obtaining approval from) the Holy See, may establish impediments.[47]\\r\\n\\r\\nIf an impediment is imposed by merely ecclesiastical law, rather than being a matter of divine law, the Church may grant a dispensation from the impediment.\\r\\n\\r\\nConditions for validity of marriage such as sufficient use of reason (canon 1095) and freedom from coercion (canon 1103), and the requirement that, normally, a marriage be contracted in the presence of the local Ordinary or parish priest or of the priest or deacon delegated by either of them, and in the presence of two witnesses (canon 1108), are not classified in the Code of Canon Law as impediments, but have much the same effect.\\r\\n\\r\\nThree of the sacraments may not be repeated: Baptism, Confirmation and Holy Orders: their effect is permanent. This teaching has been expressed by the images of, in the West, an indelible character or mark and of, in the East, a seal (CCC 698). However, if there is doubt about the validity of the administration of one or more of these sacraments, a conditional form of conferral may be used, such as: \\"If you are not already baptized, I baptize you \\"[48]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the recent past, it was common practice in the Catholic Church to baptize conditionally almost every convert from Protestantism because of a perceived difficulty in judging about the validity in any concrete instance. In the case of the major Protestant denominations, agreements involving assurances about the manner in which they administer baptism has ended this practice, which sometimes continues for other groups of Protestant tradition. The Catholic Church has always recognized the validity of baptism in the Eastern Orthodox Church,[citation needed] but it has explicitly denied the validity of the baptism conferred in the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.[49] It does not recognize a baptismal ceremony in which the names of the three divine persons (or hypostases) of the TrinityFather, Son and Holy Spiritare replaced by descriptors such as Creator, Redeemer and Sanctifier, or Creator, Liberator, and Sustainer, and requires that the conditional form should not be used when baptizing those who have received this kind of baptism.[50]","input":"What are the 7 sacraments of the roman catholic church?"},{"output":"around AD 1040","context":"Movable type (US English; moveable type in British English) is the system and technology of printing and typography that uses movable components to reproduce the elements of a document (usually individual letters or punctuation) usually on the medium of paper.\\r\\nThe world's first movable type printing press technology for printing paper books was made of porcelain materials and was invented around AD 1040 in China during the Northern Song Dynasty by the inventor Bi Sheng (990ÿ1051).[1] Subsequently in 1377, the world's oldest extant movable metal print book, Jikji, was printed in Korea during the Goryeo dynasty. Because of this, the diffusion of both movable-type systems was, to some degree, limited to primarily East Asia, although various sporadic reports of movable type technology were brought back to Europe by Christian missionaries, traders and business people who were returning to Europe after having worked in China for several years and influenced the development of printing technology in Europe. Some of these medieval European accounts are still preserved in the library archives of the Vatican and Oxford University among many others.[2] Around 1450, Johannes Gutenberg introduced the metal movable-type printing press in Europe, along with innovations in casting the type based on a matrix and hand mould. The small number of alphabetic characters needed for European languages was an important factor.[3] Gutenberg was the first to create his type pieces from an alloy of lead, tin, and antimonyand these materials remained standard for 550 years.[4]\\r\\nFor alphabetic scripts, movable-type page setting was quicker than woodblock printing. The metal type pieces were more durable and the lettering was more uniform, leading to typography and fonts. The high quality and relatively low price of the Gutenberg Bible (1455) established the superiority of movable type in Europe and the use of printing presses spread rapidly. The printing press may be regarded as one of the key factors fostering the Renaissance[5] and due to its effectiveness, its use spread around the globe.\\r\\nThe 19th-century invention of hot metal typesetting and its successors caused movable type to decline in the 20th century.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe technique of imprinting multiple copies of symbols or glyphs with a master type punch made of hard metal first developed around 3000 BC in ancient Sumer. These metal punch types can be seen as precursors of the letter punches adapted in later millennia to printing with movable metal type. Cylinder seals were used in Mesopotamia to create an impression on a surface by rolling the seal on wet clay.[6] They were used to \\"sign\\" documents and mark objects as the owner's property. Cylinder seals were a related form of early typography capable of printing small page designs in relief (cameo) on wax or claya miniature forerunner of rotogravure printing used by wealthy individuals to seal and certify documents. By 650 BC the ancient Greeks were using larger diameter punches to imprint small page images onto coins and tokens.\\r\\nThe designs of the artists who made the first coin punches were stylized with a degree of skill that could not be mistaken for common handiworksalient and very specific types designed to be reproduced ad infinitum. Unlike the first typefaces used to print books in the 13th century, coin types were neither combined nor printed with ink on paper, but \\"published\\" in metala more durable mediumand survived in substantial numbers. As the portable face of ruling authority, coins were a compact form of standardized knowledge issued in large editions, an early mass medium that stabilized trade and civilization throughout the Mediterranean world of antiquity.\\r\\nSeals and stamps may have been precursors to movable type. The uneven spacing of the impressions on brick stamps found in the Mesopotamian cities of Uruk and Larsa, dating from the 2nd millennium BC, has been conjectured by some archaeologists as evidence that the stamps were made using movable type.[7] The enigmatic Minoan Phaistos Disc of 1800ÿ1600 BC has been considered by one scholar as an early example of a body of text being reproduced with reusable characters: it may have been produced by pressing pre-formed hieroglyphic \\"seals\\" into the soft clay. A few authors even view the disc as technically meeting all definitional criteria to represent an early incidence of movable-type printing.[8][9] Recently it has been alleged by Jerome Eisenberg that the disk is a forgery.[10]\\r\\nThe Prfening dedicatory inscription is medieval example of movable type stamps being used.\\r\\nFollowing the invention of paper in the 2nd century AD during the Chinese Han Dynasty, writing materials became more portable and economical than the bones, shells, bamboo slips, metal or stone tablets, silk, etc. previously used. Yet copying books by hand was still labour-consuming. Not until the Xiping Era (172ÿ178 AD), towards the end of the Eastern Han Dynasty did sealing print and monotype appear. It was soon used for printing designs on fabrics, and later for printing texts.\\r\\nWoodblock printing, invented by about the 8th century during the Tang Dynasty, worked as follows. First, the neat hand-copied script was stuck on a relatively thick and smooth board, with the front of the paper, which was so thin that it was nearly transparent, sticking to the board, and characters showing in reverse, but distinctly, so that every stroke could be easily recognized. Then carvers cut away the parts of the board that were not part of the character, so that the characters were cut in relief, completely differently from those cut intaglio. When printing, the bulging characters would have some ink spread on them and be covered by paper. With workers' hands moving on the back of paper gently, characters would be printed on the paper. By the Song Dynasty, woodblock printing came to its heyday. Although woodblock printing played an influential role in spreading culture, there remained some apparent drawbacks. Firstly, carving the printing plate required considerable time, labour and materials; secondly, it was not convenient to store these plates; and finally, it was difficult to correct mistakes.\\r\\nWith woodblock printing, one printing plate could be used for tens of hundreds of books, playing a magnificent role in spreading culture. Yet carving the plate was time and labour consuming. Huge books cost years of effort. The plates needed a lot of storage space, and were often damaged by deformation, worms and corrosion. If books had a small print run, and were not reprinted, the printing plates would become nothing but waste; and worse, if a mistake was found, it was difficult to correct it without discarding the whole plate.\\r\\nBi Sheng (?N/??N) (990ÿ1051) developed the first known movable-type system for printing in China around 1040 AD during the Northern Song dynasty, using ceramic materials.[11][12] As described by the Chinese scholar Shen Kuo (\`) (1031ÿ1095):\\r\\nWhen he wished to print, he took an iron frame and set it on the iron plate. In this he placed the types, set close together. When the frame was full, the whole made one solid block of type. He then placed it near the fire to warm it. When the paste [at the back] was slightly melted, he took a smooth board and pressed it over the surface, so that the block of type became as even as a whetstone.\\r\\nFor each character there were several types, and for certain common characters there were twenty or more types each, in order to be prepared for the repetition of characters on the same page. When the characters were not in use he had them arranged with paper labels, one label for each rhyme-group, and kept them in wooden cases.\\r\\nIf one were to print only two or three copies, this method would be neither simple nor easy. But for printing hundreds or thousands of copies, it was marvelously quick. As a rule he kept two forms going. While the impression was being made from the one form, the type was being put in place on the other. When the printing of the one form was finished, the other was then ready. In this way the two forms alternated and the printing was done with great rapidity.[11]\\r\\nIn 1193, Zhou Bida, an officer of Southern Song Dynasty, made a set of clay movable-type method according to the method described by Shen Kuo in his Dream Pool Essays, and printed his book Notes of The Jade Hall (ޔљ?).[13]\\r\\nThe claim that Bi Sheng's clay types were \\"fragile\\" and \\"not practical for large-scale printing\\" and \\"short lived\\"[14] was refuted by facts and experiments. Bao Shicheng (1775ÿ1885) wrote that baked clay moveable type was \\"as hard and tough as horn\\"; experiments show that clay type, after being baked in an oven, becomes hard and difficult to break, such that it remains intact after being dropped from a height of two metres onto a marble floor. The length of clay movable types in China was 1 to 2 centimetres, not 2mm, thus hard as horn.\\r\\nThere has been an ongoing debate regarding the success of ceramic printing technology as there have been no printed materials found with ceramic movable types. However, it is historically recorded to have been used as late as 1844 in China from the Song dynasty through the Qing dynasty.[13][15]:22\\r\\nBi Sheng (990ÿ1051) also pioneered the use of wooden movable type around 1040 AD, as described by the Chinese scholar Shen Kuo (1031ÿ1095). However, this technology was abandoned in favour of clay movable types due to the presence of wood grains and the unevenness of the wooden type after being soaked in ink.[11][16]\\r\\nIn 1298, Wang Zhen (t_/t?), a Yuan dynasty governmental official of Jingde County, Anhui Province, China, re-invented a method of making movable wooden types. He made more than 30,000 wooden movable types and printed 100 copies of Records of Jingde County (CƳ), a book of more than 60,000 Chinese characters. Soon afterwards, he summarized his invention in his book A method of making moveable wooden types for printing books. Although the wooden type was more durable under the mechanical rigors of handling, repeated printing wore the character faces down, and the types could only be replaced by carving new pieces. This system was later enhanced by pressing wooden blocks into sand and casting metal types from the depression in copper, bronze, iron or tin. This new method overcame many of the shortcomings of woodblock printing. Rather than manually carving an individual block to print a single page, movable type printing allowed for the quick assembly of a page of text. Furthermore, these new, more compact type fonts could be reused and stored.[11][12] The set of wafer-like metal stamp types could be assembled to form pages, inked, and page impressions taken from rubbings on cloth or paper.[12] In 1322a Fenghua county officer Ma Chengde (C) in Zhejiang, made 100,000 wooded movable types and printed the 43-volume Daxue Yanyi (?Wđ). Wooden movable types were used continually in China. Even as late as 1733, a 2300-volume Wuying Palace Collected Gems Edition (Kד??w?) was printed with 253,500 wooden movable types on order of the Yongzheng Emperor, and completed in one year.\\r\\nA number of books printed in Tangut script during the Western Xia (1038ÿ1227) period are known, of which the Auspicious Tantra of All-Reaching Union that was discovered in the ruins of Baisigou Square Pagoda in 1991 is believed to have been printed sometime during the reign of Emperor Renzong of Western Xia (1139ÿ1193).[17] It is considered by many Chinese experts to be the earliest extant example of a book printed using wooden movable type.[18]\\r\\nThe logistical problems of handling the several thousand logographs (required for full literacy in Chinese language) posed a particular difficulty. It was faster to carve one woodblock per page than to composit a page from so many different types. However, if one used movable type to produce multiple copies of the same document, the speed of printing would increase relatively.[11]:201\\r\\nAt least 13 material finds in China indicate the invention of bronze movable type printing in China no later than the 12th century,[19] with the country producing large-scale bronze-plate-printed paper money and formal official documents issued by the Jin (1115ÿ1234) and Southern Song (1127ÿ1279) dynasties with embedded bronze metal types for anti-counterfeit markers. Such paper-money printing might date back to the 11th-century jiaozi of Northern Song (960ÿ1127).[15]:41ÿ54\\r\\nThe typical example of this kind of bronze movable type embedded copper-block printing is a printed \\"check\\" of the Jin Dynasty with two square holes for embedding two bronze movable-type characters, each selected from 1,000 different characters, such that each printed paper note has a different combination of markers. A copper-block printed note dated between 1215ÿ1216 in the collection of Luo Zhenyu's Pictorial Paper Money of the Four Dynasties, 1914, shows two special characters ÿ one called Ziliao, the other called Zihao ÿ for the purpose of preventing counterfeiting; over the Ziliao there is a small character (?) printed with movable copper type, while over the Zihao there is an empty square hole ÿ apparently the associated copper metal type was lost. Another sample of Song dynasty money of the same period in the collection of the Shanghai Museum has two empty square holes above Ziliao as well as Zihou, due to the loss of the two copper movable types. Song dynasty bronze block embedded with bronze metal movable type printed paper money was issued on a large scale and remained in circulation for a long time.[20]\\r\\nThe 1298 book Zao Huozi Yinshufa (Cd/C?\`?) by the Yuan dynasty (1271ÿ1368) official Wang Zhen mentions tin movable type, used probably since the Southern Song dynasty (1127ÿ1279), but this was largely experimental.[21] It was unsatisfactory due to its incompatibility with the inking process.[11]:217\\r\\nDuring the Mongol Empire (1206ÿ1405), printing using movable type spread from China to Central Asia.[clarification needed] The Uyghurs of Central Asia used movable type, their script type adopted from the Mongol language, some with Chinese words printed between the pages ÿ strong evidence that the books were printed in China.[22]\\r\\nDuring the Ming Dynasty (1368ÿ1644), Hua Sui in 1490 used bronze type in printing books.[11]:212 In 1574 the massive 1000-volume encyclopedia Imperial Readings of the Taiping Era (QLM/QLɡ) was printed with bronze movable type.\\r\\nIn 1725 the Qing Dynasty government made 250,000 bronze movable-type characters and printed 64 sets of the encyclopedic Gujin Tushu Jicheng (̤ZdĦ/̤?D?ؚ̂?, Complete Collection of Illustrations and Writings from the Earliest to Current Times). Each set consisted of 5,040 volumes, making a total of 322,560 volumes printed using movable type.[22]\\r\\nIn 1234 the first books known to have been printed in metallic type set were published in Goryeo Dynasty Korea. They form a set of ritual books, Sangjeong Gogeum Yemun, compiled by Choe Yun-ui. [23][24]\\r\\nWhile these books have not survived, the oldest book in the world printed in metallic movable types is Jikji, printed in Korea in 1377.[25] The Asian Reading Room of the Library of Congress in Washington, D.C. displays examples of this metal type.[26] Commenting on the invention of metallic types by Koreans, French scholar Henri-Jean Martin described this as \\"[extremely similar] to Gutenberg's\\".[27]\\r\\nThe techniques for bronze casting, used at the time for making coins (as well as bells and statues) were adapted to making metal type. The Joseon dynasty scholar Seong Hyeon (??, ?], 1439ÿ1504) records the following description of the Korean font-casting process:\\r\\nAt first, one cuts letters in beech wood. One fills a trough level with fine sandy [clay] of the reed-growing seashore. Wood-cut letters are pressed into the sand, then the impressions become negative and form letters [moulds]. At this step, placing one trough together with another, one pours the molten bronze down into an opening. The fluid flows in, filling these negative moulds, one by one becoming type. Lastly, one scrapes and files off the irregularities, and piles them up to be arranged.[23]\\r\\nA potential solution to the linguistic and cultural bottleneck that held back movable type in Korea for 200 years appeared in the early 15th centurya generation before Gutenberg would begin working on his own movable-type invention in Europewhen Sejong the Great devised a simplified alphabet of 24 characters (hangul) for use by the common people, which could have made the typecasting and compositing process more feasible. But Korea's cultural elite, \\"appalled at the idea of losing hanja, the badge of their elitism\\", stifled the adoption of the new alphabet.[12]\\r\\nA \\"Confucian prohibition on the commercialization of printing\\" also obstructed the proliferation of movable type, restricting the distribution of books produced using the new method to the government.[28] The technique was restricted to use by the royal foundry for official state publications only, where the focus was on reprinting Chinese classics lost in 1126 when Korea's libraries and palaces had perished in a conflict between dynasties.[28]\\r\\nScholarly debate and speculation has occurred as to whether Eastern movable type spread to Europe between the late 14th century and early 15th centuries.[23][29]:58ÿ69[30][31]\\r\\nJohannes Gutenberg of Mainz, Germany is acknowledged as the first to invent a metal movable-type printing system in Europe, the printing press. Gutenberg was a goldsmith familiar with techniques of cutting punches for making coins from moulds. Between 1436 and 1450 he developed hardware and techniques for casting letters from matrices using a device called the hand mould.[29] Gutenberg's key invention and contribution to movable-type printing in Europe, the hand mould, was the first practical means of making cheap copies of letterpunches in the vast quantities needed to print complete books, making the movable-type printing process a viable enterprise.\\r\\nBefore Gutenberg, books were copied out by hand on scrolls and paper, or printed from hand-carved wooden blocks. It was extremely time-consuming; even a small book could take months to complete, and because the carved letters or blocks were flimsy and the wood susceptible to ink the blocks had a limited lifespan.\\r\\nGutenberg and his associates developed oil-based inks ideally suited to printing with a press on paper, and the first Latin typefaces. His method of casting type may have been different from the hand mould used in subsequent decades. Detailed analysis of the type used in his 42-line Bible has revealed irregularities in some of the characters that cannot be attributed to ink spread or type wear under the pressure of the press. Scholars conjecture that the type pieces may have been cast from a series of matrices made with a series of individual stroke punches, producing many different versions of the same glyph.\\r\\n[34] It has also been suggested that the method used by Gutenberg involved using a single punch to make a mould, but the mould was such that the process of taking the type out disturbed the casting, creating variants and anomalies, and that the punch-matrix system came into use possibly around the 1470s.[35] This raises the possibility that the development of movable type in the West may have been progressive rather than a single innovation.[36]\\r\\nGutenberg's movable-type printing system spread rapidly across Europe, from the single Mainz printing press in 1457 to 110 presses by 1480, of which 50 were in Italy. Venice quickly became the center of typographic and printing activity. Significant were the contributions of Nicolas Jenson, Francesco Griffo, Aldus Manutius, and other printers of late 15th-century Europe.\\r\\nType-founding as practiced in Europe and the west consists of three stages.\\r\\nThe type-height was quite different in different countries. The Monotype Corporation Limited in London UK produced moulds in various heights:\\r\\nA Dutch printers manual mentions a tiny difference between French and German Height:[38]\\r\\nTiny differences in type-height will cause quite bold images of characters.\\r\\nAt the end of the 19th century there were only two typefoundries left in the Netherlands: Johan Ensched & Zonen, at Haarlem, and Lettergieterij Amsterdam, voorheen Tetterode. They both had their own type-height: Ensched: 65 23/24 points Didot, and Amsterdam: 66 1/24 points Didot. Enough difference to prevent a combined use of fonts of both typefoundries: Enschede would be to light, or otherwise the Amsterdam-font would print rather bold. A perfect way of binding clients.[39]\\r\\nIn 1905 the Dutch governmental \\"Algemeene Landsdrukkerij\\", later: \\"State-printery\\" (Staatsdrukkerij) decided during a reorganisation to use a standard type-height of 63 points Didot. \\"Staatdrukkerij-hoogte\\", actually Belgium-height, but this fact was not widely known.\\r\\nModern, factory-produced movable type was available in the late 19th century. It was held in the printing shop in a job case, a drawer about 2?inches high, a yard wide, and about two feet deep, with many small compartments for the various letters and ligatures. The most popular and accepted of the job case designs in America was the California Job Case, which took its name from the Pacific coast location of the foundries that made the case popular.[40]\\r\\nTraditionally, the capital letters were stored in a separate drawer or case that was located above the case that held the other letters; this is why capital letters are called \\"upper case\\" characters while the non-capitals are \\"lower case\\".[41]\\r\\nCompartments also held spacers, which are blocks of blank type used to separate words and fill out a line of type, such as em and en quads (quadrats, or spaces. A quadrat is a block of type whose face is lower than the printing letters so that it does not itself print.). An em space was the width of a capital letter \\"M\\" ÿ as wide as it was high ÿ while an en space referred to a space half the width of its height (usually the dimensions for a capital \\"N\\").\\r\\nIndividual letters are assembled into words and lines of text with the aid of a composing stick, and the whole assembly is tightly bound together to make up a page image called a forme, where all letter faces are exactly the same height to form a flat surface of type.

In the industrial era printing methods would be chosen to suit the purpose. For example, when printing large scale letters in posters etc. the metal type would have proved too heavy and economically unviable. Thus, large scale type was made as carved wood blocks as well as ceramics plates.[42] Also in many cases where large scale text was required, it was simpler to hand the job to a sign painter than a printer. Images could be printed together with movable type if they were made as woodcuts or wood engravings as long as the blocks were made to the same type height. If intaglio methods, such as copper plates, were used for the images, then images and the text would have required separate print runs on different machines.","input":"When was movable type printing invented in china?"},{"output":"about 4 billion years ago","context":"","input":"When did the first bacteria appear on earth?"},{"output":"the western Himalayas in the Indian state of Uttarakhand","context":"","input":"Where do the river ganga have their origin?"},{"output":"an article written by the senior editorial staff or publisher of a newspaper, magazine, or any other written document, often unsigned","context":"\\r\\n\\r\\nAn editorial, leading article (US) or leader (UK), is an article written by the senior editorial staff or publisher of a newspaper, magazine, or any other written document, often unsigned.

However, a newspaper may choose to publish an editorial on the front page. In the English-language press, this occurs rarely and only on topics considered especially important; it is more common, however, in some European countries such as Spain, Italy, and France.[5]\\r\\n\\r\\nMany newspapers publish their editorials without the name of the leader writer.

Japan has been in the top three of the countries with most cars manufactured since the 1960s, surpassing Germany. The automotive industry in Japan rapidly increased from the 1970s to the 1990s (when it was oriented both for domestic use and worldwide export) and in the 1980s and 1990s, overtook the U.S. as the production leader with up to 13 million cars per year manufactured and significant exports. After massive ramp-up by China in the 2000s and fluctuating U.S. output, Japan is now currently the third largest automotive producer in the world with an annual production of 9.9 million automobiles in 2012.[1] Japanese investments helped grow the auto industry in many countries throughout the last few decades.[citation needed]\\r\\nJapanese zaibatsu (business conglomerates) began building their first automobiles in the middle to late 1910s. The companies went about this by either designing their own trucks (the market for passenger vehicles in Japan at the time was small), or partnering with a European brand to produce and sell their cars in Japan under license. Such examples of this are Isuzu partnering with Wolseley Motors (UK), Nissan partnering with British automaker Austin, and the Mitsubishi Model A, which was based upon the Fiat Tipo 3. The demand for domestic trucks was greatly increased by the Japanese military buildup before World War II, causing many Japanese manufacturers to break out of their shells and design their own vehicles. In the 1970s Japan was the pioneer in robotics manufacturing of vehicles.\\r\\nThe country is home to a number of companies that produce cars, construction vehicles, motorcycles, ATVs, and engines. Japanese automotive manufacturers include Toyota, Honda, Daihatsu, Nissan, Suzuki, Mazda, Mitsubishi, Subaru, Isuzu, Kawasaki, Yamaha, and Mitsuoka.\\r\\nCars designed in Japan have won the European Car of the Year, International Car of the Year, and World Car of the Year awards many times. Japanese vehicles have had worldwide influence, and no longer have the stigma they had in the 1950s and 1960s when they first emerged internationally.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1904, Torao Yamaha produced the first domestically manufactured bus, which was powered by a steam engine. In 1907, Komanosuke Uchiyama produced the Takuri, the first entirely Japanese-made gasoline engine car. The Kunisue Automobile Works built the Kunisue in 1910, and the following year manufactured the Tokyo in cooperation with Tokyo Motor Vehicles Ltd. In 1911, Kaishinsha Motorcar Works was established and later began manufacturing a car called the DAT. In 1920, Jitsuyo Jidosha Seizo Co., founded by William R. Gorham, began building the Gorham and later the Lila. The company merged with Kaishinsha in 1926 to form the DAT Automobile Manufacturing Co. (later to evolve into Nissan Motors). From 1924 to 1927, Hakuyosha Ironworks Ltd. built the Otomo. Toyota, a textile manufacturer, began building cars in 1936.[2] Most early vehicles, however, were trucks produced under military subsidy. Isuzu, Yanmar and Daihatsu initially focused on diesel engine development.\\r\\nCars built in Japan before World War II tended to be based on European or American models. The 1917 Mitsubishi Model A was based on the Fiat A3-3 design. (This model was considered to be the first mass-produced car in Japan, with 22 units produced.) In the 1930s, Nissan Motors' cars were based on the Austin 7 and Graham-Paige designs, while the Toyota AA model was based on the Chrysler Airflow. Ohta built cars in the 1930s based on Ford models, while Chiyoda built a car resembling a 1935 Pontiac, and Sumida built a car similar to a LaSalle.[3][4]\\r\\nAutomobile manufacture from Japanese companies was struggling, despite investment efforts by the Japanese Government. The 1923 Great Kant earthquake devastated most of Japan's fledgling infrastructure and truck and construction equipment manufacturing benefited from recovery efforts. Yanase & Co., Ltd. (JdHǤϱ Yanase Kabushiki gaisha) was an importer of American-made cars to Japan and contributed to disaster recovery efforts by importing GMC trucks and construction equipment. By bringing in American products, Japanese manufacturers were able to examine the imported vehicles and develop their own products.\\r\\nFrom 1925 until the beginning of World War II, Ford and GM[5] had factories in Japan, where they dominated the Japanese market. The Ford Motor Company of Japan was established in 1925 and a production plant was set up in Yokohama. General Motors established operations in Osaka in 1927. Chrysler also came to Japan and set up Kyoritsu Motors.[6] Between 1925 and 1936, the United States Big Three automakers' Japanese subsidiaries produced a total of 208,967 vehicles, compared to the domestic producers total of 12,127 vehicles. In 1936, the Japanese government passed the Automobile Manufacturing Industry Law, which was intended to promote the domestic auto industry and reduce foreign competition;[7] ironically, this stopped the groundbreaking of an integrated Ford plant in Yokohama, modeled on Dagenham in England and intended to serve the Asian market, that would have established Japan as a major exporter[citation needed]. Instead by 1939, the foreign manufacturers had been forced out of Japan. Vehicle production was shifted in the late 1930s to truck production due to the Second Sino-Japanese War.[8][9][10]\\r\\nDuring World War II, Toyota, Nissan, Isuzu and Kurogane built trucks and motorcycles for the Imperial Japanese Army, with Kurogane introducing the worlds first mass-produced four-wheel-drive car, called the Kurogane Type 95 in 1936. For the first decade after World War II, auto production was limited, and until 1966 most production consisted of trucks (including three-wheeled vehicles). Thereafter passenger cars dominated the market. Japanese car designs also continued to imitate or be derived from European and American designs.[11] Exports were very limited in the 1950s, adding up to only 3.1% of the total passenger car production of the decade.[12]\\r\\nDuring the 1960s, Japanese automakers launched a bevy of new kei cars in their domestic market; scooters and motorcycles remained dominant, with sales of 1.47 million in 1960 versus a mere 36,000 kei cars.[13] These tiny automobiles usually featured very small engines (under 360cc, but were sometimes fitted with engines of up to 600cc for export) to keep taxes much lower than larger cars. The average person in Japan was now able to afford an automobile, which boosted sales dramatically and jumpstarted the auto industry toward becoming what it is today. The first of this new era, actually launched in 1958, was the Subaru 360. It was known as the \\"Lady Beetle\\", comparing its significance to the Volkswagen Beetle in Germany. Other significant models were the Suzuki Fronte, Mitsubishi Minica, Mazda Carol, and the Honda N360.\\r\\nThe keis were very minimalist motoring, however, much too small for most family car usage. The most popular economy car segment in the sixties was the 700-800?cc class, embodied by the Toyota Publica, Mitsubishi Colt 800, and the original Mazda Familia. By the end of the sixties, however, these (often two-stroke) cars were being replaced by full one-litre cars with four-stroke engines, a move which was spearheaded by Nissan's 1966 Sunny.[14] All other manufacturers quickly followed suit, except for Toyota who equipped their Corolla with a 1.1 litre engine - the extra 100?cc were heavily touted in period advertising. These small family cars took a bigger and bigger share of an already expanding market. All vehicles sold in Japan were taxed yearly based on exterior dimensions and engine displacement. This was established by legislation passed in 1950 that established tax brackets on two classifications; dimension regulations and engine displacement. The taxes were a primary consideration as to which vehicles were selected by Japanese consumers, and guided manufacturers as to what type of vehicles the market would buy.\\r\\nExports of passenger cars increased nearly twohundred-fold in the sixties compared to the previous decade, and were now up to 17.0 percent of the total production.[12] This though, was still only the beginning. Rapidly increasing domestic demand and the expansion of Japanese car companies into foreign markets in the 1970s further accelerated growth. Effects of the 1973 Arab Oil Embargo accelerated vehicle exports along with the exchange rate of the Japanese yen to the U.S. Dollar, UK Pound, and West German Deutsche Mark. Passenger car exports rose from 100,000 in 1965 to 1,827,000 in 1975. Automobile production in Japan continued to increase rapidly after the 1970s, as Mitsubishi (as Dodge vehicles) and Honda began selling their vehicles in the US. Even more brands came to America and abroad during the 1970s, and by the 1980s, the Japanese manufacturers were gaining a major foothold in the US and world markets.\\r\\nJapanese cars became popular with British buyers in the early 1970s, with Nissan's Datsun badged cars (the Nissan brand was not used on British registered models until 1983) proving especially popular and earning a reputation in Britain for their reliability and low running costs, although rust was a major problem. In the 1960s Japanese manufacturers began to compete head-on in the domestic market, model for model. This was exemplified by the \\"CB-war\\" between the Toyota Corona and Nissan's Bluebird. While this initially led to benefits for consumers, before long R&D expenditures swelled. Towards the late 1980s and early 1990s Japanese automobile manufacturers had entered a stage of \\"Hyper-design\\" and \\"Hyper-equipment\\"; an arms race leading to less competitive products albeit produced in a highly efficient manner.[15]\\r\\nWith Japanese manufacturers producing very affordable, reliable, and popular cars throughout the 1990s, Japan became the largest car producing nation in the world in 2000. However, its market share has decreased slightly in recent years, particularly due to old and new competition from South Korea, China and India. Nevertheless, Japan's car industry continues to flourish, its market share has risen again, and in the first quarter of 2008 Toyota surpassed American General Motors to become the world's largest car manufacturer.[16] Today, Japan is the third largest automobile market and, until China recently overtook them, was the largest car producer in the world. Still, automobile export remains one of the country's most profitable exports and is a cornerstone of recovery plan for the latest economic crisis. Even though Japan has been taken over by Mainland China as the world's largest car producer, Japanese imports continue to be widely used on streets and highways in the Chinese special administrative regions of Hong Kong and Macau.\\r\\nThe following are vehicle production volumes for Japanese vehicle manufacturers, according to the Japan Automobile Manufacturers Association (JAMA).[18]","input":"When did japan become one of the leading manufacturers of automobiles in the world?"},{"output":"a group of British boys stranded on an uninhabited island and their disastrous attempt to govern themselves","context":"Lord of the Flies is a 1954 novel by Nobel Prize-winning British author William Golding.

It has been adapted to film twice in English, in 1963 by Peter Brook and 1990 by Harry Hook, and once in Filipino (1975).\\r\\nThe book takes place in the midst of an unspecified war.[2] Some of the marooned characters are ordinary students, while others arrive as a musical choir under an established leader. With the exception of Sam and Eric and the choirboys, they appear never to have encountered each other before. The book portrays their descent into savagery; left to themselves on a paradisiacal island, far from modern civilization, the well-educated children regress to a primitive state.\\r\\nGolding wrote his book as a counterpoint to R.M. Ballantyne's youth novel The Coral Island (1858),[3] and included specific references to it, such as the rescuing naval officer's description of the children's pursuit of Ralph as \\"a jolly good show, like the Coral Island\\".[4] Golding's three central charactersRalph, Piggy and Jackhave been interpreted as caricatures of Ballantyne's Coral Island protagonists.[5]\\r\\nIn the midst of a wartime evacuation, a British aeroplane crashes on or near an isolated island in a remote region of the Pacific Ocean. The only survivors are boys in their middle childhood or preadolescence. Two boysthe fair-haired Ralph and an overweight, bespectacled boy nicknamed \\"Piggy\\"find a conch, which Ralph uses as a horn to convene all the survivors to one area. Ralph is optimistic, believing that grown-ups will come to rescue them but Piggy realizes the need to organize: (\\"put first things first and act proper\\"). Because Ralph appears responsible for bringing all the survivors together, he immediately commands some authority over the other boys and is quickly elected their \\"chief\\". He does not receive the votes of the members of a boys' choir, led by the red-headed Jack Merridew, although he allows the choir boys to form a separate clique of hunters. Ralph establishes three primary policies: to have fun, to survive, and to constantly maintain a smoke signal that could alert passing ships to their presence on the island and thus rescue them. The boys establish a form of democracy by declaring that whoever holds the conch shall also be able to speak at their formal gatherings and receive the attentive silence of the larger group.\\r\\nJack organises his choir into a hunting party responsible for discovering a food source. Ralph, Jack, and a quiet, dreamy boy named Simon soon form a loose triumvirate of leaders with Ralph as the ultimate authority. Upon inspection of the island, the three determine that it has fruit and wild pigs for food. The boys also use Piggy's spectacles to create a fire. Though he is Ralph's only real confidant, Piggy is quickly made into an outcast by his fellow \\"biguns\\" (older boys) and becomes an unwilling source of laughs for the other children while being hated by Jack. Simon, in addition to supervising the project of constructing shelters, feels an instinctive need to protect the \\"littluns\\" (younger boys).\\r\\nThe semblance of order quickly deteriorates as the majority of the boys turn idle; they give little aid in building shelters, spend their time having fun and begin to develop paranoias about the island. The central paranoia refers to a supposed monster they call the \\"beast\\", which they all slowly begin to believe exists on the island. Ralph insists that no such beast exists, but Jack, who has started a power struggle with Ralph, gains a level of control over the group by boldly promising to kill the creature. At one point, Jack summons all of his hunters to hunt down a wild pig, drawing away those assigned to maintain the signal fire. A ship travels by the island, but without the boys' smoke signal to alert the ship's crew, the vessel continues without stopping. Ralph angrily confronts Jack about his failure to maintain the signal; in frustration Jack assaults Piggy, breaking his glasses. The boys subsequently enjoy their first feast. Angered by the failure of the boys to attract potential rescuers, Ralph considers relinquishing his position as leader, but is convinced not to do so by Piggy, who both understands Ralph's importance and deeply fears what will become of him should Jack take total control.\\r\\nOne night, an aerial battle occurs near the island while the boys sleep, during which a fighter pilot ejects from his plane and dies in the descent. His body drifts down to the island in his parachute; both get tangled in a tree near the top of the mountain. Later on, while Jack continues to scheme against Ralph, the twins Sam and Eric, now assigned to the maintenance of the signal fire, see the corpse of the fighter pilot and his parachute in the dark. Mistaking the corpse for the beast, they run to the cluster of shelters that Ralph and Simon have erected to warn the others. This unexpected meeting again raises tensions between Jack and Ralph. Shortly thereafter, Jack decides to lead a party to the other side of the island, where a mountain of stones, later called Castle Rock, forms a place where he claims the beast resides. Only Ralph and a quiet suspicious boy, Roger, Jack's closest supporter, agree to go; Ralph turns back shortly before the other two boys but eventually all three see the parachutist, whose head rises via the wind. They then flee, now believing the beast is truly real. When they arrive at the shelters, Jack calls an assembly and tries to turn the others against Ralph, asking them to remove Ralph from his position. Receiving no support, Jack storms off alone to form his own tribe. Roger immediately sneaks off to join Jack, and slowly an increasing number of older boys abandon Ralph to join Jack's tribe. Jack's tribe continues to lure recruits from the main group by promising feasts of cooked pig. The members begin to paint their faces and enact bizarre rites, including sacrifices to the beast. One night, Ralph and Piggy decide to go to one of Jack's feasts.\\r\\nSimon, who faints frequently and is likely an epileptic,[6][7] has a secret hideaway where he goes to be alone. One day while he is there, Jack and his followers erect an offering to the beast nearby: a pig's head, mounted on a sharpened stick and soon swarming with scavenging flies. Simon conducts an imaginary dialogue with the head, which he dubs the \\"Lord of the Flies\\". The head mocks Simon's notion that the beast is a real entity, \\"something you could hunt and kill\\", and reveals the truth: they, the boys, are the beast; it is inside them all. The Lord of the Flies also warns Simon that he is in danger, because he represents the soul of man, and predicts that the others will kill him. Simon climbs the mountain alone and discovers that the \\"beast\\" is the dead parachutist. He rushes down to tell the other boys, who are engaged in a ritual dance. The frenzied boys mistake Simon for the beast, attack him, and beat him to death. Both Ralph and Piggy participate in the melee, and they become deeply disturbed by their actions after returning from Castle Rock.\\r\\nJack and his rebel band decide that the real symbol of power on the island is not the conch, but Piggy's glassesthe only means the boys have of starting a fire. They raid Ralph's camp, confiscate the glasses, and return to their abode on Castle Rock. Ralph, now deserted by most of his supporters, journeys to Castle Rock to confront Jack and secure the glasses. Taking the conch and accompanied only by Piggy, Sam, and Eric, Ralph finds the tribe and demands that they return the valuable object. Confirming their total rejection of Ralph's authority, the tribe capture and bind the twins under Jack's command. Ralph and Jack engage in a fight which neither wins before Piggy tries once more to address the tribe. Any sense of order or safety is permanently eroded when Roger, now sadistic, deliberately drops a boulder from his vantage point above, killing Piggy and shattering the conch. Ralph manages to escape, but Sam and Eric are tortured by Roger until they agree to join Jack's tribe.\\r\\nRalph secretly confronts Sam and Eric, who warn him that Jack and Roger hate him and that Roger has sharpened a stick at both ends, implying the tribe intends to hunt him like a pig and behead him. The following morning, Jack orders his tribe to begin a hunt for Ralph. Jack's savages set fire to the forest while Ralph desperately weighs his options for survival. Following a long chase, most of the island is consumed in flames. With the hunters closely behind him, Ralph trips and falls. He looks up at a uniformed adulta British naval officer whose party has landed from a passing warship to investigate the fire. Ralph bursts into tears over the death of Piggy and the \\"end of innocence\\". Jack and the other children, filthy and unkempt, also revert to their true ages and erupt into sobs. The officer expresses his disappointment at seeing British boys exhibiting such feral, warlike behaviour before turning to stare awkwardly at his own warship.\\r\\nAt an allegorical level, the central theme is the conflicting human impulses toward civilization and social organizationliving by rules, peacefully and in harmonyand toward the will to power. Themes include the tension between groupthink and individuality, between rational and emotional reactions, and between morality and immorality. How these play out, and how different people feel the influences of these form a major subtext of Lord of the Flies.[citation needed] The name \\"Lord of the Flies\\" is a literal translation of Beelzebub, from 2 Kings 1:2ÿ3, 6, 16.\\r\\nIn February 1960 Floyd C.

One of the larger rorqual species, adults range in length from 12ÿ16?m (39ÿ52?ft) and weigh around 25ÿ30 metric tons (28ÿ33 short tons). The humpback has a distinctive body shape, with long pectoral fins and a knobbly head. It is known for breaching and other distinctive surface behaviors, making it popular with whale watchers. Males produce a complex song lasting 10 to 20 minutes, which they repeat for hours at a time. Its purpose is not clear, though it may have a role in mating.\\r\\n\\r\\nFound in oceans and seas around the world, humpback whales typically migrate up to 25,000?km (16,000?mi) each year. They feed in polar waters, and migrate to tropical or subtropical waters to breed and give birth,  fasting and living off their fat reserves. Their diet consists mostly of krill and small fish. Humpbacks have a diverse repertoire of feeding methods, including the bubble net technique.\\r\\n\\r\\nLike other large whales, the humpback was a target for the whaling industry. Once hunted to the brink of extinction, its population fell by an estimated 90% before a 1966 moratorium. While stocks have partially recovered to some 80,000 animals worldwide, entanglement in fishing gear, collisions with ships and noise pollution continue to impact the species.\\r\\n\\r\\nB. bonaerensis (southern minke whale)\\r\\n\\r\\nB. acutorostra (northern minke whale)\\r\\n\\r\\nB. physalus (fin whale)\\r\\n\\r\\nB. edeni (pygmy Bryde's whale)\\r\\n\\r\\nB. borealis (sei whale)\\r\\n\\r\\nB. brydei (Bryde's whale)\\r\\n\\r\\nB. musculus (blue whale)\\r\\n\\r\\nMegaptera novaeangliae (humpback whale)\\r\\n\\r\\nEschrichtius robustus (gray whale)\\r\\n\\r\\nHumpback whales are rorquals, members of the Balaenopteridae family that includes the blue, fin, Bryde's, sei and minke whales. The rorquals are believed to have diverged from the other families of the suborder Mysticeti as long ago as the middle Miocene era.[4] However, it is not known when the members of these families diverged from each other.\\r\\n\\r\\nThough clearly related to the giant whales of the genus Balaenoptera, the humpback is the sole member of its genus. Recent DNA sequencing has indicated the humpback is actually more closely related to certain rorquals, particularly the fin whale (B. physalus) and possibly the gray (Eschrichtius robustus), than it is to others such as the minke.[5][6][7][8]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe humpback was first identified as baleine de la Nouvelle Angleterre by Mathurin Jacques Brisson in his Regnum Animale of 1756. In 1781, Georg Heinrich Borowski described the species, converting Brisson's name to its Latin equivalent, Balaena novaeangliae. In 1804, Lacpde shifted the humpback from the family Balaenidae, renaming it B. jubartes. In 1846, John Edward Gray created the genus Megaptera, classifying the humpback as Megaptera longipinna, but in 1932, Remington Kellogg reverted the species names to use Borowski's novaeangliae.[9] The common name is derived from the curving of their backs when diving. The generic name Megaptera from the Greek mega-/ךϫ- \\"giant\\" and ptera/ϫ \\"wing\\",[10] refers to their large front flippers. The specific name means \\"New Englander\\" and was probably given by Brisson due to regular sightings of humpbacks off the coast of New England.[9]\\r\\n\\r\\nGenetic research in mid-2014 by the British Antarctic Survey confirmed that the separate populations in the North Atlantic, North Pacific and Southern Oceans are more distinct than previously thought. Some biologists believe that these should be regarded as separate subspecies[11] and that they are evolving independently.[12]\\r\\n\\r\\nHumpbacks can easily be identified by their stocky body, obvious hump, black dorsal coloring and elongated pectoral fins. The head and lower jaw are covered with knobs called tubercles, which are hair follicles and are characteristic of the species. The fluked tail, which typically rises above the surface when diving, has wavy trailing edges.[13]\\r\\n\\r\\nHumpbacks have 270 to 400 darkly colored baleen plates on each side of their mouths.[14] The plates measure from 18?in (46?cm) in the front to about 3?ft (0.91?m) in the back, behind the hinge.\\r\\n\\r\\nVentral grooves run from the lower jaw to the umbilicus, about halfway along the underside of the body. These grooves are less numerous (usually 14ÿ22) than in other rorquals, but are fairly wide.[14]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe female has a hemispherical lobe about 15?cm (5.9?in) in diameter in her genital region. This visually distinguishes males and females.[14] The male's penis usually remains hidden in the genital slit.[15]\\r\\n\\r\\nFully grown males average 13ÿ14?m (43ÿ46?ft). Females are slightly larger at 15ÿ16?m (49ÿ52?ft); one large recorded specimen was 19?m (62?ft) long and had pectoral fins measuring 6?m (20?ft) each.[16] The largest humpback on record, according to whaling records, was a female killed in the Caribbean; she was 27?m (89?ft) long with a weight of 90 metric tons (99 short tons), although the reliability of this information is unconfirmed due to illogicality of the record.[17] The largest measured by the scientists of the Discovery Committee were a female 14.9?m (49?ft) and a male 14.75?m (48.5?ft), although this was out of a sample size of only 63 whales.[18] Body mass typically is in the range of 25ÿ30 metric tons (28ÿ33 short tons), with large specimens weighing over 40 metric tons (44 short tons).[19]\\r\\n\\r\\nNewborn calves are roughly the length of their mother's head. At birth, calves measure 6?m (20?ft) at 2 short tons (1.8?t). They nurse for about six months, then mix nursing and independent feeding for possibly six months more. Humpback milk is 50% fat and pink in color.\\r\\n\\r\\nFemales reach sexual maturity at age five, achieving full adult size a little later. Males reach sexual maturity around seven years of age.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe long black and white tail fin can be up to a third of body length.[20][21] Several hypotheses attempt to explain the humpback's pectoral fins, which are proportionally the longest fins of any cetacean. The higher maneuverability afforded by long fins and the usefulness of the increased surface area for temperature control when migrating between warm and cold climates possibly supported this adaptation.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe varying patterns on the tail flukes distinguish individual animals. A study using data from 1973 to 1998 on whales in the North Atlantic gave researchers detailed information on gestation times, growth rates and calving periods, as well as allowing more accurate population predictions by simulating the mark-release-recapture technique.[22] A photographic catalogue of all known North Atlantic whales was developed over this period and is maintained by College of the Atlantic.[23] Similar photographic identification projects operate around the world.\\r\\n\\r\\nHumpback whale skeleton on display at The Museum of Osteology, Oklahoma City, Oklahoma\\r\\n\\r\\nMother and calf in Boston Harbor\\r\\n\\r\\nA humpback whale tail displaying wavy rear edges\\r\\n\\r\\nA tail from a different individualthe tail of each humpback whale is visibly unique.\\r\\n\\r\\nIndividual identification in Vava'u, Tonga\\r\\n\\r\\nHumpback whale skeleton of \\"Snow\\" on display at Glacier Bay National Park and Preserve\\r\\n\\r\\nThe lifespan of rorquals ranges from 45 to 100 years.[24]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe humpback social structure is loose-knit. Typically, individuals live alone or in small, transient groups that disband after a few hours. Groups may stay together longer in summer to forage and feed cooperatively. Longer-term relationships between pairs or small groups, lasting months or even years, have rarely been observed. Some females possibly retain bonds created via cooperative feeding for a lifetime. Humpback whales often leap out of the water, a behaviour known as \\"breaching\\", and slap the water with their fins or tails\\r\\n\\r\\nCourtship rituals take place during the winter months, following migration toward the equator from summer feeding grounds closer to the poles. Competition is usually fierce. Unrelated males, dubbed escorts, frequently trail females, as well as cow-calf pairs. Males gather into \\"competitive groups\\" around a female and fight for the right to mate with her.[25] Group size ebbs and flows as unsuccessful males retreat and others arrive. Behaviors include breaching, spyhopping, lob-tailing, tail-slapping, pectoral fin-slapping, peduncle throws, charging and parrying.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhale song is thought to have an important role in mate selection; however, they may also be used between males to establish dominance.[26] Polyandry has been observed in humpback whales, with the females having multiple male partners throughout their lifespan.[27]\\r\\n\\r\\nFemales typically breed every two or three years. The gestation period is 11.5 months.  The peak months for birth are January, February (northern hemisphere), July and August (southern hemisphere). Females wait for one to two years before breeding again. Recent research on mitochondrial DNA reveals that groups living in proximity to each other may represent distinct breeding pools.[28] Humpback whale births have been rarely observed. One birth witnessed off Madagascar occurred within four minutes.[29]\\r\\n\\r\\nHumpbacks are a friendly species that interact with other cetacean species such as bottlenose dolphins. Right whales interact with humpbacks.[30] These behaviors have been recorded in all oceans.[31][32] Records of humpback and southern right whales demonstrating what were interpreted to be mating behaviors have been documented off the Mozambique [33] and Brazilian coasts.[34] Humpback whales appear in mixed groups with other species, such as the blue, fin, minke, gray and sperm whales.[35] Interaction with gray, fin,[36] and right whales have been observed.  Teams of researchers observed a male humpback whale singing an unknown type of song and approaching a fin whale at Rarotonga in 2014.[37] One individual was observed playing with a bottlenose dolphin in Hawaiian waters.[38] Recently, incidents of humpback whales protecting other species of animals such as seals and other whales from killer whales has been documented and filmed. Studies of such incidents indicate that the phenomenon is species-wide and global, with incidents being recorded at various locations across the world.[39] In September 2017 in Rarotonga, the Cook Islands, two adult humpback whales were observed protecting snorkeler and whale biologist Nan Hauser from a 4.5?m (15?ft) tiger shark, with one whale pushing the woman away from the shark while the other used its tail to block the predator's advances. This may be the first recorded incidence of humpback whales acting protective over a human.[40]\\r\\n\\r\\n Both male and female humpback whales vocalize, but only males produce the long, loud, complex \\"song\\" for which the species is famous. Each song consists of several sounds in a low register, varying in amplitude and frequency and typically lasting from 10 to 20 minutes.[41] Individuals may sing continuously for more than 24 hours. Cetaceans have no vocal cords, instead, they produce sound via a larynx like structure found in the throat, the mechanism of which has not as of yet been clearly identified. Whales do not have to exhale to produce sound.[42]\\r\\n\\r\\nWhales within a large area sing a single song. All North Atlantic humpbacks sing the same song, while those of the North Pacific sing a different song. Each population's song changes slowly over a period of years without repeating.[41]\\r\\n\\r\\nScientists are unsure of the purpose of whale songs. Only males sing, suggesting one purpose is to attract females. However, many of the whales observed to approach a singer are other males, often resulting in conflict. Singing may, therefore, be a challenge to other males.[43] Some scientists have hypothesized the song may serve an echolocative function.[44] During the feeding season, humpbacks make unrelated vocalizations for herding fish into their bubble nets.[45]\\r\\n\\r\\nHumpback whales make other sounds to communicate, such as grunts, groans, snorts and barks.[46]\\r\\n\\r\\nWhales are air-breathing mammals who must surface to get the air they need. The stubby dorsal fin is visible soon after the blow (exhalation) when the whale surfaces, but disappears by the time the flukes emerge. Humpbacks have a 3?m (9.8?ft), heart-shaped to bushy blow through the blowholes.\\r\\n\\r\\nThey do not generally sleep at the surface, but they must continue to breathe. Possibly only half of their brain sleeps at one time, with one half managing the surface-blow-dive process without awakening the other half.[47]\\r\\n\\r\\nMigratory patterns and social interactions were explored in the 1960s[48] and by further studies in 1971.[49] Calambokidis et al. provided the \\"first quantitative assessment of the migratory structure of humpback whales in the entire North Pacific basin.\\"[50]\\r\\n\\r\\nHumpbacks inhabit all major oceans, in a wide band running from the Antarctic ice edge to 77 N latitude. The four global populations are North Pacific, Atlantic, Southern Ocean and Indian Ocean populations. These populations are distinct. Although the species has cosmopolitan distribution and is usually not considered to cross the equator line, seasonal observations at Cape Verde suggest possible interactions among populations from both hemispheres.[51] Aside from the Arabian Sea group, year-round presences have been confirmed among British and Norwegian waters.[52] Parts of wintering grounds around the globe have been poorly studied or being undetected, such as around Pitcairn Islands,[53] Northern Mariana Islands (e.g. Marpi[54] and CK Reefs vicinity to Saipan[55] ), Dait Islands,[56] Volcano Islands,[57] Pasaleng Bay, Trindade and Martin Vaz, Mauritius, Aldabra,[58] and so on.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhales were once uncommon in the Mediterranean and the Baltic Sea, but have increased their presence in both waters as global populations have recovered. Recent increases within the Mediterranean basin, including re-sightings, indicate that more whales may migrate into the inland sea in the future, not only for wintering but also for feeding.[59][60] Humpbacks are also showing signs of re-expanding into former ranges, such as Scotland,[52] Skagerrak and Kattegat,[61] as well as Scandinavian fjords such as Kv?nangen, where they had not been observed for decades.[62][63]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the North Atlantic, feeding areas range from Scandinavia to New England. Breeding occurs in the Caribbean and Cape Verde.[64] In the South Atlantic and Indian Oceans, whales may breed off Brazil, as well the coasts of central, southern and southeastern Africa (including Madagascar).[65] Whale visits into Gulf of Mexico have been infrequent, but occurred in the gulf historically.[66] In the South Atlantic, about 10% of world population of the species possibly migrate to the Gulf of Guinea. Comparison of songs between those at Cape Lopez and Abrolhos Archipelago indicate that trans-Atlantic mixings between western and southeastern populations occur.[67]\\r\\n\\r\\nA large population spreads across the Hawaiian Islands every winter, ranging from the island of Hawaii in the south to Kure Atoll in the north.[68] These animals feed in areas ranging from the coast of California to the Bering Sea.[69] Humpbacks were first observed in Hawaiian waters in the mid-19th century and might have gained a dominance over North Pacific right whales, as the right whales were hunted to near-extinction.[70]\\r\\n\\r\\nA 2007 study identified seven individuals then wintering off the Pacific coast of Costa Rica as having traveled from the Antarcticaround 8,300?km (5,200?mi). Identified by their unique tail patterns, these animals made the longest documented mammalian migration.[71] In Australia, two main migratory populations were identified, off the west and east coasts. These two populations are distinct, with only a few females in each generation crossing between the two groups.[72]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn Panama and Costa Rica, humpback whales come from both the Southern Hemisphere (JulyÿOctober with over 2,000 whales) and the Northern Hemisphere (DecemberÿMarch numbering about 300.)[73] South Pacific populations migrating off mainland New Zealand, Kermadec Islands,  and Tasmania are increasing, but less rapidly than in Australian waters because of illegal whaling by the Soviet Union in the 1970s.\\r\\n\\r\\nSome recolonizing habitats are confirmed, especially in the North and South Atlantic (e.g. English and Irish coasts, English Channel[74]) to coasts in the north such as the North Sea and Wadden Sea, where the first confirmed sighting since 1755 was made in 2003,[75][76] South Pacific (e.g. New Zealand coasts and Niue), pelagic islands of Chile such as Isla Salas y G܇mez and Easter Island, where possibilities of undocumented wintering grounds have been considered,[77] southern fiords of Chile and Peru (e.g. Gulf of Penas, Strait of Magellan, Beagle Channel[78]) and in Asia. Areas in the Philippines such as the Babuyan Islands, Cagayan (the first modern mortality of the species in the nation was in 2007),[79] Calayan[80] and Pasaleng Bay, the Ryukyu Islands, the Volcano Islands in Japan and the Northern Mariana Islands recently[81] again became stable/growing wintering grounds while the Marshall Islands,[82] Vietnamese, Taiwanese and Chinese coasts show slow or no obvious recovery.[83]\\r\\n\\r\\nWhales again migrate off Japanese archipelagos and into the Sea of Japan. Connections between these stocks and whales seen in the Sea of Okhotsk, on Kamchatka coasts and around the Commander Islands have been studied.[84] Historical wintering distributions could have been much wider and more southerly distributed, as whales were seen in areas along the Batanes, Sulu and Celebes Seas including off Palawan, Luzon, Malaysia and Mindanao, with higher densities around today's Cape Eluanbi and Kenting National Park.[85] Unconfirmed sightings have been reported near Borneo in modern times.[86] The first confirmation in modern Taiwan was of a pair off Hualien in 1994, followed by a successful escape from entanglement off Taitung in 1999,[87] and continuous sightings around Orchid Island in 2000.[88] Few/none regularly migrate into Kenting National Park.[89][90] In addition, despite sightings reported almost annually off Green and Orchid Islands, relatively short stays in these waters indicate recoveries as winter foraging has not occurred.[91] Sightings, including of a cow-calf pair, have occurred along the east coast of Taiwan.[92][93][94][95] Around Hong Kong, two documented sightings were recorded in 2009 and in 2016.[96][97] One of the first documented sightings within the Yellow Sea was of a group of 3 or 4 individuals, including a cow/calf pair in Changhai County in October, 2015.[98][99]\\r\\n\\r\\nSince November 2015, whales gather around Hachij-jima, far north from the known breeding areas in the Bonin Islands. All breeding activities except for giving births had been confirmed as of January, 2016. That makes Hachijo-jima the northernmost breeding ground in the world,[100] north of breeding grounds such as Amami shima, Midway Island,[101] and Bermuda.[102]\\r\\n\\r\\nA non-migratory population in the Arabian Sea remains there year-round.[41] More typical annual migrations cover up to 25,000?km (16,000?mi), making it one of the most-traveled mammalian species. Genetic studies and visual surveys indicate that the Arabian group is the most isolated of all humpback groups and is the most endangered, numbering possibly fewer than 100 animals.[103] Within Arabian Sea, Masirah Island and Gulf of Masirah, Halaniyat Islands and Kuria Muria Bay are hot spots for the species.[104]\\r\\n\\r\\nWhales were historically common in continental and marginal waters such as Hallaniyat Islands,[105] along Indian coasts, Persian Gulf[106] and Gulf of Aden and recent migrations into the gulf including by cow-calf pairs[107].[108] It is unknown whether whales seen in the Red Sea originate in this population,[109] however sightings increased since in 2006 even in the northern part of the sea such as in Gulf of Aqaba. Individuals may reach the Maldives, Sri Lanka, or further east.[103] Humpbacks have been considered rather vagrant into Persian Gulf, however new studies indicate more regular presences can be expected.[104]\\r\\n\\r\\nOrigins of whales occurring at Maldives are not clear either from Arabian or south Pacific populations, and overlaps are possible.[110][103]\\r\\n\\r\\nArabian Sea Humpback whales in Dhofar, Oman\\r\\n\\r\\nHumpbacks feed primarily in summer and live off fat reserves during winter.[111] They feed only rarely and opportunistically in their wintering waters. The humpback is an energetic hunter, taking krill and small schooling fish such as juvenile Atlantic and Pacific salmon, herring, capelin and American sand lance, as well as Atlantic mackerel, pollock and haddock in the North Atlantic.[112][113][114] They have been documented opportunistically feeding near fish hatcheries in Southeast Alaska, feasting on salmon fry released from the hatcheries.[115] Krill and copepods are prey species in Australian and Antarctic waters.[116] Humpbacks hunt by direct attack or by stunning prey by hitting the water with pectoral fins or flukes.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe humpback has the most diverse hunting repertoire of all baleen whales.[117] Its most inventive technique is known as bubble net feeding; a group of whales swims in a shrinking circle blowing bubbles below a school of prey. The shrinking ring of bubbles encircles the school and confines it in an ever-smaller cylinder. This ring can begin near 30?m (98?ft) in diameter and involve the cooperation of a dozen animals. Using a crittercam attached to a whale's back, researchers found that some whales blow the bubbles, some dive deeper to drive fish toward the surface and others herd prey into the net by vocalizing.[118] The whales then suddenly swim upward through the \\"net\\", mouths agape, swallowing thousands of fish in one gulp. the water is then squeezed out through baleen plates in the mouth to filter out the prey.\\r\\n\\r\\nSo-called lobtail feeding was observed in the North Atlantic. This technique involves the whale slapping the surface of the ocean with its tail between one and four times before creating the bubble net.[119] Using network-based diffusion analysis, the study authors argued that these whales learned the behavior from other whales in the group over a period of 27 years in response to a change in the primary form of prey.[120]\\r\\n\\r\\nVisible scars indicate that killer whales (orcas) can prey upon juvenile humpbacks, though until recently hunting had never been witnessed and attacks were assumed to be superficial in nature.[121] However, a 2014 study off Western Australia[122] observed that when available in large numbers, young humpbacks can be attacked and sometimes killed by orcas. Moreover, mothers and (possibly related) adults escort neonates to deter such predation. The suggestion is that when humpbacks suffered near-extinction during the whaling era, orcas turned to other prey, but are now resuming their former practice.  There is evidence that humpback whales will defend against or attack killer whales who are attacking either humpback calves or juveniles as well as members of other species.[123]\\r\\n\\r\\nHumpback whales were hunted as early as the 18th century. By the 19th century, many nations (the United States in particular), were hunting the animal heavily in the Atlantic Ocean and to a lesser extent in the Indian and Pacific Oceans. The late-19th-century introduction of the explosive harpoon allowed whalers to accelerate their take. This, along with hunting in the Antarctic Ocean beginning in 1904, sharply reduced whale populations. During the 20th century, over 200,000 humpbacks were taken, reducing the global population by over 90%. North Atlantic populations dropped to as low as 700 individuals.[124]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1946, the International Whaling Commission (IWC) was founded to oversee the industry.  They imposed hunting regulations and created hunting seasons. To prevent extinction, IWC banned commercial humpback whaling in 1966. By then, the global population had been reduced to around 5,000.[125] The ban has remained in force since 1966.\\r\\n\\r\\nPrior to commercial whaling, populations could have reached 125,000. North Pacific kills alone are estimated at 28,000.[13] The Soviet Union deliberately under-recorded its catches; the Soviets reported catching 2,820 between 1947 and 1972, but the true number was over 48,000.[126]\\r\\n\\r\\nAs of 2004, hunting was restricted to a few animals each year off the Caribbean island of Bequia in the nation of St. Vincent and the Grenadines.[117] The take is not believed to threaten the local population. Japan had planned to kill 50 humpbacks in the 2007/08 season under its JARPA II research program. The announcement sparked global protests.[127] After a visit to Tokyo by the IWC chair asking the Japanese for their co-operation in sorting out the differences between pro- and antiwhaling nations on the commission, the Japanese whaling fleet agreed to take no humpback whales during the two years it would take to reach a formal agreement.[128]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 2010, the IWC authorized Greenland's native population to hunt a few humpback whales for the following three years.[129]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn Japan, humpback, minkes, sperm and many other smaller Odontoceti, including critically endangered species such as North Pacific right, western gray and northern fin, have been targets of illegal captures. The hunts use harpoons for dolphin hunts or intentionally drive whales into nets, reporting them as cases of entanglement. Humpback meat can be found in markets. In one case, humpbacks of unknown quantities were illegally hunted in the Exclusive Economic Zones of anti-whaling nations such as off Mexico and South Africa.[130]\\r\\n\\r\\nWhale watching is the leisure activity of observing humpbacks in the wild. Participants watch from shore or on touring boats. Humpbacks are generally curious about nearby objects. Some individuals, referred to as \\"friendlies\\", approach whale-watching boats closely, often staying under or near the boat for many minutes.\\r\\n\\r\\nBecause humpbacks are typically easily approachable, curious, identifiable as individuals and display many behaviors, they have become the mainstay of whale tourism around the world. Hawaii has used the concept of \\"ecotourism\\" to benefit from the species without killing them. This business brings in revenue of $20 million per year for the state's economy.[131]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn December 1883, a male humpback swam up the Firth of Tay in Scotland, past what was then the whaling port of Dundee. Harpooned during a failed hunt, it was found dead off of Stonehaven a week later. Its carcass was exhibited to the public by a local entrepreneur, John Woods, both locally and then as a touring exhibition that travelled to Edinburgh and London. The whale was dissected by Professor John Struthers, who wrote seven papers on its anatomy and an 1889 monograph on the humpback.[132][133][134][135]\\r\\n\\r\\nAn albino humpback whale that travels up and down the east coast of Australia became famous in local media because of its rare, all-white appearance. Migaloo is the only known all-white specimen[136] and is a true albino.[137] First sighted in 1991, the whale was named for an indigenous Australian word for \\"white fella\\". To prevent sightseers approaching dangerously close, the Queensland government decreed a 500-m (1600-ft) exclusion zone around him.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1985, Humphrey swam into San Francisco Bay and then up the Sacramento River towards Rio Vista.[138] Five years later, Humphrey returned and became stuck on a mudflat in San Francisco Bay immediately north of Sierra Point below the view of onlookers from the upper floors of the Dakin Building.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe was twice rescued by the Marine Mammal Center and other concerned groups in California.[139] He was pulled off the mudflat with a large cargo net and the help of the US Coast Guard. Both times, he was successfully guided back to the Pacific Ocean using a \\"sound net\\" in which people in a flotilla of boats made unpleasant noises behind the whale by banging on steel pipes, a Japanese fishing technique known as oikami. At the same time, the attractive sounds of humpback whales preparing to feed were broadcast from a boat headed towards the open ocean.[140]\\r\\n\\r\\nHe was last sighted in the vicinity of the Farallon Islands in 1991.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nAnalyses of whale songs in the 1960s led to worldwide media interest and convinced the public that whales were highly intelligent, aiding the antiwhaling advocates.\\r\\nWhile whaling no longer threatens the species, individuals are vulnerable to collisions with ships, entanglement in fishing gear and noise pollution.[3] Like other cetaceans, humpbacks can be injured by excessive noise. In the 19th century, two humpback whales were found dead near sites of repeated oceanic sub-bottom blasting, with traumatic injuries and fractures in the ears.[141]\\r\\n\\r\\nSaxitoxin, a paralytic shellfish poisoning from contaminated mackerel, has been implicated in humpback whale deaths.[142]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe worldwide population is at least 80,000, with 18,000ÿ20,000 in the North Pacific,[143] about 12,000 in the North Atlantic[144] and over 50,000 in the Southern Hemisphere,[145] down from a prewhaling population of 125,000.[13]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn August 2008, the IUCN changed humpback's status from Vulnerable to Least Concern, although two subpopulations remain endangered.[146] The United States is considering listing separate humpback populations, so smaller groups, such as North Pacific humpbacks, which are estimated to number 18,000ÿ20,000 animals, might be delisted. This is made difficult by humpbacks migrations, which can extend 5,157 miles (8,299?km) from Antarctica to Costa Rica.[28] In Costa Rica, the Ballena Marine National Park is designed for humpback protection.\\r\\n\\r\\nAreas where population data is limited and the species may be at higher risk include the Arabian Sea, the western North Pacific Ocean, the west coast of Africa and parts of Oceania.[3]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe species was listed as vulnerable in 1996 and endangered as recently as 1988. Most monitored stocks have rebounded since the end of commercial whaling.[3][147] In the North Atlantic stocks are believed to be approaching prehunting levels. However, the species is considered endangered in some countries, including the United States.[148][149]\\r\\n\\r\\nA 2008 US Department of Commerce analysis (SPLASH) noted that the many challenges to determining the recovery status included the lack of accurate population estimates, the unexpected complexity of population structures and their migration. The report was based on data collected from 2004 to 2006. At the time, the North Pacific population was some 18,302.[150] The estimate is consistent with a moderate rate of recovery for a depleted population, although it was considered to be a \\"dramatic increase in abundance\\" from other post-1960s estimates. By comparison, Calambokidis et al. estimated 9,819,[151] covering 1991ÿ1993. This represents a 4% annual increase in population from 1993 to 2006.[150] The sanctuary provided by US national parks, such as Glacier Bay National Park and Preserve and Cape Hatteras National Seashore, became major factors in population recovery.[152]\\r\\n\\r\\nOff the west coast of Canada, the Gwaii Haanas National Marine Conservation Area Reserve covers 3,400 square kilometres (1,300?sq?mi). It is \\"a primary feeding habitat\\" of the North Pacific population. Their critical habitat overlaps with tanker shipping routes between Canada and its eastern trade partners.[153] In 2005 the North Pacific population was listed as threatened under Canadas Species at Risk Act (SARA). On April 19, 2014 the Department of the Environment recommended an amendment to SARA to downgrade their status off the Pacific coast from \\"threatened\\" to \\"species of special concern\\".[154] According to Committee on the Status of Endangered Wildlife in Canada (COSEWIC), the North Pacific humpback population increased at about 4% annually from 1992 to 2008. Although socioeconomic costs and benefits were considered in their decision to upgrade their status, according to the University of British Columbias Marine Mammal Research Consortium's research director, the decision was based on biology, not politics.[153]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe United Kingdom, among other countries,  designated the humpback as a priority species under the national Biodiversity Action Plan.","input":"How long is the gestation period for humpback whales?"},{"output":"the 16-story, 247-foot-tall Alworth Building","context":"The city of Duluth, Minnesota, is home to 17 completed high-rises standing over 115ft (35m) tall.[1] The tallest building in Duluth is the 16-story, 247-foot-tall Alworth Building, which at the time of its construction, was the tallest building in Minnesota outside Minneapolis.[2]\\r\\nThe history of high-rises in Duluth begins with the Torrey Building.

Blood is normally a sterile environment,[1] so the detection of bacteria in the blood (most commonly accomplished by blood cultures[2]) is always abnormal. It is distinct from sepsis, which is the host response to the bacteria.[3]\\r\\nBacteria can enter the bloodstream as a severe complication of infections (like pneumonia or meningitis), during surgery (especially when involving mucous membranes such as the gastrointestinal tract), or due to catheters and other foreign bodies entering the arteries or veins (including during intravenous drug abuse).[4] Transient bacteremia can result after dental procedures or brushing of teeth.[5]\\r\\nBacteremia can have several important health consequences. The immune response to the bacteria can cause sepsis and septic shock, which has a high mortality rate.[6] Bacteria can also spread via the blood to other parts of the body (which is called hematogenous spread), causing infections away from the original site of infection, such as endocarditis or osteomyelitis.[7] Treatment for bacteremia is with antibiotics, and prevention with antibiotic prophylaxis can be given in high risk situations.[8]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nBacteremia is the presence of bacteria in the bloodstream that are alive and capable of reproducing. It is a type of bloodstream infection.[9] Bacteremia is defined as either a primary or secondary process. In primary bacteremia, bacteria have been directly introduced into the bloodstream.[10] Injection drug use may lead to primary bacteremia. In the hospital setting, use of blood vessel catheters contaminated with bacteria may also lead to primary bacteremia.[11] Secondary bacteremia occurs when bacteria have entered the body at another site, such as the cuts in the skin, or the mucous membranes of the lungs (respiratory tract), mouth or intestines (gastrointestinal tract), bladder (urinary tract), or genitals.[12] Bacteria that have infected the body at these sites may then spread into the lymphatic system and gain access to the bloodstream, where further spread can occur.[13]\\r\\nBacteremia may also be defined by the timing of bacteria presence in the bloodstream: transient, intermittent, or persistent. In transient bacteremia, bacteria are present in the bloodstream for minutes to a few hours before being cleared from the body, and the result is typically harmless in healthy people.[14] This can occur after manipulation of parts of the body normally colonized by bacteria, such as the mucosal surfaces of the mouth during teeth brushing, flossing, or dental procedures,[15] or instrumentation of the bladder or colon.[9] Intermittent bacteremia is characterized by periodic seeding of the same bacteria into the bloodstream by an existing infection elsewhere in the body, such as an abscess, pneumonia, or bone infection, followed by clearing of that bacteria from the bloodstream. This cycle will often repeat until the existing infection is successfully treated.[9] Persistent bacteremia is characterized by the continuous presence of bacteria in the bloodstream.[9] It is usually the result of an infected heart valve, a central line-associated bloodstream infection (CLABSI), an infected blood clot (suppurative thrombophlebitis), or an infected blood vessel graft.[9] Persistent bacteremia can also occur as part of the infection process of typhoid fever, brucellosis, and bacterial meningitis. Left untreated, conditions causing persistent bacteremia can be potentially fatal.[16]\\r\\nBacteremia is clinically distinct from sepsis, which is a condition where the blood stream infection is associated with an inflammatory response from the body, often causing abnormalities in body temperature, heart rate, breathing rate, blood pressure, and white blood cell count.[17]\\r\\nBacteremia is typically transient and is quickly removed from the blood by the immune system.[5]\\r\\nBacteremia frequently evokes a response from the immune system called Sepsis, which consists of symptoms such as fever, chills, and hypotension.[18] Severe immune responses to bacteremia may result in septic shock and multiple organ dysfunction syndrome,[18] which are potentially fatal.\\r\\nBacteremia can travel through the blood stream to distant sites in the body and cause infection (hematogenous spread). Hematogenous spread of bacteria is part of the pathophysiology of certain infections of the heart (endocarditis), structures around the brain (meningitis), and tuberculosis of the spine (Pott's disease). Hematogenous spread of bacteria is responsible for many bone infections (osteomyelitis).[19]\\r\\nProsthetic cardiac implants (for example artificial heart valves) are especially vulnerable to infection from bacteremia.[20]\\r\\nPrior to widespread use of vaccines, occult bacteremia was an important consideration in febrile children that appeared otherwise well.[21]\\r\\nBacteria can enter the bloodstream in a number of different ways. However, for each major classification of bacteria (gram negative, gram positive, or anaerobic) there are characteristic sources or routes of entry into the bloodstream that lead to bacteremia. Causes of bacteremia can additionally be divided into healthcare-associated (acquired during the process of receiving care in a healthcare facility) or community-acquired (acquired outside of a health facility, often prior to hospitalization).\\r\\nGram positive bacteria are an increasingly important cause of bacteremia.[22] Staphyloccocus, streptococcus, and enterococcus species are the most important and most common species of gram-positive bacteria that can enter the bloodstream. These bacteria are normally found on the skin or in the gastrointestinal tract.\\r\\nStaphylococcus aureus is the most common cause of healthcare-associated bacteremia in North and South America and is also an important cause of community-acquired bacteremia.[23] Skin ulceration or wounds, respiratory tract infections, and IV drug use are the most important causes of community-acquired staph aureus bacteremia. In healthcare settings, intravenous catheters, urinary tract catheters, and surgical procedures are the most common causes of staph aureus bacteremia.[24]\\r\\nThere are many different types of streptococcal species that can cause bacteremia. Group A streptococcus (GAS) typically causes bacteremia from skin and soft tissue infections.[25] Group B streptococcus is an important cause of bacteremia in neonates, often immediately following birth.[16] Viridans streptococci species are normal bacterial flora of the mouth. Viridans strep can cause temporary bacteremia after eating, toothbrushing, or flossing.[16] More severe bacteremia can occur following dental procedures or in patients receiving chemotherapy.[16] Finally, streptococcus bovis is a common cause of bacteremia in patients with colon cancer.[26]\\r\\nEnterococci are an important cause of healthcare-associated bacteremia. These bacteria commonly live in the gastrointestinal tract and female genital tract. Intravenous catheters, urinary tract infections and surgical wounds are all risk factors for developing bacteremia from enterococcal species.[27] Resistant enterococcal species can cause bacteremia in patients who have had long hospital stays or frequent antibiotic use in the past.[28]\\r\\nGram negative bacterial species are responsible for approximately 24% of all cases of healthcare-associated bacteremia and 45% of all cases of community-acquired bacteremia.[29][30] In general, gram negative bacteria enter the bloodstream from infections in the respiratory tract, genitourinary tract, gastrointestinal tract, or hepatobiliary system. Gram-negative bacteremia occurs more frequently in elderly populations (65 years or older) and is associated with higher morbidity and mortality in this population.[31]\\r\\nE.coli is the most common cause of community-acquired bacteremia accounting for approximately 75% of cases.[32] E.coli bacteremia is usually the result of a urinary tract infection. Other organisms that can cause community-acquired bacteremia include pseudomonas aeruginosa, klebsiella pneumoniae, and proteus mirabilis. Salmonella infection, despite mainly only resulting in gastroenteritis in the developed world, is a common cause of bacteremia in Africa.[33] It principally affects children who lack antibodies to Salmonella and HIV+ patients of all ages.\\r\\nAmong healthcare-associated cases of bacteremia, gram negative organisms are an important cause of bacteremia in the ICU.[34] Catheters in the veins, arteries, or urinary tract can all create a way for gram negative bacteria to enter the bloodstream.[25] Surgical procedures of the genitourinary tract, intestinal tract, or hepatobiliary tract can also lead to gram negative bacteremia.[25] Pseudomonas and enterobacter species are the most important causes of gram negative bacteremia in the ICU.[34]\\r\\nThere are several risk factors that increase the likelihood of developing bacteremia from any type of bacteria.[22][35] These include:\\r\\nBacteremia is most commonly diagnosed by blood culture, in which a sample of blood drawn from the vein by needle puncture is allowed to incubate with a medium that promotes bacterial growth.[36] If bacteria are present in the bloodstream at the time the sample is obtained, the bacteria will multiply and can thereby be detected.\\r\\nAny bacteria that incidentally find their way to the culture medium will also multiply. For example, if the skin is not adequately cleaned before needle puncture, contamination of the blood sample with normal bacteria that live on the surface of the skin can occur.[37] For this reason, blood cultures must be drawn with great attention to sterile process. The presence of certain bacteria in the blood culture, such as Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and Escherichia coli almost never represent a contamination of the sample. On the other hand, contamination may be more highly suspected if organisms like Staphylococcus epidermidis or Propionibacterium acnes grow in the blood culture.\\r\\nTwo blood cultures drawn from separate sites of the body are often sufficient to diagnose bacteremia.[37] Two out of two cultures growing the same type of bacteria usually represents a real bacteremia, particularly if the organism that grows is not a common contaminant.[37] One out of two positive cultures will usually prompt a repeat set of blood cultures to be drawn to confirm whether a contaminant or a real bacteremia is present.[37] The patient's skin is typically cleaned with an alcohol-based product prior to drawing blood to prevent contamination.[37] Blood cultures may be repeated at intervals to determine if persistent  rather than transient  bacteremia is present.[37]\\r\\nPrior to drawing blood cultures, a thorough patient history should be taken with particular regard to presence of both fevers and chills, other focal signs of infection such as in the skin or soft tissue, a state of immunosuppression, or any recent invasive procedures.[36]\\r\\nUltrasound of the heart is recommended in all those with bacteremia due to Staphylococcus aureus to rule out infectious endocarditis.[38]\\r\\nThe presence of bacteria in the blood almost always requires treatment with antibiotics. This is because there are high mortality rates from progression to sepsis if antibiotics are delayed.[34]\\r\\nThe treatment of bacteremia should begin with empiric antibiotic coverage. Any patient presenting with signs or symptoms of bacteremia or a positive blood culture should be started on intravenous antibiotics.[31] The choice of antibiotic is determined by the most likely source of infection and by the characteristic organisms that typically cause that infection. Other important considerations include the patient's past history of antibiotic use, the severity of the presenting symptoms, and any allergies to antibiotics.[39] Empiric antibiotics should be narrowed, preferably to a single antibiotic, once the blood culture returns with a particular bacteria that has been isolated.[39]\\r\\nThe Infectious Disease Society of America (IDSA) recommends treating uncomplicated methicillin resistant staph aureus (MRSA) bacteremia with a 14-day course of intravenous vancomycin.[40] Uncomplicated bacteremia is defined as having positive blood cultures for MRSA, but having no evidence of endocarditis, no implanted prostheses, negative blood cultures after 2ÿ4 days of treatment, and signs of clinical improvement after 72 hrs.[40]\\r\\nThe antibiotic treatment of choice for streptococcal and enteroccal infections differs by species. However, it is important to look at the antibiotic resistance pattern for each species from the blood culture to better treat infections caused by resistant organisms.[22]\\r\\nThe treatment of gram negative bacteremia is also highly dependent on the causative organism. Empiric antibiotic therapy should be guided by the most likely source of infection and the patient's past exposure to healthcare facilities.[41] In particular, a recent history of exposure to a healthcare setting may necessitate the need for antibiotics with pseudomonas aeruginosa coverage or broader coverage for resistant organisms.[41] Extended generation cephalosporins such as ceftriaxone or beta lactam/beta lactam inhibitor antibiotics such as piperacillin-tazobactam are frequently used for the treatment of gram negative bacteremia.[41]\\r\\nFor healthcare-associated bacteremia due to intravenous catheters, the IDSA has published guidelines for catheter removal. Short term catheters (in place <14 days) should be removed if bacteremia is caused by any gram negative bacteria, staph aureus, enterococci or mycobacteria.[42] Long term catheters (>14 days) should be removed if the patient is developing signs or symptoms of sepsis or endocarditis, or if blood cultures remain positive for more than 72 hours.[42]","input":"How do you treat bacteria in the blood?"},{"output":"three","context":"\\r\\n\\r\\nJohnny English is a series of action comedy films parodying the James Bond secret agent genre.

What constitutes a sex crime differs by culture and legal jurisdiction. Most jurisdictions compile their laws into sections, such as traffic, assault, and sexual[clarification needed]. The majority of convicted sex offenders have convictions for crimes of a sexual nature; however, some sex offenders have simply violated a law contained in a sexual category. Some of the crimes which usually result in a mandatory sex-offender classification are: a second prostitution conviction, sending or receiving obscene content in the form of SMS text messages (sexting), and relationship between young adults and teenagers resulting in corruption of a minor (if the age between them is greater than 1,060 days). If any sexual contact was made by the adult to the minor, then child molestation has occurred. Other serious offenses are sexual assault, statutory rape, bestiality, child sexual abuse, female genital mutilation, incest, rape, and sexual imposition. However, particularly sex offender registration laws in the United States, may also classify less serious offenses as sexual offenses requiring sex offender registration. In some states public urination, having sex on a beach,[1] or unlawful imprisonment of a minor also constitute sexual offenses requiring registration.[2][3]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nIn looking at various types of offenses, an example of a digital obscenity offense is child pornography. In the modern world of technology, many jurisdictions are reforming their laws to prevent the over-prosecution of sex offenders and focusing on crimes involving a victim. The term sexual predator is often used to describe a sex offender or any of the \\"tier offenders\\"; however, only the category just below sexually-violent sexual predator is reserved for a severe or repeated sex offender: sexual predator.\\r\\nIn the United States, the Adam Walsh Act (AWA) proposed to provide funding to each jurisdiction which would agree to incorporate its Act into their law. In the few jurisdictions accepting the agreement, there are Tier I, Tier II, or Tier III sex offenders. Individuals convicted of petty crimes not covered by the AWA are still liable to abide by the previous regulations denoting them as a sex offender (or habitual sex offender, sexual predator, sexually violent sexual predator, or child-victim offender).\\r\\nIn the United States, the United Kingdom, and other countries, a convicted sex offender is often required to register with the respective jurisdiction's sex offender registry. In the U.S., registry databases are often open to the public. Sexual offenders are sometimes classified by level.[4] The highest-level offenders generally must register for their entire lives; low-level offenders may only need to register for a period of time.\\r\\nThe level of recidivism in sexual offenders is lower than is commonly believed.[5][6] A 2002 study by the Office of Justice Programs (OJP) of the United States Department of Justice following 9,691 male sex offenders released from prisons in 15 US states in 1994 indicated that within the first 3 years following their release, rearrest and reconviction rates for new sex offenses were 5.3 and 3.5 percent, respectively; that is, about 1 in 19 of released sex offenders were arrested within three years for another sex crime. The same study found that during the same 3 years from release, 68 percent of released non-sex offenders were re-arrested for any crime (and 47.8 percent reconvicted), while 43 percent of the released sex offenders were rearrested for any crime (and 24 percent reconvicted).[7]\\r\\nAccording to the Office of Justice Programs (OJP) of the United States Department of Justice,[8] in New York state, the recidivism rate for sex offenders has been shown to be lower than any other crime except murder. Another report from the OJP which studied the recidivism of prisoners released in 1994 in 15 states (accounting for two-thirds of all prisoners released in the United States that year) reached the same conclusion.[9]\\r\\nOf released sex offenders who allegedly committed another sex crime, 40 percent perpetrated the new offense within a year or less from their prison discharge. Within three years of release, 2.5 percent of released rapists were rearrested for another rape, and 1.2 percent of those who had served time for homicide were arrested for a new homicide. Sex offenders were about four times more likely than non-sex offenders to be arrested for another sex crime after their discharge from prison (5.3 percent of sex offenders, versus 1.3 percent of non-sex offenders). An estimated 24 percent of those serving time for rape and 19 percent of those serving time for sexual assault had been on probation (or parole) at the time of the offense for which they were in state prison in 1991.[7]\\r\\nApproximately 4,300 child molesters were released from prisons in 15 U.S. states in 1994. An estimated 3.3 percent of these 4,300 were rearrested for another sex crime against a child within 3 years of release from prison. Among child molesters released from prison in 1994, 60 percent had been in prison for molesting a child 13 years old or younger. The median age of victims of those imprisoned for sexual assault was less than 13 years old; the median age of rape victims was about 22 years. Child molesters were, on average, five years older than violent offenders who committed their crimes against adults. Nearly 25 percent of child molesters were age 40 or older, but about 10 percent of inmates with adult victims were in that age group.[7]\\r\\nA sex offender registry is a system in place in a number of jurisdictions designed to allow authorities to keep track of the residence and activity of sex offenders (including those released from prison). In some jurisdictions (especially in the United States), information in the registry is made available to the public via a website or other means. In many jurisdictions, registered sex offenders are subject to additional restrictions (including housing). Those on parole (or probation) may be subject to restrictions not applicable to other parolees or probationers.[10] These include restrictions on being in the presence of minors, living in proximity to a school or daycare center, or owning toys (or other items of interest to minors). Israels sex offender registry is accessible only to security officials, rather than to the general public.[11]\\r\\nMegan's Law, in the U.S., is designed to sanction sex offenders and reduce their recidivism rate. The law is enacted and enforced on a state-by-state basis. Most states also restrict where convicted sex offenders can live after their release, prohibiting residency within a designated distance of schools and daycare centers (usually 1,000ÿ2,000 feet (300ÿ610?m)). Guided by the 2007 Adam Walsh Child Protection and Safety Act, sex offenders must avoid of such areas as schools, bus stops, gyms, recreation centers, playgrounds, parks, swimming pools, libraries, nursing homes, and places of worship by 500 to 2,500 feet (150 to 760?m). However, residence stipulations vary from state to state. Some states (such as Arkansas, Illinois, Washington and Idaho) do not require sex offenders to move from their residences if a forbidden facility is built or a law is enacted after the offender takes up residency. Many aspects of the laws are criticised by reformists and civil right groups like National RSOL[12] and Human Right Watch,[13][14] and treatment professionals as Atsa.[15][16]\\r\\nCommitting to a residence requires a convicted sex offender to be notified of registration regulations by local law enforcement if convicted after January 1, 2005. The offender must act upon the notification within five business days of receipt. If and when an offender is released from incarceration, they must confirm their registration status within five business days. Registration data includes the offender's sex, height, weight, date of birth, identifying characteristics (if any), statutes violated, fingerprints and a current photograph. An offender's email addresses, chat room IDs and instant-messaging aliases must be surrendered to authorities. In Colorado, an offender must re-register when moving to a new address, changing their legal name, employment, volunteer activity, identifying information used online or enrollment status at a post-secondary educational institution. A web-based registration list may be found on county websites, which identifies adult convicted sex offenders who are sexually-violent predators convicted of felony sexual acts, crimes of violence or failure to register as required. Legally, \\"any person who is a sexually violent predator and any person who is convicted as an adult...has a duty to register for the remainder of his or her natural life\\".[17] Exceptions to this include deferred sentencing for the offense or petition of the court for termination of registration.[18]\\r\\nSome sex offenders are deemed too dangerous to society to be released, and are subjected to civil confinement  indefinite continuing incarceration, which is supposed to, but does not always, provide treatment to the offender.\\r\\nBehavior modification programs have been shown to reduce recidivism in sex offenders.[19] Often, such programs use principles of applied behavior analysis. Two such approaches from this line of research have promise. The first uses operant conditioning approaches (which use reward and punishment to train new behavior, such as problem-solving)[20] and the second uses respondent conditioning procedures, such as aversion therapy. Many of the behaviorism programs use covert sensitization[21] and/or odor aversion: both are forms of aversion therapy, which have had ethical challenges. Such programs are effective in lowering recidivism by 15ÿ18 percent.[22] The use of aversion therapy remains controversial, and is an ethical issue related to the professional practice of behavior analysis.\\r\\nIn 2007, the Texas State Auditor released a report showing that sex offenders who completed the Texas Sex Offender Treatment Program (SOTP) were 61 percent less likely to commit a new crime.[23]\\r\\nChemical castration is used in some countries and states to treat male sex offenders. Unlike physical castration, it is reversible by stopping the medication. For male sex offenders with severe or extreme paraphilias, physical castration appears to be effective. It results in a 20-year re-offense rate of less than 2.3 percent (versus 80 percent in the untreated control group), according to a large 1963 study involving a total of 1036 sex offenders by the German researcher A. Langelddeke.[24] This was much lower than otherwise expected, compared with overall sex offender recidivism rates. Although considered cruel and unusual punishment by many, physical castration does not otherwise affect the lifespan of men (compared with uncastrated men).[citation needed]\\r\\nTherapists use various methods to assess individual sex offenders' recidivism risk. Risk assessment tools consider factors that have been empirically linked by research to sexual recidivism risk. Researchers and practitioners consider some factors as \\"static\\", such as age, number of prior sex offenses, victim gender, relationship to the victim, and indicators of psychopathy and deviant sexual arousal, and some other factors as \\"dynamic\\", such as an offender's compliance with supervision and treatment.[25] By examining both types of factors, a more complete picture of the offender's risk can emerge, compared with static or dynamic factors used alone.[26]\\r\\nIt is argued that in the U.S., sex offenders have been selected as the new realization of moral panics about sex, stranger danger, and national paranoia, the new folk devils or boogeymen. People convicted of any sex crime are \\"transformed into a concept of evil, which is then personified as a group of faceless, terrifying, and predatory devils\\", who are, contrary to scientific evidence, perceived as a constant threat, habitually waiting for an opportunity to attack.[27] Consequently, sex offenders are brought up by media on Halloween, despite the fact that there has never been a recorded case of abduction or abuse by a registered sex offender on Halloween.[27]\\r\\nAcademics, treatment professionals,[15][28] and law reform groups such as National Association for Rational Sexual Offense Laws[29] and Women Against Registry[30] criticize current sex offender laws as based on media-driven moral panic and \\"public emotion\\", rather than a real attempt to protect society.[27][31][32][33][34][35] This can motivate legislators to pass knee-jerk laws[36] to address public hysteria, echoing a \\"populist punitiveness\\" perspective.[37] Many lawmakers feel that they will attract votes by appearing to be \\"tough on sex offenders\\".[38] One discrepancy pointed out by critics is that John Walsh, father of Adam Walsh and supporter of the Adam Walsh Act, has admitted having a relationship with a 16-year-old girl while being in his early 20s and aware of age of consent being 17 in New York,[39] meaning that, had he been convicted, John Walsh himself could be required to register as a sex offender. Since passage of the Adam Walsh Act, Walsh himself has criticized the law, stating \\"You can't paint sex offenders with a broad brush.\\"[40]\\r\\nCritics point out that contrary to media depictions, abductions by predatory offenders are very rare[41] and 93% of child sexual abuse is committed by someone the child knows: a family member, a family friend, someone in a position of authority.[42] According to the U.S. Department of Justice, sex offender recidivism is 5.3%,[43] the lowest for any type of crime except homicide.[44]\\r\\nCritics say that, while originally aimed at the worst offenders, as a result of moral panic the laws have gone through series of amendments, many named after the victim of a highly publicized predatory offense, expanding the scope of the laws to low-level offenders, and treating them the same as predatory offenders, leading to the disproportionate punishment of being placed on a public sex offender registry, with the consequent restrictions on movement, employment, and housing.[30][41] As a result of the media narrative of sex offenders, highlighting egregious offenses as typical behavior of sex offenders, and distorting the facts of cases,[45] the panic has been said to increased, leading legislators to attack judicial discretion,[45] by making registration mandatory based strictly on offense of conviction, without considering the likelihood to re-offend or the actual severity of the crime, thus punishing less serious offenders under the harsh sex offender laws.","input":"What is the definition of a sex offender?"},{"output":"March 23, 2017","context":"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nNaruto: Shippuden is an anime series adapted from Part II of Masashi Kishimoto's manga series, with exactly 500 episodes.

It serves as the league's most common source of player recruitment. The basic design of the draft is that each team is given a position in the drafting order in reverse order relative to its record in the previous year, which means that the last place team is positioned first. From this position, the team can either select a player or trade their position to another team for other draft positions, a player or players, or any combination thereof. The round is complete when each team has either selected a player or traded its draft position. Certain aspects of the draft, including team positioning and the number of rounds in the draft, have seen revisions since its first creation in 1936, but the fundamental methodology has remained the same. Currently the draft consists of seven rounds. The original rationale in creating the draft was to increase the competitive parity between the teams as the worst team would, ideally, have chosen the best player available.\\r\\nIn the early years of the draft, players were chosen based on hearsay, print media, or other rudimentary evidence of a player's ability. In the 1940s, some franchises began employing full-time scouts. The ensuing success of their corresponding teams eventually forced the other franchises to also hire scouts.\\r\\nColloquially, the name of the draft each year takes on the form of the NFL season in which players picked could begin playing. For example, the 2010 NFL draft was for the 2010 NFL season. However, the NFL-defined name of the process has changed since its inception.\\r\\nThe location of the draft has continually changed over the years to accommodate more fans, as the event has gained popularity. The draft's popularity now garners prime-time television coverage.\\r\\nIn the league's early years the draft was held in various cities with NFL franchises until the league settled on New York City starting in 1965, where it remained until 2015. The 2015 and 2016 NFL drafts were held in Chicago, while the 2017 version was held in Philadelphia. In recent years, the NFL draft has occurred in late April or early May.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nAs background, Stan Kostka had a huge college career as a U of M running back, leading the Minnesota Gophers to an undefeated season in 1934. Every NFL team wanted to sign him. Since there was no draft back then, savvy Stan did the smart thing - he held out for the highest offer. While a free agent, Stan kept busy, even running for Mayor of Inver Grove Heights, Minnesota. Although his political career didnt take off, Stan's nine-month NFL holdout succeeded and he became the league's highest-paid player, signing a $5,000 contract with the NFL's team in Brooklyn, New York on August 25, 1935. As a response to the bidding war for Stan Kostka, the NFL instituted the draft in 1936.[1]\\r\\nIn late 1934, Art Rooney, owner of the Pittsburgh Steelers, gave the right of usage of two players to the New York Giants because Rooney's team had no chance to participate in the post-season. After the owner of the Boston Redskins, George Preston Marshall, protested the transaction, the president of the NFL, Joe F. Carr, disallowed the Giants the ability to employ the players.[2] At a league meeting in December 1934, the NFL introduced a waiver rule to prevent such transactions. Any player released by a team during the season would be able to be claimed by other teams. The selection order to claim the player would be in inverse order to the teams' standings at the time.[2][3]\\r\\nThroughout this time, Bert Bell, co-owner of the Philadelphia Eagles, felt his team's lack of competitiveness on the field made it difficult for the Eagles to sell tickets and to be profitable.[4] Compounding the Eagles' problems were players signed with teams that offered the most money,[5] or if the money being equal, players chose to sign with the most prestigious teams at the time,[6] who had established a winning tradition.[7] As a result, the NFL was dominated by the Chicago Bears, Green Bay Packers, Giants, and Redskins.[8][9] Bell's inability to sign a desired prospect, Stan Kostka, in 1935,[5][10][11] eventually led Bell to believe the only way for the NFL to have enduring success was for all teams to have an equal opportunity to sign eligible players.[8][12][13] At a league meeting on May 18, 1935, Bell proposed a draft be instituted to enhance the possibility of competitive parity on the field in order to ensure the financial viability of all franchises. His proposal was adopted unanimously that day,[14][15][16][17] although the first draft would not occur until the next off-season.[12][13]\\r\\nThe rules for the selection of the players in the first draft were, first, that a list of college seniors[18][19] would be assembled by each franchise and submitted into a pool. From this pool, each franchise would select, in inverse order to their team's record in the previous year, a player. With this selection, the franchise had the unilateral right to negotiate a contract with that player,[20][21] or the ability to trade that player to another team for a player, or players.[22] If, for any reason, the franchise was unsuccessful in negotiating a contract with the player and was unable to trade the player, the president of the NFL could attempt to arbitrate a settlement between the player and the franchise. If the president was unable to settle the dispute, then the player would be placed in the reserve list of the franchise and would be unavailable to play for any team in the NFL that year.[20][21] In the 1935 NFL season, the Eagles finished in last place at 2ÿ9, thus securing themselves the first pick in the draft.[23][24][25]\\r\\nThe first NFL draft began at the Ritz-Carlton Hotel in Philadelphia on February 8, 1936.[12][13] Ninety names were written on a blackboard in the meeting room from which the teams would choose.[26][27] As no team had a scouting department, the list was created from either print media sources, visits to local colleges by team executives, or by recommendations to team executives.[26][27][28] The draft would last for nine rounds,[13][27][29] and it had no media coverage.[13] The first player ever selected in the draft was Jay Berwanger. Bell, prior to the draft, was not successfully able to negotiate a contract with Berwanger so Bell traded him to the Bears.[30][31][32] George Halas, owner of the Bears, was also unsuccessful in signing Berwanger.[33] Berwanger's decision to not play in the NFL was not unusual, as only twenty-four of the eighty-one players selected chose to play in the NFL that year.[34] The draft was recessed on the first day and it was continued and finished on the next day.[35]\\r\\nThis draft saw the emergence of Wellington Mara as a savant, as he had been subscribing to magazines and local and out-of-town papers to build up dossiers of college players across the country, which resulted in the Giants' drafting of Tuffy Leemans.[36] As a result of the institution of the draft, Tim Mara, owner of the Giants, reduced Ken Strong's salary offer to $3,200 from $6,000 a year for 1936 because Mara felt the draft would alter the salary structure of the NFL.[37] Generally, the franchises' exclusivity in negotiating with draft picks produced the immediate effect of, depending on sources, stopping the escalating salaries of new players,[13][18] or reducing their salaries.[38][39] Consequently, contemporary critics charged it was anti-labor.[40]\\r\\nArt Rooney, owner of the Pittsburgh Steelers, chose Byron \\"Whizzer\\" White in the first round of the 1938 draft despite White's known public declaration that he would not play professional football and would instead begin work on his Rhodes scholarship. White did, however, agree to play for the 1938 season after Rooney publicly gave him a guaranteed contract of $15,000, double what any other player had ever made in the NFL.[41] The size of the dollar amount brought condemnation from other owners because it altered the pay expectations of college draftees.[42] For the 1939 draft Wellington, for the first time, was put in charge of drafting players for the Giants. He submitted the list of players into the pool that the Giantsor other franchisescould choose players from. However, in the first round he selected a player, Walt Nielsen, not on the list of players that the Giants or any other franchise had submitted. With a grin Wellington stated, \\"'I didn't think I said I put every name on that list.'\\"[43]\\r\\nAn African-American had not played in the NFL since prior to the draft's institution. In 1939, Kenny Washington was, to no small extent, viewed as one of the greatest college football players of all time. After information was made available to at least one owner of a franchise, Washington was not drafted by any team for the 1940 NFL Draft.[44]\\r\\nThe draft would be eventually codified into the NFL Constitution,[45] although no information is available on when that originally occurred.\\r\\n\\"Bullet Bill\\" Dudley was the first overall pick in the 1942 draft and he would eventually become the first player picked first overall in the draft to enter the Pro Football Hall of Fame.[46]\\r\\nEddie Kotal became the first man scout in 1946 when he was hired by Dan Reeves of the Los Angeles Rams.[47][48]\\r\\nThe NFL's competition with the AAFC in 1947 resulted in a temporary institution of a bonus pick.\\r\\nCompetitive parity did not, however, quickly arrive in the NFL as perennial losers, such as the Eagles and Chicago Cardinals, standings' did not improve until 1947.[38][49]\\r\\nIn the thirteenth round, George Taliaferro became the first African-American selected when he was chosen in the 1949 NFL draft. He however, chose to sign with an AAFC team. Wally Triplett was chosen in the nineteenth and he would be the first African-American to be selected in the draft and make an NFL team.[50] After the draft and prior to the start of the season, Paul \\"Tank\\" Younger was signed by the Los Angeles Rams as a free agent and became the first NFL player from an historically black college.[48][50] Eddie Robinson, Younger's coach at Grambling, promptly and unequivocally, impressed upon him that the future of the recruitment and drafting of his colleagues at other black colleges lay in the balance based on his success with the Rams.[51]\\r\\nThe 1960 NFL Draft marked a turning point in the draft's history because of the pending arrival of the American Football League (AFL), as it became a \\"high-stakes, competitive affair.\\"[52]\\r\\nIn 1976, former NFL wide receiver Paul Salata first coined the moniker \\"Mr. Irrelevant\\" to refer to the last overall player selected in the draft.[53]\\r\\nIn 1980, Chet Simmons, president of the year-old ESPN, asked Pete Rozelle if the fledgling network could broadcast coverage of the draft live on ESPN. Although Rozelle did not believe it would be entertaining television, he agreed.[54][55]\\r\\nIn 1988, the NFL moved the draft from weekdays to the weekend and ESPN's ratings of the coverage improved dramatically.[54][56] ESPN received competition in 2006 when the NFL Network, which had launched in October 2003, began to produce its own draft coverage. ESPN pays the NFL a rights fee for the non-exclusive rights to draft coverage, a fee that is included in its overall contract to televise games (ESPN Sunday Night NFL from 1987 to 2005, and Monday Night Football from 2006 to the present).[57]\\r\\nIn 2010, the NFL moved to a three-day draft with the first day encompassing the first round beginning at 8:00?pm EDT, the second day encompassing the second and third rounds beginning at 7:00?pm EDT, and third day concluding the process with the final four rounds beginning at 11:00?am EDT Saturday.\\r\\nThe rules do not state that a player must attend college, but virtually all of the players selected in the NFL draft have played college football, usually in the United States but occasionally from Canadian universities as well. Rules only state that a player must be three years removed from high school graduation, regardless of what the prospective draftee did during that time. A few players are occasionally selected from other football leagues like the Arena Football League (AFL), the Canadian Football League (CFL), and the German Football League (GFL). A small handful of players have also been drafted from colleges who played other sports than football.\\r\\nThe selection order is based on each team's win-loss record in the previous season and whether the team reached the playoffs. Teams that did not reach the playoffs the previous season are ranked in reverse order of their records (thus the team with the fewest wins is awarded the first selection). Ties between teams with identical records are determined by the following tiebreakers (in order):[58]\\r\\nTeams that reached the playoffs the previous season are then slotted in the order in which they were eliminated as indicated in the table below. Within each tier, the slotting is determined as above (i.e. worst record picks first and the same tiebreakers apply).[58]\\r\\nOnce the order for the first round is determined as described above, the selection order remains the same for subsequent rounds with the exception of teams with identical records within their tier. These tied teams \\"cycle\\" picks in each subsequent round. For example, in the 2014 draft, the Jacksonville Jaguars, Cleveland Browns, Oakland Raiders, Atlanta Falcons, and Tampa Bay Buccaneers all finished 4ÿ12, and selected in that order in the first round (based on the tiebreakers described above). In the second round, Jacksonville cycled to the back of the line with the order becoming Cleveland, Oakland, Atlanta, Tampa Bay, and Jacksonville. That cycling continued in each round.[citation needed]\\r\\nAn exception to this ordering strategy occurs when new \\"expansion teams\\" are added to the league. An expansion team is automatically granted the first selection. If there are two or more expansion teams added, a coin toss (for two expansion teams) or a drawing of lots (for three expansion teams or more) determines which team is awarded the first selection in the regular draft. The loser of the coin toss (or the winner of the drawing of lots in the event there are three or more expansion teams) is awarded the first selection in the expansion draft.[59]\\r\\nThe 2010 NFL draft was the first draft to take place over three days. Its first round was on Thursday, April 22 at 7:30?p.m. ET, with the second and third rounds on Friday, April 23 at 6?p.m. ET, followed by the remaining rounds on Saturday, April 24 at 10?a.m. ET.[60]\\r\\nThe first overall pick generally gets the richest contract, but other contracts rely on a number of variables. While they generally are based on the previous year's second overall pick, third overall, etc., each player's position also is taken into account. Quarterbacks, for example, usually command more money than defensive linemen, which can skew those dollar figures slightly.[citation needed]\\r\\nEach team has its representatives attend the draft. During the draft, one team is always \\"on the clock.\\" In Round 1, teams have 10 minutes to make their choice (previously 15)[time?needed]. The decision time drops to 7 minutes (previously 10) in the second round and 5 minutes in Rounds 3ÿ7. If a team does not make a decision within its allotted time, the team still can submit its selection at any time after its time is up, but the next team can pick before it, thus possibly 'stealing' a player the team with the earlier pick may have been considering. This occurred in the 2003 draft, when the Minnesota Vikings, with the 7th overall pick, were late with their selection. The Jacksonville Jaguars drafted quarterback Byron Leftwich and the Carolina Panthers drafted offensive tackle Jordan Gross before the Vikings were able to submit their selection of defensive tackle Kevin Williams. This also happened in 2011; as the Baltimore Ravens were negotiating a trade with the Chicago Bears, their time expired and allowed the Kansas City Chiefs to pick ahead of Baltimore, who was unable to finalize the trade with Chicago.\\r\\nTeams may negotiate with one another both before and during the draft for the right to pick an additional player in a given round. For example, a team may include draft picks in future drafts in order to acquire a player during a trading period. Teams may also make negotiations during the draft relinquishing the right to pick in a given round for the right to have an additional pick in a later round. Thus teams may have no picks or multiple picks in a given round.\\r\\nIn addition to the 32 selections in each of the seven rounds, a total of 32 compensatory picks are awarded to teams based on the players they lost and gained in free agency. Using a proprietary formula, the league defines a class of unrestricted free agents as \\"compensatory free agents (\\"CFA\\"). Teams that have lost more or better compensatory free agents than they signed in the previous year receive picks somewhere in the third through seventh rounds.[61] Teams that gain and lose the same number of players but lose higher-valued players also can be awarded a pick, but only in the seventh round, after the others. Compensatory picks are awarded each year at the NFL annual meeting which is held at the end of March; typically, about three or four weeks before the draft. Compensatory picks may not be traded (however, this will change beginning with the 2017 NFL draft).[62] The placement of the picks is determined by a proprietary formula based on the player's salary, playing time, and postseason honors with his new team, with salary being the primary factor. So, for example, a team that lost a linebacker who signed for $2.5 million per year in free agency might get a sixth-round compensatory pick, while a team that lost a wide receiver who signed for $5 million per year might receive a fourth-round pick. However, the NFL has never revealed the exact formula used to determine allotment of compensatory picks, though observers from outside the NFL have been able to reverse engineer it to some degree of certainty.[63]\\r\\nAll compensatory picks are awarded at the ends of Rounds 3 through 7. If fewer than 32 such picks are awarded, the remaining picks are awarded after the final Round 7 compensatory picks in the order in which teams would pick in a hypothetical eighth round of the draft; these picks are known as \\"supplemental compensatory selections\\". More than 32 compensatory picks have been awarded only on one occasion: the 2016 NFL Draft, where 33 picks were awarded; the additional pick was awarded (under an agreement between the NFL Management Council and the NFLPA) to the Buffalo Bills for losing Da'Norris Searcy to free agency and signing Charles Clay as a transition tagged player from the Miami Dolphins, who had not qualified as a CFA.[64][65]\\r\\nIn 2016, the NFL released the compensatory picks on March 11 (one month and four days after the Super Bowl).\\r\\nThe NFL allows each team a certain amount of money from its salary cap[66] to sign its drafted rookies for their first season. That amount is based on an undisclosed formula that assigns a certain value to each pick in the draft; thus, having more picks, or earlier picks, will increase the allotment. In 2008 the highest allotment was about $8.22 million for the Kansas City Chiefs, who had 12 picks, including two first-rounders, while the lowest was the $1.79 million for the Cleveland Browns who had only five picks, and none in the first three rounds.[67] The exact mechanism for the rookie salary cap is set out in the NFL's collective bargaining agreement (CBA) with the National Football League Players Association (NFLPA). (Those numbers represent the cap hits that each rookie's salary may contribute, not the total amount of money paid out.)\\r\\nThe drafted players are paid salaries commensurate with the position in which they were drafted. High first-round picks get paid the most, and low-round picks get paid the least. There is a de facto pay scale for drafted rookies. After the draft, non-drafted rookies may sign a contract with any team in the league. These rookie free-agents are not usually paid as well as drafted players, nearly all of them signing for the predetermined rookie minimum and a small signing bonus.\\r\\nTwo other facets of the rookie salary cap impact the makeup of rosters. First, the base salaries of rookie free agents do not count towards the rookie salary cap, though certain bonuses do. Second, if a rookie is traded, his cap allotment remains with the team that originally drafted him, which make trades involving rookie players relatively rare. (This rule does not apply, however, to rookies that are waived by the teams that drafted them.)\\r\\nTeams can also agree to a contract with a draft-eligible player before the draft itself starts. They can only do this if they have the first overall pick, as by agreeing to terms with a player the team has already \\"selected\\" which player they will draft. A recent example of this would be quarterback Matthew Stafford and the Detroit Lions in the 2009 NFL Draft. The Lions, with the first overall selection in the draft, agreed to a 6-year, $78 million deal with $41.7 million guaranteed with Stafford a day before the draft officially started. By agreeing to the deal, Stafford had already been chosen as the first overall pick in the draft.\\r\\nThe commissioner has the ability to forfeit picks the team is allotted in a draft. For example, in the 2007 NFL season, the New England Patriots were penalized for videotaping the Jets' defensive signals outside of a designated area. As a result, the Patriots forfeited their first-round pick in the 2008 NFL Draft. Similarly, the San Francisco 49ers were forced to forfeit a fifth-round pick in the same draft for tampering with a player under contract to the Chicago Bears, and were also forced to swap third-round selections with the Bears (moving the 49ers down and the Bears up six spots). Also, NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell penalized the New Orleans Saints by taking away their 2nd round picks in the 2012 and 2013 NFL drafts in the wake of the New Orleans Saints bounty scandal. Another time this has happened was in the 2016 NFL Draft where the Patriots 1st round pick was taken away for Deflategate and redistribution rules should be made.\\r\\nTeams vary greatly in their selection methodologies. Owners, general managers, coaches, and others may or may not participate. For the 1983 draft, for example, the Pittsburgh Steelers' head coach Chuck Noll had what team executive Art Rooney, Jr. later described as \\"the final say\\" over picks, even over his father, team owner Art Rooney. New England Patriots head coach Ron Meyer, by contrast, later stated that the team, led by owner Billy Sullivan, excluded the coaching staff from any personnel-related decisions, even prohibiting him from reading scouting reports. Had he had the decision-making authority, Meyer said, he would not have chosen Tony Eason in the first round of the 1983 draft.[68]\\r\\nCollege football players who are considering entering the NFL draft but who still have eligibility to play football can request an expert opinion from the NFL-created Draft Advisory Board. The Board, composed of scouting experts and team executives, makes a prediction as to the likely round in which a player would be drafted. This information, which has proven to be fairly accurate, can help college players determine whether to enter the draft or to continue playing and improving at the college level. There are also many famous reporting scouts, such as Mel Kiper Jr.\\r\\nThe NFL Scouting Combine is a six-day assessment of skills occurring every year in late February or early March in Lucas Oil Stadium in Indianapolis, Indiana. College football players perform physical and mental tests in front of NFL coaches, general managers, and scouts. With increasing interest in the NFL draft, the scouting combine has grown in scope and significance, allowing personnel directors to evaluate upcoming prospects in a standardized setting. Its origins have evolved from the National, BLESTO, and Quadra Scouting services in 1977 to the media frenzy it has become today. Athletes attend by invitation only. Implications of one's performance during the Combine can affect perception, draft status, salary, and ultimately his career. The draft has popularized the term \\"Workout Warrior\\" (sometimes known as a \\"Workout Wonder\\"), describing an athlete who, based on superior measurables such as size, speed, and strength, has increased his \\"draft stock\\" despite having a possibly average or subpar college career.[69][70][71]\\r\\nEach university has a Pro Day, during which the NCAA allows NFL scouts to visit the school and watch players participate in NFL Combine events together. (Some smaller universities join with nearby schools.) Essentially job fairs for prospective NFL players,[72] Pro Days are held under the belief that players feel more comfortable at their own campus than they do at the Combine, which in turn leads to better performances. College teams which produce a large quantity of NFL prospects generally generate huge interest from scouts and coaches at their Pro Days.\\r\\nTickets to the NFL draft are free and made available to fans on a first-come first-served basis. The tickets are distributed at the box office the morning of the draft, one ticket per person.[73]\\r\\nThe 2006 draft was held at New York City's Radio City Music Hall, the first time this venue has hosted the gala, and it was held there until 2015, when the draft was held in Chicago's Auditorium Theater. The move marks the first time that the Draft has been in Chicago since 1964. The Theater at Madison Square Garden had hosted the event for a ten-year period, but the NFL moved it to the Javits Convention Center in 2005 following a dispute with the Cablevision-owned arena, who were opposing the West Side Stadium, which would have served as home of the New York Jets and the centerpiece of the New York City bid for the 2012 Summer Olympics, because the new stadium would compete with the Garden for concerts and other events.[74]\\r\\nChicago: 1938, 1942ÿ1943, 1951, 1962ÿ1964, 2015ÿ2016 (9)\\r\\nLos Angeles: 1956 (1)\\r\\nMilwaukee: 1940 (1)\\r\\nNew York City: 1937, 1939, 1944ÿ1945, 1947, 1952, 1955, 1965ÿ2014 (57)\\r\\nPhiladelphia: 1936, 1944, 1949ÿ1961, 2017 (15)\\r\\nPittsburgh: 1948ÿ1949 (2)\\r\\nWashington, D.C.: 1941 (1)\\r\\n*: Year with more than one Draft venue\\r\\nSource: NFL Draft Locations[77]\\r\\nDallas: 1961ÿ1963\\r\\nMinneapolis: 1960\\r\\nNew York: 1964ÿ1966\\r\\nNo location (by telephone): 1965*\\r\\n*: Year with more than one draft venue\\r\\nSource: NFL Draft Locations[77]\\r\\nSince 1977, the NFL has also held a supplemental draft to accommodate players who did not enter the regular draft. Players generally enter the supplementary draft because they missed the filing deadline for the NFL draft or because issues developed which affected their eligibility (such as academic or disciplinary matters). The supplemental draft is scheduled to occur at some point after the regular draft and before the start of the next season. In 1984 the NFL held an additional draft for players who were under contract with either USFL or CFL teams.\\r\\nDraft order is determined by a weighted system that is divided into three groupings. First come the teams that had six or fewer wins last season, followed by non-playoff teams that had more than six wins, followed by the 12 playoff teams. In the supplemental draft, a team is not required to use any picks. Instead, if a team wants a player in the supplemental draft, they submit a \\"bid\\" to the Commissioner with the round they would pick that player. If no other team places a bid on that player at an earlier spot, the team is awarded the player and has to give up an equivalent pick in the following year's draft.[78] (For example, FS Paul Oliver was taken by the San Diego Chargers in the fourth round of the supplemental draft in 2007; thus, in the 2008 NFL draft, the Chargers forfeited a fourth-round pick.)\\r\\nThe 1985 supplemental draft was particularly controversial. Quarterback Bernie Kosar who had led the University of Miami to its first National Championship in 1984 was earning his academic degree as a junior. Rather than finish his eligibility at Miami he wanted to turn pro. At this time college players had to wait for their class unless they themselves graduated early.\\r\\nA plan was devised by football agent AJ Faigin[79] that was to get him to Kosar's preferred team, the Cleveland Browns. Faigin was representing former University of Miami QB Jim Kelly, then in the USFL, but whose NFL rights were held by the Buffalo Bills. The USFL was in its last days and Kelly would soon be available to the Bills. Faigin's first step was to ask Bill Polian, the GM of Buffalo, if he would be willing to trade the number one supplemental pick (worth next to nothing at that time) to Cleveland. Polian agreed and Faigin told the Cleveland Browns a trade was available. He next notified Kosar's father he should not formally submit his son's application for the standard NFL draft that was weeks away and declare only afterward; which would put him into the supplemental draft.\\r\\nThe result of Kosar's withdrawal resulted in rare, open warfare among NFL teams played out in the newspapers with threats of lawsuits between them, notably the Minnesota Vikings and New York Giants, who had expressed interest in choosing him in that season's regular draft. But as no rules were broken the Giants and eventually Minnesota had to back down. Following that season, the NFL instituted the current semi-random supplemental draft order.\\r\\nThe strategy devised by A.J. Faigin, to not declare for the NFL until after the regular draft, was subsequently used by other top players for various reasons. In some cases, it was because they did not want to play for the team that would have drafted them in the regular draft. For example, Brian Bosworth did not declare because he did not want to play for the Indianapolis Colts or the Buffalo Bills, the teams who drafted second and third that year. The Colts had offered him a 4-year, $2.2 million deal before the draft.[80] The Seattle Seahawks won the right to draft first in the supplemental draft, and later signed him to a 10-year, $11 million contract.[81] At the time that was the largest rookie contract in NFL history.\\r\\nAs of the 1990 season, only players who had graduated or exhausted their college eligibility were made available for the supplemental draft. Since 1993, only players who had planned to attend college but for various reasons could not, have been included in the supplemental draft.","input":"How many rounds are in the nfl draft?"},{"output":"at 11ÿ18 months for males, and 20ÿ36 months for females","context":"The ball python (Python regius), also known as the royal python,[2] is a python species found in sub-Saharan Africa. Like all other pythons, it is a nonvenomous constrictor. This is the smallest of the African pythons and is popular in the pet trade, largely due to its small size and typically docile temperament. No subspecies are currently recognized.[3] The name \\"ball python\\" refers to the animal's tendency to curl into a ball when stressed or frightened.[4] The name \\"royal python\\"(from the Latin regius) comes from the fact that rulers in Africa would wear the python as jewelry.[citation needed]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nMaximum adult length of this species is 182?cm (6.0?ft).[5] Females tend to be slightly bigger than males, maturing around 122ÿ137?cm (4.0ÿ4.5?ft). Males typically grow to around 90ÿ107?cm (3.0ÿ3.5?ft).[6] Their build is stocky,[2] while the head is relatively small. The scales are smooth[5] and both sexes have anal spurs on either side of the vent.[7] Although males tend to have larger spurs, this is not definitive, and sex is best determined by manual eversion of the male hemipenes or inserting a probe into the cloaca to check the presence of an inverted hemipenis (if male).[8] When probing to determine sex, males typically measure eight to 10 subcaudal scales, and females typically measure two to four subcaudal scales.[5]\\r\\nThe color pattern is typically black or dark brown with light brown or gold sides and dorsal blotches. The belly is a white or cream that may include scattered black markings.[5] However, those in the pet industries have, through selective breeding, developed many morphs (genetic mutations) with altered colors and patterns.[9]\\r\\nThey are found in west Africa from Senegal, Mali, Guinea-Bissau, Guinea, Sierra Leone, Liberia, Ivory Coast, Ghana, Benin, and Nigeria through Cameroon, Chad, and the Central African Republic to Sudan and Uganda. No type locality was given in the original description.[1]\\r\\nThe ball python bears a strong physical resemblance to the Burmese python, whose adaptive abilities have caused it to become classified as an invasive species in places such as the Florida Everglades. The ball python, however, has not been known to reproduce in the wild outside of its native range and no reproducing wild populations are known in Florida.[10]\\r\\nBall pythons prefer grasslands, savannas, and sparsely wooded areas.[2] but have been shown to adapt to all types of environments. Males tend to display more semi-arboreal behaviours, whilst females tend towards terrestrial behaviours.[11]\\r\\nThis terrestrial species is known for its defense strategy that involves coiling into a tight ball when threatened, with its head and neck tucked away in the middle. In this state, it can literally be rolled around. Favored retreats include mammal burrows and other underground hiding places, where they also aestivate. In captivity, they are considered good pets, with their relatively small size and placid nature making them easy to handle.[2]\\r\\nIn the wild, their diet consists mostly of small mammals, such as African soft-furred rats, shrews, and striped mice and birds. Younger pythons, under 70?cm total length, and males prey almost exclusively on small birds (nestlings and immature young) whilst pythons greater than 70?cm total length, and females prey almost exclusively on small mammals.[12]\\r\\nFemales are oviparous, with 3 to 11 rather large, leathery eggs being laid (four to six are most common).[5] These are incubated by the female under the ground (via a shivering motion), and hatch after 55 to 60 days. Sexual maturity is reached at 11ÿ18 months for males, and 20ÿ36 months for females. Age is only one factor in determining sexual maturity and ability to breed; weight is the second factor. Males breed at 600 g or more, but in captivity are often not bred until they are 800 g (1.7 lb), although in captivity, some males have been known to begin breeding at 300ÿ400 g. Females breed in the wild at weights as low as 800 g though 1200 g or more in weight is most common; in captivity, breeders generally wait until they are no less than 1500?g (3.3?lb). Parental care of the eggs ends once they hatch, and the female leaves the offspring to fend for themselves.[8]\\r\\nWild-caught specimens have greater difficulty adapting to a captive environment, which can result in refusal to feed, and they generally carry internal or external parasites. Specimens have survived for over 40 years in captivity, with the oldest recorded ball python being kept in captivity 47 years and 6 months until its death in 1992 at the Philadelphia Zoo.[13]\\r\\nHundreds of different color patterns are available in captive snakes. Some of the most common are Spider, Pastel, Albino, Mojave, and Lesser. Breeders are continuously creating new designer morphs, and over 5,300 different morphs currently exist.[14]\\r\\nThis species is particularly revered in the traditional religion of the Igbo people of southeastern Nigeria. It is considered symbolic of the earth, being an animal that travels so close to the ground. Even among many Christian Igbos, these pythons are treated with great care whenever they happen to wander into a village or onto someone's property; they are allowed to roam freely or are very gently picked up and placed out in a forest or field away from any homes. If one is accidentally killed, many communities in Igboland still build a coffin for the snake's remains and give it a short funeral.[15]","input":"How old is a full grown ball python?"},{"output":"a small force of Green Mountain Boys led by Ethan Allen and Colonel Benedict Arnold overcame a small British garrison at the fort and looted the personal belongings of the garrison","context":"1 captured near Fort Saint-Jean[7]\\r\\nThe Capture of Fort Ticonderoga occurred during the American Revolutionary War on May 10, 1775, when a small force of Green Mountain Boys led by Ethan Allen and Colonel Benedict Arnold overcame a small British garrison at the fort and looted the personal belongings of the garrison. Cannons and other armaments from the fort were later transported to Boston and used to fortify Dorchester Heights and break the standoff at the Siege of Boston.\\r\\nAfter seizing Ticonderoga, a small detachment captured the nearby Fort Crown Point on May 11. Seven days later, Arnold and 50 men intrepidly raided Fort Saint-Jean on the Richelieu River in southern Quebec, seizing military supplies, cannons, and the largest military vessel on Lake Champlain.\\r\\nAlthough the scope of this military action was relatively minor, it had significant strategic importance. It impeded communication between northern and southern units of the British Army, and gave the nascent Continental Army a staging ground for the invasion of Quebec later in 1775. It also involved two larger-than-life personalities in Allen and Arnold, each of whom sought to gain as much credit and honor as possible for these events. Most significantly, artillery from Ticonderoga would be dragged across Massachusetts to the heights commanding Boston Harbor, forcing the British to withdraw from that city.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1775, Fort Ticonderoga's location did not appear to be as strategically important as it had been in the French and Indian War, when the French famously defended it against a much larger British force in the 1758 Battle of Carillon, and when the British captured it in 1759. After the 1763 Treaty of Paris, in which the French ceded their North American territories to the British, the fort was no longer on the frontier of two great empires, guarding the principal waterway between them.[9] The French had blown up the fort's powder magazine when they abandoned the fort, and it had fallen further into disrepair since then. In 1775 it was garrisoned by only a small detachment of the 26th Regiment of Foot, consisting of two officers and forty-six men, with many of them \\"invalids\\" (soldiers with limited duties because of disability or illness). Twenty-five women and children lived there as well. Because of its former significance, Fort Ticonderoga still had a high reputation as the \\"gateway to the continent\\" or the \\"Gibraltar of America\\", but in 1775 it was, according to historian Christopher Ward, \\"more like a backwoods village than a fort.\\"[5]\\r\\nEven before shooting started in the American Revolutionary War, American Patriots were concerned about Fort Ticonderoga. The fort was a valuable asset for several reasons. Within its walls was a collection of heavy artillery including cannons, howitzers, and mortars, armaments that the Americans had in short supply.[10][11] The fort was situated on the shores of Lake Champlain, a strategically important route between the Thirteen Colonies and the British-controlled northern provinces. British forces placed there would expose the colonial forces in Boston to attack from the rear.[10] After the war began with the Battles of Lexington and Concord on April 19, 1775, the British General Thomas Gage realized the fort would require fortification, and several colonists had the idea of capturing the fort.\\r\\nGage, writing from the besieged city of Boston following Lexington and Concord, instructed Quebec's governor, General Guy Carleton, to rehabilitate and refortify the forts at Ticonderoga and Crown Point.[12] Carleton did not receive this letter until May 19, well after the fort had been captured.[13]\\r\\nBenedict Arnold had frequently traveled through the area around the fort, and was familiar with its condition, manning, and armaments. En route to Boston following news of the events of April 19, he mentioned the fort and its condition to members of Silas Deane's militia.[14] The Connecticut Committee of Correspondence acted on this information; money was \\"borrowed\\" from the provincial coffers and recruiters were sent into northwestern Connecticut, western Massachusetts, and the New Hampshire Grants (now Vermont) to raise volunteers for an attack on the fort.[15]\\r\\nJohn Brown, an American spy from Pittsfield, Massachusetts who had carried correspondence between revolutionary committees in the Boston area and Patriot supporters in Montreal, was well aware of the fort and its strategic value.[9] Ethan Allen and other Patriots in the disputed New Hampshire Grants territory also recognized the fort's value, as it played a role in the dispute over that area between New York and New Hampshire.[16] Whether either took or instigated action prior to the Connecticut Colony's recruitment efforts is unclear. Brown had notified the Massachusetts Committee of Safety in March of his opinion that Ticonderoga \\"must be seized as soon as possible should hostilities be committed by the King's Troops.\\"[16][17]\\r\\nWhen Arnold arrived outside Boston, he told the Massachusetts Committee of Safety about the cannons and other military equipment at the lightly defended fort. On May 3, the Committee gave Arnold a colonel's commission and authorized him to command a \\"secret mission\\", which was to capture the fort.[18] He was issued S100, some gunpowder, ammunition, and horses, and instructed to recruit up to 400 men, march on the fort, and ship back to Massachusetts anything he thought useful.[19]\\r\\nArnold departed immediately after receiving his instructions. He was accompanied by two captains, Eleazer Oswald and Jonathan Brown, who were charged with recruiting the necessary men. Arnold reached the border between Massachusetts and the Grants on May 6, where he learned of the recruitment efforts of the Connecticut Committee, and that Ethan Allen and the Green Mountain Boys were already on their way north. Riding furiously northward (his horse was subsequently destroyed), he reached Allen's headquarters in Bennington the next day.[20] Upon arrival, Arnold was told that Allen was in Castleton, 50 miles (80?km) to the north, awaiting supplies and more men. He was also warned that, although Allen's effort had no official sanction, his men were unlikely to serve under anyone else. Leaving early the next day, Arnold arrived in Castleton in time to join a war council, where he made a case to lead the expedition based on his formal authorization to act from the Massachusetts Committee.[21]\\r\\nThe force that Allen had assembled in Castleton included about 100 Green Mountain Boys, about 40 men raised by James Easton and John Brown at Pittsfield, and an additional 20 men from Connecticut.[22] Allen was elected colonel, with Easton and Seth Warner as his lieutenants.[21] When Arnold arrived on the scene, Samuel Herrick had already been sent to Skenesboro and Asa Douglas to Panton with detachments to secure boats. Captain Noah Phelps, a member of the \\"Committee of War for the Expedition against Ticonderoga and Crown Point\\", had reconnoitered the fort disguised as a peddler seeking a shave. He saw that the fort walls were dilapidated, learned from the garrison commander that the soldiers' gunpowder was wet, and that they expected reinforcements at any time.[23][24] He reported this intelligence to Allen, following which they planned a dawn raid.[23]\\r\\nMany of the Green Mountain Boys objected to Arnold's wish to command, insisting that they would go home rather than serve under anyone other than Ethan Allen. Arnold and Allen worked out an agreement, but no documented evidence exists concerning the deal. According to Arnold, he was given joint command of the operation. Some historians have supported Arnold's contention, while others suggest he was merely given the right to march next to Allen.[Note 1]\\r\\nBy 11:30?pm on May 9, the men had assembled at Hand's Cove (in what is now Shoreham, Vermont) and were ready to cross the lake to Ticonderoga. However, boats did not arrive until 1:30?am, and they were inadequate to carry the whole force.[25] Eighty-three of the Green Mountain Boys made the first crossing with Arnold and Allen, and Douglas went back for the rest.[2] As dawn approached, Allen and Arnold became fearful of losing the element of surprise, so they decided to attack with the men at hand. The only sentry on duty at the south gate fled his post after his musket misfired, and the Americans rushed into the fort. The Patriots then roused the small number of sleeping troops at gunpoint and began confiscating their weapons. Allen, Arnold, and a few other men charged up the stairs toward the officers' quarters. Lieutenant Jocelyn Feltham, the assistant to Captain William Delaplace, was awakened by the noise, and called to wake the captain.[26] Stalling for time, Feltham demanded to know by what authority the fort was being entered. Allen, who later claimed that he said it to Captain Delaplace, replied, \\"In the name of the Great Jehovah and the Continental Congress!\\"[27] Delaplace finally emerged from his chambers (fully clothed, not with \\"his breeches in his hand\\", as Allen would later say) and surrendered his sword.[27]\\r\\nNobody was killed in the assault. The only injury was to one American, Gideon Warren,[28] who was slightly injured by a sentry with a bayonet.[8] Eventually, as many as 400 men arrived at the fort, which they plundered for liquor and other provisions. Arnold, whose authority was not recognized by the Green Mountain Boys, was unable to stop the plunder. Frustrated, he retired to the captain's quarters to await forces that he had recruited, reporting to the Massachusetts Provincial Congress that Allen and his men were \\"governing by whim and caprice\\" at the fort, and that the plan to strip the fort and send armaments to Boston was in peril.[29] When Delaplace protested the seizure of his private liquor stores, Allen issued him a receipt for the stores, which he later submitted to Connecticut for payment.[30] Arnold's disputes with Allen and his unruly men were severe enough that there were times when some of Allen's men drew weapons.[29]\\r\\nOn May 12, Allen sent the prisoners to Connecticut's Governor Jonathan Trumbull with a note saying \\"I make you a present of a Major, a Captain, and two Lieutenants of the regular Establishment of George the Third.\\"[31] Arnold busied himself over the next few days with cataloging the military equipment at Ticonderoga and Crown Point, a task made difficult by the fact that walls had collapsed on some of the armaments.[32]\\r\\nSeth Warner sailed a detachment up the lake and captured nearby Fort Crown Point, garrisoned by only nine men. It is widely recorded that this capture occurred on May 10; this is attributed to a letter Arnold wrote to the Massachusetts Committee of Safety on May 11, claiming that an attempt to sail up to Crown Point was frustrated by headwinds. However, Warner claimed, in a letter dated May 12 from \\"Head Quarters, Crown Point\\", that he \\"took possession of this garrison\\" the day before.[6] It appears likely that, having failed on May 10, the attempt was repeated the next day with success, as reported in Warner's memoir.[33] A small force was also sent to capture Fort George on Lake George, which was held by only two soldiers.[34]\\r\\nTroops recruited by Arnold's captains began to arrive, some after seizing Philip Skene's schooner Katherine and several bateaux at Skenesboro.[35][36] Arnold rechristened the schooner Liberty. The prisoners had reported that the lone British warship on Lake Champlain was at Fort Saint-Jean, on the Richelieu River north of the lake. Arnold, uncertain whether word of Ticonderoga's capture had reached Saint-Jean, decided to attempt a raid to capture the ship. He had Liberty outfitted with guns, and sailed north with 50 of his men on May 14.[37] Allen, not wanting Arnold to get the full glory for that capture, followed with some of his men in bateaux, but Arnold's small fleet had the advantage of sail, and pulled away from Allen's boats. By May 17, Arnold's small fleet was at the northern end of the lake. Seeking intelligence, Arnold sent a man to reconnoiter the situation at Fort Saint-Jean. The scout returned later that day, reporting that the British were aware of the fall of Ticonderoga and Crown Point, and that troops were apparently on the move toward Saint-Jean. Arnold decided to act immediately.[38]\\r\\nRowing all night, Arnold and 35 of his men brought their bateaux near the fort. After a brief scouting excursion, they surprised the small garrison at the fort, and seized supplies there, along with the HMS?Royal George, a seventy-ton sloop-of-war.[39] Warned by their captives that several companies were on their way from Chambly, they loaded the more valuable supplies and cannons on the George, which Arnold renamed the Enterprise. Boats that they could not take were sunk, and the enlarged fleet returned to Lake Champlain.[4] This activity was observed by Moses Hazen, a retired British officer who lived near the fort. Hazen rode to Montreal to report the action to the local military commander, and then continued on to Quebec City, where he reported the news to General Carleton on May 20. Major Charles Preston and 140 men were immediately dispatched from Montreal to Saint-Jean in response to Hazen's warning.[40]\\r\\nFifteen miles out on the lake, Arnold's fleet met Allen's, which was still heading north. After an exchange of celebratory gunfire, Arnold opened his stores to feed Allen's men, who had rowed 100 miles (160?km) in open boats without provisions. Allen, believing he could seize and hold Fort Saint-Jean, continued north, while Arnold sailed south.[41] Allen arrived at Saint-Jean on May 19, where he was warned that British troops were approaching by a sympathetic Montreal merchant who had raced ahead of those troops on horseback.[42] Allen, after penning a message for the merchant to deliver to the citizens of Montreal, returned to Ticonderoga on May 21, leaving Saint-Jean just as the British forces arrived.[42][43] In their haste to escape the British, three men were left behind; one was captured, but the other two eventually returned south by land.[7]\\r\\nEthan Allen and his men eventually drifted away from Ticonderoga, especially once the alcohol began to run out, and Arnold largely controlled affairs from a base at Crown Point.[34][44] He oversaw the fitting of the two large ships, eventually taking command of Enterprise because of a lack of knowledgeable seamen. His men began rebuilding Ticonderoga's barracks, and worked to extract armaments from the rubble of the two forts and build gun carriages for them.[44]\\r\\nConnecticut sent about 1,000 men under Colonel Benjamin Hinman to hold Ticonderoga, and New York also began to raise militia to defend Crown Point and Ticonderoga against a possible British attack from the north. When Hinman's troops arrived in June, there was once again a clash over leadership. None of the communications to Arnold from the Massachusetts committee indicated that he was to serve under Hinman; when Hinman attempted to assert authority over Crown Point, Arnold refused to accept it, as Hinman's instructions only included Ticonderoga.[45] The Massachusetts committee eventually sent a delegation to Ticonderoga. When they arrived on June 22 they made it clear to Arnold that he was to serve under Hinman. Arnold, after considering for two days, disbanded his command, resigned his commission, and went home, having spent more than S1,000 of his own money in the effort to capture the fort.[46]\\r\\nWhen Congress received news of the events, it drafted a second letter to the inhabitants of Quebec, which was sent north in June with James Price, another sympathetic Montreal merchant. This letter, and other communications from the New York Congress, combined with the activities of vocal American supporters, stirred up the Quebec population in the summer of 1775.[47]\\r\\nWhen news of the fall of Ticonderoga reached England, Lord Dartmouth wrote that it was \\"very unfortunate; very unfortunate indeed\\".[48]\\r\\nNews of the capture of Ticonderoga and Crown Point, and especially the raids on Fort Saint-Jean, electrified the Quebec population. Colonel Dudley Templer, in charge of the garrison at Montreal, issued a call on May 19 to raise a militia for defense of the city, and requested Indians living nearby to also take up arms. Only 50 men, mostly French-speaking landowning seigneurs and petty nobility, were raised in and around Montreal, and they were sent to Saint-Jean; no Indians came to their aid. Templer also prevented merchants sympathetic to the American cause from sending supplies south in response to Allen's letter.[49]\\r\\nGeneral Carleton, notified by Hazen of the events on May 20, immediately ordered the garrisons of Montreal and Trois-Rivires to fortify Saint-Jean. Some troops garrisoned at Quebec were also sent to Saint-Jean. Most of the remaining Quebec troops were dispatched to a variety of other points along the Saint Lawrence, as far west as Oswegatchie, to guard against potential invasion threats.[50] Carleton then traveled to Montreal to oversee the defense of the province from there, leaving the city of Quebec in the hands of Lieutenant Governor Hector Cramah.[51] Before leaving, Carleton prevailed on Monsignor Jean-Olivier Briand, the Bishop of Quebec, to issue his own call to arms in support of the provincial defense, which was circulated primarily in the areas around Montreal and Trois-Rivires.[52]\\r\\nIn July 1775, General Philip Schuyler began using the fort as the staging ground for the invasion of Quebec that was launched in late August.[53] In the winter of 1775ÿ1776, Henry Knox directed the transportation of the guns of Ticonderoga to Boston. The guns were placed upon Dorchester Heights overlooking the besieged city and the British ships in the harbor, prompting the British to evacuate their troops and Loyalist supporters from the city in March 1776.[54]\\r\\nBenedict Arnold again led a fleet of ships at the Battle of Valcour Island, and played other key roles in thwarting Britain's attempt to recapture the fort in 1776.[55] The British did recapture the fort in July 1777 during the Saratoga campaign, but had abandoned it by November after Burgoyne's surrender at Saratoga.[56]\\r\\nAlthough Fort Ticonderoga was not at the time an important military post, its capture had several important results. Rebel control of the area meant that overland communications and supply lines between British forces in Quebec and those in Boston and later New York were severed, so the British military command made an adjustment to their command structure.[57] This break in communication was highlighted by the fact that Arnold, on his way north to Saint-Jean, intercepted a message from Carleton to Gage, detailing the military troop strengths in Quebec.[58] Command of British forces in North America, previously under a single commander, was divided into two commands. General Carleton was given independent command of forces in Quebec and the northern frontier, while General William Howe was appointed Commander-in-Chief of forces along the Atlantic coast, an arrangement that had worked well between Generals Wolfe and Amherst in the French and Indian War.[57] In this war, however, cooperation between the two forces would prove to be problematic and would play a role in the failure of the Saratoga campaign in 1777, as General Howe apparently abandoned an agreed-upon northern strategy, leaving General John Burgoyne without southern support in that campaign.[59]\\r\\nBeginning on the day of the fort's capture, Allen and Arnold began a war of words, each attempting to garner for himself as much credit for the operation as possible. Arnold, unable to exert any authority over Allen and his men, began to keep a diary of events and actions, which was highly critical and dismissive of Allen.[34] Allen, in the days immediately after the action, also began to work on a memoir. Published several years later (see Further reading), the memoir fails to mention Arnold at all. Allen also wrote several versions of the events, which John Brown and James Easton brought to a variety of Congresses and committees in New York, Connecticut, and Massachusetts. Randall (1990) claims that Easton took accounts written by both Arnold and Allen to the Massachusetts committee, but conveniently lost Arnold's account on the way, ensuring that Allen's version, which greatly glorified his role in the affair, would be preferred.[60] Smith (1907) indicates that it was highly likely that Easton was interested in claiming Arnold's command for himself.[61] There was clearly no love lost between Easton and Arnold. Allen and Easton returned to Crown Point on June 10 and called a council of war while Arnold was with the fleet on the lake, a clear breach of military protocol. When Arnold, whose men now dominated the garrison, asserted his authority, Easton insulted Arnold, who responded by challenging Easton to a duel. Arnold later reported, \\"On refusing to draw like a gentleman, he having a [sword] by his side and cases of loaded pistols in his pockets, I kicked him very heartily and ordered him from the Point.\\"[62]","input":"What was the outcome of the battle of ticonderoga?"},{"output":"about 10,000 seasonal and full-time employees","context":"Knotts Berry Farm is a 160-acre amusement park in Buena Park, California, United States, owned by Cedar Fair. In 2017, it was the tenth most-visited theme park in North America. Knott's Berry Farm is also the most-visited theme park in the Cedar Fair chain.[3] The park features 35 rides including roller coasters, family rides, children's rides, water rides, and historical rides, and it employs about 10,000 seasonal and full-time employees.[4]\\r\\nThe theme park sits on the site of a former berry farm established by Walter Knott, Cordelia Knott, and their family. Beginning around 1920, the Knott family sold berries, berry preserves, and pies from a roadside stand along State Route 39. In 1934, the Knotts began selling fried chicken dinners in a tea room on the property, and the Knotts built several shops and other attractions to entertain visitors. Cordelia Knott's efforts in the Mrs. Knott's Chicken Dinner Restaurant were essential to putting Knott's Berry Farm on the map, and the ensuing crowds prompted the creation of even more tourist attractions. In 1940, Walter Knott began constructing a replica ghost town on the property. Knott added several other attractions over the years, and began charging admission to the attractions in 1968. In 1983, Knott's Berry Farm added Camp Snoopy, which began the park's present-day association with the Peanuts characters.\\r\\nIn the 1990s, following the deaths of Walter and Cordelia Knott, their children sold the theme park to Cedar Fair and the family's food business to ConAgra Foods, which subsequently sold it to J. M. Smucker. Cedar Fair has continued to expand the theme park, adding Knott's Soak City in 1999 and adding new rides to the original park.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe theme park sits on the site of a former berry farm established by Walter Knott and his family.

In 1934, the Knotts began selling fried chicken dinners in a tea room on the property, later called \\"Mrs. Knott's Chicken Dinner Restaurant\\". The dinners soon became a major tourist draw, and the Knotts built several shops and other attractions to entertain visitors while waiting for a seat in the restaurant. In 1940, Walter Knott began constructing a replica Ghost Town on the property, the beginning of the present-day theme park. The idea of an amusement park really picked up in the 1950s when Walter Knott opened a \\"summer-long county fair\\".\\r\\nIn 1968, for the first time, an admission price was required to get into the park, originally set at 25 cents. The Calico log ride was added in 1969. The park became a popular destination for conservative college students in the 1960s, especially as conservative organizations like the California Free Enterprise Association, the Libres Foundation, and the Americanism Educational League were based there.[5] According to Assistant Professor Caroline Rolland-Diamond of the Paris West University Nanterre La Dfense:\\r\\nit also appealed to conservative Americans, young and old, because the idealized representation of a past devoid of social and racial tensions that it offered stood in sharp contrast with the political and social upheavals affecting California since the Free Speech Movement erupted at the University of California at Berkeley in 1964.\\r\\nOn April 12, 1974, Cordelia Knott died. Walter turned his attention toward political causes,[7][8] Roaring Twenties[9] re-themed Gypsy Camp in the 1970s with the addition of a nostalgic traditional amusement area, Wheeler Dealer Bumper Cars, Knott's Bear-y Tales.

Parachute Sky Jump boarded one or two standing riders anticipating the thrill of the drop into baskets beneath a faux parachute canopy. From the top, eight arms supported the vertical cable tracks of wire rope which lifted the baskets. The Sky Cabin ringed the support pole with a single floor of seats that are enclosed behind windows. The Sky Cabin ring revolves slowly as it rises to the top and back offering a pleasantly changing vista. Sky Cabin is very sensitive to weather and passenger motion, such as walking, which is prohibited during the trip. During winds 25+?mph or rain it is closed. When built, Sky Tower was the tallest structure in Orange County (a distinction briefly held by WindSeeker before its relocation to Worlds of Fun in 2012.)\\r\\nMotorcycle Chase, modernized steeplechase rollercoaster built in 1976 by Arrow Development, featured single motorbike themed vehicles racing side-by-side, each on one of four parallel tracks, launched together.[10] One or two riders straddled each \\"Indian motorcycle\\" attraction vehicle. The tubular steel monorail track closely followed dips and bumps in \\"the road\\" and tilted to lean riders about the curves. Gasoline Alley, an electric steel-guiderail car ride below, was built together and intimately intertwined, which enhanced ride-to-ride interaction thrill value.[11] Rider safety concerns of the high center of gravity coupled with the method of rider restraints caused it to be re-themed Wacky Soap Box Racers with vehicles themed to look like soap box racers, each seating two riders, strapped in low (nearly straddling the track), surrounded by the close fitting car sides, and the dips and bumps of the track were straightened flat in 1980. Motorcycle Chase/Wacky Soap Box Racers was removed 1996 for a dueling loop coaster Windjammer Surf Racers and now Xcelerator, a vertical launch coaster, takes its place.\\r\\nOn December 3, 1981, Walter Knott died, survived by his children who would continue to operate Knott's as a family business for another fourteen years.\\r\\nIn the 1980s, Knott's built the Barn Dance featured Bobbi & Clyde as the house band. It was during the height of the \\"Urban Cowboy\\" era. The \\"Barn Dance\\" was featured in Knott's TV Commercials.\\r\\nDuring the 1980s, Knott's met the competition in Southern California theme parks by theming a new land and building two massive attractions:\\r\\nThe Boomerang roller coaster replaced the Corkscrew[9] in 1990 with a lift shuttle train passing to and fro through a cobra roll and a vertical loop for six inversions each trip.\\r\\nMystery Lodge (1994),[12] inspired by General Motors \\"Spirit Lodge\\" pavilion, was a live show augmented with Pepper's ghost and other special effects, which was among the most popular exhibits at Expo 86 in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada, which was produced by Bob Rogers of BRC Imagination Arts[13] and created with the assistance of the Kwagulth Native reserve in the village of Alert Bay, British Columbia.[14] Mystery Lodge recreates a quiet summer night in Alert Bay, then guests \\"move inside\\" the longhouse and listen to the storyteller weave a tale of the importance of family from the smoke of the bonfire.\\r\\nThe Jaguar! was opened June 17, 1995, to add another roller coaster to the mix of Fiesta Village alongside Montezooma's Revenge.\\r\\nIn the 1990s, after Walter and Cordelia died, their children decided to sell off their businesses:\\r\\nIn the late 1990s Cedar Fair acquired the Buena Park Hotel at the corner of Grand Ave. and Crescent. It was then brought up to Radisson standards and branded Radisson Resort Hotel as a franchise. In 2004, the park renamed the Radisson Resort Hotel the Knott's Berry Farm Resort Hotel.\\r\\nIn 1995, the Knott family sold the food specialty business to ConAgra Foods, which later re-sold the brand to The J.M. Smucker Company in 2008.\\r\\nIn 1997, the Knott family sold the amusement park operations to Cedar Fair Entertainment Company. Initially, the Knotts were given an opportunity to sell the park to The Walt Disney Company. The park would have been amalgamated into the Disneyland Resort and converted into Disney's America, which had previously failed to be built near Washington, D.C. The Knotts refused to sell the park to Disney out of fear most of what Walter Knott had built would be eliminated.\\r\\nSince being acquired by Cedar Fair, the park has seen an aggressive shift towards thrill rides, with the construction of a number of large roller coasters and the addition of a high-performance Shoot-the-Chutes ride Perilous Plunge. Perilous Plunge had the record of being the tallest and steepest water ride in the world until September 2012 when it was closed and removed.[15] Also, in 2013, Knott's Berry Farm announced that the most popular ride at the park, the Timber Mountain Log Ride, would be closed for a major five-month refurbishment, led by Garner Holt Productions, Inc.[16]\\r\\nOn May 25, 2013, Knott's Berry Farm added three new family rides on the site of former Perilous Plunge. They include: Coast Rider (wild mouse roller coaster), Pacific Scrambler (Scrambler ride) and Surfside Gliders. All three of the rides added to the Boardwalk theme. The old bridge which connected the exit of Perlious Plunge and the boardwalk is now used as the entrance to Surfside Gliders and Pacific Scrambler. The Boomerang roller coaster was also repainted a lime-green color as part of the Boardwalk expansion.\\r\\nOn September 2, 2013, Knott's Berry Farm announced that Windseeker would be removed from the park. The ride was removed and sent to Worlds of Fun for the 2014 season.\\r\\nOn November 22, 2013, Knott's Berry Farm made a major announcement for the 2014 operating season; the famous and historical Calico Mine Ride would be closed for a major six-month refurbishment beginning in January 2014.[17]\\r\\nThe park's annual Knott's Scary Farm has drawn crowds since 1973. The idea for this event was presented at one of the regularly scheduled round table meetings for managers by Patricia Pawson. The actual event was created by Bill Hollingshead, Gary Salisbury, Martha Boyd and Gene Witham, along with other members of the Knott's Berry Farm Entertainment Department as documented in the DVD Season of Screams. Initially fake corpses and other static figures were rented from Hollywood prop house, but Bud Hurlbut, the creator/concessionaire of the Mine Ride, Log Ride and other rides at Knott's, decided that this wasn't enough.[26] He dressed up in a gorilla suit, and started scaring guests on the Mine Ride. Halloween Haunt was an instant hit, and by the next year, the event sold out nightly.[27] During this special ticketed event, the entire park (or major portions of it) re-themes itself into a \\"haunted house\\" style attraction in the form of mazes and \\"scare zones\\" in the evening. Over a thousand specially employed monsters are also scatteredoften hidden out of viewthroughout the park at this time. Some of the characters have become well-known, such as the green witch, which has been portrayed by Charlene Parker since 1983, the longest of any performer.[28][29][30][31][32][33][34] Several attractions are decorated for the event including the Timber Mountain Log Ride and Calico Mine Train and there are 13 mazes of various themes. Elvira (actress Cassandra Peterson) was introduced into the Halloween Event in 1982 and was prominently featured in many Halloween Haunt events until 2001. According to postings on her My Space page, Cassandra was released from her contract by the park's new owners due to their wanting a more family friendly appeal,[35] although she returned for one night in 2012 for the 40th anniversary of the event and has returned as a regular performer throughout the run of the event for the last several years.[36] During the month of October, Knott's Scary Farm generates half the revenue for Knott's Berry Farm's fiscal year.[citation needed]\\r\\nSeason of Screams is a DVD produced by an independent company which traces the beginnings of Halloween Haunt and the story behind how it all got started back in 1973. Season of Screams also highlights recent Halloween Haunts.\\r\\nWinter Coaster Solace is an event that takes place in the first or second weekend of March every year when roller coaster enthusiasts can come before the park opens and stay after the park closes to ride the rides and eat at the Chicken Dinner Restaurant. It is intended to provide \\"solace\\" to visitors from other parts of the country where theme parks and roller coasters are seasonal, not year-round operations like the Southern California parks. Knott's Berry Farm also used to give attendees behind the scenes tours of the rides.\\r\\nEvery year since 1991, Knott's has offered free admission to veterans and their families during the month of November. Though this was originally started as a tribute to returning Gulf War veterans, they subsequently expanded it to include all veterans and have run it every year since.\\r\\nA Christmas event known as \\"Knott's Merry Farm\\" also happens annually. Previous Merry Farm events have included manufactured snow, handcrafts exhibits, and a visit with Santa Claus. This event was originally created by Gary Salisbury in the Fall of 1985.\\r\\nPraise (festival) has been a Christian themed celebration presented many years as a mix-in special event of music and comedy on New Year's Eve.\\r\\nThe park consists of five themed areas:\\r\\nCraftsmen in Ghost Town demonstrate the arts of the blacksmith, woodcarver, glass-blower, sign cutter, and spinner. Demonstrations of narrow gauge railroading and farm equipment hobbyists accompany additional merchant stalls of cottage-craft fairs seasonally at discounted admission which is restricted to Ghost Town only.\\r\\nWestern Trails Museum, relocated between the candy store and the General Store to accommodate Bigfoot Rapids, still features historical western artifacts large and small, from a hand powered horse-drawn fire engine to miniature replica of a borax hauling \\"Twenty Mule Team\\" and utensils necessary to survive the prairie and wilderness.\\r\\nThe Ghost Town area has a few other notable attractions. The Bird Cage Theatre only hosts two seasonal entertainmentsduring \\"Knott's Merry Farm,\\" two small productions of \\"The Gift of the Magi\\" and \\"A Christmas Carol,\\" and a Halloween Haunt thrill show. The Calico Stage, a large open-air stage in Calico Square, hosts a variety of shows and acts, big and small, from those of elementary school students, Gallagher, a local band, and the summer-spectacular All Wheels Extreme stunt show featuring youthful performers demonstrating aerial tricks with acrobatics, trampolines, and riding ramps with skates, scooters, skateboards, and freestyle bikes to popular music. Calico Saloon recreates the revelry of music, singing and dancing, with Cameo Kate hosting a variety of acts. Jersey Lily, Judge Roy Bean's combination courthouse/saloon, offers certified comical \\"genuine illegal hitchin'\\" alongside pickles, candy, and sports/soft drinks.\\r\\nMany parts of Ghost Town are forever lost to progress. The conversion of the Silver Dollar Saloon to a shooting gallery, Hunters Paradise shooting gallery to Panda Express and the original Berry Stand, moved several times with its last location now occupied by the Silver Bullet station.\\r\\nWhat is left of Ghost Town today was based on Calico ghost town and other real ghost towns in the Western United States such as Prescott, Arizona. Walter Knott inherited his uncle's silver mill and land, then bought more of the actual Calico ghost town in 1951 and developed it. In 1966, he donated that property to the corporate-municipal County of San Bernardino which then made the town of Calico, California into a public historic park, for which it charged an entrance/parking fee. See 'History?ÿ Ghost Town?ÿ Calico' section above.\\r\\nWild Water Wilderness is a section of Ghost Town that features two major rides: the Bigfoot Rapids river rafting adventure, and Pony Express, a horse themed family roller coaster installed in 2008. Nearby Bigfoot Rapids is Rapids Trader, a small merchandise stand. It is also home to Mystery Lodge, a multimedia show based on an Expo 86 pavilion featuring a Native American storyteller.\\r\\nFiesta Village was built in 1969 with a pop-culture Mexican theme. It was the second area constructed after the completion of Ghost Town. Stores like Casa California, restaurants like Pancho's Tacos, La Papa Loca, and La Victoria Cantina, games like Shoot If Yucan, and the themed rides like La Revoluci܇n, Jaguar!, and Montezooma's Revenge, along with the former attraction Tampico Tumbler, all contribute to the Mexican and Aztec theme of the area. In 2013 colorful string lights were added for the summer season.\\r\\nBoardwalk Games include physical challenges such as a rock wall, soccer, basketball and a rope ladder crawl. A variety of traditional pitch three balls and win a prize type games, such as squirt gun into clowns mouth, knock off milk bottles, pitch a quarter onto a plate are pitched by hawkers along the Boardwalk Games midway. In September 2012, Perilous Plunge closed for an expansion of the Boardwalk. Perilous Plunge was noticeably known as one of Knott's major thrill rides. The boardwalk reopened after a year transformation with two flat rides and a new family roller coaster taking the spot of Perilous Plunge. The Boomerang roller coaster also got repainted with a new vibrant green and yellow color scheme. The world's largest Johnny Rockets restaurant franchise is located at Knott's Boardwalk, featuring over 5,900 square feet (550?m2) of indoor dining space for more than 260 guests.\\r\\nCamp Snoopy is home to the park's family and children's rides, with many of the rides and attractions being built specifically for children and guests who cannot ride the park's more aggressive attractions. Its theme is Charles M. Schulz' \\"Peanuts\\" comic strip characters. Snoopy has been the mascot of Knott's Berry Farm since 1983, and the characters can now be seen at all of Cedar Fair's parks, except Gilroy Gardens, which is managed by Cedar Fair and owned by the city of Gilroy. The 14 rides include a mini roller coaster called the Timberline Twister, a mini-scrambler called the Log Peeler, a Zamperla Rockin' Tug called Lucy's Tugboat, and a steel spinning roller coaster called Sierra Sidewinder. Snoopy Bounce is a small attraction for kids. However, it is not considered a ride at the park. For guests who cannot ride the park's more aggressive and thrilled rides, Camp Snoopy contains a good number of rides for guests of all ages including infants, children, and seniors. With the exception of Sierra Sidewinder and Timberline Twister, the rides are relativity tame and not aggressive.\\r\\nKnott's Berry Farm also built the Mall of America's indoor theme park, which itself was originally called Camp Snoopy. (In fact, Charles M. Schulz hailed from St. Paul.) However, today the park is no longer affiliated with Knott's or Cedar Fair, and is now called Nickelodeon Universe.\\r\\nOn November 22, 2013, Knott's Berry Farm announced major improvements in the area of Camp Snoopy. Camp Snoopy will receive a makeover as the section is approaching its 30th anniversary. In summer 2014, Knott's Berry Farm will open up new rides in Camp Snoopy.[17]\\r\\nThe 2?ft (610?mm) narrow gauge[43] Grand Sierra Scenic Railroad takes guest on a four-minute train ride through the reflection lake. The ride was made shorter with the construction of Silver Bullet.\\r\\nLocated next to the Bottle House in Ghost Town, Indian Trails is a small area sandwiched between Camp Snoopy, Ghost Town, and Fiesta Village, showcasing Native American art, crafts, and dance. One ride is located in this area. It is called Butterfield Stagecoach which is a family ride where an actual stagecoach take guest on a circular ride through Fiesta Village and Camp Snoopy. It is one of the original rides at the park. The ride was developed directly by the park and it opened in 1949.\\r\\nMany of the original attractions are outside the gates of the current-day theme park along Grand Ave. at the California Marketplace, mostly things which would no longer be considered interesting to today's audience, or things which were merely there for decoration. Near the restrooms behind Berry Place are the waterfall overshooting the water wheel and historic gristmill grindstone, a replica of George Washington's Mount Vernon estate fireplace hearth, and what remains of the visible beehive. Some attractions still exist, but have been incorporated into backstage areas, such as the Rock Garden, now an employee smoking area. Other attractions have been removed, such as the historic volcano, and the cross-section of giant sequoia with age rings denoting historic events such as Christopher Columbus visiting America.\\r\\nThe east side of the property, divided by Beach Blvd., features the main parking lot, Knott's Soak City a seasonal water park that requires separate admission, the picnic grounds rental areas, complementary admission to Independence Hall and gift shop, and the Church of Reflections which was moved outside the theme park in 2004 and held non-denominational Sunday services until 2010, but is still used for wedding ceremonies. A tunnel and pedestrian underpass beneath Beach Blvd. connects the main parking lot to the shops, restaurants and theme park.\\r\\nFor Halloween Haunt in 2016, Knott's Berry Farm introduced FearVR: 5150, a virtual reality attraction that was met with controversy from the mental health community regarding the negative portrayal of mental illness.[46] The ten-minute-long attraction immersed guests inside of a chaotic mental hospital haunted by a supernatural central character named Katie and zombie-like patients.[47] The initial controversy came from the attraction's name, with 5150 referring to the California law that allows a law enforcement officer or clinician to involuntarily commit a person suspected of having a mental illness and determined \\"a danger to themselves or others\\". The backlash was focused on Cedar Fair's use of painful experiences suffered by those dealing with mental illness and to have it \\"transmogrified into spooky entertainment\\".[46] In response, Cedar Fair removed \\"5150\\" from the name, and after continued opposition, permanently closed the attraction on September 28, 2016, only six days after its debut.[48][49] A petition was signed by more than 2,000 people hoping Cedar Fair would bring it back, with the petition's organizer stating that Cedar Fair shouldn't be \\"forced to shut down an attraction based on the words of people who had not even experienced the attraction\\".[50]\\r\\nKnott's Soak City is Knott's Berry Farm's water park. It opened in 1999 as Soak City U.S.A. It requires separate admission from Knott's Berry Farm.\\r\\nFast Lane is Knott's Berry Farm's virtual queue system. For an extra fee, visitors get a wrist band that enables them to get to the front of the line on some of the most popular attractions without queuing.\\r\\nThe J.M. Smucker Company continues to sell the jam and preserves made famous by the Knott family; however, other products such as the syrups have been discontinued due to low demand.[51]\\r\\nIn November 2013, Knott's Berry Farm began selling their \\"Berry Market\\" brand of preserves at the park. The Berry Market brand is all-natural and uses the Knott family's original recipe. They are unable to use \\"Knott's\\" on the label, since Smucker's owns the rights to the name.\\r\\nKnott's Berry Farm can easily be accessed by public transportation. Service is available by both Los Angeles Metro and the Orange County Transportation Authority.[52] Bus routes serving the park include Metro Express Line 460 which provides direct express service between Downtown Los Angeles and Disneyland and OCTA bus routes 29 and 38.[53]","input":"How many employees does knotts berry farm have?"},{"output":"August 1979","context":"A hockey helmet is worn by players of ice hockey, inline hockey, and bandy to help protect the head from potential injury when hit by the puck, sticks, skates, boards, other players, or the ice.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nHockey helmets grip the head from inside by cupping the back of head, or the occipital protuberance. Helmet manufacturers will have a chart that relates their helmet sizes to head measurements.\\r\\nMost helmets have tool-free adjustments, but on older models, the helmet size is adjusted by loosening the screws on the side to slide the front portion forward or back.\\r\\nThe shell of a hockey helmet is generally made of a substance called vinyl nitrile that disperses force from the point of contact, while the liner may be made of either vinyl nitrile foam, expanded polypropylene foam, or other material to absorb the energy, to reduce the chances of concussion.[1]\\r\\nThe first player to regularly wear a helmet for protective purposes was George Owen, who played for the Boston Bruins in 1928ÿ29. In 1927, Barney Stanley presented a prototype of a helmet at the NHL's annual meeting. It was quickly rejected.\\r\\nHelmets appeared after the Ace BaileyÿEddie Shore incident on December 12, 1933, as a result of which Bailey almost died and Shore suffered a severe head injury. After that, Art Ross engineered a new helmet design and when the Boston Bruins took to the ice in a game against the Ottawa Senators, most of the players donned the new helmet. Most Bruins players didn't wear the helmet after the game, with the exception of Eddie Shore, who wore it the rest of his career. In the 1930s, the Toronto Maple Leafs players were ordered to add helmets to their equipment. A few minutes into the first game with the new helmets, the popular King Clancy famously flung his off. The helmets were generally unpopular with fans, media, and other players. A few players, such as Des Smith, Bill Mosienko, Dit Clapper, and Don Gallinger continued to don helmets.\\r\\nDuring the Original Six era, Maurice Richard and Elmer Lach briefly wore helmets. Jack Crawford wore a helmet to hide his bald head and Charlie Burns wearing one to protect the metal plates in his head from an injury incurred in playing junior ice hockey, predating his NHL career.\\r\\nThe death of Bill Masterton from a brain injury in a January 13, 1968 in a game between the Minnesota North Stars and Oakland Seals started to change perceptions surrounding helmets.[2] Helmet use began to gradually increase during the 1970s, with Ted Green being the first Bruins player since Shore to wear one as a result of his NHL career, for the 1970-71 NHL season and onwards for the same reason that Charlie Burns had worn a helmet, until Green's retirement from pro hockey in 1979. The 1972 Summit Series showcased an entirely helmet clad Soviet Union team, with Paul Henderson, Stan Mikita, and Red Berenson being the only Canadians to sport a helmet. Usage increased to the point that 70% of NHL players were wearing them by 1979.[3]\\r\\nIn August 1979, then President of the National Hockey League (NHL), John Ziegler, announced that protective helmets would become mandatory for incoming players in the NHL. \\"The introduction of the helmet rule will be an additional safety factor,\\" he said. The rule allowed players who signed professional contracts prior to June 1, 1979 to continue to not wear a helmet provided a liability waiver was signed, if they so desired. The last player to play without a helmet was Craig MacTavish, who played his final game during the 1996ÿ97 season for the St. Louis Blues.\\r\\nA visor or shield in ice hockey is a device attached to the front of a helmet to reduce potential of injury to the face. Visors cover the upper half of the face, while full face shields cover the entire face. A series of eye injuries, most notably that to Bruce Fogarty,[citation needed] have led to a call from many to enforce their wearing. As of 2015[update], 89% of NHL players wear visors.[4] Many other leagues around the world mandate the use of visors. Visors and shields, made of a high impact-resistant plastic, offer better overall vision than the wire cages available, which can obscure vision in certain areas. The face shield provides excellent straight ahead and peripheral vision, but does not provide as good air flow as a cage.\\r\\nThe American Hockey League, the top minor league in North America required all players to wear a visor prior to the start of the 2006ÿ07 season. The NHL \\"strongly recommends\\" the use of visors. The NHL mandated visors in 2013, with an exception for players having 25 games experience.[5]\\r\\nThe hockey visor was first invented by Kenneth William Clay when he lost vision in his left eye to a high stick while playing for the Vanderhoof Bears. After a month in hospital in Vancouver, Clay created the first documented clear face shield in January 1964. The invention caused quite a stir, with announcers calling it a \\"fish bowl\\" and a \\"wrap-around windshield\\". While the original shield and helmet were lost in the fire that consumed the Vanderhoof Arena a few years later, the newspaper clippings still attest to the dates and facts.[6]\\r\\nA cage in ice hockey is a device attached to the front of a helmet to reduce potential of injury to the face. It consists of a metal or composite mesh that covers the entire face, although some half cages do exist (to protect the eyes while allowing full airflow). The bars, or cage, are spaced far enough apart to allow seeing through to the action but are close enough to stop pucks and sticks from getting through to injure the face.\\r\\nSome manufacturers now offer the best of both designsa plastic face shield to protect the eyes and upper part of the face, and a cage to cover the lower jaw and to add ventilation. Full facial protection is mandatory in many amateur leagues and in North America, full face cages, full shields, or shield and cage combination are mandatory in high school hockey, college hockey, and for all players under the age of 18.\\r\\nIn 2002, the British Journal of Sports Medicine published a study identifying the protection offered against concussions between the half-face shield and the full-face shield. The use of a full-face shield compared with half-face shield significantly reduced the playing time lost because of concussion, suggesting that concussion severity may be reduced by the use of a full-face shield.[7]","input":"When did helmets become mandatory in the nhl?"},{"output":"Enterprise Radio Network","context":"Sports radio (or sports talk radio) is a radio format devoted entirely to discussion and broadcasting of sporting events. A widespread programming genre that has a narrow audience appeal,[1] sports radio is characterized by an often-boisterous on-air style and extensive debate and analysis by both hosts and callers. Many sports talk stations also carry play-by-play of local sports teams as part of their regular programming. Hosted by Bill Mazer, the first sports talk radio show in history launched in March 1964 on New York's WNBC (AM).[2]\\r\\nSoon after WNBC launched its program, in 1965 Seton Hall University's radio station, WSOU, started Hall Line, a call-in sports radio talk show that focuses on Seton Hall basketball. Having celebrated its 50th anniversary on air during the 2015ÿ2016 season, Hall Line, which broadcasts to central and northern New Jersey as well as all five boroughs of New York, is the oldest and longest running sports talk call-in show in the NY-NJ Metropolitan area, and is believed to be the oldest in the nation.[3]\\r\\nEnterprise Radio Network became the first national all-sports network, operating out of Avon, Connecticut, from New Year's Day 1981 through late September of that year before going out of business. ER had two channels, one for talk and a second for updates and play-by-play. ER's talk lineup included current New York Yankees voice John Sterling, New York Mets radio host Ed Coleman and former big-league pitcher Bill Denehy.\\r\\nSports talk is available in local, network and syndicated forms, is available in multiple languages, and is carried in multiple forms on both major North American satellite radio networks. In the United States, most sports talk-formatted radio stations air syndicated programming from ESPN Radio, SB Nation Radio, Sports Byline USA, Fox Sports Radio, CBS Sports Radio, or NBC Sports Radio, while in the Spanish language, ESPN Deportes Radio is the largest current network. In contrast, Canadian sports talk stations may carry a national brand (such as TSN Radio or Sportsnet Radio) but carry mostly local programming, with American-based shows filling in gaps. Compared to other formats, sports radio is not as popular on Internet radio; as a live and interactive format, it does not lend itself well to voice-tracking or automation (thus raising the cost and required labor to keep a station running 24/7), and most sports leagues place their radio broadcasts behind a paywall or provide their broadcasts directly to the consumer, though sports podcasting is a popular alternative to address this problem.\\r\\nAs with most other radio formats, sports radio uses dayparting. ESPN Radio, for instance, insists that its affiliates carry Mike and Mike in the Morning during morning drive time to provide as much national clearance as possible; in contrast, it carries less prominent programming in the afternoon drive to accommodate local sports talk, as well as in the evening (for its first two decades, rolling score updates aired under the banner of GameNight) to allow stations to break away for local sporting events. Somewhat unusually for radio, the late-night and overnight hosts have more prominence on a sports talk network, due to a near-complete lack of local preemption; Sports Byline USA, for instance, only operates overnights.\\r\\nSports radio stations typically depend on drawing an audience that fits advertiser-friendly key demographics, particularly young men with the disposable income to invest in sports fandom, since the format does not have the broad appeal to reach a critical mass in the general public. Prominent sports radio stations typically get their greatest listenership from live play-by-play of local major professional sports league or college sports franchises; less prominent stations (especially on the AM dial) may not have this option because of poorer (or for daytime-only stations, non-existent) nighttime signals and smaller budgets for rights fees.\\r\\n88.9 Brila FM: Sports Radio 88.9 Brila FM, owned by Brila Broadcasting Services, is Nigeria's first sports radio station and was launched in 2002.[4]\\r\\nDZSR Sports Radio 918?kHz is the first and only sports radio station owned by the Philippine Broadcasting Service.\\r\\nIn 2009, Detroit's \\"97.1 The Ticket\\" WXYT-FM, thanks to the surprising time slot dominance of shows like Valenti and Foster, in addition to holding the play-by-play rights for the Detroit Tigers, Detroit Red Wings, Detroit Lions and the Detroit Pistons, became the USA's only sports talk radio station to be the highest rated station in their market, according to Portable People Meter rankings. The station relocated to the FM dial in October 2007 after existing on the AM dial for seven years prior, replacing a Free FM \\"hot talk\\" station, WKRK. This ratings success has led to WXYT-FM billing itself as the country's best sports station.\\r\\nWXYT-FM's recent influence has led to CBS Radio installing sports radio stations on the FM dial in Dallas (105.3 The Fan), Boston (98.5 The Sports Hub), Pittsburgh (93.7 The Fan), Washington, DC (106.7 The Fan), Baltimore (105.7 The Fan) and Cleveland (92.3 The Fan), in addition to simulcasting Philadelphia's heritage 610 WIP onto the former WYSP. Other non-CBS stations have also migrated to the FM dial, most notably Clear Channel's KFAN in Minneapolis, Greater Media's WPEN in Pennsylvania and Dispatch Media's WBNS-FM in Columbus, just to name a few.\\r\\nMore recently, a number large number of listeners have begun to make internet radio the primary medium of choice. Major market leaders such as ESPN, NBC, CBS, Yahoo, and Fox have invested in the creation of their own proprietary sports apps for streaming radio distribution on Apple, Android, and Windows devices. Other independent market leaders such as Sports Radio America choose to stream their content through non proprietary apps including Live 365 and Tune In.\\r\\nSortable lists of commercial sports talk radio stations:","input":"What was the first all-sports talk radio station?"},{"output":"a shade of cyan (greenish-blue color)","context":"Robin egg blue, also called eggshell blue, is a shade of cyan (greenish-blue color), approximating the shade of the eggs laid by the American robin.\\r\\nThe first recorded use of robin egg blue as a color name in English was in 1873.[1]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nPale robin egg blue is identical to the following tone of the color robin egg blue displayed on the ISCC-NBS color list: ISCC-NBS Dictionary of Color Names (1955)Color sample of Robin Egg (color sample #162):.\\r\\nTiffany Blue is the trademarked name for the light medium tone of robin egg blue associated with Tiffany & Co., the New York City jewelry company.\\r\\n{{Shades of cyan|robin egg blue","input":"What is the color of a robin egg?"},{"output":"Centerbridge Partners","context":"Pei Wei Asian Diner, LLC, doing business as Pei Wei Asian Kitchen,[1] (/?pe? ?we?/)) is an American restaurant chain serving Pan Asian fare, operating in more than 200 locations in the U.S. and six international locations.

The momentum accelerated in August 2017 after the Unite the Right rally in Charlottesville, Virginia.[1][2][3] The removals were driven by the belief that the monuments glorify white supremacy and memorialize a government whose founding principle was the perpetuation and expansion of slavery.[4][5][6][7][8] Many of those who object to the removals claim that the artifacts are part of the cultural heritage of the United States.[9]\\r\\nThe vast majority of these Confederate monuments were built during the Jim Crow Era (1877-1954) and the African-American Civil Rights Movement (1954ÿ1968) era as a means of intimidating African Americans and reaffirming white supremacy.[10][11][12] The monuments have thus become highly politicized; according to Eleanor Harvey, a senior curator at the Smithsonian American Art Museum and a scholar of Civil War history: \\"If white nationalists and neo-Nazis are now claiming this as part of their heritage, they have essentially co-opted those images and those statues beyond any capacity to neutralize them again\\".[4] According to Stan Deaton, senior historian at the Georgia Historical Society, \\"These laws are the Old South imposing its moral and its political views on us forever more. This is what led to the Civil War, and it still divides us as a country. We have competing visions not only about the future but about the past.\\"[13]\\r\\nMany of the Confederate monuments concerned were built in periods of racial conflict, such as when Jim Crow laws were being introduced in the late 19th century and at the start of the 20th century or during the Civil Rights Movement of the 1950s and 1960s.[a][b] These two periods also coincided with the 50th anniversary and the American Civil War Centennial.[16] The peak in construction of Civil War Monuments occurred between the late 1890s up to 1920, with a second, smaller peak in the late 1950s to mid 1960s.[17]\\r\\nAccording to historian Jane Dailey from University of Chicago, in many cases the purpose of the monuments was not to celebrate the past but rather to promote a \\"white supremacist future\\".[18] Another historian, Karyn Cox, from the University of North Carolina at Charlotte, has written that the monuments are \\"a legacy of the brutally racist Jim Crow era\\".[19] A historian from the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, James Leloudis, stated that \\"The funders and backers of these monuments are very explicit that they are requiring a political education and a legitimacy for the Jim Crow era and the right of white men to rule.\\"[20]\\r\\nAdam Goodheart, Civil War author and director of the Starr Center at Washington College, stated in National Geographic: \\"They're 20th-century artifacts in the sense that a lot of it had to do with a vision of national unity that embraced Southerners as well as Northerners, but importantly still excluded black people.\\"[4]\\r\\nIn an August 2017 statement on the monuments controversy, the American Historical Association (AHA) said that to remove a monument \\"is not to erase history, but rather to alter or call attention to a previous interpretation of history.\\" The AHA noted that most monuments were erected \\"without anything resembling a democratic process,\\" and recommended that it was \\"time to reconsider these decisions.\\" According to the AHA, most Confederate monuments were erected during the late nineteenth and early twentieth century, and this undertaking was \\"part and parcel of the initiation of legally mandated segregation and widespread disenfranchisement across the South.\\" According to the AHA, memorials to the Confederacy erected during this period \\"were intended, in part, to obscure the terrorism required to overthrow Reconstruction, and to intimidate African Americans politically and isolate them from the mainstream of public life.\\" A later wave of monument building coincided with the civil rights movement, and according to the AHA \\"these symbols of white supremacy are still being invoked for similar purposes.\\"[21]\\r\\nAccording to historian Adam Goodheart, the statues were meant to be symbols of white supremacy and the rallying around them by white supremacists will likely hasten their demise.[22] Elijah Anderson, a professor of sociology at Yale University, said the statues \\"really impacts the psyche of black people.\\"[23] Harold Holzer, the director of the Roosevelt House Public Policy Institute at Hunter College, agreed that the statues were designed to belittle African Americans.[24] Dell Upton, chair of the Department of Art History at the University of California, Los Angeles, wrote that \\"the monuments were not intended as public art,\\" but rather were installed \\"as affirmations that the American polity was a white polity,\\" and that because of their explicitly white supremacist intent, their removal from civic spaces was a matter \\"of justice, equity, and civic values.\\"[12] In a 1993 book, author Frank McKenney argued otherwise; These monuments were communal efforts, public art, and social history,\\" he wrote.[25] Ex-soldiers and politicians had difficult time raising funds to erect monuments so the task mostly fell to the women, the mothers widows, and orphans, the bereaved fiancees and sisters of the soldiers who had lost their lives.[26] Many ladies memorial associations were formed in the decades following the end of the Civil War, most of them joining the United Daughters of the Confederacy following its inception in 1894. The women were advised to remember that they were buying art, not metal and stone;[27] The history the monuments celebrated told only one side of the story, howeverone that was \\"openly pro-Confederate,\\" Upton argues. Furthermore, Confederate monuments were erected without the consent or even input of Southern African-Americans, who remembered the Civil War far differently, and who had no interest in honoring those who fought to keep them enslaved.[12] According to Civil War historian Judith Giesberg, professor of history at Villanova University, \\"White supremacy is really what these statues represent.\\"[28]\\r\\nRobert Seigler in his study of Confederate monuments in South Carolina found that out of the over one hundred and seventy that he documented, only five monuments were found dedicated to the African Americans who had been used by the Confederacy working on fortifications, and had served as musicians, teamsters, cooks, servants, and in other capacities, four of those were to slaves and one to a musician, Henry Brown.[29]\\r\\nEric Foner, a historian of the Civil War and biographer of Lincoln, argued that more statues of African-Americans like Nat Turner should be constructed.[23] Alfred Brophy, a professor of law at the University of Alabama, argued the removal of the Confederate statues \\"facilitates forgetting\\", although these statues were \\"re-inscribed images of white supremacy\\". Brophy also stated that the Lee statue in Charlottesville should be removed.[23]\\r\\nThe removals were marked by events in Louisiana and Virginia within the span of two years. In Louisiana, after the Charleston church shooting of 2015, the city of New Orleans removed its Confederate memorials two years later.[31] A few months later, in August 2017, a state of emergency was declared in Virginia after a Unite the Right rally against the removal of the Robert Edward Lee statue in Charlottesville turned violent.[32]\\r\\nOther events followed across the United States. In Baltimore, for example, the city's Confederate statues were removed on the night of August 15ÿ16, 2017. Mayor Catherine Pugh said that she ordered the overnight removals to preserve public safety.[33][34] Similarly, in Lexington, Kentucky, Mayor Jim Gray asked the city council on August 16, 2017 to approve the relocation of two statues from a courthouse.[35][36] A different event occurred in Durham, North Carolina, where several protesters toppled the Confederate Soldiers Monument outside the Old Durham County Courthouse on August 15, 2017. Eight activists were arrested in connection with the illegal action.[37]\\r\\nIn Alabama (2017), Mississippi (2004), North Carolina (2015), South Carolina (2000), Tennessee (2016), and Virginia (1902), state laws impede the removal or alteration of monuments. Attempts to repeal these laws have not yet (2017) been successful. Alabama's law, the Alabama Memorial Preservation Act, was passed in May 2017, North Carolina's law in 2015.[38] Tennessee passed its Tennessee Heritage Protection Act in 2016; it requires a ? majority of the Tennessee Historical Commission to rename, remove, or relocate any public statue, monument, or memorial.[39]\\r\\nThe removal of the Confederate flag from the South Carolina capitol required a 2/3 vote of both houses of the legislature.[40]\\r\\nA 2017 Reuters poll found that 54% of American adults stated that the monuments should remain in all public spaces, and 27% said they should be removed, while 19% said they were unsure. The results were split along racial and political lines, with Republicans and whites preferring to keep the monuments in place, while Democrats and minorities preferring their removal.[41][42] Another 2017 poll, by HuffPost/YouGov, found that 33% of respondents favored removal while 48% were opposed, with roughly 18% unsure about removal.[43][44]\\r\\nAn August, 2017 meeting of the Florida League of Mayors was devoted to the topic of what to do with Civil War monuments.[61]\\r\\nTo comply with a 2015 City Council order, New Orleans removed statues of Confederate President Jefferson Davis; Gen. Robert E. Lee, who resigned his U.S Army commission at the time of Virginia's secession and accepted command of the state's military forces; Gen. Pierre G.T. Beauregard, who oversaw the Battle of Fort Sumter; and the Battle of Liberty Place Monument. Court challenges were unsuccessful. The workers who moved the monuments were dressed in bullet-proof vests, helmets, and masks to conceal their identities because of concerns about their safety.[89][90] According to Mayor Landrieu, \\"The original firm we'd hired to remove the monuments backed out after receiving death threats and having one of his cars set ablaze.\\"[91] \\"The city said it was weighing where to display the monuments so they could be 'placed in their proper historical context from a dark period of American history.\\"[92] On May 19, 2017, the Monumental Task Committee,[93] an organization that maintains monuments and plaques across the city, commented on the removal of the statues: \\"Mayor Landrieu and the City Council have stripped New Orleans of nationally recognized historic landmarks. With the removal of four of our century-plus aged landmarks, at 299 years old, New Orleans now heads into our Tricentennial more divided and less historic.\\" Landrieu replied on the same day: \\"These statues are not just stone and metal. They are not just innocent remembrances of a benign history. These monuments purposefully celebrate a fictional, sanitized Confederacy; ignoring the death, ignoring the enslavement, and the terror that it actually stood for.[94]\\r\\nA state law, the Historic Artifact Management and Patriotism Act (2015), prevents local governments from removing or relocating monuments without state permission. In 2017 Governor Roy Cooper asked the North Carolina legislature to repeal the law, saying: \\"I don't pretend to know what it's like for a person of color to pass by one of these monuments and consider that those memorialized in stone and metal did not value my freedom or humanity. Unlike an African-American father, I'll never have to explain to my daughters why there exists an exalted monument for those who wished to keep her and her ancestors in chains.\\"[115] He also asked the Department of Natural and Cultural Resources to \\"determine the cost and logistics of removing Confederate monuments from state property.\\"[116][117]","input":"When was the first civil war statue taken down?"},{"output":"August 2, 1776","context":"The signing of the United States Declaration of Independence occurred primarily on August 2, 1776 at the Pennsylvania State House, Independence Hall in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. The 56 delegates to the Second Continental Congress represented the 13 former colonies which had declared themselves the \\"United States of America,\\" and they endorsed the Declaration of Independence which the Congress had approved on July 4, 1776. The Declaration proclaimed that the former Thirteen Colonies then at war with Great Britain were now a sovereign, independent nation and thus no longer a part of the British Empire. The signers names are grouped by state, with the exception of President of the Continental Congress John Hancock; the states are arranged geographically from north to south.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe final draft of the Declaration was approved by the Continental Congress on July 4, although the date of its signing has long been disputed. Most historians have concluded that it was signed on August 2, 1776, nearly a month after its adoption, and not on July 4 as is commonly believed.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Second Continental Congress adopted the Declaration of Independence on July 4, 1776, with 12 of the 13 colonies voting in favor and New York abstaining. The date that the Declaration was signed has long been the subject of debate. Thomas Jefferson, Benjamin Franklin, and John Adams all wrote that it was signed by Congress on the day when it was adopted on July 4, 1776.[1] That assertion is seemingly confirmed by the signed copy of the Declaration, which is dated July 4. Additional support for the July 4 date is provided by the Journals of Congress, the official public record of the Continental Congress. The proceedings for 1776 were first published in 1777, and the entry for July 4 states that the Declaration was engrossed and signed on that date (the official copy was handwritten).[2]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1796, signer Thomas McKean disputed that the Declaration had been signed on July 4, pointing out that some signers were not present, including several who were not even elected to Congress until after that date.[3] \\"No person signed it on that day nor for many days after\\", he wrote.[4] His claim gained support when the Secret Journals of Congress were published in 1821.[5] The Secret Journals contained two previously unpublished entries about the Declaration.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn July 15, New York's delegates got permission from their convention to agree to the Declaration.[6] The Secret Journals entry for July 19 reads:\\r\\n\\r\\nResolved That the Declaration passed on the 4th be fairly engrossed on parchment with the title and stile of \\"The unanimous declaration of the thirteen united states of America\\" & that the same when engrossed be signed by every member of Congress.[7]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe entry for August 2 states:\\r\\n\\r\\nThe declaration of Independence being engrossed & compared at the table was signed by the Members.[8]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1884, historian Mellen Chamberlain argued that these entries indicated that the famous signed version of the Declaration had been created following the July 19 resolution, and had not been signed by Congress until August 2.[9] Subsequent research has confirmed that many of the signers had not been present in Congress on July 4, and that some delegates may have added their signatures even after August 2.[10] Neither Jefferson nor Adams ever wavered from their belief that the signing ceremony took place on July 4, yet most historians have accepted the argument which David McCullough articulates in his biography of John Adams: \\"No such scene, with all the delegates present, ever occurred at Philadelphia.\\"[11]\\r\\n\\r\\nLegal historian Wilfred Ritz concluded in 1986 that about 34 delegates signed the Declaration on July 4, and that the others signed on or after August 2.[12] Ritz argues that the engrossed copy of the Declaration was signed by Congress on July 4, as Jefferson, Adams, and Franklin had stated, and that it was implausible that all three men had been mistaken.[13] He believes that McKean's testimony was questionable,[14] and that historians had misinterpreted the July 19 resolution. According to Ritz, this resolution did not call for a new document to be created, but rather for the existing one to be given a new title, which was necessary after New York had joined the other 12 states in declaring independence. He reasons that the phrase \\"signed by every member of Congress\\" in the July 19 resolution meant that delegates who had not signed the Declaration on the 4th were now required to do so.[15]\\r\\n\\r\\nFifty-six delegates eventually signed the Declaration of Independence:\\r\\n\\r\\nPresident of Congress\\r\\n\\r\\nNew Hampshire\\r\\n\\r\\nMassachusetts Bay\\r\\n\\r\\nRhode Island and Providence Plantations\\r\\n\\r\\nConnecticut\\r\\n\\r\\nNew York\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nNew Jersey\\r\\n\\r\\nPennsylvania\\r\\n\\r\\nDelaware\\r\\n\\r\\nMaryland\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nVirginia\\r\\n\\r\\nNorth Carolina\\r\\n\\r\\nSouth Carolina\\r\\n\\r\\nGeorgia\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nEight delegates never signed the Declaration, out of about 50 who are thought to have been present in Congress during the voting on independence in early July 1776:[16] John Alsop, George Clinton, John Dickinson, Charles Humphreys, Robert R. Livingston, John Rogers, Thomas Willing, and Henry Wisner.[17] Clinton, Livingston, and Wisner were attending to duties away from Congress when the signing took place. Willing and Humphreys voted against the resolution of independence and were replaced in the Pennsylvania delegation before the August 2 signing. Rogers had voted for the resolution of independence but was no longer a delegate on August 2. Alsop favored reconciliation with Great Britain and so resigned rather than add his name to the document.[18] Dickinson refused to sign, believing the Declaration premature, but he remained in Congress. George Read had voted against the resolution of independence, and Robert Morris had abstainedyet they both signed the Declaration.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe most famous signature on the engrossed copy is that of John Hancock, who presumably signed first as President of Congress.[19] Hancock's large, flamboyant signature became iconic, and John Hancock emerged in the United States as an informal synonym for \\"signature\\".[20] Future presidents Thomas Jefferson and John Adams were among the signatories. Edward Rutledge (age 26) was the youngest signer and Benjamin Franklin (age 70) the oldest.\\r\\n\\r\\nSome delegates were away on business when the Declaration was debated, including William Hooper[22] and Samuel Chase, but they were back in Congress to sign on August 2. Other delegates were present when the Declaration was debated but added their names after August 2, including Lewis Morris, Oliver Wolcott, Thomas McKean, and possibly Elbridge Gerry. Richard Henry Lee and George Wythe were in Virginia during July and August, but returned to Congress and signed the Declaration probably in September and October, respectively.[23]\\r\\n\\r\\nNew delegates joining the Congress were also allowed to sign. Eight men signed the Declaration who did not take seats in Congress until after July 4: Matthew Thornton, William Williams, Benjamin Rush, George Clymer, James Smith, George Taylor, George Ross, and Charles Carroll of Carrollton.[24] Matthew Thornton did not take a seat in Congress until November.[25]  By the time that he signed it, there wasn't any space for his name next to the other New Hampshire delegates, so he placed his signature at the end of the document.[26]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe first published version of the Declaration was the Dunlap broadside. The only names on that version were Congress President John Hancock and Secretary Charles Thomson, and those names were printed rather than signatures. The public did not learn who had signed the engrossed copy until January 18, 1777, when the Congress ordered that an \\"authenticated copy\\" be sent to each of the 13 states, including the names of the signers.[27] This copy is called the Goddard Broadside; it was the first to list all the signers[28] except for Thomas McKean, who may not have signed the Declaration until after the Goddard Broadside was published.  Congress Secretary Charles Thomson did not sign the engrossed copy of the Declaration, and his name doesn't appear on the Goddard Broadside, even though it does appear on the Dunlap broadside.\\r\\n\\r\\nVarious legends emerged years later concerning the signing of the Declaration, when the document had become an important national symbol. In one famous story, John Hancock supposedly said that Congress, having signed the Declaration, must now \\"all hang together\\", and Benjamin Franklin replied: \\"Yes, we must indeed all hang together, or most assuredly we shall all hang separately.\\" The quotation did not appear in print until more than 50 years after Franklin's death.[29]","input":"When was the usa declaration of independence signed?"},{"output":"The Maya civilization","context":"Indigenous peoples of Mexico (Spanish: pueblos indgenas de Mxico), Native Mexicans (Spanish: nativos mexicanos), or Mexican Native Americans (Spanish: nativo america mexicanos), are those who are part of communities that trace their roots back to populations and communities that existed in what is now Mexico prior to the arrival of Europeans.\\r\\nAccording to the National Commission for the Development of Indigenous Peoples (Comisi܇n Nacional para el Desarrollo de los Pueblos Indgenas, or CDI in Spanish) and the INEGI (official census institute), in 2015, 25,694,928 people in Mexico self-identify as being indigenous[3][4] of many different ethnic groups,[5] which constitute 21.5% of Mexico's population.[1][2]\\r\\nIn the second article of its Constitution, Mexico is defined as a \\"pluricultural\\" nation in recognition of the diverse ethnic groups that constitute it and where the indigenous peoples[6] are the original foundation.[7]\\r\\nThe number of indigenous Mexicans is judged using the political criteria found in the 2nd article of the Mexican constitution. The Mexican census does not report racial-ethnicity but only the cultural-ethnicity of indigenous communities that preserve their indigenous languages, traditions, beliefs and cultures.[8]\\r\\nThe category of indigena (indigenous) can be defined narrowly according to linguistic criteria including only persons that speak one of Mexico's 89 indigenous languages, this is the categorization used by the National Mexican Institute of Statistics. It can also be defined broadly to include all persons who self identify as having an indigenous cultural background, whether or not they speak the language of the indigenous group they identify with. This means that the percentage of the Mexican population defined as \\"indigenous\\" varies according to the definition applied; cultural activists have referred to the usage of the narrow definition of the term for census purposes as \\"statistical genocide\\".[9][10]\\r\\nThe indigenous peoples in Mexico have the right of free determination under the second article of the constitution. According to this article the indigenous peoples are granted:\\r\\namongst other rights. Also, the Law of Linguistic Rights of the Indigenous Languages recognizes 89 indigenous languages as \\"national languages\\", which have the same validity as Spanish in all territories where they are spoken.[11] According to the National Institute of Statistics, Geography and Data Processing (INEGI), approximately 5.4% of the population speaks an indigenous language - that is, approximately half of those identified as indigenous.[12] The recognition of indigenous languages and the protection of indigenous cultures is granted not only to the ethnic groups indigenous to modern-day Mexican territory but also to other North American indigenous groups that migrated to Mexico from the United States[13] in the nineteenth century and those who immigrated from Guatemala in the 1980s.[14]\\r\\nThe pre-Columbian civilizations of what now is known as Mexico are usually divided in two regions: Mesoamerica, in reference to the cultural area where several complex civilizations developed before the arrival of the Spanish in the sixteenth century, and Aridoamerica (or simply \\"The North\\")[15] in reference to the arid region north of the Tropic of Cancer where few civilizations developed and was mostly inhabited by nomadic or semi-nomadic groups.[citation needed] Despite the conditions however, it is argued that the Mogollon culture and Peoples successfully established population centers at Casas Grandes and Cuarenta Casas in a vast territory that encompassed northern Chihuahua state and parts of Arizona and New Mexico in the United States.\\r\\nMesoamerica was densely populated by diverse indigenous ethnic groups[15][page?needed][16] which, although sharing common cultural characteristics, spoke different languages and developed unique civilizations.\\r\\nOne of the most influential civilizations that developed in Mesoamerica was the Olmec civilization, sometimes referred to as the \\"Mother Culture of Mesoamerica\\".[16] The later civilization in Teotihuacn reached its peak around 600 AD, when the city became the sixth largest city in the world,[16] whose cultural and theological systems influenced the Toltec and Aztec civilizations in later centuries. Evidence has been found on the existence of multiracial communities or neighborhoods in Teotihuacan (and other large urban areas like Tenochtitlan).[17][18]\\r\\nThe Maya civilization, though also influenced by other Mesoamerican civilizations, developed a vast cultural region in south-east Mexico and northern Central America, while the Zapotec and Mixtec culture dominated the valley of Oaxaca, and the Purpecha in western Mexico.\\r\\nThere is common academic agreement that significant systems of trading existed between the cultures of Mesoamerica, Aridoamerica and the American Southwest, and the architectural remains and artifacts share a commonality of knowledge attributed to this trade network. The routes stretched far into Mesoamerica and reached as far north to ancient communities that included such population centers in the United States such as at Snaketown,[19] Chaco Canyon, and Ridge Ruin near Flagstaff (considered some of the finest artifacts ever located).\\r\\nBy the time of the arrival of the Spanish in central Mexico, many of the diverse ethnic civilizations (with the notable exception of the Tlaxcaltecs and the Purpecha Kingdom of Michoacn) were loosely joined under the Aztec Empire, the last Nahua civilization to flourish in Central Mexico. The capital of the empire, Tenochtitlan, became one of the largest urban centers in the world, with an estimated population of 350,000 inhabitants.[15][page?needed]\\r\\nDuring the conquest of the Aztec Empire, the Spanish conquistadors, vastly outnumbered by indigenous peoples, used the ethnic diversity of the country and exploited the discontentment of the subjugated groups, making important alliances with rivals of the Aztecs.[15][page?needed] While the alliances were decisive to the Europeans' victory, the indigenous peoples were soon subjugated by an equally impressive empire. However, as the Spanish consolidated their rule in what became the viceroyalty of New Spain, the crown recognized the indigenous nobility in Mesoamerica as nobles and kept the existing basic structure of indigenous city-states. Indigenous communities were incorporated as communities under Spanish rule and with the indigenous power structure largely intact.[20]\\r\\nAs part of the Spanish incorporation of indigenous into the colonial system, the friars taught indigenous scribes to write their languages in Latin letters so that there are huge corpus of colonial-era documentation in the Nahuatl language, Mixtec, Zapotec, and Yucatec Maya as well as others. Such a written tradition likely took hold because there was an existing tradition of pictorial writing found in many indigenous codices. Scholars have utilized the colonial-era alphabetic documentation in what is currently called the New Philology to illuminate the colonial experience of Mesoamerican peoples from their own viewpoints.[21]\\r\\nSince Mesoamerican peoples had an existing requirement of labor duty and tribute in the pre-conquest era, Spaniards who were awarded the labor and tribute of particular communities in encomienda could benefit financially. Indigenous officials in their communities were involved in maintaining this system. There was a precipitous decline in indigenous populations due to the spread of European diseases previously unknown in the New World. Pandemics wrought havoc, but indigenous communities recovered with fewer members.[15][page?needed][22][23]\\r\\nWith contact between Europeans, the black slaves that they brought, and indigenous populations, there was intermingling of the groups, with mixed-race castas, particularly mestizos, becoming a component of Spanish cities and to a lesser extent indigenous communities. The Spanish legal structure formally separated what they called the rep~blica de indios (the republic of Indians) from the rep~blica de espa?oles (republic of Spaniards), the latter of which encompassed all those in the Hispanic sphere: Europeans, Africans, and mixed-race castas. Although in many ways indigenous peoples were marginalized in the colonial system,[24] the paternalistic structure of colonial rule supported the continued existence and structure of indigenous communities. The Spanish crown recognized the existing ruling group, gave protection to the land holdings of indigenous communities, and communities' and individuals had access to the Spanish legal system.[22][23][25] In practice in central Mexico this meant that until the nineteenth-century liberal reform that eliminated the corporate status of indigenous communities, indigenous communities had a protected status.\\r\\nAlthough the crown recognized the political structures and the ruling elites in the civil sphere, in the religious sphere indigenous men were banned from the Christian priesthood, following an early Franciscan experiment that included fray Bernardino de Sahag~n at the Colegio de Santa Cruz Tlatelolco to train such a group. Mendicants of the Franciscan, Dominican, and Augustinian orders initially evangelized indigenous in their own communities in what is often called the \\"spiritual conquest\\".[26] Later on the northern frontiers where nomadic indigenous groups had no fixed settlements, the Spanish created missions and settled indigenous populations in these complexes. The Jesuits were prominent in this enterprise until their expulsion from Spanish America in 1767. Catholicism with particular local aspects was the only permissible religion in the colonial era.\\r\\nAs the New Spain became independent from Spain, the new country was named after its capital city, Mexico City. Mexico declared the abolition of black slavery in 1829 and the equality of all citizens under the law. Indigenous communities continued to have rights as corporations to maintain land holdings until the liberal Reforma. Some indigenous individuals integrated into the Mexican society, like Benito Jurez of Zapotec ethnicity, the first indigenous president of a country in the New World.[27] As a political liberal, however, Jurez supported the removal of protections of indigenous community corporate land holding.\\r\\nThe greatest change came about as a result of the Mexican Revolution, a violent social and cultural movement that defined 20th century Mexico. The Revolution produced a national sentiment that the indigenous peoples were the foundation of Mexican society. Several prominent artists promoted the \\"Indigenous Sentiment\\" (sentimiento indigenista) of the country, including Frida Kahlo, and Diego Rivera. Throughout the twentieth century, the government established bilingual education in certain indigenous communities and published free bilingual textbooks.[28] Some states of the federation appropriated an indigenous inheritance in order to reinforce their identity.[29]\\r\\nIn spite of the official recognition of the indigenous peoples, the economic underdevelopment of the communities, accentuated by the crises of the 1980s and 1990s, has not allowed for the social and cultural development of most indigenous communities.[30] Thousands of indigenous Mexicans have emigrated to urban centers in Mexico as well as in the United States. In Los Angeles, for example, the Mexican government has established electronic access to some of the consular services provided in Spanish as well as Zapotec and Mixe.[31] Some of the Maya peoples of Chiapas have revolted, demanding better social and economic opportunities, requests voiced by the EZLN.[citation needed]\\r\\nThe Chiapas conflict of 1994 led to collaboration between the Mexican government and the Zapatista Army of National Liberation, an indigenous political group.[32] This large movement generated international media attention and united many indigenous groups.[33] In 1996 the San Andrs Larrinzar Accords were negotiated between the Zapatista Army of National Liberation and the Mexican government.[32] The San Andres accords were the first time that indigenous rights were acknowledged by the Mexican government.[32]\\r\\nThe government has made certain legislative changes to promote the development of the rural and indigenous communities and the preservation and promotion of their languages. The second article of the Constitution was modified to grant them the right of self-determination and requires state governments to promote and ensure the economic development of the indigenous communities as well as the preservation of their languages and traditions.\\r\\nThe Spanish crown had legal protections of indigenous as individuals as well as their communities, including establishing a separate General Indian Court.[34] The mid-nineteenth century liberal reform removed those, so that there was equality of individuals before Mexican law.[35] The creation of a national identity not linked to racial or ethnic identity was an aim of Mexican liberalism.\\r\\nIn the late twentieth century there has been a push for indigenous rights and a recognition of indigenous cultural identity. According to the constitutional reform of 2001, the following rights of indigenous peoples are recognized:[36]\\r\\nDuring the early colonial era in central Mexico, Spaniards were more interested in having access to indigenous labor than in ownership of land. The institution of the encomienda, a crown grant of the labor of particular indigenous communities to individuals was a key element of the imposition of Spanish rule, with the land tenure of indigenous communities continuing largely in its preconquest form. The Spanish crown initially kept intact the indigenous sociopolitical system of local rulers and land tenure, with the Spanish conquest of the Aztec Empire eliminating the superstructure of rule, replacing it with Spanish.[37][38] The crown had several concerns about the encomienda. First was that the holders of encomiendas, called encomenderos were becoming too powerful, essentially a seigneurial group that might challenge crown power (as shown in the conspiracy by conqueror Hernn Corts's legitimate son and heir). Second was that the encomenderos were monopolizing indigenous labor to the exclusion of newly arriving Spaniards. And third, the crown was concerned about the damage to the indigenous vassals of the crown and their communities by the institution. Through the New Laws of 1542, the crown sought to phase out the encomienda and replace it with another crown mechanism of forced indigenous labor, known as the repartimiento. Indigenous labor was no longer monopolized by a small group of privileged encomienda holders, but rather labor was apportioned to a larger group of Spaniards. Natives performed low-paid or underpaid labor for a certain number of weeks or months on Spanish enterprises.[39]\\r\\nThe land of indigenous peoples is used for material reasons as well as spiritual reasons. Religious, cultural, social, spiritual, and other events relating to their identity are also tied to the land.[40] Indigenous people use collective property so that the aforementioned services that the land provides are available to the entire community and future generations.[40] This was a stark contrast to the viewpoints of colonists that saw the land purely in an economic way where land could be transferred between individuals.[40] Once the land of the indigenous people and therefore their livelihood was taken from them, they became dependent on those that had land and power.[40] Additionally, the spiritual services that the land provided were no longer available and caused a deterioration of indigenous groups and cultures.[40]\\r\\nThe Spanish legal system divided racial groups into two basic categories, the Rep~blica de Espa?oles, consisting of all non-indigenous but initially white Spaniards and black Africans, and the Rep~blica de Indios. As there was greater intermixture and resulting offspring, a more formal casta system came into place, with specific terms for different racial mixtures. This system gave more political and social power to Spaniards so that Indigenous people and blacks could be kept in lower positions.[41] When the ethnic origins of the person were not known, phenotypic characteristics were relied upon to determine the status of the individual.[41] Those that were in lower statuses had to pay more to the crown.[41]\\r\\nWhen Mexico gained independence in 1821, the casta system was eliminated as a legal structure, but racial divides remained. White Mexican argued about what the solution was to the Indian Problem, that is indigenous who continued to live in communities and were not integrated politically or socially as citizens of the new republic.[42] The Mexican constitution of 1824 has several articles pertaining to indigenous peoples. The second article of the constitution of Mexico recognizes and enforces the right of indigenous peoples and communities to self-determination and therefore their autonomy to:\\r\\nV. Preserve and improve their habitat as well as preserve the integrity of their lands in accordance with this constitution. VI. Be entitled to the estate and land property modalities established by this constitution and its derived legislation, to all private property rights and communal property rights as well as to use and enjoy in a preferential way all the natural resources located at the places which the communities live in, except those defined as strategic areas according to the constitution. The communities shall be authorized to associate with each other in order to achieve such goals.[43]\\r\\nUnder the Mexican government, some indigenous people had land rights under ejido and agrarian communities.[44] Under ejidos, indigenous communities have usufruct rights of the land. Indigenous communities choose to do this when they do not have the legal evidence to claim the land. In 1992, shifts were made to the economic structure and ejidos could now be partitioned and sold. For this to happen, the PROCEDE program was established. The PROCEDE program surveyed, mapped, and verified the ejido lands. This privatization of land undermined the economic base of the indigenous communities much like the taking of their land during colonization.[44]\\r\\nThe history of linguistic rights in Mexico began when Spanish first made contact with Indigenous Languages during the colonial period.[32] During the early sixteenth century mestizaje, mixing of races of culture, led to mixing of languages as well.[32] The Spanish Crown proclaimed Spanish to be the language of the empire; however, indigenous languages were used during conversion of individuals to Catholicism.[32] Because of this, indigenous languages were more widespread than Spanish from 1523-1581.[32] During the late sixteenth century, the status of Spanish language increased.[32]\\r\\nBy the seventeenth century, the elite minority were Spanish speakers.[32] After independence in 1821 there was a shift to Spanish to legitimize the Mexican Spanish created by the Mexican criollos.[32] Since then, indigenous tongues were discriminated against and seen as not modern.[45] The nineteenth century brought with it programs to provide bilingual education at primary levels where they would eventually transition to Spanish only education.[32] Linguistic uniformity was sought out to strengthen national identity; however, this left indigenous languages out of power structures.[32]\\r\\nThe Chiapas conflict of 1994 led to collaboration between the Mexican government and the Zapatista Army of National Liberation, an indigenous political group.[32] In 1996 the San Andrs Larrinzar Accords were negotiated between the Zapatista Army of National Liberation and the Mexican government.[32] The San Andres accords were the first time that indigenous rights were acknowledged by the Mexican government.[32] The San Andres Accords did not explicitly state language but language was involved in matters involving culture and education.[32]\\r\\nIn 2001, the constitution of Mexico was changed to acknowledge indigenous peoples and grant them protection. The second article of the constitution of Mexico recognizes and enforces the right of indigenous peoples and communities to self-determination and therefore their autonomy to:\\r\\nIn 2003, the General Law of Linguistic Rights of the Indigenous Peoples explicitly stated the protection of individual and collective linguistic rights of indigenous peoples.[46] The final section also sanctioned the creation of a National Institute for Indigenous Languages (INALI) whose purpose is to promote the growth of indigenous languages in Mexico.[46]\\r\\nHowever, there has been a lack of enforcement of the law. For example, the General Law on Linguistic Rights of Indigenous People guarantees the right to a trial in the language of indigenous peoples with someone who understands their culture.[46] According to the National Human Rights Commission (Mexico), Mexico has not abided by this law.[45] Examples of this include Jacinta Francisca Marcial, an indigenous woman who was imprisoned for kidnapping in 2006.[45] After three years and the assistance of Amnesty International she was released for lack of evidence.[45]\\r\\nAdditionally, the General Law on Linguistics also guarantees bilingual and intercultural education.[46] However, it is a common complaint that teachers do not know the indigenous language or do not prioritize teaching the indigenous language.[45] In fact, some studies argue that formal education has decreased the prevalence of indigenous languages.[45]\\r\\nSome parents do not teach their children their indigenous language and some children refuse to learn their indigenous language for fear that they will be discriminated against. Scholars argue that there needs to be a social change to elevate the status of indigenous languages in order for the law to be withheld so that indigenous languages are protected.[45]\\r\\nIndigenous women are often taken advantage of because they are women, indigenous, and often poor.[47] Indigenous culture has been used as a pretext for Mexican government to enact laws that deny human rights to women such as the right to own land.[47] Additionally, violence against women has been regarded by the Mexican government as a cultural practice.[47] The government has enforced impunity of the exploitation of indigenous women by its own government[clarification needed] including by the military.[47]\\r\\nThe EZLN accepted a Revolutionary Law for Women on March 8, 1993.[47] The law is not fully enforced but shows solidarity between the indigenous movement and women.[47] The Mexican government has increased militarization of indigenous areas which makes women more susceptible to harassment through military abuses.[47]\\r\\nIndigenous women are forming many organizations to support each other, improve their position in society, and gain financial independence.[47] Indigenous women use national and international legislation to support their claims that go against cultural norms such as domestic violence.[48]\\r\\nReproductive justice is an important issue to indigenous communities because there is a lack of development in these areas and is less access to maternal care. Conditional cash transfer programs such as Oportunidades have been used to encourage indigenous women to seek formal health care.[49]\\r\\nThe number of indigenous Mexicans is judged using the political criteria found in the 2nd article of the Mexican constitution. The Mexican census does not report racial-ethnicity but only the cultural-ethnicity of indigenous communities that preserve their indigenous languages, traditions, beliefs, and cultures.[8]\\r\\nThe Law of Linguistic Rights of the Indigenous Languages recognizes 62 indigenous languages as \\"national languages\\" which have the same validity as Spanish in all territories where they are spoken.[11] According to the National Institute of Statistics, Geography and Data Processing (INEGI), approximately 6.7% of the population speaks an indigenous language.[50] That is, less than half of those identified as indigenous.[51] 6,695,228 people 5 years or older were tallied as indigenous-language speakers in the 2010 census, an increase of about 650,000 from the 2000 census. In 2000, 6,044,547 people 5 years or older spoke an indigenous language.[52]\\r\\nIn previous censuses, information on the indigenous speaking population five years of age and older was obtained from the Mexican people. However, in the 2010 census, this approach was changed and the Government also began to collect data on people 3 years and older because from the age of 3, children are able to communicate verbally. With this new approach, it was determined that there were 6,913,362 people 3 years of age or more who spoke an indigenous language (218,000 children 3 and 4 four years of age fell into this category), accounting for 6.6% of the total population. The population of children aged 0 to 2 years in homes where the head of household or a spouse spoke an indigenous language was 678 954. The indigenous language speaking population has been increasing in absolute numbers for decades, but have nonetheless been falling in proportion to the national population.[51]\\r\\nThe recognition of indigenous languages and the protection of indigenous cultures is granted not only to the ethnic groups indigenous to modern-day Mexican territory, but also to other North American indigenous groups that migrated to Mexico from the United States[13] in the nineteenth century and those who immigrated from Guatemala in the 1980s.[1][2][14]\\r\\nThe five states with the largest indigenous-language-speaking populations are:\\r\\nThese five states accounted for 61.1% of all indigenous language speakers in Mexico. Most indigenous Mexicans do not speak their own languages and speak only Spanish. This is reflected in these five states' populations. Although Oaxaca, Chiapas, Veracruz, Puebla, and Yucatn have 34.2%, 27.2%, 9.4%, 11.7%, and 30.3% of their populations speaking an indigenous language, these states' indigenous populations are 65.73%, 36.15%, 29.25%, 35.28%, 65.4% respectively.[51]\\r\\nAccording to the National Commission for the Development of the Indigenous Peoples (CDI), there were 25,694,928 indigenous people reported in Mexico in 2015,[1][2] which constitutes 21.5% of the population of Mexico. This is a significant increase from the 2010 census, in which indigenous Mexicans accounted for 14.9% of the population, and numbered 15,700,000[53] Most indigenous communities have a degree of financial, political autonomy under the legislation of \\"usos y costumbres\\", which allows them to regulate internal issues under customary law.\\r\\nThe indigenous population of Mexico has in recent decades increased both in absolute numbers as-well as a percentage of the population. This is largely due to increased self-identification as indigenous, as-well as indigenous women having higher birth rates as compared to the Mexican average.[2][12][54][55] Indigenous peoples are more likely to live in more rural areas, than the Mexican average, but many do reside in urban or suburban areas, particularly, in the central states of Mexico, Puebla, Tlaxcala, the Federal District and the Yucatn Peninsula.\\r\\nAccording to the CDI, the states with the greatest percentage of indigenous population are:[56] Yucatn, with 65.40%, Quintana Roo with 44.44% and Campeche with 44.54% of the population being indigenous, most of them Maya; Oaxaca with 65.73% of the population, the most numerous groups being the Mixtec and Zapotec peoples; Chiapas has 36.15%, the majority being Tzeltal and Tzotzil Maya; Hidalgo with 36.21%, the majority being Otomi; Puebla with 35.28%, and Guerrero with 33.92%, mostly Nahua people and the states of San Luis Potos and Veracruz both home to a population of 19% indigenous people, mostly from the Totonac, Nahua and Teenek (Huastec) groups.[1][2]\\r\\nThe majority of the indigenous population is concentrated in the central and southern states. According to the CDI, the states with the greatest percentage of indigenous population as of 2015 are:[1][2][51][57]\\r\\nIn 2011 a large scale mitochondrial sequencing in Mexican Americans revealed 85 to 90% of maternal mtDNA lineages are of Native American origin, with the remainder having European (5-7%) or African ancestry (3-5%). Thus the observed frequency of Native American mtDNA in Mexican/Mexican Americans is higher than was expected on the basis of autosomal estimates of Native American admixture for these populations i.e. ~ 30-46%[58]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nGenerally, indigenous Mexicans live more poorly than non-indigenous Mexicans however, social development varies between states, different indigenous ethnicities and between rural and urban areas. In all states indigenous people have higher infant mortality, in some states almost double of the non-indigenous populations.[60]\\r\\nSome indigenous groups, particularly the Yucatec Maya in the Yucatn peninsula[61][62] and some of the Nahua and Otomi peoples in central states have maintained higher levels of development while indigenous peoples in states such as the Guerrero[63] or Michoacn[64] are ranked drastically lower than the average Mexican citizen in these fields. Despite certain indigenous groups such as the Maya or Nahua retaining high levels of development, the general indigenous population lives at a lower level of development than the general population.\\r\\nLiteracy rates are much lower for the indigenous, particularly in the southwestern states of Guerrero and Oaxaca due lack of access to education and a lack of the educational literature available in indigenous languages. Literacy rates are also much lower, with 27% of indigenous children between 6 and 14 being illiterate compared to a national average of 12%.[60] The Mexican government is obligated to provide education in indigenous languages, but many times fails to provide schooling in languages other than Spanish. As a result, many indigenous groups have resorted to creating their own small community educational institutions.\\r\\nThe indigenous population participate in the workforce longer than the national average, starting earlier and continuing longer. A major reason for this is that significant number of the indigenous practice economically under productive agriculture and receive no regular salaries. Indigenous people also have less access to health care.[60]\\r\\n1Number of indigenous peoples that still speak their Indigenous language\\r\\n1Number of indigenous peoples that still speak their Indigenous language\\r\\n2 Includes Opata, Soltec and Papabuco\\r\\n1Number of indigenous peoples that still speak their Indigenous language","input":"Which native civilization lived in the region that is now eastern and southern mexico?"},{"output":"legal act or process by which a non-citizen in a country may acquire citizenship or nationality of that country","context":"Naturalization (or naturalisation) is the legal act or process by which a non-citizen in a country may acquire citizenship or nationality of that country. It may be done by a statute, without any effort on the part of the individual, or it may involve an application and approval by legal authorities. The rules of naturalization vary from country to country and typically include a minimum legal residency requirement, and may specify other requirements such as knowledge of the national dominant language or culture, a promise to obey and uphold that country's laws. An oath or pledge of allegiance is also sometimes required. Some countries also require that the person renounce any other citizenship that they currently hold, forbidding dual citizenship, but whether this renunciation actually causes loss of the person's original citizenship, as seen by the host country and by the original country, will again depend on the laws of the countries involved.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe massive increase in population flux due to globalization and the sharp increase in the numbers of refugees following World War I created a large number of  stateless persons, people who were not citizens of any state. In some rare cases, laws for mass naturalization were passed. As naturalization laws had been designed to cater for the relatively few people who had voluntarily moved from one country to another (expatriates), many western democracies were not ready to naturalize large numbers of people. This included the massive influx of stateless people which followed massive denationalizations and the expulsion of ethnic minorities from newly created nation states in the first part of the 20th century, but they also included the mostly aristocratic Russians who had escaped the 1917 October Revolution and the war communism period, and then the Spanish refugees. As Hannah Arendt pointed out, internment camps became the \\"only nation\\" of such stateless people, since they were often considered \\"undesirable\\" and were stuck in an illegal situation, wherein their country had expelled them or deprived them of their nationality, while they had not been naturalized, thus living in a judicial no man's land.\\r\\n\\r\\nSince World War II, the increase in international migrations created a new category of refugees, most of them economic refugees. For economic, political, humanitarian and pragmatic reasons, many states passed laws allowing a person to acquire their citizenship after birth, such as by marriage to a national ÿ jus matrimonii ÿ or by having ancestors who are nationals of that country, in order to reduce the scope of this category. However, in some countries this system still maintains a large part of the immigrated population in an illegal status, albeit with some massive regularizations, for example, in Spain by Jos Luis Zapatero's government and in Italy by Berlusconi's government.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe People's Republic of China gives citizenship to persons with one or two parents with Chinese nationality who have not taken residence in other countries. The country also gives citizenship to people born on its territory to stateless people who have settled there. Furthermore, individuals may apply for nationality if they have a near relative with Chinese nationality, if they have settled in China, or if they present another legitimate reason.[1] In practice, only few people gain Chinese citizenship; as of 2010, China had only 1,448 naturalised Chinese in total.[2]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe naturalization process starts with a written application. Applicants must submit three copies, written with a ball-point or fountain pen, to national authorities, and to provincial authorities in the Ministry of Public Security and the Public Security Bureau. Applicants must also submit original copies of a foreign passport, a residence permit, a permanent residence permit, and four two-and-a-half inch long pictures. According to the conditions outlined in the Nationality Law of the People's Republic of China, authorities may also require \\"any other material that the authority believes are related to the nationality application\\".[3]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Indian citizenship and nationality law and the Constitution of India provides single citizenship for the entire country. The provisions relating to citizenship at the commencement of the Constitution are contained in Articles 5 to 11 in Part?II of the Constitution of India. Relevant Indian legislation is the Citizenship Act 1955, which has been amended by the Citizenship (Amendment) Act 1986, the Citizenship (Amendment) Act 1992, the Citizenship (Amendment) Act 2003, and the Citizenship (Amendment) Ordinance 2005. The Citizenship (Amendment) Act 2003 received the assent of the President of India on 7 January 2004 and came into force on 3 December 2004. The Citizenship (Amendment) Ordinance 2005 was promulgated by the President of India and came into force on 28 June 2005.\\r\\n\\r\\nFollowing these reforms, Indian nationality law largely follows the jus sanguinis (citizenship by right of blood) as opposed to the jus soli (citizenship by right of birth within the territory).\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Italian Government grants Italian citizenship for the following reasons.[4]\\r\\n\\r\\nIndonesian nationality is regulated by Law No. 12/2006 (UU No. 12 Tahun 2006). The Indonesian nationality law is based on jus sanguinis and jus soli. The Indonesian nationality law does not recognize dual citizenship except for persons under the age of 18 (single citizenship principle). After reaching 18 years of age individuals are forced to choose one citizenship (limited double citizenship principle).[5]\\r\\n\\r\\nA foreign citizen can apply to become an Indonesian citizen with the following requirements:\\r\\n\\r\\nAny application for citizenship is granted by the President of Indonesia.\\r\\n\\r\\nIsrael's Declaration of Independence was made on 14 May 1948, the day before the British Mandate was due to expire as a result of the United Nations Partition Plan.[6] The Israeli parliament created two laws regarding immigration, citizenship and naturalization: the Law of Return and the Israeli nationality law.[7] The Law of Return, enacted on July 15, 1950, gives Jews living anywhere in the world the right to immigrate to Israel. This right to immigrate did not and still does not grant citizenship. In fact, for four years after Israel gained independence, there were no Israeli citizens.[7]\\r\\n\\r\\nOn July 14, 1952, the Israeli parliament enacted the Israeli Nationality Law.[7] The Nationality Law naturalized all citizens of Mandated Palestine, the inhabitants of Israel on July 15, 1952, and those who had legally resided in Israel between May 14, 1948, and July 14, 1952. The law further clarified that naturalization was available to immigrants who had arrived before Israel's creation, immigrants who arrived after statehood was granted, and those who did not come to Israel as immigrants but have since expressed desire to settle in Israel, with restriction. Naturalization applicants must also meet the following requirements: be over 18 years of age, have resided in Israel for three out of the five preceding years, have settled or intend to settle permanently in Israel, have some knowledge of Hebrew, and have renounced prior nationality or demonstrated ability to renounce nationality after becoming a citizen of Israel.[7]\\r\\n\\r\\nBecause of Israel's relatively new and culturally mixed identity, Israel does not grant citizenship to persons born on Israeli soil. Instead, the government chose to enact a jus sanguinis system, with the naturalization restrictions listed above. There is currently no legislation on second-generation immigrants (those born in Israel to immigrant parents). Furthermore, foreign spouses can apply for citizenship through the Minister of the Interior, but have a variety of restrictions and are not guaranteed citizenship.[8]\\r\\n\\r\\nNaturalisation in Malaysia is guided by the 1964 Malaysian Constitution. According to the law, those who want to be the country citizen should live in the country for a period of 10ÿ12 years. The would-be-citizens are required to speak the Malay language as well submitting the identity cards of two Malaysians who recommend the applicant for citizenship.[9] As the Government of Malaysia does not recognise dual citizenship, those who seek naturalisation are needed to reside permanently in the country and renouncing their former country citizenship.[10]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe requirements are as follows:[11]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Article 16 of 1957 Malaysian Constitution also stated a similar condition previously.[12]\\r\\n\\r\\nCommonwealth Act No. 473, the Revised Naturalization Law, approved June 17, 1939, provided that persons having certain specified qualifications may become a citizen of the Philippines by naturalization.[13] Republic Act No. 9139, approved June 8, 2001, provided that aliens under the age of 18 who were born in the Philippines, who have resided in the Philippines and have resided therein since birth, and who possess other specified qualifications may be granted Philippines citizenship by administrative proceeding subject to certain requirements.[14][15]\\r\\n\\r\\nNaturalization in Russia is guided by articles 13 and 14 of the federal law About Citizenship of Russian Federation passed on May 31, 2002. Citizenship of Russia can be obtained in general or simplified order. To become a citizen in general order, one must be 18 years of age or older, continuously live in Russia as a permanent resident for at least five years (this term is limited to one year for valued specialists, political asylum seekers and refugees), have legal means of existence, promise to obey the laws and Constitution of Russia and be fluent in Russian language.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere is also a possibility to naturalize in a simplified order, in which certain requirements will be waived. Eligible for that are persons, at least one parent of whom is a Russian citizen living on Russian territory; persons, who lived on the territories of the former Soviet republics but never obtained citizenships of those nations after they gained independence; persons, who were born on the territory of RSFSR and formerly held Soviet citizenship; persons married to Russian citizens for at least 3 years; persons, who served in Russian Armed Forces under contract for at least 3 years; parents of mentally incapacitated children over 18 who are Russian citizens; participants of the State Program for Assisting Compatriots Residing Abroad; and some other categories.[16]\\r\\n\\r\\nChapter 2 of the South African Citizenship Act, enacted on October 6, 1995, defines who is considered a naturalized citizen at the time of the act and also outlines the naturalization process for future immigrants.[17]\\r\\n\\r\\nAny person who immediately prior to the commencement of the act had been a South African citizen via naturalization, had been deemed to be a South African citizen by registration, or had been a citizen via naturalization of any of the former states now composing South Africa is now considered to be a naturalized citizen of South Africa.[17]\\r\\n\\r\\nThose wishing to apply for naturalization in the future must apply to the Minister of Home Affairs and must meet a slew of requirements. First, naturalization applicants must be over the age of 18 and must have been a permanent resident of South Africa for one year prior to application and for four out of the eight years prior to application. Applicants must also demonstrate good character and knowledge of the basic responsibilities and privileges of a South African citizen. The ability to communicate in one of the official languages of South Africa is also required. Applicants must show the intention to reside in South Africa after naturalization, and they are required to make a declaration of allegiance.[17]According to Article 3, subsection 3 of the South African constitution, national legislation must provide for the acquisition, loss and restoration of citizenship. \\r\\n\\r\\nBeing a naturalized South African citizen is a privilege, not a right. Even after meeting all the requirements and going through the naturalization process, the minister holds the right to deny citizenship.[18] Foreign spouses of South African citizens can apply for naturalization after two years of marriage, but is subject to potential denial of the minister. The minister can also grant citizenship to minors, if their parent applies for them.[17]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe minister also holds the power to revoke naturalization at any time for specific reasons listed in the Act. Reasons for revoking the naturalization certificate include marrying someone who is a citizen of another country and holding citizenship in another country, or applying for citizenship of another country without prior authorization for retention of citizenship.[18] If a permanent resident is denied naturalization, he or she must wait at least one year before reapplying.[17]\\r\\n\\r\\nThere has always been a distinction in the law of England and Wales between the subjects of the monarch and aliens: the monarch's subjects owed the monarch allegiance, and included those born in his or her dominions (natural-born subjects) and those who later gave him or her their allegiance (naturalised subjects). Today, the requirements for naturalisation as a citizen of the United Kingdom depend on whether or not one is the spouse or civil partner of a citizen. An applicant who is a spouse or civil partner of a British citizen must:\\r\\n\\r\\nFor those not married to or in a civil partnership with a British citizen, the requirements are:\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the United States of America, the Constitution gives Congress the power to prescribe a uniform rule of naturalization, which is administered by state courts. There was some confusion about which courts could naturalize; the final ruling was that it could be done by any \\"court of record having common-law jurisdiction and a clerk (prothonotary) and seal.\\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Constitution also mentions \\"natural born citizen\\". The first naturalization Act (drafted by Thomas Jefferson) used the phrases \\"natural born\\" and \\"native born\\" interchangeably.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Constitution does not mandate race-neutral naturalization, and the First Congress passed a naturalization act that limited eligibility for naturalization to free white persons. Shortly after the Civil War, Congress also extended racial eligibility for naturalization to aliens of African nativity and persons of African descent. Racial eligibility for naturalization was limited to these racial categories until 1940, after which eligibility for naturalization was also extended to descendants of races indigenous to the Western Hemisphere, Filipino persons or persons of Filipino descent, Chinese persons or persons of Chinese descent, and persons of races indigenous to India. The racial eligibility provisions were removed from the naturalization act in 1952, but while they remained in place many federal and state courts as well as the United States Board of Immigration Appeals interpreted the phrase free white person in a variety of cases involving the contested naturalization applications of immigrants from Asia and the Pacific Rim who some claimed were racially ineligible for naturalization.[19]\\r\\n\\r\\nNaturalization is also mentioned in the Fourteenth Amendment. The Supreme Court, in the case of Minor v. Happersett explained who the citizens of the United States were before its adoption, the Court said, Before the 14th Amendment, \\"the Constitution of the United States did not in terms prescribe who should be citizens [of the United States] or of the several states, yet there were necessarily such citizens without such provision. Additions might always be made to the citizenship of the United States in two ways: first, by birth, and second, by naturalization\\". Before the U.S. Constitution was adopted, individual states set their own standards for citizenship; After adoption, all state citizens \\"became ipso facto a citizen\\" of the United States and all children born in the United States \\"of parents who were its citizens became themselves, upon their birth, citizens [of the United States]. These were natives or natural-born citizens, as distinguished from aliens or foreigners.\\". The 14th Amendment states that \\"all persons born or naturalized in the United States and subject to the jurisdiction thereof shall be citizens of the United States and of the State in which they reside\\". The Minor v. Happersett Court went on to say, \\"Some authorities go further and include as citizens children born within the jurisdiction without reference to the citizenship of their parents. As to this class there have been doubts, but never as to the first\\". The Supreme Court later, in the case of Afroyim v. Rusk, interpreted this clause to imply that a naturalized citizen cannot be subsequently deprived of U.S. citizenship involuntarily.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Naturalization Act of 1795 set the initial rules on naturalization: \\"free, White persons\\" who had been resident for five years or more. The Naturalization Act of 1798, part of the Alien and Sedition Acts, was passed by the Federalists and extended the residency requirement from five to fourteen years. It specifically targeted Irish and French immigrants who were involved in Democratic-Republican Party politics. It was repealed in 1802.\\r\\n\\r\\nAn 1862 law allowed honorably discharged Army veterans of any war to petition for naturalization, without having filed a declaration of intent, after only one year of residence in the United States. An 1894 law extended the same privilege to honorably discharged five-year veterans of the Navy or Marine Corps. Over 192,000 aliens were naturalized between May 9, 1918, and June 30, 1919, under an act of May 9, 1918. Laws enacted in 1919, 1926, 1940, and 1952 continued preferential treatment provisions for veterans.[20]\\r\\n\\r\\nPassage of the Fourteenth Amendment meant that, in theory, all persons born in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens regardless of race. Citizenship by birth in the United States, however, was not initially granted to Asians until 1898, when the Supreme Court, in the case of United States v. Wong Kim Ark held that the Fourteenth Amendment did apply to Asians born in the United States to Alien parents who have a permanent domicile and residence in the United States.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe enabling legislation for the naturalization aspects of the Fourteenth Amendment was the Naturalization Act of 1870, which allowed naturalization of \\"aliens of African nativity and to persons of African descent\\", but is silent about other races. The 1882 Chinese Exclusion Act banned Chinese workers and specifically barred them from naturalization. The Immigration Act of 1917, (Barred Zone Act) extended those restrictions to almost all Asians.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe 1922 Cable Act specified that women marrying aliens ineligible for naturalization lose their US citizenship. At the time, all Asians were ineligible for naturalization. The Immigration Act of 1924 barred entry of all those ineligible for naturalization, which again meant non-Filipino Asians.\\r\\n\\r\\nFollowing the SpanishÿAmerican War in 1898, Philippine residents were classified as U.S. nationals, and the 1917 JonesÿShafroth Act granted U.S. citizenship to citizens of Puerto Rico. But the 1934 TydingsÿMcDuffie Act (or Philippine Independence Act) reclassified Filipinos as aliens, and set a quota of 50 immigrants per year, and otherwise applying the Immigration Act of 1924 to them. The quotas did not apply to Filipinos who served in the United States Navy, which actively recruited in the Philippines at that time.\\r\\n\\r\\nChinese persons were first permitted naturalization by the 1943 Magnuson Act, which repealed the Chinese Exclusion Act. India and the Philippines were allowed 100 annual immigrants under the 1946 Filipino Naturalization Act. The War Brides Act of 1945 permitted soldiers to bring back their foreign wives and established precedent in naturalization through marriage. The 1952 Immigration and Nationality Act (better known as the McCarranÿWalter Act) lifted racial restrictions, but kept the quotas in place. The Immigration Act of 1965 finally allowed Asians and all persons from all nations be given equal access to immigration and naturalization.\\r\\n\\r\\nIllegal immigration became a major issue in the United States at the end of the 20th century. The Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986, while tightening border controls, also provided the opportunity of naturalization for illegal aliens who had been in the country for at least four years. Today, lawful permanent resident aliens can apply for naturalization in the  United States after five years, unless they continue to be married to a U.S. citizen, in which case they can apply after three years of permanent residency.[21]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Child Citizenship Act of 2000 streamlined the naturalization process for children adopted internationally. A child under age 18 who is adopted by at least one U.S. citizen parent, and is in the custody of the citizen parent(s), is now automatically naturalized once admitted to the United States as an immigrant or when legally adopted in the United States, depending on the visa under which the child was admitted to the United States. The Act also provides that the non-citizen minor child of a newly naturalized U.S. citizen, whether by birth or adoption, also automatically receives U.S. citizenship\\r\\n\\r\\nThe following list is a brief summary of the duration of legal residence before a national of a foreign state, without any cultural, historical, or marriage ties or connections to the state in question, can request citizenship under that state's naturalization laws.\\r\\n\\r\\n[83]\\r\\n\\r\\nA few rare mass naturalization processes have been implemented by nation states. In 1891, Brazil granted naturalization to all aliens living in the country.[84] In 1922, Greece massively naturalized all the Greek refugees coming back from Turkey. The second massive naturalization process was in favor of Armenian refugees coming from Turkey, who went to Syria, Lebanon or other former Ottoman countries. Reciprocally, Turkey massively naturalized the refugees of Turkish descent or other ethnic backgrounds in Muslim creed from these countries during a redemption process.\\r\\n\\r\\nCanada instituted a mass naturalization by Act of Parliament with the enactment of the Canadian Citizenship Act 1946.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter annexation of the territories east of the Curzon line by the Soviet Union in 1945, Soviets naturalized en masse all the inhabitants of those territoriesincluding ethnic Poles, as well as its other citizens who had been deported into the Soviet Union, mainly to Kazakhstan. Those persons were forcibly naturalized as Soviet citizens.[citation needed] Later on, Germany granted to the ethnic German population in Russia and Kazakhstan full citizenship rights. Poland has a limited repatriation program in place.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe most recent massive naturalization case resulted from the Argentine economic crisis in the beginning of the 21st century. Existing or slightly updated right of return laws in Spain and Italy allowed many of their diasporic descendants to obtainin many cases to regainnaturalization in virtue of jus sanguinis, as in the Greek case. Hence, many Argentines acquired European nationality.\\r\\n\\r\\nSince the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution grants citizenship only to those \\"born or naturalized in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof\\", and the original United States Constitution only grants Congress the power of naturalization, it could be argued that all acts of Congress that expand the right of citizenship are cases of mass naturalization.  This includes the acts that extended U.S. citizenship to citizens of Puerto Rico, the United States Virgin Islands, Guam, and the Northern Mariana Islands, as well as the Indian Citizenship Act of 1924 which made all Native Americans citizens (most of them were previously excluded under the \\"jurisdiction\\" clause of the 14th Amendment).\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the eastern Malaysian state of Sabah, mass naturalisation also happened during the administration of United Sabah National Organisation (USNO) and Sabah People's United Front (BERJAYA's) Muslim-dominated political parties to increase the Muslim population in the territory by naturalising immigrants and refugees from the mainly-Muslim dominated areas of Mindanao and Sulu Archipelago of the Philippines and Sulawesi of Indonesia.[85][86][87]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe mass naturalization of native persons in occupied territories is illegal under the laws of war (Hague and Geneva Conventions).  However, there have been many instances of such illegal mass naturalizations in the 20th century.[citation needed]\\r\\n\\r\\nDenaturalization is the reverse of naturalization, when a state deprives one of its citizens of his or her citizenship. From the point of view of the individual, denaturalization means revocation or loss of citizenship. Denaturalization can be based on various legal justifications. The most severe form is the \\"stripping of citizenship\\" when denaturalization takes place as a penalty for actions considered criminal by the state, often only indirectly related to nationality, for instance for having served in a foreign military. In countries that enforce single citizenship, voluntary naturalization in another country will lead to an automatic loss of the original citizenship; the language of the law often refers to such cases as \\"giving up one's citizenship\\" or (implicit) renunciation of citizenship. In another case, affecting only foreign-born citizens, denaturalization can refer to the loss of citizenship by an annulment of naturalization, also known as \\"administrative denaturalization\\" where the original act of naturalization is found to be invalid, for instance due to an administrative error or if it had been based on fraud (including bribery). In the US, the Bancroft Treaties in the 19th century regulated legislation concerning denaturalization.\\r\\n\\r\\nLoss of U.S. citizenship was a consequence of foreign military service based on Section 349(a)(3) of the Immigration and Nationality Act until its provisions were found unconstitutional by the Supreme Court in 1967.[88][89]\\r\\n\\r\\nYaser Esam Hamdi was a U.S. citizen captured in Afghanistan in 2001. He was fighting against U.S. and Afghan Northern Alliance forces, siding with the Taliban. He was named by the Bush administration as an illegal enemy combatant, and militarily detained in the country for almost three years without receiving any charges. On September 23, 2004, the U.S. Justice Department agreed to release Hamdi to Saudi Arabia on the condition that he give up his U.S. citizenship, though since it was done under duress it is possible that he can later reclaim it.[citation needed]\\r\\n\\r\\nSection 4 of the British Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002[90] gave power to the Home Secretary to deprive a person of a citizenship status if the Secretary of State is satisfied that the person has done anything seriously prejudicial to the vital interests of the United Kingdom etc., except in the case where such might render the person stateless.[91]\\r\\n\\r\\nUnder Canadian citizenship law citizenship can be revoked by an order from the federal cabinet if:\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the past (pre-1977) revoking citizenship was more broad:\\r\\n\\r\\nThose who are revoked can appeal to the Federal Court of Canada.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn Apartheid-era South Africa, the Bantu Homelands Citizenship Act, 1970, removed South African citizenship from Black South Africans, making them citizens of nominally-independent or self-governing tribal \\"homelands\\", the Bantustans  none of which achieved international recognition. In parallel with the creation of the homelands, South Africa's black population was subjected to a massive programme of forced relocation. It has been estimated that 3.5 million people were forced from their homes from the 1960s through the 1980s, many being resettled in the Bantustans.\\r\\n\\r\\nWith the demise of the apartheid regime in South Africa in 1994, the Bantustans were dismantled and their territory reincorporated into the Republic of South Africa. The drive to achieve this was spearheaded by the African National Congress as a central element of its programme of reform. The Bantu Homelands Citizenship Act itself was repealed by the 1993 Interim Constitution, with all citizens being restored to their South African citizenship.\\r\\n\\r\\nBefore World War I, only a small number of countries had laws governing denaturalization that could be enforced against citizens guilty of \\"lacking patriotism\\". Such denaturalized citizens became stateless persons. During and after the war, most European countries passed amendments to revoke naturalization.[93]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn Homo Sacer: Sovereign Power or Bare Life (1998), philosopher Giorgio Agamben mentioned a number of denaturalization laws that were passed after World War I by most European countries:\\r\\n\\r\\nIt is important to note that starting with the period of World War?I, many European states began to introduce laws which permitted their own citizens to be denaturalized and denationalized. The first was France, in 1915, with regard to naturalized citizens of \\"enemy\\" origins; in 1922 the example was followed by Belgium, which revoked the naturalization of citizens who had committed \\"anti-national\\" acts during the war; in 1926 the Fascist regime in Italy passed a similar law concerning citizens who had shown themselves to be \\"unworthy of Italian citizenship\\"; in 1933 it was Austria's turn, and so forth, until in 1935 the Nuremberg Laws divided German citizens into full citizens and citizens without political rights. These lawsand the mass statelessness that ensuedmark a decisive turning point in the life of the modern nation-state and its definitive emancipation from the naive notions of \\"people\\" and \\"citizen\\"\\r\\nThe 1915 French denaturalization law applied only to naturalized citizens with \\"enemy origins\\" who had kept their original nationality. Later under Raymond Poincar's government, another law was passed in 1927 which entitled the government to denaturalize any new citizen who committed acts contrary to the national interest.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1916, Portugal passed a law which automatically denaturalized all citizens born to a German father.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1922, Belgium enacted a law revoking the naturalization of persons accused of having committed \\"antinational acts\\" during the war; this was supplemented in 1934 by a new decree against people \\"in dereliction of their duties as Belgian citizens.\\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter 1926 in Italy, people who were deemed not to deserve the Italian citizenship or who were considered to represent a threat to the public order could lose their naturalization.\\r\\n\\r\\nEgypt in 1926 and Turkey in 1928 enacted laws authorizing denaturalization of any person threatening the public order. Austria passed a similar law in 1933 by which it could denaturalize any citizen who participated in a hostile action against the state. Russia also passed several similar decrees after 1921.[93]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1933, Nazi Germany passed a law authorizing it to denaturalize any person \\"living abroad\\" and began restricting the citizenship rights of naturalized citizens of Jewish origin, followed in 1935 by citizens by birth on the basis of the Nuremberg laws.\\r\\n\\r\\nDuring Vichy France, 15,000 persons, mostly Jews, were denaturalized (between June 1940 and August 1944), following the setting up, in July 1940, of a Commission charged of revision of naturalizations since the 1927 reform of the nationality law.[94]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the United States, the proposed, but never ratified, Titles of Nobility amendment of 1810 would revoke the American citizenship of anyone who would \\"accept, claim, receive or retain, any title of nobility\\" or who would receive any gifts or honors from a foreign power.\\r\\n\\r\\n Media related to Naturalization at Wikimedia Commons","input":"What does it mean to become a naturalized citizen?"},{"output":"cockerel","context":"Corn flakes, or cornflakes, are a popular breakfast cereal made by toasting flakes of corn. The cereal was first created by John Harvey Kellogg in 1894 as a food that he thought would be healthy for the patients of the Battle Creek Sanitarium in Michigan where he was superintendent. The breakfast cereal proved popular among the patients and the Kellogg Company (Kellogg's) was set up to produce corn flakes for the wider public. A patent for the process was granted in 1896.\\r\\nWith corn flakes becoming popular in the wider community, a previous patient at the sanitarium, C. W. Post, started to make rival products. Kellogg continued to experiment and various ingredients were added and different grains were used. In 1928, he started to manufacture Rice Krispies, another successful breakfast cereal.\\r\\nThere are many generic brands of corn flakes produced by various manufacturers. As well as being used as a breakfast cereal, the crushed flakes can be a substitute for bread crumbs in recipes and can be incorporated into many cooked dishes.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCorn flakes are a packaged cereal product formed from small toasted flakes of corn, usually served cold with milk and sometimes sugar. Since their original production, the plain flakes of corn have been flavoured with salt, sugar and malt, and many successive products with additional ingredients have been manufactured such as sugar frosted flakes and honey & nut corn flakes.[1] Corn flakes are produced in significant quantities at the Trafford Park factory in Manchester, England, which is the largest cereal factory in the world.[2]\\r\\nThe legend of corn flakes goes back to the late 19th century, when a team of Seventh-day Adventists began to develop new foods to adhere to the vegetarian diet recommended by the church. Members of the group experimented with a number of different grains, including wheat, oats, rice, barley and corn. In 1894, John Harvey Kellogg, the superintendent of the Battle Creek Sanitarium in Michigan and an Adventist, used these recipes as part of a strict vegetarian regimen for his patients, which also included no alcohol, tobacco or caffeine. The diet he imposed consisted entirely of bland foods. A follower of Sylvester Graham, the inventor of graham crackers and graham bread, Kellogg believed that spicy or sweet foods would increase passions.[3]\\r\\nThis idea for corn flakes began by accident when Kellogg and his younger brother, Will Keith Kellogg, left some cooked wheat to sit while they attended to some pressing matters at the sanitarium. When they returned, they found that the wheat had gone stale, but being on a strict budget, they decided to continue to process it by forcing it through rollers, hoping to obtain long sheets of the dough. To their surprise, what they found instead were flakes, which they toasted and served to their patients. This event occurred on August 8, 1894, and a patent for \\"Flaked Cereals and Process of Preparing Same\\" was filed on May 31, 1895, and issued on April 14, 1896.[4][5][6]\\r\\nDr. Kellogg introduced Kellogg's Corn Flakes in hopes that it would reduce dyspepsia and, in accordance with the practices of the Seventh-day Adventists, masturbation and excessive sexual intercourse.[7]\\r\\nThe flakes of grain, which the Kellogg brothers called granose, were a very popular food among the patients. The brothers then experimented with other flakes from other grains. In 1906, Will Keith Kellogg, who served as the business manager of the sanitarium, decided to try to mass-market the new food. At his new company, Battle Creek Toasted Corn Flake Company, he added sugar to the flakes to make them more palatable to a mass audience, but this caused a rift between his brother and him. In 1907, his same company ran an ad campaign which offered a free box of cereal to any woman who winked at her grocer.[8] To increase sales, in 1909 he added a special offer, the Funny Jungleland Moving Pictures Booklet, which was made available to anyone who bought two boxes of the cereal. This same premium was offered for 22 years. At the same time, Kellogg also began experimenting with new grain cereals to expand his product line. Rice Krispies, his next great hit, first went on sale in 1928.[9]\\r\\nThere have been many mascots of Kellogg's Cornflakes. The most popular one is a green rooster named Cornelius \\"Corny\\" Rooster, which has been the mascot since his debut. In early commercials, he would speak the catch phrase \\"Wake up, up, up to Kellogg's Cornflakes!\\" Dallas McKennon and Andy Devine voiced him. Later, he stopped talking and simply crowed.[citation needed] The concept of using a stylized cockerel originated from a suggestion by family friend Nansi Richards, a harpist from Wales and a Welsh language proponent. The Welsh word for cockerel is ceiliog (pronounced keyeleeog or in some dialects keelog).[10][11]\\r\\nA former patient of the Battle Creek Sanitarium, C. W. Post, started a rival company to create the other major brand of corn flakes in the United States, Post Toasties or Elijah's Manna. The Australian company Sanitarium Health and Wellbeing also manufactures their own brand of corn flakes called Skippy corn flakes. Many generic brands of corn flakes are produced by various manufacturers. In addition, Sainsbury's, Tesco, Morrisons, Asda Co-operative, etc. have brought out similar products based on cornflakes. A variety of corn flakes that is sold in the United Kingdom is one where honey and nuts have been added to the corn flakes, colloquially as \\"honey nut corn flakes\\" and as Crunchy Nut under the Kellogg's brand name.\\r\\nThere are a wide variety of different recipes for dishes involving corn flakes and crushed corn flakes can even be a substitute for bread crumbs.\\r\\nHoney joys are a popular party snack in Australia. They are made by mixing corn flakes with honey, butter and sugar and baking in patty cases or muffin cups.[12] A variant popular in the UK is chocolate corn flake cakes, made with corn flakes, dark chocolate, golden syrup and butter.[13] In New Zealand, corn flakes are a core ingredient in Afghan biscuits, a chocolate cookie made with corn flakes and topped with chocolate icing.[14][better?source?needed]\\r\\nCorn flakes are usually served with cold milk (but it is sometimes warm or hot).

(The term \\"necropsy\\" is generally reserved for non-human animals; see below). It is usually performed by a specialized medical doctor called a pathologist.  In most cases, a medical examiner or coroner can determine cause of death and only a small portion of deaths require an autopsy.  \\r\\n\\r\\nAutopsies are performed for either legal or medical purposes. For example, a forensic autopsy is carried out when the cause of death may be a criminal matter, while a clinical or academic autopsy is performed to find the medical cause of death and is used in cases of unknown or uncertain death, or for research purposes. Autopsies can be further classified into cases where external examination suffices, and those where the body is dissected and internal examination is conducted. Permission from next of kin may be required for internal autopsy in some cases. Once an internal autopsy is complete the body is reconstituted by sewing it back together.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe term \\"autopsy\\" derives from the Ancient Greek ϫ??ϫ autopsia, \\"to see for oneself\\", derived from ϫ (autos, \\"oneself\\") and ?? (opsis, \\"sight, view\\").[1] The word autopsy has been used since around the 17th century, it refers to the examination of inside the dead human body to discover diseases and cause of death.[2]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe principal aims of an autopsy is to determine the cause of death, the state of health of the person before he or she died, and whether any medical diagnosis and treatment before death was appropriate.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn most Western countries the number of autopsies performed in hospitals has been decreasing every year since 1955. Critics, including pathologist and former JAMA editor George D. Lundberg, have charged that the reduction in autopsies is negatively affecting the care delivered in hospitals, because when mistakes result in death, they are often not investigated and lessons therefore remain unlearned.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen a person has given permission in advance of their death, autopsies may also be carried out for the purposes of teaching or medical research.\\r\\n\\r\\nAn autopsy is frequently performed in cases of sudden death, where a doctor is not able to write a death certificate, or when death is believed to result from an unnatural cause. These examinations are performed under a legal authority (Medical Examiner or Coroner or Procurator Fiscal) and do not require the consent of relatives of the deceased. The most extreme example is the examination of murder victims, especially when medical examiners are looking for signs of death or the murder method, such as bullet wounds and exit points, signs of strangulation, or traces of poison.\\r\\nSome religions including Judaism and Islam usually discourage the performing of autopsies on their adherents.[3] Organizations such as ZAKA in Israel and Misaskim in the United States generally guide families how to ensure that an unnecessary autopsy is not made.\\r\\n\\r\\nAutopsies are used in clinical medicine to identify medical error, or a previously unnoticed condition that may endanger the living, such as infectious diseases or exposure to hazardous materials[4].\\r\\n\\r\\nA study that focused on myocardial infarction (heart attack) as a cause of death found significant errors of omission and commission,[5] i.e. a sizable number cases ascribed to myocardial infarctions (MIs) were not MIs and a significant number of non-MIs were actually MIs.\\r\\n\\r\\nA systematic review of studies of the autopsy calculated that in about 25% of autopsies a major diagnostic error will be revealed.[6] However, this rate has decreased over time and the study projects that in a contemporary US institution, 8.4% to 24.4% of autopsies will detect major diagnostic errors.\\r\\n\\r\\nA large meta-analysis suggested that approximately one-third of death certificates are incorrect and that half of the autopsies performed produced findings that were not suspected before the person died.[7]  Also, it is thought that over one fifth of unexpected findings can only be diagnosed histologically, i.e., by biopsy or autopsy, and that approximately one quarter of unexpected findings, or 5% of all findings, are major and can similarly only be diagnosed from tissue.\\r\\n\\r\\nOne study found that (out of 694 diagnoses) \\"Autopsies revealed 171 missed diagnoses, including 21 cancers, 12 strokes, 11  myocardial infarctions, 10 pulmonary emboli, and 9 endocarditis, among others\\".[8]\\r\\n\\r\\nFocusing on intubated patients, one study found \\"abdominal pathologic conditions? abscesses, bowel perforations, or  infarction? were as frequent as pulmonary emboli as a cause of class I errors.  While patients with abdominal pathologic conditions generally complained of  abdominal pain, results of examination of the abdomen were considered unremarkable in most patients, and the symptom was not pursued\\".[9]\\r\\n\\r\\nThere are four main types of autopsies:[10]\\r\\n\\r\\nA forensic autopsy is used to determine the cause and manner of death. Forensic science involves the application of the sciences to answer questions of interest to the legal system.\\r\\n\\r\\nMedical examiners attempt to determine the time of death, the exact cause of death, and what, if anything, preceded the death, such as a struggle.  A forensic autopsy may include obtaining biological specimens from the deceased for toxicological testing, including stomach contents.  Toxicology tests may reveal the presence of one or more chemical \\"poisons\\" (all chemicals, in sufficient quantities, can be classified as a poison) and their quantity. Because post-mortem deterioration of the body, together with the gravitational pooling of bodily fluids, will necessarily alter the bodily environment, toxicology tests may overestimate, rather than underestimate, the quantity of the suspected chemical.[12]\\r\\n\\r\\nFollowing an in-depth examination of all the evidence, a medical examiner or coroner will assign one of the manners of death provided for in the fact-finder's jurisdiction and will detail the evidence on the mechanism of the death.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn most[which?] United States jurisdictions[citation needed], each death is categorized as taking place in one of five \\"manners of death\\":\\r\\n\\r\\nMost states require the state medical examiner to complete an autopsy report, and many mandate that the autopsy be videotaped.[citation needed]\\r\\n\\r\\nAlthough England and Wales use the \\"accident\\" designation, in those jurisdictions the term applies to deaths resulting from a risk that is either a) reasonable (whether assumed deliberately or not) or b) neither i) voluntarily assumed nor ii) intentionally created by another party. For deaths resulting from deliberate assumption of unreasonable risk, England and Wales use the category \\"misadventure.\\"\\r\\n\\r\\nSome jurisdictions[which?] place deaths in absentia, such as deaths at sea and missing persons declared dead in a court of law, in the \\"Undetermined\\" category on the grounds that due to the fact-finder's lack of ability to examine the body, the examiner has no personal knowledge of the manner of (assumed) death; others[which?] classify such deaths in an additional category \\"Other,\\" reserving \\"Undetermined\\" for deaths in which the fact-finder has access to the body, but the information provided by the body and examination of it is insufficient to provide sufficient grounds for a determination.\\r\\n\\r\\nClinical autopsies serve two major purposes. They are performed to gain more insight into pathological processes and determine what factors contributed to a patient's death. Autopsies are also performed to ensure the standard of care at hospitals. Autopsies can yield insight into how patient deaths can be prevented in the future.\\r\\n\\r\\nWithin the United Kingdom, clinical autopsies can be carried out only with the consent of the family of the deceased person, as opposed to a medico-legal autopsy instructed by a Coroner (England & Wales) or Procurator Fiscal (Scotland) to which the family cannot object.[citation needed]\\r\\n\\r\\nOver time, autopsies have not only been able to determine the cause of death, but also lead to discoveries of various diseases such as fetal alcohol syndrome, Legionnaire's disease, and even viral hepatitis.[13]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 2004 in England and Wales, there were 514,000 deaths of which 225,500 were referred to the coroner. Of those, 115,800 (22.5% of all deaths) resulted in post-mortem examinations and there were 28,300 inquests, 570 with a jury.[14]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe rate of consented (hospital) autopsy in the UK and worldwide has declined rapidly over the past 50 years. In the UK in 2013 only 0.7% of inpatient adult deaths were followed by consented autopsy.[15]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the United States, autopsy rates fell from 17% in 1980[16] to 14% in 1985[16] and 11.5% in 1989,[17] although the figures vary notably from county to county.[18]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe body is received at a medical examiner's office, municipal mortuary, or hospital in a body bag or evidence sheet. A new body bag is used for each body to ensure that only evidence from that body is contained within the bag. Evidence sheets are an alternative way to transport the body. An evidence sheet is a sterile sheet that covers the body when it is moved. If it is believed there may be any significant evidence on the hands, for example, gunshot residue or skin under the fingernails, a separate paper sack is put around each hand and taped shut around the wrist.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere are two parts to the physical examination of the body: the external and internal examination. Toxicology, biochemical tests or genetic testing/molecular autopsy often supplement these and frequently assist the pathologist in assigning the cause or causes of death.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt many institutions the person responsible for handling, cleaning, and moving the body is called a diener, the German word for servant. In the UK this role is performed by an Anatomical Pathology Technician (APT), who will also assist the pathologist in eviscerating the body and reconstruction after the autopsy. After the body is received, it is first photographed. The examiner then notes the kind of clothes and their position on the body before they are removed. Next, any evidence such as residue, flakes of paint or other material is collected from the external surfaces of the body. Ultraviolet light may also be used to search body surfaces for any evidence not easily visible to the naked eye. Samples of hair, nails and the like are taken, and the body may also be radiographically imaged. Once the external evidence is collected, the body is removed from the bag, undressed, and any wounds present are examined. The body is then cleaned, weighed, and measured in preparation for the internal examination. The scale used to weigh the body is often designed to accommodate the cart that the body is transported on; its weight is then deducted from the total weight shown to give the weight of the body.\\r\\n\\r\\nIf not already within an autopsy room at the city, county or state morgue, the body is transported to one and placed on a table. A general description of the body as regards ethnic group, sex, age, hair colour and length, eye colour and other distinguishing features (birthmarks, old scar tissue, moles, tattoos, etc.) is then made. A voice recorder or a standard examination form is normally used to record this information.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn some countries, e.g., Scotland, France, Germany, and Canada, an autopsy may comprise an external examination only. This concept is sometimes termed a \\"view and grant\\". The principle behind this is that the medical records, history of the deceased and circumstances of death have all indicated as to the cause and manner of death without the need for an internal examination.[19]\\r\\n\\r\\nIf not already in place, a plastic or rubber brick called a \\"head block\\" is placed under the shoulders of the deceased, hyperflexing the neck making the spine arch backward while stretching and pushing the chest upward to make it easier to incise. This gives the APT, or pathologist, maximum exposure to the trunk. After this is done, the internal examination begins. The internal examination consists of inspecting the internal organs of the body by dissection for evidence of trauma or other indications of the cause of death. For the internal examination there are a number of different approaches available:\\r\\n\\r\\nThere is no need for any incision to be made, which will be visible after completion of the examination when the deceased is dressed in a shroud.\\r\\nIn all of the above cases the incision then extends all the way down to the pubic bone (making a deviation to either side of the navel) and avoiding, where possible; transsecting any scars which may be present.\\r\\n\\r\\nBleeding from the cuts is minimal, or non-existent, because the pull of gravity is producing the only blood pressure at this point, related directly to the complete lack of cardiac functionality. However, in certain cases there is anecdotal evidence that bleeding can be quite profuse, especially in cases of drowning.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt this point, shears are used to open the chest cavity.  It is also possible to utilise a simple scalpel blade. The prosector uses the tool to cut through the ribs on the costal cartilage, to allow the sternum to be removed; this is done so that the heart and lungs can be seen in situ and that the heart, in particular the pericardial sac is not damaged or disturbed from opening. A PM 40 knife is used to remove the sternum from the soft tissue which attaches it to the mediastinum. Now the lungs and the heart are exposed. The sternum is set aside and will be eventually replaced at the end of the autopsy.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt this stage the organs are exposed. Usually, the organs are removed in a systematic fashion.  Making a decision as to what order the organs are to be removed will depend highly on the case in question. Organs can be removed in several ways: The first is the en masse technique of Letulle whereby all the organs are removed as one large mass. The second is the en bloc method of Ghon. The most popular in the UK is a modified version of this method, which is divided into four groups of organs. Although these are the two predominant evisceration techniques, in the UK variations on these are widespread.\\r\\n\\r\\nOne method is described here: The pericardial sac is opened to view the heart.  Blood for chemical analysis may be removed from the inferior vena cava or the pulmonary veins.  Before removing the heart, the pulmonary artery is opened in order to search for a blood clot.  The heart can then be removed by cutting the inferior vena cava, the pulmonary veins, the aorta and pulmonary artery, and the superior vena cava.  This method leaves the aortic arch intact, which will make things easier for the embalmer.  The left lung is then easily accessible and can be removed by cutting the bronchus, artery, and vein at the hilum.  The right lung can then be similarly removed.  The abdominal organs can be removed one by one after first examining their relationships and vessels.\\r\\n\\r\\nMost pathologists, however, prefer the organs to be removed all in one \\"block\\".  Using dissection of the fascia, blunt dissection; using the fingers or hands and traction; the organs are dissected out in one piece for further inspection and sampling. During autopsies of infants, this method is used almost all of the time. The various organs are examined, weighed and tissue samples in the form of slices are taken. Even major blood vessels are cut open and inspected at this stage. Next the stomach and intestinal contents are examined and weighed. This could be useful to find the cause and time of death, due to the natural passage of food through the bowel during digestion. The more area empty, the longer the deceased had gone without a meal before death.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe body block that was used earlier to elevate the chest cavity is now used to elevate the head. To examine the brain, an incision is made from behind one ear, over the crown of the head, to a point behind the other ear. When the autopsy is completed, the incision can be neatly sewn up and is not noticed when the head is resting on a pillow in an open casket funeral. The scalp is pulled away from the skull in two flaps with the front flap going over the face and the rear flap over the back of the neck. The skull is then cut with a circular (or semicircular) bladed reciprocating saw to create a \\"cap\\" that can be pulled off, exposing the brain. The brain is then observed in situ. Then the brain's connection to the cranial nerves and spinal cord are severed, and the brain is lifted out of the skull for further examination. If the brain needs to be preserved before being inspected, it is contained in a large container of formalin (15 percent solution of formaldehyde gas in buffered water) for at least two, but preferably four weeks. This not only preserves the brain, but also makes it firmer, allowing easier handling without corrupting the tissue.\\r\\n\\r\\nAn important component of the autopsy is the reconstitution of the body such that it can be viewed, if desired, by relatives of the deceased following the procedure. After the examination, the body has an open and empty thoracic cavity with chest flaps open on both sides, the top of the skull is missing, and the skull flaps are pulled over the face and neck. It is unusual to examine the face, arms, hands or legs internally.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the UK, following the Human Tissue Act 2004 all organs and tissue must be returned to the body unless permission is given by the family to retain any tissue for further investigation. Normally the internal body cavity is lined with cotton, wool, or a similar material, and the organs are then placed into a plastic bag to prevent leakage and are returned to the body cavity. The chest flaps are then closed and sewn back together and the skull cap is sewed back in place. Then the body may be wrapped in a shroud, and it is common for relatives to not be able to tell the procedure has been done when the body is viewed in a funeral parlor after embalming.\\r\\n\\r\\nAround 3000 BC ancient Egyptians were one of the first civilizations to practice the removal and examination of the internal organs of humans in the religious practice of mummification.[1][20]\\r\\n\\r\\nAutopsies that opened the body to determine the cause of death were attested at least in the early third millennium BC, although they were opposed in many ancient societies where it was believed that the outward disfigurement of dead persons prevented them from entering the afterlife[21] (as with the Egyptians, who removed the organs through tiny slits in the body).[1] Notable Greek autopsists were Galen (AD 129- c. 200/ 216),[22] Erasistratus and\\r\\nHerophilus of Chalcedon, who lived in 3rd century BC Alexandria, but in general, autopsies were rare in ancient Greece.[21] In 44 BC, Julius Caesar was the subject of an official autopsy after his murder by rival senators, the physician's report noting that the second stab wound Caesar received was the fatal one.[21] Julius Caesar had been stabbed a total of 23 times.[23] By around 150 BC, ancient Roman legal practice had established clear parameters for autopsies.[1]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe dissection of human remains for medical or scientific reasons continued to be practiced irregularly after the Romans, for instance by the Arab physicians Avenzoar and Ibn al-Nafis. In Europe they were done with enough regularity to become skilled, as early as 1200, and successful efforts to preserve the body, by filling the veins with wax and metals.[22] Until the 20th century,[22] it was thought that the modern autopsy process derived from the anatomists of the Renaissance. Giovanni Battista Morgagni (1682ÿ1771), celebrated as the father of anatomical pathology,[24] wrote the first exhaustive work on pathology, De Sedibus et Causis Morborum per Anatomen Indagatis (The Seats and Causes of Diseases Investigated by Anatomy, 1769).[1]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the mid-1800s, Carl von Rokitansky and colleagues at the Second Vienna Medical School began to undertake dissections as a means to improve diagnostic medicine.[23]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1543 Andreas Vesalius conducted a public dissection of the body of a former criminal. He asserted and articulated the bones, this became the worlds oldest surviving anatomical preparation. It is still displayed at the Anatomical museum at the University of Basel.[25]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe 19th-century medical researcher Rudolf Virchow, in response to a lack of standardization of autopsy procedures, established and published specific autopsy protocols (one such protocol still bears his name). He also developed the concept of pathological processes.\\r\\n\\r\\nPost-mortem examination, or necropsy, is far more common in veterinary medicine than in human medicine. For many species that exhibit few external symptoms (sheep), or that are not suited to detailed clinical examination (poultry, cage birds, zoo animals), it is a common method used by veterinary physicians to come to a diagnosis. A necropsy is mostly used like an autopsy to determine cause of death. The entire body is examined at the gross visual level, and samples are collected for additional analyses.[26]","input":"What is the person who does an autopsy?"},{"output":"Charles, Prince of Wales","context":"Succession to the British throne is determined by descent, gender (for people born before October 2011), legitimacy, and religion. Under common law, the Crown is inherited by a sovereign's children or by a childless sovereign's nearest collateral line. The Bill of Rights 1689 and the Act of Settlement 1701, restrict succession to the throne to the legitimate Protestant descendants of Sophia of Hanover that are in \\"communion with the Church of England\\".[1] Spouses of Roman Catholics were disqualified from 1689 until the law was amended in 2015. Protestant descendants of those excluded for being Roman Catholics are eligible.[2]\\r\\nQueen Elizabeth II is the sovereign, and her heir apparent is her eldest son, Charles, Prince of Wales. Next in line after him is Prince William, Duke of Cambridge, the Prince of Wales's elder son. Third in line is Prince George, the son of the Duke of Cambridge, followed by his sister, Princess Charlotte. Fifth in line is Prince Henry of Wales, the younger son of the Prince of Wales. Sixth in line is Prince Andrew, Duke of York, the Queen's second-eldest son. Any of the first six in line marrying without the sovereign's consent would be disqualified from succession.\\r\\nThe first four individuals in the line of succession who are over 21, and the sovereign's consort, may be appointed Counsellors of State. Counsellors of State perform some of the sovereign's duties in the United Kingdom while he or she is out of the country or temporarily incapacitated. Otherwise, individuals in the line of succession need not have specific legal or official roles.\\r\\nThe United Kingdom is one of the 16 Commonwealth realms. Each of those countries has the same person as monarch and the same order of succession. In 2011, the prime ministers of the realms agreed unanimously to adopt a common approach to amending the rules on the succession to their respective Crowns so that absolute primogeniture would apply for persons born after the date of the agreement, instead of male-preference primogeniture, and the ban on marriages to Roman Catholics would be lifted, but the monarch would still need to be in communion with the Church of England. After the necessary legislation had been enacted in accordance with each realm's constitution, the changes took effect on 26 March 2015.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nNo official, complete version of the line of succession is currently maintained. The exact number, in remoter collateral lines, of the persons who would be eligible is uncertain. In 2001 genealogist William Addams Reitwiesner compiled a list of 4,973 living descendants of the Electress Sophia in order of succession, but did so disregarding Roman Catholic status.[3] When updated in January 2011, the number was more than five thousand.[4]\\r\\nThe annotated list below covers the first part of this line of succession, being limited to descendants of the sons of George V (the present Queen's grandfather). Persons named in italics are unnumbered either because they are deceased or because sources report them to be excluded from the succession. The order of the first sixteen numbered in the list is given on the official website of the British Monarchy;[1] other list numbers and exclusions are explained by annotations (\\"Notes and sources\\" below) and footnotes.\\r\\nNotes and sources:\\r\\nThe current succession law in the United Kingdom evolved from succession law in both England and Scotland. Originally in both countries, there were no fixed rules governing succession to the throne. The individual could have relied on inheritance, statute, election (by Parliament or by another body), nomination (by a reigning sovereign in his or her will), conquest or prescription (de facto possession of the Crown). It was often unclear which of these bases should take precedence; often, the outcome depended not on the legal strength of the claims, but on the political or military power of the claimants.\\r\\nHowever, over time, the default rule became male primogeniture: later monarchs coming to the throne by exception to this rule went to great lengths to explain and justify going against these rules, and to prove their rivals illegitimate. Eventually, Parliament asserted control of succession.\\r\\nIn 1485, Henry Tudor, a female-line descendant of a legitimated branch of the royal house of Lancaster, the House of Beaufort, assumed the English crown as Henry VII, after defeating Richard III, who was killed at the battle of Bosworth when leading a charge against Henry's standard. Richard was the last king of the House of York, and the last of the Plantagenet dynasty. Henry declared himself king retroactively from 21 August 1485, the day before his victory over Richard at Bosworth Field,[6] and caused Richard's Titulus Regius to be repealed and expunged from the Rolls of Parliament.[7] After Henry's coronation in London in October that year, his first parliament, summoned to meet at Westminster in November, enacted that \\"the inheritance of the crown should be, rest, remain and abide in the most royal person of the then sovereign lord, King Henry VII, and the heirs of his body lawfully coming.\\"[8]\\r\\nHenry VII was followed by his son, Henry VIII. Though his father descended from the Lancastrians, Henry VIII could also claim the throne through the Yorkist line, as his mother Elizabeth was the sister and heiress of Edward V. In 1542 Henry also assumed the title King of Ireland; this would pass down with the monarchs of England, and later Great Britain, until the Acts of Union 1800 merged the separate crowns into that of the United Kingdom.\\r\\nHenry VIII's numerous marriages led to several complications over succession. Henry VIII was first married to Catherine of Aragon, by whom he had a daughter named Mary. His second marriage, to Anne Boleyn, resulted in a daughter named Elizabeth. Henry VIII had a son, Edward, by his third wife, Jane Seymour. An Act of Parliament passed in 1533 declared Mary illegitimate; another passed in 1536 did the same for Elizabeth. Though the two remained illegitimate, an Act of Parliament passed in 1544 allowed reinserting them, providing further \\"that the King should and might give, will, limit, assign, appoint or dispose the said imperial Crown and the other premises  by letters patent or last will in writing.\\" Mary and Elizabeth, under Henry VIII's will, were to be followed by descendants of the King's deceased sister Mary Tudor, Duchess of Suffolk (he however excluded his niece Frances Brandon, Duchess of Suffolk). This will also excluded from the succession the descendants of Henry's eldest sister Margaret Tudor, who were the rulers of Scotland.\\r\\nWhen Henry VIII died in 1547, the young Edward succeeded him, becoming Edward VI. Edward VI was the first Protestant Sovereign to succeed to the rule of England. He attempted to divert the course of succession in his will to prevent his Catholic half-sister, Mary, from inheriting the throne. He excluded Mary and Elizabeth, settling on the Duchess of Suffolk's daughter, Lady Jane Grey. Jane was also originally excluded on the premise that no woman could reign over England. Nonetheless, the will, which originally referred to Jane's heirs-male, was amended to refer to Jane and her heirs-male. Upon Edward VI's death in 1553, Jane was proclaimed Queen of England and Ireland. She was not universally recognised and after nine days she was overthrown by the popular Mary. As Henry VIII's will had been approved by an Act of Parliament in 1544, Edward's contravening will was unlawful and ignored.\\r\\nMary was succeeded by her half-sister, Elizabeth, who broke with the precedents of many of her predecessors, and refused to name an heir. Whilst previous monarchs (including Henry VIII) had specifically been granted authority to settle uncertain successions in their wills, the Treasons Act 1571 asserted that Parliament had the right to settle disputes, and made it treason to deny Parliamentary authority. Wary of threats from other possible heirs, Parliament further passed the Act of Association 1584, which provided that any individual involved in attempts to murder the Sovereign would be disqualified from succeeding. (The Act was repealed in 1863.)\\r\\nThe House of Stewart (later Stuart) had ruled in Scotland since 1371. It had followed strict rules of primogeniture until the deposition and exile of Mary I in 1567; even then she was succeeded by her son, James VI.\\r\\nElizabeth I of England and Ireland was succeeded by King James VI of Scotland, her first cousin twice removed, even though his succession violated Henry VIII's will, under which Lady Anne Stanley, heiress of Mary Tudor, Duchess of Suffolk, was supposed to succeed. James asserted that hereditary right was superior to statutory provision, and as King of Scotland was powerful enough to deter any rival. He reigned as James I of England and Ireland, thus effecting the Union of the Crowns, although England and Scotland remained separate sovereign states until 1707. His succession was rapidly ratified by Parliament.[9]\\r\\nJames's eldest surviving son and successor, Charles I, was overthrown and beheaded in 1649. The monarchy itself was abolished. A few years later, it was replaced by the Protectorate under Oliver Cromwell, effectively a monarch with the title of Lord Protector rather than King. Cromwell had the right to name his own successor, which he exercised on his deathbed by choosing his son, Richard Cromwell. Richard was ineffective, and was quickly forced from office. Shortly afterwards, the monarchy was restored, with Charles I's son Charles II as King.\\r\\nJames II and VII, a Roman Catholic, followed his brother Charles II, despite efforts in the late 1670s to exclude him in favour of Charles's illegitimate Protestant son, the Duke of Monmouth. James was deposed when his Protestant opponents forced him to flee from England in 1688. Parliament then deemed that James had, by fleeing the realms, abdicated the thrones and offered the Crowns not to the King's infant son James but to his Protestant daughter Mary and to her husband William, who as James's nephew was the first person in the succession not descended from him. The two became joint Sovereigns (a unique circumstance in British history) as William III of England and Ireland (and II of Scotland) and Mary II of England, Scotland and Ireland. William had insisted on this unique provision as a condition of his military leadership against James.\\r\\nThe English Bill of Rights passed in 1689 determined succession to the English, Scottish and Irish Thrones. First in the line were the descendants of Mary II. Next came Mary's sister Princess Anne and her descendants. Finally, the descendants of William by any future marriage were added to the line of succession. Only Protestants were allowed to succeed to the Thrones, and those who married Roman Catholics were excluded.\\r\\nAfter Mary II died in 1694, her husband continued to reign alone until his own death in 1702. The line of succession provided for by the Bill of Rights was almost at an end; William and Mary never had any children, and Princess Anne's children had all died. Therefore, Parliament passed the Act of Settlement. The Act maintained the provision of the Bill of Rights whereby William would be succeeded by Princess Anne and her descendants, and thereafter by his own descendants from future marriages. The Act, however, declared that they would be followed by James I & VI's granddaughter Sophia, Electress Dowager of Hanover (the daughter of James's daughter Elizabeth Stuart), and her heirs. As under the Bill of Rights, non-Protestants and those who married Roman Catholics were excluded.\\r\\nUpon William's death, Anne became Queen of England, Scotland and Ireland. Because the Parliament of England settled on Sophia as Anne's heir-presumptive without consulting Scottish leaders, the Estates of Scotland retaliated by passing the Scottish Act of Security. The Act provided that, upon the death of Anne, the Estates would meet to select an heir to the throne of Scotland, who could not be the same person as the English Sovereign unless numerous political and economic conditions were met. Anne originally withheld the Royal Assent, but was forced to grant it when the Estates refused to raise taxes and sought to withdraw troops from the Queen's army. England's Parliament responded by passing the Alien Act 1705, which threatened to cripple Scotland's economy by cutting off trade with them. Thus, Scotland had little choice but to unite with England to form the Kingdom of Great Britain in 1707; the Crown of the new nation (along with the Crown of Ireland) was subject to the rules laid down by the English Act of Settlement.\\r\\nAnne was predeceased by Sophia, Electress Dowager of Hanover, and was therefore succeeded by the latter's son, who became George I in 1714.\\r\\nAttempts were made in the risings of 1715 and 1745 to restore Stuart claimants to the Throne, supported by those who recognised the Jacobite succession. The House of Hanover nonetheless remained undeposed, and the Crown descended in accordance with the appointed rules. In 1801, following the Acts of Union 1800, the separate crowns of Great Britain and Ireland were merged and became the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland. Between 1811 and 1820, when George III was deemed unfit to rule, the Prince of Wales (later George IV) acted as his regent. Some years later the Regency Act 1830 made provision for a change in the line of succession had a child been born to William IV after his death, but this event did not come about.\\r\\nThe succession was next called into doubt in 1936, when Edward VIII abdicated in the same year as he succeeded to the throne immediately on his father's death. Edward was proclaimed King in January 1936,[10] and mounted the throne in the House of Lords for the first and last time at the opening of Parliament in November 1936, but he had not yet been crowned when he renounced the throne in December. Edward VIII had desired to marry Wallis Simpson, a divorcee, but the Church of England, of which the British Sovereign is Supreme Governor, would not authorise the marriage of divorcees. Consequently, Parliament passed His Majesty's Declaration of Abdication Act 1936, by which Edward VIII ceased to be Sovereign \\"immediately upon\\" his royal assent as King being signified in Parliament on 11 December. The Act provided that he and his descendants, if any, were not to have any \\"right, title or interest in or to the succession to the Throne\\". Edward died childless in 1972.\\r\\nEdward's abdication was \\"a demise of the Crown\\" (in the words of the Act), and the Duke of York, his brother who was then next in the line, immediately succeeded to the throne and to its \\"rights, privileges, and dignities\\", taking the regnal name George VI. He in turn was succeeded in 1952 by his own elder daughter, Elizabeth II. By that time the monarch of the United Kingdom no longer reigned in the greater part of Ireland (which had become a republic in 1949), but was the monarch of a number of independent sovereign states (Commonwealth realms).\\r\\nEach of the Commonwealth realms has the same person as monarch and, to maintain that arrangement, they have agreed to continue the same line of succession; some realms do so through domestic succession laws, while others stipulate whoever is monarch of the United Kingdom will also be monarch of that realm. In February 1952, on her accession, Elizabeth II was proclaimed as sovereign separately throughout her realms. In October 2011, the heads of government of all 16 realms agreed unanimously at a meeting held in Perth, Australia, to proposed changes to the royal succession laws that would see the order of succession for people born after 28 October 2011 governed by absolute primogeniturewherein succession passes to an individual's children according to birth order, regardless of genderinstead of male-preference primogeniture. They also agreed to lift a ban on those who marry Roman Catholics. The ban on Catholics themselves was retained to ensure that the monarch would be in communion with the Church of England.[11] The changes came into effect across the Commonwealth realms on 26 March 2015, after legislation was made according to each realm's constitution.[12][13]\\r\\nFollowing the changes coming into effect, the positions of the first 27 in line remained unchanged, including Princess Anne and her children and grandchildren, until the birth of Princess Charlotte of Cambridge on 2 May 2015. The first to be affected by the changes, on the day they came into effect in March, were the children of Lady Davina Lewisher son Tne (born 2012) and her daughter Senna (born 2010)who were reversed in the order of succession, becoming 29th and 28th in line respectively.[14]\\r\\nThe Bill of Rights and the Act of Settlement (restated by the Acts of Union) still govern succession to the throne. They were amended in the United Kingdom by the Succession to the Crown Act 2013, which was passed mainly \\"to make succession to the Crown not depend on gender\\" and \\"to make provision about Royal Marriages\\" (according to its long title), thereby implementing the Perth Agreement in the UK and in those realms that, by their laws, have as their monarch automatically whoever is monarch of the UK. Other realms passed their own legislation.\\r\\nAnyone ineligible to succeed is treated as if they were \\"dead\\". That individual's descendants are not also disqualified, unless they are personally ineligible.\\r\\nThe Act of Settlement 1701 provides that Protestant \\"heirs of the body\\" (that is, legitimate descendants) of Sophia, Electress of Hanover, are eligible to succeed to the throne, unless otherwise disqualified. The meaning of heir of the body is determined by the common law rules of male preference primogeniture (the \\"male-preference\\" criterion is no longer applicable, in respect of succession to the throne, to persons born after 28 October 2011), whereby older children and their descendants inherit before younger children, and a male child takes precedence over a female sibling.[15] Children born out of wedlock and adopted children are not eligible to succeed. Illegitimate children whose parents subsequently marry are legitimated, but remain ineligible to inherit the Crown.[n 4]\\r\\nThe Royal Marriages Act 1772 (repealed by the Succession to the Crown Act 2013) further required descendants of George II to obtain the consent of the reigning monarch to marry. (The requirement did not apply to descendants of princesses who married into foreign families, as well as, from 1936, any descendants of Edward VIII,[n 5] of which there are none.) The Act provided, however, that if a dynast older than twenty-five years notified the Privy Council of his or her intention to marry without the consent of the Sovereign, then he or she may have lawfully done so after one year, unless both houses of Parliament expressly disapproved of the marriage. A marriage that contravened the Royal Marriages Act was void, and the resulting offspring illegitimate and thus ineligible to succeed, though the succession of the dynast who failed to obtain consent was not itself affected. This also had the consequence that marriage to a Roman Catholic without permission was void, so that the dynast was not disqualified from succeeding on account of being married to a Roman Catholic. Thus when the future George IV attempted to marry the Roman Catholic Maria Fitzherbert in 1785 without obtaining permission from George III he did not disqualify himself from inheriting the throne in due course.[2] A marriage voided by the 1772 act prior to its repeal remains void \\"for all purposes relating to the succession to the Crown\\" under the 2013 act.[16]\\r\\nThe constitutional crisis arising from Edward VIII's decision to marry a divorcee in 1936 led to His Majesty's Declaration of Abdication Act 1936, which provided that Edward VIII and his descendants would have no claim to the throne.[17] The Act is no longer applicable, because Edward died in 1972 without issue.\\r\\nUnder the 2013 Succession to the Crown Act, the first six persons in line to the throne must obtain the sovereign's approval before marrying.[16] Marriage without the Sovereign's consent disqualifies the person and the person's descendants from the marriage from succeeding to the Crown,[16] but the marriage is still legally valid.\\r\\nRules relating to eligibility established by the Bill of Rights are retained under the Act of Settlement. The preamble to the Act of Settlement notes that the Bill of Rights provides \\"that all and every person and persons that then [at the time of the Bill of Right's passage] were, or afterwards should be reconciled to, or shall hold communion with the see or Church of Rome, or should profess the popish religion, or marry a papist, should be excluded.\\"[18] The Act of Settlement continues, providing \\"that all and every Person and Persons who shall  is, are or shall be reconciled to or shall hold Communion with the See or Church of Rome or shall profess the Popish religion or shall marry a papist shall be subject to such Incapacities\\"[19] as the Bill of Rights established.\\r\\nThe precise meaning of the aforementioned clauses is subject to contention. Under one interpretation, the religion of an individual at the precise moment of succession is relevant. Under another interpretation, anyone who has been a Roman Catholic at any time since 1689 (\\"then  or afterwards\\") is forever ineligible to succeed. The former interpretation allows a Roman Catholic to convert to Protestantism and succeed to the Throne just before a vacancy on the throne occurs devolving the crown on the first dynast in the line of succession; the latter does not. In either case, however, other denominations of faith are not affected; it is clear that any non-Catholic may convert to Protestantism and succeed to the Throne. It is a requirement that the monarch must be a Protestant.[1]\\r\\nThe Act of Settlement further provided that anyone who married a Roman Catholic was ineligible to succeed. The Act did not require that the spouse be Protestant; it only barred those who marry Roman Catholics. Since the passage of the Act it has been determined (in the case of Prince Edward, Duke of Kent) that an individual is not barred because his or her spouse later converts to Roman Catholicism after their marriage. The Succession to the Crown Act 2013 removed the bar on individuals married to Roman Catholics, though not on Roman Catholics themselves.\\r\\nUnder the Treason Act 1702 and the Treason (Ireland) Act 1703, it is treason to \\"endeavour to deprive or hinder any person who shall be the next in succession to the crown ... from succeeding ... to the imperial crown of this realm\\". Since the Crime and Disorder Act 1998, the maximum penalty has been life imprisonment.\\r\\nIn the Commonwealth realms, upon the death of a sovereign, the heir apparent or heir presumptive succeeds to the throne immediately, with no need for confirmation or further ceremony.[20][n 6] Nevertheless, the Accession Council meets and decides upon the making of the accession proclamation, which by custom has for centuries been ceremonially proclaimed in public places, in London, York, Edinburgh and other cities. The anniversary is observed throughout the sovereign's reign as Accession Day, including royal gun salutes in the United Kingdom.[22]\\r\\nFormerly, a new sovereign proclaimed his or her own accession. But on the death of Elizabeth I an Accession Council met to proclaim the accession of James I to the throne of England. James was then in Scotland and reigning as King James VI of Scotland. This precedent has been followed since. Now, the Accession Council normally meets in St James's Palace. Proclamations since James I's have usually been made in the name of the Lords Spiritual and Temporal, the Privy Council, the Lord Mayor, Aldermen and citizens of the City of London and \\"other principal Gentlemen of quality\\", though there have been variations in some proclamations. The proclamation of accession of Elizabeth II was the first to make mention of representatives of members of the Commonwealth.\\r\\nUpon his or her accession, a new sovereign is required by law to make and subscribe several oaths. The Bill of Rights of 1689 first required the sovereign to make a public declaration of non-belief in Roman Catholicism.[n 7] This declaration, known as the Accession Declaration, is required to be taken at either the first meeting of parliament of his or her reign (i.e. during the State Opening of Parliament) or at his or her coronation, whichever occurs first. The current wording of this declaration was adopted in 1910 as the previous wording was deemed to be controversial and overtly anti-Catholic. Rather than denouncing Roman Catholicism, the sovereign now declares him or herself to be a Protestant and that he or she will \\"uphold and maintain\\" the Protestant succession.[23] In addition to the Accession Declaration, the new sovereign is required by the Acts of Union 1707 to make an oath to \\"maintain and preserve\\" the Church of Scotland.[24] This oath is normally made at the sovereign's first meeting of the Privy Council following his or her accession. According to the Regency Act 1937, should the sovereign be under the age of 18, such oaths and declarations required to be taken by the sovereign shall be made upon his attainment of that age.[25]\\r\\nAfter a period of mourning,[26] the new sovereign is usually consecrated and crowned in Westminster Abbey. Normally, the Archbishop of Canterbury officiates, though the sovereign may designate any other bishop of the Church of England. A coronation is not necessary for a sovereign to reign; for example, Edward VIII was never crowned, yet during his short reign was the undoubted king.","input":"Who is heir to the throne of britain?"},{"output":"Ahmet Ertegun","context":"The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, located on the shore of Lake Erie in downtown Cleveland, Ohio, recognizes and archives the history of the best-known and most influential artists, producers, engineers, and other notable figures who have had some major influence on the development of rock and roll. The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame Foundation was established on April 20, 1983, by Atlantic Records founder and chairman Ahmet Ertegun. In 1986, Cleveland was chosen as the Hall of Fame's permanent home. Since opening in September 1995, the \\"Rock Hall\\" ÿ part of the city's redeveloped North Coast Harbor ÿ has hosted more than 10 million visitors and had a cumulative economic impact estimated at more than $1.8 billion.[2][3]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nFounder Ahmet Ertegun assembled a team that included attorney Suzan Evans, Rolling Stone magazine editor and publisher Jann S. Wenner, attorney Allen Grubman, and record executives Seymour Stein, Bob Krasnow, and Noreen Woods. The Foundation began inducting artists in 1986, but the Hall of Fame still had no home. The search committee considered several cities, including Philadelphia (home of Bill Haley and American Bandstand), Memphis (home of Sun Studios and Stax Records), Detroit (home of Motown Records), Cincinnati (home of King Records), New York City, and Cleveland.[citation needed]\\r\\nCleveland lobbied for the museum, citing that WJW disc jockey Alan Freed both coined the term \\"rock and roll\\" and heavily promoted the new genreand that Cleveland was the location of Freed's Moondog Coronation Ball, the first major rock and roll concert. In addition, Cleveland cited radio station WMMS, which played a key role in breaking several major acts in the U.S. during the 1970s and 80s, including artist David Bowie, who began his first U.S. tour in the city, Bruce Springsteen, Roxy Music, and Rush among many others.[4] Cleveland was also one of the premier tour stops for most rock bands.\\r\\nCivic leaders in Cleveland pledged $65 million in public money to fund the construction. A petition drive was signed by 600,000 fans favoring Cleveland over Memphis, and Cleveland ranked first in a 1986 USA Today poll asking where the Hall of Fame should be located. On May 5, 1986, the Hall of Fame Foundation chose Cleveland as the permanent home of the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and Museum. Sam Phillips of Sun Studios fame and many others were stunned and disappointed that it ended up in Cleveland. \\"The hall of fame should've been in Memphis, certainly,\\" wrote Peter Guralnick, author of an acclaimed two-volume Elvis Presley biography.[5]\\r\\nCleveland may also have been chosen as the organization's site because the city offered the best financial package. As The Plain Dealer music critic Michael Norman noted, \\"It was $65 million... Cleveland wanted it here and put up the money.\\" Co-founder Jann Wenner later said, \\"One of the small sad things is we didn't do it in New York in the first place,\\" but then added, \\"I am absolutely delighted that the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and Museum is in Cleveland.\\"\\r\\nDuring early discussions on where to build the Hall of Fame and Museum, the Foundation's board considered the Cuyahoga River. Ultimately, the chosen location was along East Ninth Street in downtown Cleveland by Lake Erie, east of Cleveland Stadium.\\r\\nAt one point in the planning phase when a financing gap existed, planners proposed locating the Rock Hall in the then-vacant May Company Building, but finally decided to commission architect I. M. Pei to design a new building. Initial CEO Dr. Larry R. Thompson facilitated I. M. Pei in designs for the site. Pei came up with the idea of a tower with a glass pyramid protruding from it. The museum tower was initially planned to stand 200?ft (61 m) high, but had to be cut down to 162?ft (49 m) due to its proximity to Burke Lakefront Airport. The building's base is approximately 150,000 square feet (14,000 m2). The groundbreaking ceremony took place on June 7, 1993. Pete Townshend, Chuck Berry, Billy Joel, Sam Phillips, Ruth Brown, Sam Moore of Sam and Dave, Carl Gardner of the Coasters and Dave Pirner of Soul Asylum all appeared at the groundbreaking.\\r\\nThe museum was dedicated on September 1, 1995, with the ribbon being cut by an ensemble that included Yoko Ono and Little Richard, among others, before a crowd of more than 10,000 people. The following night an all-star concert was held at the stadium. It featured Chuck Berry, Bob Dylan, Al Green, Jerry Lee Lewis, Aretha Franklin, Bruce Springsteen, Iggy Pop, John Fogerty, John Mellencamp, and many others.\\r\\nIn addition to the Hall of Fame inductees, the museum documents the entire history of rock and roll, regardless of induction status. Hall of Fame inductees are honored in a special exhibit located in a wing that juts out over Lake Erie.[6]\\r\\nSince 1986, the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame has selected new inductees. The formal induction ceremony has been held in New York City 25 times (1986ÿ92, 1994ÿ96, 1998ÿ2008, 2010ÿ11, 2014, and 2016); twice in Los Angeles (1993 and 2013); and four times in the Hall of Fame's home in Cleveland (1997, 2009, 2012, and 2015). Beginning in 2018, the induction ceremonies will alternate each year between Cleveland and New York.[7]\\r\\nThe 2009 and 2012 induction weeks were made possible by a publicÿprivate partnership between the City of Cleveland, the State of Ohio, the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, and local foundations, corporations, civic organizations and individuals. Collectively these entities invested $5.8 million in 2009 and $7.9 million in 2012 to produce a week of events, including free concerts, a gospel celebration, exhibition openings, free admission to the museum, and induction ceremonies filled with both fans and VIPs at Public Hall.[8]\\r\\nMillions viewed the television broadcast of the Cleveland inductions; tens of thousands traveled to Ohio during induction week to participate in Induction-related events. The economic impact of the 2009 induction week activities was more than $13 million, and it provided an additional $20 million in media exposure for the region. The 2012 induction week yielded similar results.[9]\\r\\nThere are seven levels in the building. On the lower level is the Ahmet M. Ertegun Exhibition Hall, the museum's main gallery. It includes exhibits on the roots of rock and roll (gospel, blues, rhythm & blues and folk, country and bluegrass). It also features exhibits on cities that have had a major impact on rock and roll: Memphis, Detroit, London and Liverpool, San Francisco, Los Angeles, New York and Seattle. There are exhibits about soul music, the Fifties, Sun Records, Atlantic Records, hip hop music, Cleveland's rock and roll legacy, the music of the Midwest, rock and roll radio and dee-jays, and the many protests against rock and roll. This gallery also has exhibits that focus on individual artists, including the Beatles, the Rolling Stones, Jimi Hendrix and others. Finally, the Ahmet M. Ertegun Exhibition Hall includes two theaters, one of which features a film about the roots of rock and roll and one that features films on various subjects.[10]\\r\\nThe first floor of the museum is the entrance level. It includes a cafe, a stage that the museum uses for various special performances and events throughout the year, and a section called \\"Backstage Stories.\\" The second floor includes several interactive kiosks that feature programs on one-hit wonders and the Songs That Shaped Rock and Roll. This level also includes a gallery with artifact-filled exhibits about Les Paul, Alan Freed, Sam Phillips and the evolution of audio technology.[11]\\r\\nVisitors enter the Hall of Fame section of the museum on the third floor. This section includes \\"The Power of Rock Experience,\\" which includes one of Jonathan Demme's final works, a film shown in the Connor Theater. The film includes musical highlights from some of the Hall's induction ceremonies.[12] Visitors exit the Hall of Fame section on the fourth floor. That level features the Foster Theater, a state-of-the-art 3-D theater that is used for special events and programs.[13][14]\\r\\nFinally, the top two levels of the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame feature large, temporary exhibits. Over the years, numerous exhibits have been installed on these two levels, including exhibits about Elvis Presley, hip-hop, the Supremes, the Who, U2, John Lennon, the Clash, Bruce Springsteen, Women Who Rock, and the Rolling Stones.\\r\\nDesigned by I.

The tower supports a dual-triangular-shaped glass \\"tent\\" that extends (at its base) onto a 65,000-square-foot plaza that provides a main entry facade.\\r\\nThe building houses more than 55,000 square feet of exhibition space, as well as administrative offices, a store, and a caf.\\r\\n\\"In designing this building,\\" Pei said, \\"it was my intention to echo the energy of rock and roll. I have consciously used an architectural vocabulary that is bold and new, and I hope the building will become a dramatic landmark for the city of Cleveland and for fans of rock and roll around the world.\\" [15]\\r\\nSince 1997, the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame has featured numerous temporary exhibits that range in size from major exhibits that fill the top two floors of the museum to smaller exhibits that are often installed in the main exhibition hall on the lower level.\\r\\nThe museum's first major exhibit opened on May 10, 1997. It was called I Want to Take You Higher: The Psychedelic Era, 1965 ÿ 1969. It included artifacts from numerous artists, including John Lennon, Eric Clapton, John Sebastian, the Jefferson Airplane, and Janis Joplin, as well as artifacts related to the Monterey International Pop Festival and Woodstock.\\r\\nThat exhibit was followed by Elvis is in the Building, an exhibit about the \\"King of Rock and Roll\\", which ran from August 8, 1998, to September 5, 1999. This year-long tribute was the first ever special exhibit devoted to a single artist, Elvis Presley, the first inductee into the RRHOF in 1986. Graceland supplied a significant selection of representative artifacts for this special tribute spanning Elvis' life and legendary career. (see Larry G. Keeter, \\"Elvis Is In the Building,\\" \\"Elvis International Forum,\\" Summer 2000, pp.?28ÿ29) Next, the museum curated Roots, Rhymes and Rage: The Hip-Hop Story. That was the first major museum exhibit to focus on hip-hop. It ran from November 11, 1999, to August 6, 2000. It was followed by Rock Style, an exhibit that focused on rock and roll and fashion. It featured clothing from Buddy Holly to Alice Cooper, from Ray Charles to David Bowie and from Smokey Robinson to Sly Stone. After it closed in Cleveland, Rock Style traveled to other museums in the U.S.\\r\\nOther temporary exhibits have included Lennon: His Life and Work, which ran from October 20, 2000, to January 1, 2003. It was followed by In the Name of Love: Two Decades of U2 and then Reflections: The Mary Wilson Supreme Legacy Collection. A major exhibition on display during the Republican National Convention in Cleveland in 2016 was Louder than Words: Rock, Power, Politics.[16]\\r\\nOther large temporary exhibits have focused on the Clash (Revolution Rock: The Story of the Clash), the Doors (Break on Through: The Lasting Legacy of the Doors), the Who's Tommy (Tommy: The Amazing Journey), and Bruce Springsteen (From Asbury Park to the Promised Land: The Life and Music of Bruce Springsteen). Another thematic temporary exhibit focused on the role of women in rock and roll (Women Who Rock: Vision, Passion, Power). Many of these exhibits travel to other museums after closing in Cleveland. The museum's current major temporary exhibit is about the history of the magazine Rolling Stone.[17]\\r\\nThe Rock and Roll Hall of Fame also curates many smaller temporary exhibits. Over the years, these exhibits have focused on such topics as the Vans Warped Tour, the Concert for Bangladesh, Woodstock's 40th anniversary, Austin City Limits, the Monterey International Pop Festival, Roy Orbison, Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers, Marty Stuart, Paul Simon, Graham Nash, and John Mellencamp.\\r\\nThe museum also devotes exhibits to photography and artwork related to rock and roll. Among the photographers whose work has been featured at the Hall of Fame are George Kalinsky, Alfred Wertheimer, Tommy Edwards, Kevin Mazur, Janet Macoska, Lynn Goldsmith, Mike McCartney, Robert Alford,[18] and George Shuba. The museum also featured the artwork of Philip Burke in one of its temporary exhibits, and a later exhibit featured Herb Ritts.[19][20]\\r\\nThe Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and Museum produces numerous public programs, including concerts, interviews, lectures, film screenings, and other events that help tell the story of rock and roll. Every February, the museum celebrates Black History Month[21] by hosting concerts, film screenings and lectures that illustrate the important role African-Americans have played in the history of rock and roll. Since the program began in 1996, such artists as Robert Lockwood, Jr., the Temptations, Charles Brown, Ruth Brown, the Ohio Players, Lloyd Price, Little Anthony and the Imperials, and Al Green have appeared at the museum during Black History Month.\\r\\nAnother program is the Hall of Fame Series. This series began in April 1996 and features interviews with Hall of Fame inductees in a rare and intimate settings, most often in the Museum's Foster Theater. The interviews are usually followed by a question-and-answer session with the audience and, often, a performance by the inductee. Among the inductees who have taken part in this series are Darryl \\"DMC\\" McDaniels of Run-D.M.C., Lloyd Price, Marky Ramone, Seymour Stein, Ray Manzarek of the Doors, Ronnie Spector, Bootsy Collins, Ann and Nancy Wilson of Heart, and Jorma Kaukonen of the Jefferson Airplane.\\r\\nA similar program is the Legends Series. The only real difference between this program and the Hall of Fame Series is that it features artists who have not yet been inducted into the Hall of Fame. Peter Hook of Joy Division, Spinderella of Salt n Pepa, Tommy James, and the Chi-Lites are among the artists who have participated in the Legends Series.\\r\\nThe Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and Museum's most acclaimed program is the annual American Music Masters series. Each year the museum celebrates one of the Hall's inductees with a week-long series of programs that include interviews, film screenings, and, often, a special exhibit. The celebration ends with an all-star concert held at a Cleveland theater. The concerts include a diverse mix of artists, from Hall of Fame inductees to contemporary musicians.\\r\\nThe American Music Masters series began in 1996 with Hard Travelin': The Life and Legacy of Pete Seeger. Since then, the programs have honored the following inductees: Jimmie Rodgers (1997), Robert Johnson (1998), Louis Jordan (1999), Muddy Waters (2000), Bessie Smith (2001), Hank Williams (2002), Buddy Holly (2003), Lead Belly (2004), Sam Cooke (2005), Roy Orbison (2006), Jerry Lee Lewis (2007), Les Paul (2008),[22] Janis Joplin (2009),[23] Fats Domino and Dave Bartholomew (2010), Aretha Franklin (2011),[24] and Chuck Berry (2012).[25]\\r\\nHall of Fame museum curator James Henke, along with \\"the museum's curatorial staff and numerous rock critics and music experts\\", created an unordered list of \\"500 Songs That Shaped Rock and Roll\\".[26][27] The list is part of a permanent exhibit at the museum, and was envisioned as part of the museum from its opening in 1995.[28] It contains songs recorded from the 1920s through the 1990s. The Beatles with seven songs was the most represented on the 500ÿsong list. The oldest song on the list is \\"Wabash Cannonball\\", written circa 1882 and credited to J. A. Roff. Since then, however, an additional 155 songs have been added, and the list is now simply referred to as \\"The Songs That Shaped Rock and Roll.\\" The most recent songs on the list are Gnarls Barkley's \\"Crazy\\" and My Chemical Romance's \\"Welcome to the Black Parade,\\" both released in 2006.[29] The Beatles and the Rolling Stones are the most represented on the 655ÿsong list, with eight songs each.\\r\\nThe Rock and Roll Hall of Fame celebrated its 25th anniversary with a concert series over two days on October 29 and 30, 2009 at Madison Square Garden in New York. The celebration included performances by Jerry Lee Lewis, U2, Patti Smith, Bruce Springsteen & the E Street Band, Simon & Garfunkel, Dion DiMucci, Metallica, James Taylor, Bonnie Raitt, Fergie, Mick Jagger, Lou Reed, Ray Davies, Ozzy Osbourne, Paul Simon, Jeff Beck, Buddy Guy, Aretha Franklin, Stevie Wonder, Sting, Little Anthony & the Imperials, and Crosby, Stills and Nash. The first night ran almost six hours with Bruce Springsteen & the E Street Band closing the concert with special guests John Fogerty, Darlene Love, Tom Morello, Sam Moore, Jackson Browne, Peter Wolf, and Billy Joel.[30][31][32]\\r\\nArtists are inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame at an annual induction ceremony. Over the years, the majority of the ceremonies have been held at the Waldorf-Astoria Hotel in New York City. However, on January 12, 1993, the ceremony was held in Los Angeles, and was held there again in 2013. On May 6, 1997, about a year and a half after the opening of the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and Museum, the ceremony was held in Cleveland. It returned to Cleveland in 2009 and again in 2012. Current plans call for the ceremony to be in Cleveland every three years. Generally, the number of inductees ranges from about a half-dozen to a dozen. Virtually all living inductees have attended the ceremonies, and they are presented with their Hall of Fame award by an artist who was influenced by that inductee's music. Both the presenter and the inductee speak at the ceremonies, which also include numerous musical performances, by both the inductees and the presenters. The first group of inductees, inducted on January 23, 1986, included Elvis Presley, James Brown, Little Richard, Fats Domino, Ray Charles, Chuck Berry, Sam Cooke, the Everly Brothers, Buddy Holly, and Jerry Lee Lewis. Robert Johnson, Jimmie Rodgers, and Jimmy Yancey were inducted as Early Influences, John Hammond received the Lifetime Achievement Award and Alan Freed and Sam Phillips were inducted as Non-Performers.\\r\\nA nominating committee composed of rock and roll historians selects names for the \\"Performers\\" category (singers, vocal groups, bands, and instrumentalists of all kinds), which are then voted on by roughly five hundred experts across the world. Those selected to vote include academics, journalists, producers, and others with music industry experience. Artists become eligible for induction 25 years after the release of their first record. Criteria include the influence and significance of the artists' contributions to the development and perpetuation of rock and roll. To be selected for induction, performers must receive the highest number of votes, and also greater than 50% of the votes. Around five to seven performers are inducted each year.[33]\\r\\nIn 2012, six additional groups, the Miracles, the Famous Flames, the Comets, the Blue Caps, the Midnighters, and the Crickets, were inducted as performers by a special committee due to the controversial exclusions when their lead singer was inducted. \\"There was a lot of discussion about this,\\" said Terry Stewart, a member of the nominating committee. \\"There had always been conversations about why the groups weren't included when the lead singers were inducted. Very honestly, nobody could really answer that question ÿ it was so long ago... We decided we'd sit down as an organization and look at that. This is the result.\\"[34]\\r\\nEarly Influences includes artists from earlier eras, primarily country, folk, and blues, whose music inspired and influenced rock and roll artists. Other notable artists that have been inducted as Early Influences include Bill Kenny & The Ink Spots, country musicians Jimmie Rodgers and Hank Williams, blues musicians Howlin' Wolf and Muddy Waters, and jazz musicians Jelly Roll Morton and Louis Armstrong. After Nat King Cole and Billie Holiday in 2000, no one was inducted in this category until 2009, when rockabilly singer Wanda Jackson was selected. Unlike earlier inductees in this category, Jackson's career almost entirely took place after the traditional 1955 start of the \\"rock era\\".\\r\\nFormerly the \\"Non-Performers\\" award, this category encompasses those who primarily work behind the scenes in the music industry, including record label executives, songwriters, record producers, disc jockeys, concert promoters and music journalists. This category has had at least one inductee every year except 2007 and 2009. Following the death of the Hall of Fame's co-founder Ahmet Ertegun, this award was renamed in his honor in 2008.[35]\\r\\nFormerly the \\"Sidemen\\" award, this category was introduced in 2000 and honors veteran session and concert players who are selected by a committee composed primarily of producers. The category was dormant from 2004 through 2007 and re-activated in 2008. This honor was renamed the \\"Award for Musical Excellence\\" in 2010. According to Joel Peresman, the president of the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame Foundation, \\"This award gives us flexibility to dive into some things and recognize some people who might not ordinarily get recognized.\\"[36]\\r\\nThe Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and Museum's Library and Archives is the world's most comprehensive repository of materials related to the history of rock and roll. The Library and Archives is located in a new building on the Metro Campus of Cuyahoga Community College in Cleveland's Campus District.\\r\\nThe Library and Archives' mission is to collect, preserve and provide access to these materials. The Library and Archives operates on two levels: people may come into the library and read the books and magazines, listen to music and other recordings, and watch videos and films. More serious scholars, historians and journalists may also make an appointment for access to the archival collections under the supervision of the staff archivists.\\r\\nThe library is composed of books, academic dissertations, and other references. It also includes popular magazines, scholarly journals and trade publications; commercial audio and video recordings, and research databases.\\r\\nThe archival collections include music-business records from record executives, artist managers, labels, historic venues, recording studios, specialists in stage design and lighting, and long-running concert tours. The collections also contain important individual items, such as personal letters penned by Aretha Franklin and Madonna, handwritten working lyrics by Jimi Hendrix and LL Cool J, papers from music journalists such as Sue Cassidy Clark, and rare concert recordings from CBGB in the 1970s.[37][38][39]\\r\\nThe most frequent criticism of the Hall of Fame is that the nomination process is controlled by a few individuals who are not themselves musicians, such as founder Jann Wenner (co-founder and editor-in-chief of Rolling Stone magazine), former foundation director Suzan Evans, and writer Dave Marsh, reflecting their personal tastes rather than the views of the rock world as a whole. A former member of the nominations board once commented that \\"At one point Suzan Evans lamented the choices being made because there weren't enough big names that would sell tickets to the dinner. That was quickly remedied by dropping one of the doo-wop groups being considered in favor of a 'name' artist ... I saw how certain pioneering artists of the '50s and early '60s were shunned because there needed to be more name power on the list, resulting in '70s superstars getting in before the people who made it possible for them. Some of those pioneers still aren't in today.\\"[40] Sister Rosetta Tharpe is often considered \\"The Godmother/Grandmother of Rock & Roll\\",[41][42] but has yet to be inducted. Also, the influential soul/funk group Tower of Power has not yet been honored. Velvet Underground drummer Maureen Tucker has dismissed the Hall of Fame as the \\"Hall of Lame\\".[43]\\r\\nThere is also controversy in the lack of transparency in the selection process. Janet Morrissey of The New York Times wrote:\\r\\n\\"With fame and money at stake, it's no surprise that a lot of backstage lobbying goes on. Why any particular act is chosen in any particular year is a mystery to performers as well as outsiders ÿ and committee members say they want to keep it that way.\\"[44]\\r\\nJon Landau, the chairman of the nominating committee, says they prefer it that way. \\"We've done a good job of keeping the proceedings nontransparent. It all dies in the room.\\"[44]\\r\\nAccording to Fox News, petitions with tens of thousands of signatures were also being ignored, and some groups that were signed with certain labels or companies or were affiliated with various committee members have even been put up for nomination with no discussion at all.[40] The committee has also been accused of largely ignoring certain genres.[45] According to author Brett Milano, \\"entire genres get passed over, particularly progressive rock, '60s Top 40, New Orleans funk and a whole lot of black music.\\"[46] In contrast, since the mid-2000s (decade), numerous hip hop artists have been inducted, including Tupac Shakur (class of 2017), N.W.A (class of 2016) and Grandmaster Flash and the Furious Five (class of 2007).[47]\\r\\nAnother criticism is that too many artists are inducted. In fifteen years, 97 different artists were inducted.[48] A minimum of 50% of the vote is needed to be inducted; although, the final percentages are not announced and a certain number of inductees (five in 2011) is set before the ballots are shipped.[48] The committee usually nominates a small number of artists (12 in 2010) from an increasing number of different genres. Several voters, including Joel Selvin, himself a former member of the nominating committee, did not submit their ballots in 2007 because they did not feel that any of the candidates were truly worthy.[49]\\r\\nMembers of the British punk rock band The Sex Pistols, inducted in 2006, refused to attend the ceremony, calling the museum \\"a piss stain\\" and \\"urine in wine\\".[50]\\r\\nIn BBC Radio 6 Music's Annual John Peel Lecture in 2013, the singer Charlotte Church accused the museum of gender bias, stating, \\"Out of 295 acts and artists in the Rock n' Roll Hall of Fame, 259 are entirely male, meaning that Tina Weymouth's part in Talking Heads makes them one of the 36 female acts.\\"[51][52] In fact, the actual percentage of woman inductees is 8.5%.[53] Combining all the categories, there have been 719 inductees, out of which only 61 have been women, none of which has been inducted more than once or awarded the Lifetime Achievement.[54]\\r\\nOn March 14, 2007, two days after that year's induction ceremony, Roger Friedman of Fox News published an article claiming that the Dave Clark Five should have been the fifth inductee, as they had more votes than inductee Grandmaster Flash and the Furious Five. The article went on to say \\"Jann Wenner used a technicality about the day votes were due in. In reality, The Dave Clark Five got six more votes than Grandmaster Flash. But he felt we couldn't go another year without a rap act.\\"[47]\\r\\nThe Rock and Roll Hall of Fame Foundation would later deny fixing the vote, although they did not deny that late votes were received, saying, \\"No. There is a format and rules and procedure. There is a specific time when the votes have to be in, and then they are counted. The bands with the top five votes got in.\\"[55] The Dave Clark Five was subsequently nominated again and then inducted the following year.[56]\\r\\nIn June 2007, Monkee Peter Tork complained to the New York Post that Wenner had blackballed the Monkees, commenting:\\r\\n[Wenner] doesn't care what the rules are and just operates how he sees fit. It is an abuse of power. I don't know whether the Monkees belong in the Hall of Fame, but it's pretty clear that we're not in there because of a personal whim. Jann seems to have taken it harder than everyone else, and now, 40 years later, everybody says, 'What's the big deal? Everybody else does it.' [Uses studio artists or backing bands.] Nobody cares now except him. He feels his moral judgment in 1967 and 1968 is supposed to serve in 2007.\\r\\nIn a Facebook post, fellow Monkee Michael Nesmith stated that he does not know if the Monkees belong in the Hall of Fame because he can only see the impact of the Monkees from the inside, and further stated: \\"I can see the HOF (Hall of Fame) is a private enterprise. It seems to operate as a business, and the inductees are there by some action of the owners of the Enterprise. The inductees appear to be chosen at the owner's pleasure. This seems proper to me. It is their business in any case. It does not seem to me that the HOF carries a public mandate, nor should it be compelled to conform to one.\\"[57]\\r\\nVarious magazines and news outlets, such as Time,[58] NPR radio,[59] The Christian Science Monitor,[60] Goldmine magazine,[61][62] Yahoo Music[63] and MSNBC [64] have argued that the Monkees belong in the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.","input":"Who founded the rock and roll hall of fame?"},{"output":"April 14, 2017","context":"The Lost City of Z is a 2016 American biographical adventure drama film written and directed by James Gray, based on the 2009 book of the same name by David Grann.[4] It describes real events surrounding British explorer Percy Fawcett who was sent to Bolivia and later made several attempts to find an ancient lost city in the Amazon and disappeared in 1925 along with his son on an expedition.[5] It stars Charlie Hunnam as Fawcett[6] along with Robert Pattinson as his fellow explorer Henry Costin and Sienna Miller as his wife Nina Fawcett.[7]\\r\\nThe film had its world premiere as closing night film on October 15, 2016, at the New York Film Festival[8] and was released in the United States on April 14, 2017, by Amazon Studios and Bleecker Street.[9] The film was praised by critics, though it only grossed $17.2 million against a $30 million budget.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nIn Ireland in 1905, Percy Fawcett is a young British officer participating in a stag hunt on an Irish baronial estate for the benefit of the visiting Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria. A skilled horseman and marksman, he brings down the stag swiftly but is snubbed at the after-hunt party. A year later, Fawcett is sent to London to meet with officials of the Royal Geographical Society. The governments of Bolivia and Brazil are nearly at war over the location of their mutual boundary, and have asked the British government to survey it. Fawcett agrees to lead the survey party to restore his family's good name. On the ship to Brazil, Fawcett meets Corporal Henry Costin, who has knowledge of the Amazon rainforest. At a large rubber plantation in the jungle owned by the Portuguese nobleman Baron de Gondoris, the two meet Corporal Arthur Manley, who tells them that the British government advises against further exploration. Fawcett, with several guides and the Amazonian scout Tadjui, completes the mission. Tadjui tells Fawcett stories about a city in the jungle covered in gold and full of people. Fawcett dismisses such stories as insane ravings, but discovers highly advanced broken pottery and some small stone statues in the jungle that convince him Tadjui's story was true.\\r\\nFawcett is praised after his return to England, where his wife, Nina, has given birth to their second son. In the Trinity College Library, Nina discovers a conquistador text which tells of a city deep in the Amazon jungle. Fawcett meets the renowned biologist James Murray, who agrees to back Fawcett's expedition to the Amazon to find what Fawcett calls \\"the Lost City of Z\\". Fawcett attempts to convince the members of the RGS to back the expedition, but is publicly ridiculed. Nevertheless, the RGS backs the expedition to further exploration of the Amazon basin. Murray is unused to the rigors of the deep jungle, and slows the party down significantly. The Fawcett group is attacked while traveling along the river. However, Fawcett makes peace with the natives. Murray suffers a severe knee injury which becomes infected, and he begins to go mad. Fawcett sends him off with a native guide and the group's last pack animal to find aid. Fawcett's team are forced to abandon the expedition after discovering that Murray poured paraffin on their remaining supplies.\\r\\nMurray survives, and accuses Fawcett in front of the RGS trustees of abandoning him in the jungle. Fawcett elects to resign from the society rather than apologize. World War I breaks out in Europe, and Fawcett goes to France to fight. In the Battle of the Somme, Manley dies in the trenches, and Fawcett is temporarily blinded during a chlorine gas attack. Jack, Fawcett's eldest son who had long accused Fawcett of abandoning the family, reconciles with his father in the hospital.\\r\\nIn 1923, Fawcett is living in obscurity in England. American interest in exploring the Amazon has reached a fever pitch, primarily due to Fawcett's stories of the lost city. John D. Rockefeller Jr. and a consortium of American newspapers finance a new Fawcett expedition. The RGS co-funds the expedition at the last moment as a matter of British pride. Fawcett shows Sir John Scott Keltie a compass, informing Keltie that should the lost city be found by Fawcett, the compass will be sent back to England. Percy and Jack intend to go alone this time, traveling as light as they can for up to three years in order to find Z. Fawcett invites Costin along, but he declines. Percy and Jack are attacked by natives and escapeonly to run into an ambush by a second group of Amazonians. This second tribe give the Fawcetts a fair hearing, but are puzzled by them, noticing that their spirits aren't wholly of their own world but also not wholly of the Amazon. They declare that the spirits of the Fawcetts \\"must belong\\" somewhere and they will help them find it. Percy and Jack are drugged during a ceremony and carried away.\\r\\nYears later, Nina Fawcett meets with Keltie, now the head of the RGS, claiming she has heard that Percy and Jack are alive and living with tribespeople. The RGS, having sent more than a hundred people to search for Fawcett over the last several years, declines to send another expedition. Keltie advises Nina to come to terms with her husband's death, but she refuses. Nina instead shows Keltie a package, and on opening it, it contains the compass Fawcett had promised to send back if he found the city.\\r\\nOriginally James Gray was hired by Paramount Pictures and Plan B Entertainment to write and direct the film based on David Grann's 2009 book in February 2009 but the film remained in development stage for six years. Based on his previous films, Gray was not initially sure why Plan B sent him the book. He explains, \\"When I was sent the book in the fall of 2008, it hadnt yet been published. I didnt know what it was and I hadnt heard of the story at all. It takes place outside of New York, and its a period piece in the United Kingdom and the jungle. So I had no idea why the people at Plan B decided to send me this book, because nothing in my prior work had shown that I could do anything like this. Maybe it was an act of madness on their part.\\"[11]\\r\\nIn a 2015 interview with IndieWire, Gray admitted that he had developed the script for a while before moving towards production.[12] He explained that \\"(it's) very complicated production and the story is amazing, but it's a complicated story. And you want to get it right. It's a very, very scary proposition to go into the jungle and all that. But at the same time it's terrific. It's why you make movies.\\"[12]\\r\\nThe project went through numerous casting changes for the lead role. Initially Brad Pitt was to star as Colonel Percy Fawcett, additionally providing production duties through his Plan B Entertainment.[13][14] In November 2010, Pitt withdrew from the lead role due to scheduling conflicts, but remained attached as the producer to the film.[15] On September 4, 2013, Benedict Cumberbatch came on board to portray Fawcett,[16] along with Robert Pattinson, who also joined the cast as fellow explorer Henry Costin.[17][18]\\r\\nIn February 2015, Cumberbatch also dropped out of the project due to scheduling conflicts, and was replaced by Charlie Hunnam, while Sienna Miller also joined the cast as Nina Fawcett.[19][20]\\r\\nPrincipal photography began on August 19, 2015, in Belfast, Northern Ireland and continued for five weeks through late September 2015.[21][22] After that, filming moved to Santa Marta, Colombia, South America and continued through September and October 2015.[23][24] On August 28, 2015, filming took place at Greyabbey Village and Strangford Lough in Northern Ireland.[25] Hunnam and Miller filmed scenes at Ballintoy County Antrim on August 31, 2015.[26][27] Filming took place at Craigavon House, East Belfast on September 2, 2015.[28]\\r\\nHunnam, Pattinson, Miller and Macfadyen shot scenes at Methodist College Belfast on September 3, 2015.[29] On September 7, 2015, scenes were filmed at Belfast City Hall and on the grounds of Royal Belfast Academical Institution.[30] Scenes were also shot at Bangor Castle Leisure Centre on September 13, 2015.[31]\\r\\nChristopher Spelman composed the music of the film.

In 2011, the Sumatran elephant has been classified as critically endangered by IUCN as the population has declined by at least 80% over the last three generations, estimated to be about 75 years. The subspecies is pre-eminently threatened by habitat loss, degradation and fragmentation, and poaching; over 69% of potential elephant habitat has been lost within the last 25 years. Much of the remaining forest cover is in blocks smaller than 250?km2 (97?sq?mi), which are too small to contain viable elephant populations.[1]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn general, Asian elephants are smaller than African elephants and have the highest body point on the head. The tip of their trunk has one finger-like process. Their back is convex or level. Females are usually smaller than males, and have short or no tusks.[2]\\r\\n\\r\\nSumatran elephants reach a shoulder height of between 2 and 3.2?m (6.6 and 10.5?ft), weigh between 2,000 and 4,000?kg (4,400 and 8,800?lb), and have 20 pairs of ribs. Their skin color is lighter than of maximus and indicus with least depigmentation.[3]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Sumatran elephant was once widespread on the island, and Riau Province was believed to have the largest elephant population in Sumatra with over 1,600 individuals in the 1980s.[1] In 1985, an island-wide rapid survey suggested that between 2,800 and 4,800 elephants lived in all eight mainland provinces of Sumatra in 44 populations. Twelve of these populations occurred in Lampung Province, where only three populations were extant in 2002 according to surveys carried out between September 2000 and March 2002. The population in Bukit Barisan Selatan National Park was estimated at 498 individuals, while the population in Way Kambas National Park was estimated at 180 individuals. The third population in Gunung RindinganÿWay Waya complex was considered to be too small to be viable over the long-term.[4]\\r\\n\\r\\nBy 2008, elephants had become locally extinct in 23 of the 43 ranges identified in Sumatra in 1985, indicating a very significant decline of the Sumatran elephant population up to that time. By 2008, the elephant was locally extinct in West Sumatra Province and at risk of being lost from North Sumatra Province too. In Riau Province only about 350 elephants survived across nine separate ranges.[1]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe current Sumatran elephant population is estimated at 2,400ÿ2,800 wild individuals, excluding elephants in camps, in 25 fragmented populations across the island. More than 85% of their habitat is outside of protected areas.[5]\\r\\n\\r\\nFemale elephants stop reproducing after 60 years of age. The maximum longevity in the wild is around 60 years. Female captive elephants have survived until 75 years while males have survived 60 years.[6]\\r\\n\\r\\nBirth happens at night and lasts approximately 10 seconds. The infant is able to stand up on its own after 10 to 30 minutes.[7]\\r\\n\\r\\nDue to conversion of forests into human settlements and agricultural areas, many of the Sumatran elephant populations have lost their habitat to humans. As a result, many elephants have been removed from the wild or directly killed. In addition to conflict related death, elephants are also targets of poaching for their ivory. Between 1985 and 2007, 50% of Sumatran elephants died.[1] Between 1980 and 2005, 69% of potential Sumatran elephant habitat was lost within just one elephant generation, and the driving forces that caused this habitat loss still remain essentially unchecked. There is clear, direct evidence from two provinces, Riau and Lampung, which shows entire elephant populations have disappeared as a result of habitat loss.[4]\\r\\n\\r\\nMost of the elephants found in Sumatran camps were captured after crop-raiding in protected areas. The reduction of the elephants' habitat for illegal conversion of agriculture still continues.[8]\\r\\n\\r\\nBetween 2012 and 2015, 36 elephants were found dead in Aceh Province due to poisoning, electrocution and traps. Most dead elephants were found near palm oil plantations. Conservationists think that Sumatran elephants may become extinct in less than ten years if poaching is not stopped.[9]\\r\\n\\r\\nElephas maximus is listed on CITES Appendix I. Sumatran elephants are protected under Indonesia law.[1]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 2004, the Tesso Nilo National Park has been established in Riau Province to protect the Sumatran elephant's habitat. This forest is one of the last areas large enough to support a viable population of elephants.[10]\\r\\n\\r\\nBetween 1986 and 1995, 520 wild elephants were captured and kept in six Elephant Training Centres, which have been established since 1986 in the provinces of Lampung, Aceh, Bengkulu, North and South Sumatra, and Riau. Capturing wild elephants was stopped in 1999, since the maintenance of captive elephants was too expensive, their management had not become self-financing and because some of the centres were overcrowded. By the end of 2000, 391 elephants were kept in the centres, and a few more in zoos, safari parks and tourist areas.[11]","input":"How many sumatran elephants are left in the world?"},{"output":"in the Cusco Region, Urubamba Province, Machupicchu District","context":"Machu Picchu (Spanish pronunciation:?[?mat?u ?pit?u]) (Quechua: Machu Picchu;[1] [?mt?u ?pixt?u]) is a 15th-century Inca citadel situated on a mountain ridge 2,430 metres (7,970?ft) above sea level.[2][3] It is located in the Cusco Region, Urubamba Province, Machupicchu District in Peru,[4] above the Sacred Valley, which is 80 kilometres (50?mi) northwest of Cuzco and through which the Urubamba River flows.\\r\\nMost archaeologists believe that Machu Picchu was constructed as an estate for the Inca emperor Pachacuti (1438ÿ1472). Often mistakenly referred to as the \\"Lost City of the Incas\\" (a title more accurately applied to Vilcabamba), it is the most familiar icon of Inca civilization. The Incas built the estate around 1450 but abandoned it a century later at the time of the Spanish Conquest. Although known locally, it was not known to the Spanish during the colonial period and remained unknown to the outside world until American historian Hiram Bingham brought it to international attention in 1911.\\r\\nMachu Picchu was built in the classical Inca style, with polished dry-stone walls. Its three primary structures are the Intihuatana, the Temple of the Sun, and the Room of the Three Windows. Most of the outlying buildings have been reconstructed in order to give tourists a better idea of how they originally appeared.[5] By 1976, thirty percent of Machu Picchu had been restored[6] and restoration continues.[7]\\r\\nMachu Picchu was declared a Peruvian Historic Sanctuary in 1981 and a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1983.[3] In 2007, Machu Picchu was voted one of the New Seven Wonders of the World in a worldwide Internet poll.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the Quechua language, machu means \\"old\\" or \\"old person\\", while pikchu means \\"peak; mountain or prominence with a broad base that ends in sharp peaks\\",[8] hence the name of the site means \\"old peak\\".\\r\\nMachu Picchu was built around 1450, at the height of the Inca.[10] Its construction appears to date to the period of the two great Inca rulers, Pachacutec Inca Yupanqui (1438ÿ71) and T~pac Inca Yupanqui (1472ÿ93).[11] It was abandoned just over 100 years later, in 1572, as a belated result of the Spanish Conquest.[10][12] It is possible that most of its inhabitants died from smallpox introduced by travellers before the Spanish conquistadors arrived in the area.[13]\\r\\nAlthough it was located only about 80 kilometers (50?mi) from the Inca capital in Cusco, the Spanish never found Machu Picchu and so did not plunder or destroy it, as they did many other sites.[14] The conquistadors had notes of a place called Piccho, although no record of a Spanish visit exists. The types of sacred rocks defaced by the conquistadors in other locations are untouched at Machu Picchu.[12]\\r\\nOver the centuries, the surrounding jungle overgrew the site, and few outside the immediate area knew of its existence. The site may have been discovered and plundered in 1867 by a German businessman, Augusto Berns.[15] Some evidence indicates that German engineer J. M. von Hassel arrived earlier. Maps show references to Machu Picchu as early as 1874.[16]\\r\\nIn 1911 American historian and explorer Hiram Bingham travelled the region looking for the old Inca capital and was led to Machu Picchu by a local farmer. Bingham brought Machu Picchu to international attention and organized another expedition in 1912 to undertake major clearing and excavation. He returned in 1914 and 1915 to continue with excavation.\\r\\nIn 1981, Peru declared an area of 325.92 square kilometres (125.84?sq?mi) surrounding Machu Picchu a \\"Historic Sanctuary\\". In addition to the ruins, the sanctuary includes a large portion of the adjoining region, rich with the flora and fauna of the Peruvian Yungas and Central Andean wet puna ecoregions.[17]\\r\\nIn 1983, UNESCO designated Machu Picchu a World Heritage Site, describing it as \\"an absolute masterpiece of architecture and a unique testimony to the Inca civilization\\".[2]\\r\\nBingham was a lecturer at Yale University, although not a trained archaeologist. In 1909, returning from the Pan-American Scientific Congress in Santiago, he traveled through Peru and was invited to explore the Inca ruins at Choqquequirau in the Apurmac Valley. He organized the 1911 Yale Peruvian Expedition in part to search for the Inca capital, which was thought to be the city of Vitcos. He consulted Carlos Romero, a historian in Lima who showed him helpful references and Father Calanchas Chronicle.\\r\\nArmed with this information the expedition went down the Urubamba River. En route Bingham asked local people to show them Inca ruins. By the time they camped at Mandor Pampa, with Huayna Picchu 2000 feet above them on the opposite bank, they had already examined several ruins, but none fit the descriptions of Vitcos.\\r\\nAt Mandor Pampa, Bingham asked farmer and innkeeper Melchor Arteaga if he knew of any nearby ruins. Arteaga said he knew of excellent ruins on the top of Huayna Picchu.[18] The next day, 24 July, Arteaga led Bingham and Sergeant Carrasco across the river on a log bridge and up the Huayna Picchu mountain. At the top of the mountain they came across a small hut occupied by a couple of Quechua, Richarte and Alvarez, who were farming some of the original Machu Picchu agricultural terraces that they had cleared four years earlier. Alvarez's 11-year-old son, Pablito, led Bingham along the ridge to the main ruins.[12]\\r\\nThe ruins were mostly covered with vegetation except for the cleared agricultural terraces and clearings used by the farmers as vegetable gardens. Because of the vegetation Bingham was not able to observe the full extent of the site. He took preliminary notes, measurements and photographs, noting the fine quality of Inca stonework of several principal buildings. Bingham was unclear about the original purpose of the ruins, but decided that there was no indication that it matched the description of Vitcos.\\r\\nThe expedition continued down the Urubamba and up the Vilcabamba Rivers examining all the ruins they could find. Guided by locals Bingham rediscovered and correctly identified the site of the old Inca capital, Vitcos (then called Rosaspata), and the nearby temple of Chuquipalta. He then crossed a pass and into the Pampaconas Valley where he found more ruins heavily buried in the jungle undergrowth at Espritu Pampa, which he named \\"Eromboni Pampa\\".[19] As was the case with Machu Picchu, the site was so heavily overgrown that Bingham could only note a few of the buildings. In 1964, Gene Savoy further explored the ruins at Espiritu Pampa and revealed the full extent of the site, identifying it as Vilcabamba Viejo where the Incas fled after the Spanish drove them from Vitcos.[20]\\r\\nOn the return of the expedition up the Urubamba River, Bingham sent two men to clear and map the site he referred to as Machu Picchu. As Bingham failed to identify the ruins at Espiritu Pampa as Vilcabamba Viejo, he erroneously theorized that Machu Picchu was Vilcabamba Viejo. Machu Picchu features spectacular workmanship and a dramatic site, while Vilcabamba was built while the short-lived remnant Neo-Inca State was being vanquished by the Spanish; it was built quickly and features crude workmanship.\\r\\nBingham returned to Machu Picchu in 1912 under the sponsorship of Yale University and National Geographic and with full support of Peruvian President Leguia. The expedition undertook a four-month clearing of the site with local labor, which was expedited with the support of the Prefect of Cuzco. Excavation started in 1912 with further excavation undertaken in 1914 and 1915. Bingham focused on Machu Picchu because of its fine Inca stonework and well-preserved nature, which had lain undisturbed since the site was abandoned. None of Bingham's several hypotheses explaining the site held up. During his studies, he carried various artifacts back to Yale. One prominent artifact was a set of 15th-century, ceremonial Incan knives made from bismuth bronze; they are the earliest known artifact containing this alloy.[21][22]\\r\\nAlthough local institutions initially welcomed the exploration, they soon accused Bingham of legal and cultural malpractice.[23] Rumors arose that the team was stealing artifacts and smuggling them out of Peru through Bolivia. (In fact, Bingham removed many artifacts, but openly and legally; they were deposited in the Yale University Museum. Bingham was abiding by the 1852 Civil Code, the code stated that \\"archaeological finds generally belonged to the discoverer, except when they had been discovered on private land.\\" (Batievsky 100)[24] ) Local press perpetuated the accusations, claiming that the excavation harmed the site and deprived local archaeologists of knowledge about their own history.[23] Landowners began to demand rent from the excavators.[23] By the time Bingham and his team left Machu Picchu, locals had formed coalitions to defend their ownership of Machu Picchu and its cultural remains, while Bingham claimed the artifacts ought to be studied by experts in American institutions.[23]\\r\\nLittle information describes human sacrifices at Machu Picchu, though many sacrifices were never given a proper burial, and their skeletal remains succumbed to the elements.[25]:115 However, there is evidence that retainers were sacrificed to accompany a deceased noble in the afterlife.[25]:107,119 Animal, liquid and dirt sacrifices to the gods were much more common, made at the Altar of the Condor. The tradition is upheld by members of the New Age Andean religion.[26]:263\\r\\nMachu Picchu lies in the southern hemisphere, 13.164 degrees south of the equator.[27] It is 80 kilometres (50 miles) northwest of Cusco, on the crest of the mountain Machu Picchu, located about 2,430 metres (7,970 feet) above mean sea level, over 1,000 metres (3,300?ft) lower than Cusco, which has an elevation of 3,600 metres (11,800?ft).[27] As such, it had a milder climate than the Inca capital. It is one of the most important archaeological sites in South America, one of the most visited tourist attractions in Latin America[28] and the most visited in Peru.\\r\\nMachu Picchu has wet and dry seasons, with the majority of annual rain falling from October through to April.[27]\\r\\nMachu Picchu is situated above a bow of the Urubamba River, which surrounds the site on three sides, where cliffs drop vertically for 450 metres (1,480?ft) to the river at their base. The area is subject to morning mists rising from the river.[14] The location of the city was a military secret, and its deep precipices and steep mountains provided natural defenses. The Inca Bridge, an Inca grass rope bridge, across the Urubamba River in the Pongo de Mainique, provided a secret entrance for the Inca army. Another Inca bridge was built to the west of Machu Picchu, the tree-trunk bridge, at a location where a gap occurs in the cliff that measures 6 metres (20?ft). It could be bridged by two tree trunks, but with the trees removed, there was a 570 metres (1,870?ft) fall to the base of the cliffs.\\r\\nThe city sits in a saddle between the two mountains Machu Picchu and Huayna Picchu,[14] with a commanding view down two valleys and a nearly impassable mountain at its back. It has a water supply from springs that cannot be blocked easily, and enough land to grow food for about four times as many people as ever lived there. The hillsides leading to it were terraced, to provide more farmland to grow crops, and to steepen the slopes that invaders would have to ascend. The terraces reduced soil erosion and protected against landslides.[29] Two high-altitude routes from Machu Picchu cross the mountains back to Cusco, one through the Sun Gate, and the other across the Inca bridge. Both could be blocked easily, should invaders approach along them.\\r\\nThe site is roughly divided into an urban sector and an agricultural sector, and into an upper town and a lower town. The temples are in the upper town, the warehouses in the lower.[30]\\r\\nThe architecture is adapted to the mountains. Approximately 200 buildings are arranged on wide parallel terraces around an east-west central square. The various compounds, called kanchas, are long and narrow in order to exploit the terrain. Sophisticated channeling systems provided irrigation for the fields. Stone stairways set in the walls allowed access to the different levels across the site. The eastern section of the city was probably residential. The western, separated by the square, was for religious and ceremonial purposes. This section contains the Torre܇n, the massive tower which may have been used as an observatory.[31]\\r\\nLocated in the first zone are the primary archaeological treasures: the Intihuatana, the Temple of the Sun and the Room of the Three Windows. These were dedicated to Inti, their sun god and greatest deity.\\r\\nThe Popular District, or Residential District, is the place where the lower-class people lived. It includes storage buildings and simple houses.\\r\\nThe royalty area, a sector for the nobility, is a group of houses located in rows over a slope; the residence of the amautas (wise persons) was characterized by its reddish walls, and the zone of the ?ustas (princesses) had trapezoid-shaped rooms. The Monumental Mausoleum is a carved statue with a vaulted interior and carved drawings. It was used for rites or sacrifices.\\r\\nThe Guardhouse is a three-sided building, with one of its long sides opening onto the Terrace of the Ceremonial Rock. The three-sided style of Inca architecture is known as the wayrona style.[32]\\r\\nIn 2005 and 2009, the University of Arkansas made detailed laser scans of the entire site and of the ruins at the top of the adjacent Huayna Picchu mountain. The scan data is available online for research purposes.[33]\\r\\nThe Intihuatana stone is one of many ritual stones in South America. These stones are arranged to point directly at the sun during the winter solstice. The name of the stone (perhaps coined by Bingham) derives from Quechua language: inti means \\"sun\\", and wata-, \\"to tie, hitch (up)\\". The suffix -na derives nouns for tools or places. Hence Intihuatana is literally an instrument or place to \\"tie up the sun\\", often expressed in English as \\"The Hitching Post of the Sun\\". The Inca believed the stone held the sun in its place along its annual path in the sky. The stone is situated at 139'48\\" S. At midday on 11 November and 30 January, the sun stands almost exactly above the pillar, casting no shadow. On 21 June, the stone casts the longest shadow on its southern side, and on 21 December a much shorter shadow on its northern side.\\r\\nInti Mach'ay is a special cave used to observe the Royal Feast of the Sun. This festival was celebrated during the Incan month of Qhapaq Raymi. It began earlier in the month and concluded on the December solstice. On this day, noble boys were initiated into manhood by an ear-piercing ritual as they stood inside the cave and watched the sun rise.[35]\\r\\nArchitecturally, Inti Mach'ay is the most significant structure at Machu Picchu. Its entrances, walls, steps and windows are some of the finest masonry in the Incan Empire. The cave also includes a tunnel-like window unique among Incan structures, which was constructed to only allow sunlight into the cave during several days around the December solstice. For this reason, the cave was inaccessible for much of the year.[36] Inti Mach'ay is located on the eastern side of Machu Picchu, just north of the \\"Condor Stone.\\" Many of the caves surrounding this area were prehistorically used as tombs, yet there is no evidence that Mach'ay was a burial ground.[37]\\r\\nThe central buildings use the classical Inca architectural style of polished dry-stone walls of regular shape. The Incas were masters of this technique, called ashlar, in which blocks of stone are cut to fit together tightly without mortar.\\r\\nThe section of the mountain where Machu Picchu was built provided various challenges that the Incas solved with local materials. One issue was the seismic activity due to two fault lines. It made mortar and similar building methods nearly useless. Instead, the Inca mined stones from the quarry at the site, lined them up and shaped them to fit together perfectly, stabilizing the structures. Inca walls have many stabilizing features: doors and windows are trapezoidal, narrowing from bottom to top; corners usually are rounded; inside corners often incline slightly into the rooms; and outside corners were often tied together by \\"L\\"-shaped blocks; walls are offset slightly from row to row rather than rising straight from bottom to top.\\r\\nHeavy rainfall required terraces and stone chips to drain rain water and prevent mud slides, landslides, erosion and flooding. Terraces were layered with stone chips, sand, dirt and top soil, to absorb water and prevent it from running down the mountain. Similar layering protected the large city center from flooding.[38] Multiple canals and reserves provide water throughout the city that could be supplied to the terraces for irrigation and to prevent erosion and flooding.\\r\\nThe Incas never used wheels in a practical way, although its use in toys shows that they knew the principle. Its use in engineering may have been limited due to the lack of strong draft animals, steep terrain and dense vegetation. The approach to moving and placing the enormous stones remains uncertain, probably involving hundreds of men to push the stones up inclines. A few stones have knobs that could have been used to lever them into position; after which they were generally sanded away, with a few overlooked.\\r\\nThe Inca road system included a route to the Machu Picchu region. The people of Machu Picchu were connected to long-distance trade, as shown by non-local artifacts found at the site. For example, Bingham found unmodified obsidian nodules at the entrance gateway. In the 1970s, Burger and Asaro determined that these obsidian samples were from the Titicaca or Chivay obsidian source, and that the samples from Machu Picchu showed long-distance transport of this obsidian type in pre-Hispanic Peru.[39][page?needed]\\r\\nThousands of tourists walk the Inca Trail to visit Machu Picchu each year.[40] They congregate at Cusco before starting on the one-, two-, four- or five-day journey on foot from Kilometer 82 (or 77 or 85, four/five-day trip) or Kilometer 104 (one/two-day trip) near the town of Ollantaytambo in the Urubamba valley, walking up through the Andes to the isolated city.\\r\\nMachu Picchu is a UNESCO World Heritage Site, both cultural and natural. Since its discovery in 1911, growing numbers of tourists visit the site yearly, reaching 400,000 in 2000.[41] As Peru's most visited tourist attraction and major revenue generator, it is continually exposed to economic and commercial forces. In the late 1990s, the Peruvian government granted concessions to allow the construction of a cable car and a luxury hotel, including a tourist complex with boutiques and restaurants and a bridge to the site.[42] Many people protested the plans, including Peruvians and foreign scientists, saying that more visitors would pose a physical burden on the ruins.[43] A no-fly zone exists above the area.[44] UNESCO is considering putting Machu Picchu on its List of World Heritage in Danger.[42]\\r\\nDuring the 1980s a large rock from Machu Picchu's central plaza was moved to a different location to create a helicopter landing zone. In the 1990s, the government prohibited helicopter landings. In 2006, a Cusco-based company, Helicusco, sought approval for tourist flights over Machu Picchu. The resulting license was soon rescinded.[45]\\r\\nAuthorities have struggled to maintain tourist safety. Tourist deaths have been linked to altitude sickness, floods and hiking accidents.[46][47][48][49] UNESCO received criticism for allowing tourists at the location given high risks of landslides, earthquakes and injury due to decaying structures.[50]\\r\\nNude tourism is a recent trend, to the dismay of Peruvian officials. In several incidents, tourists were detained for posing for nude pictures or streaking across the site. Peru's Ministry of Culture denounced these acts for threatening Peru's cultural heritage. Cusco's Regional Director of Culture increased surveillance to end the practice.[51]\\r\\nIn January 2010, heavy rain caused flooding that buried or washed away roads and railways to Machu Picchu, trapping more than 2,000 locals and more than 2,000 tourists, later airlifted out. Machu Picchu was temporarily closed,[52] reopening on 1 April 2010.[53]\\r\\nIn July 2011, the Direcci܇n Regional de Cultura Cusco (DRC) introduced new entrance rules to the citadel of Machu Picchu.[54] The tougher entrance rules attempted to reduce the effect of tourism. Entrance was limited to 2,500 visitors per day, and the entrance to Huayna Picchu (within the citadel) was further restricted to 400 visitors per day, in two time slots, at 7 and 10 AM.\\r\\nIn May 2012, a team of UNESCO conservation experts called upon Peruvian authorities to take \\"emergency measures\\" to further stabilize the sites buffer zone and protect it from damage, particularly in the nearby town of Aguas Calientes, which had grown rapidly.[55]\\r\\nIn 1912, 1914 and 1915, Bingham removed thousands of artifacts from Machu Picchuceramic vessels, silver statues, jewelry and human bonesand took them to Yale University for further study, supposedly for 18 months. Yale instead kept the artifacts until 2012, arguing that Peru lacked the infrastructure and systems to care for them. Eliane Karp, an anthropologist and wife of former Peruvian President Alejandro Toledo, accused Yale of profiting from Peru's cultural heritage. Many of the articles were exhibited at Yale's Peabody Museum.\\r\\nIn 2006, Yale returned some pieces but kept the rest, claiming this was supported by federal case law of Peruvian antiquities.[56] On 19 September 2007, the Courant reported that Peru and Yale had agreed on the return of the artifacts. The agreement included a joint traveling exhibition and construction of a new museum and research center in Cusco advised by Yale. Yale acknowledged Peru's title to all the objects, but would share rights with Peru in the research collection, part of which would remain at Yale for continuing study.[57] On 21 November 2010, Yale agreed to return the disputed artifacts.[58] The third and final batch of artifacts was delivered November 2012.[59] The artifacts are permanently exhibited at La Casa Concha (\\"The Shell House\\") close to Cusco's colonial center. Owned by the National University of San Antonio Abad del Cusco, La Casa Concha also features a study area for local and foreign students.\\r\\nThe 1955 film Secret of the Incas by Paramount Pictures with Charlton Heston and Ima Sumac was filmed on location at Cusco and Machu Picchu, the first time that a major Hollywood studio filmed on site. Five hundred indigenous people were hired as extras in the film.[60]\\r\\nThe opening sequence of the 1972 film Aguirre, the Wrath of God was shot in the Machu Picchu area and on the stone stairway of Huayna Picchu.[61]\\r\\nMachu Picchu was featured prominently in the 2004 film, The Motorcycle Diaries, a biopic based on the 1952 youthful travel memoir of Marxist revolutionary Che Guevara.[62]\\r\\nThe NOVA television documentary \\"Ghosts of Machu Picchu\\" presents an elaborate documentary on the mysteries of Machu Picchu.[63]\\r\\nContemporary multimedia artist Kimsooja used Macchu Picchu as the primary setting for the first episode of her film series Thread Routes, shot in 2010.[64]\\r\\nThe song \\"Kilimanjaro\\" from the 2010 South Indian Tamil film Enthiran was filmed in Machu Picchu.[65] The sanction for filming was granted only after direct intervention from the Indian government.[66][67]","input":"What part of peru is machu picchu in?"},{"output":"Hispaniola","context":"Dominican RepublicÿHaiti relations have long been complex due to the substantial cultural differences between the two nations and their sharing the small island of Hispaniola, part of the Greater Antilles archipelago in the Caribbean region. The living standards in the Dominican Republic are considerably higher than those in Haiti. The deep-set cultural differences have contributed to a long-standing conflict.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThough having vast demographic and cultural differences since colonial times, the inhabitants of modern-day Dominican Republic and Haiti have at times been allies and foes, constantly vying for dominance of Hispaniola. The conflicts began during the colonial era which developed into military and political conflicts between the two governments.[1] The political division of the island of Hispaniola is due in part to the European struggle for control of the New World during the 17th century, when France and Spain began fighting for control of the island. They resolved their dispute in 1697 by splitting the island into two countries.[2] It was not until the 19th century that Haiti became independent from France on January 1, 1804. Spanish Haiti, the predecessor of the Dominican Republic, became independent from Spain on December 1, 1821, after more than 300 years of Spanish rule.\\r\\nBeginning in 1789, free people of color of Saint-Domingue were inspired by the French Revolution to seek an expansion of their rights. Initially, the slave population did not become involved in the conflict.[3] In August 1791, a Vodou ceremony at Bois Ca?man marked the start of a major slave rebellion in the north. Toussaint apparently did not take part in the earliest stages of the rebellion, but after a few weeks he sent his family to safety in Spanish Santo Domingo and helped the overseers of the Breda plantation to leave the island.\\r\\nThroughout 1792, Toussaint, as a leader in an increasingly formal alliance between the black rebellion and the Spanish, ran the fortified post of La Tannerie and maintained the Cordon de l'Ouest, a line of posts between rebel and colonial territory.[4] He gained a reputation for running an orderly camp, trained his men in guerrilla tactics and \\"the European style of war\\",[5] and began to attract soldiers who would play an important role throughout the revolution.[6] After hard fighting, he lost La Tannerie in January 1793 to the French General tienne Maynaud, but it was in these battles that the French first recognised him as a significant military leader.[7]\\r\\nDespite adhering to royalist political views, Louverture had begun to use the language of freedom and equality associated with the French Revolution.[8] From being willing to bargain for better conditions of slavery late in 1791, he had become committed to its complete abolition.[9] On 29 August 1793 he made his famous declaration of Camp Turel to the blacks of St Domingue:\\r\\nBrothers and friends, I am Toussaint Louverture; perhaps my name has made itself known to you. I have undertaken vengeance. I want Liberty and Equality to reign in St Domingue. I am working to make that happen. Unite yourselves to us, brothers and fight with us for the same cause.\\r\\n\\r\\nYour very humble and obedient servant, Toussaint Louverture,\\r\\n\\r\\nGeneral of the armies of the king, for the public good.[10]\\r\\nOn the same day, the beleaguered French commissioner, Lger-Flicit Sonthonax, proclaimed emancipation for all slaves in French Saint-Domingue,[11] hoping to bring the black troops over to his side.[12] Initially, this failed, perhaps because Toussaint and the other leaders knew that Sonthonax was exceeding his authority.[13] However, on 4 February 1794, the French revolutionary government proclaimed the abolition of slavery.[14] For months, Louverture had been in diplomatic contact with the French general tienne Maynaud de Bizefranc de Lavaux. During this time, competition between him and other rebel leaders was growing, and the Spanish had started to look with disfavour on his near-autonomous control of a large and strategically important region.[15] In May 1794, when the decision of the French government became known in Saint-Domingue, Louverture switched allegiance from the Spanish to the French and rallied his troops to Lavaux.[16]\\r\\nOn November 9, 1821 the Spanish colony of Santo Domingo was overthrown by a group of rebels at the command of Jos N~?ez de Cceres, the colony's former administrator,[1][17] as they proclaimed independence from the Spanish crown on December 1, 1821.[18] The new nation was known as Republic of Spanish Haiti (Spanish: Rep~blica del Hait Espa?ol), as Haiti had been the indigenous name of the island.[17][contradictory]\\r\\nA group of Dominican military officers favored uniting the newly independent nation with Haiti, as they sought for political stability under Haitian president Jean-Pierre Boyer. The Dominicans were unaware that Boyer made a concession with the French, and agreed to pay France for the lost territory of Haiti. Boyer agreed to pay a sum of 150 million Francs (more than twice what France had charged the United States for the much larger Louisiana territory in 1803) thus the Haitians would essentially be forced into paying to maintain their freedom from the French.\\r\\nDuring twenty-two years of Haitian occupation, the Haitians implemented what some Dominicans viewed as a brutal military regime.[citation needed] Use of the French language over Spanish was enforced, and the army closed La Universidad Santo Tomas de Aquino. In addition, the Haitian army confiscated all church land and property and imposed mandatory military service. This difficult time for the Dominicans created cultural conflicts in language, race, religion and national tradition between the Dominicans and Haitians. Many Dominicans developed a resentment of Haitians, who they saw as oppressors.\\r\\nIn order to raise funds for the huge indemnity of 150 million francs that Haiti agreed to pay the former French colonists, and which was subsequently lowered to 60 million francs, Haiti imposed heavy taxes on the Dominicans. Since Haiti was unable to adequately provision its army, the occupying forces largely survived by commandeering or confiscating food and supplies at gunpoint. Attempts to redistribute land conflicted with the system of communal land tenure (terrenos comuneros), which had arisen with the ranching economy, and newly emancipated slaves resented being forced to grow cash crops under Boyer's Code Rural.[19] In rural areas, the Haitian administration was usually too inefficient to enforce its own laws. It was in the city of Santo Domingo that the effects of the occupation were most acutely felt, and it was there that the movement for independence originated.[citation needed]\\r\\nHaiti's constitution also forbade white elites from owning land,[citation needed] and the major landowning families were forcibly deprived of their properties. Most emigrated to Cuba, Puerto Rico (these two being Spanish possessions at the time) or Gran Colombia, usually with the encouragement of Haitian officials, who acquired their lands. The Haitians, who associated the Roman Catholic Church with the French slave-masters who had exploited them before independence, confiscated all church property, deported all foreign clergy, and severed the ties of the remaining clergy to the Vatican. Santo Domingo's university, lacking both students and teachers had to close down, and thus the country suffered from a massive case of human capital flight.\\r\\nAlthough the occupation effectively eliminated colonial slavery and instated a constitution modeled after the United States Constitution throughout the island, several resolutions and written dispositions were expressly aimed at converting average Dominicans into second-class citizens: restrictions of movement, prohibition to run for public office, night curfews, inability to travel in groups, banning of civilian organizations, and the indefinite closure of the state university (on the alleged grounds of its being a subversive organization) all led to the creation of movements advocating a forceful separation from Haiti with no compromises.\\r\\nIn 1838 Juan Pablo Duarte, an educated Dominican nationalist, founded a resistance movement called La Trinitaria. They initially worked with a liberal Haitian party that overthrew President Jean-Pierre Boyer. However, the Trinitarios'[20] work in the overthrow gained the attention of Boyer's replacement, Charles Rivire-Hrard. Rivire-Hrard imprisoned some Trinitarios and forced Duarte to leave the island. The rebels decided to take action anyway with the new leadership of Francisco del Rosario Snchez, Ram܇n Matas Mella, and Pedro Santana, a wealthy cattle-rancher from El Seibo who commanded a private army who worked on his estates.\\r\\nIn the Dominican War of Independence[21] Dominicans fought against the Haitian occupation.[22] On February 27, 1844 the Dominicans gained freedom from Haitian rule, thus giving birth to the Dominican Republic, a self-sufficient nation established on the liberal ideals of a democratic government. After winning the war and ousting the Haitian occupying force from the country, Dominican nationalists fought against a series of attempted invasions at the command of Haitian \\"emperor\\" Faustin Soulouque from 1844 to 1856. Haitian soldiers tried to regain control of lost territory, but these efforts were to no avail as the Dominicans would go on to decisively win every battle henceforth. Since then, DominicanÿHaitian relations have been unstable.[23]\\r\\nIn 1937, claiming that Haiti was harboring his former Dominican opponents, Rafael Trujillo ordered an attack on the border, slaughtering tens of thousands of Haitians as they tried to escape. The number of dead is still unknown, though it is now calculated between 20,000[24] and 30,000.[25]\\r\\nIn the mid-twentieth century, the economies of the two countries were comparable. Since that time, the Dominican economy has grown while the Haitian economy has diminished. The economic downturn in Haiti has been the result of factors such as internal power struggles, rapid population growth, environmental degradation, and trade embargoes. Today, Haiti is the poorest country in the Western Hemisphere. There is a lack of resources, and Haiti's population density exceeds its neighbor's by far. Despite the UN sending missions since the 1990s, in order to maintain peace, terrible conditions persist.[26]\\r\\nOne large contributor to cultural dissonance is the language barrier, as Spanish is the primary language spoken in the eastern part of Hispaniola (Dominican Republic) while French and Haitian Creole are spoken in the western part (Haiti). Race is another defining factor of DominicanÿHaitian relations. The ethnic composition of the Dominican population is 73%?mixed, 16%?white, and 11%?black;[27] while 95% of the Haitian population is black.[28]\\r\\nThe development of social classes in the Dominican Republic is somewhat based on race. Since the Haitian invasion of 1822 skin color holds importance in Dominican society. Darker-colored Dominicans are usually found in the lower class, while lighter-skinned (mixed, whites and others) Dominicans are found in the middle and upper classes. Most Haitians are darker-skinned with little non-African admixture. In the Dominican Republic there is a stigma against dark-skinned residents. People with darker skin are usually associated with poor, uneducated Haitians because of their past connections with slavery.[29]\\r\\nThe Dominican economy is also over 600% larger than the Haitian economy. The estimated annual per capita income is US$1,300 in Haiti and US$8,200 in Dominican Republic.[30] The divergence between the level of economic development between Haiti and the Dominican Republic makes their border the one with the highest contrast of all Western world borders and it is evident that the Dominican Republic has one of the highest illegal migration issues in the Americas.[31]\\r\\nSome cross-border cooperation exists in areas such as health, business, and infrastructure. Many Haitians travel to the Dominican Republic to find seasonal or long-term work in order to send remittances to their families. Some of these Haitian workers, as well as Dominicans of Haitian descent have reported complaints of discrimination against them by the Dominican majority population. Other Haitians who would seek work, instead remain in Haiti, fearing discrimination on the other side of the border.[32]\\r\\nMigration has been taking place since the 1920s, when Haitian laborers were actively encouraged to come work in the thriving Dominican sugar industry. With modernization from the 1960s on, fewer workers were required, and other Dominican industries and services started employing more Haitian workers, often an inexpensive, less regulated labor source with fewer legal protections. Many Haitian women find work in Dominican households, and Haitian men at Dominican construction sites, often leading to the move of an entire family.[32]\\r\\nA large number of migrated Haitian workers have continued to live in the Dominican Republic over several generations. The two governments have been unable to agree upon a legal framework to address the nationality of these descendants, leaving around one million people of Haitian ancestry in the Dominican Republic effectively stateless, restricting their access to health care, education and employment opportunities.[32]\\r\\nThough migration from Haiti to the Dominican Republic is economically beneficial to both countries, it is one of the leading contributors to tension between the two countries as well; illegal immigration from Haiti resonates high dissonance with the Dominican people. It has led to anti-Haitian feelings and mistrust of the Haitian people. Another problem with Haitian migration into Dominican Republic is that it blurs the line of citizenship. This factor of migration affects not only Dominican economy but its culture as well.[33]\\r\\nMany have observed that there is a clear distinction between Dominicans and Haitians in the Dominican Republic. The two groups of people do not function as one entity and there are many factors that contribute to those tensions. Some Dominicans view Haitians in the Dominican Republic as an invasion of their own space that they have fought very long and hard to live in. Some Dominicans view Haitians as inferior and believe that their only function in the Dominican Republic is as labor. There is a strong sense of Dominican pride in the Dominican Republic, and oftentimes, Haitians cannot fit into their culture or way of life. Many of these current day beliefs have been influenced by the former Dominican dictator, Rafael Trujillo.\\r\\nTrujillo strongly disliked the Haitian people and made it his mission to clearly distinguish the Dominican Republic from Haiti. Trujillo was not fond of dark skin, and targeted anyone of dark complexion that appeared to be Haitian. In 1937, Trujillo carried out the Parsley Massacre in which he sought to destroy anyone who looked dark enough to be Haitian and anyone who could not roll the \\"r\\" in \\"perejil,\\" the Spanish word for parsley. Even without Trujillo in power, some still carry these negative connotations and approach Haitians with anger and scorn.\\r\\nAfter the devastating earthquake of 12 January 2010, countless Haitians fled across the border to escape the quake's effects. The Dominican government was one of the first to send teams to help distribute food and medicine to the victims and made it easier for Haitians to acquire visas to receive treatment in Dominican hospitals. Supplies were transported to Haiti through the Dominican Republic, and many injured Haitians have been treated in Dominican hospitals. Virtually, every level of the Dominican efforts assisted its neighboring country.[34]\\r\\nHaitian refugees were also taken in and supported by many Dominicans, though relations deteriorated as the refugees have remained in the Dominican Republic. This has led to reported concerns among some Dominicans that quake refugees contribute to rising crime, over-crowding, cholera and unemployment. More and more discrimination has been attributed to the massive numbers of Haitian refugees in the Dominican Republic. Over the past years tensions have risen, causing the International Organization for Migration to offer Haitians $50 each plus additional relocation assistance to return to Haiti. More than 1,500 have accepted that assistance and returned.[34]\\r\\nThe baseball federations of the Dominican Republic and Haiti have agreed to develop and promote baseball in Haiti (especially at the border), on the basis that sport is a developmental element to foster peace, as well as strengthening friendship and mutual respect between the two peoples. With the support of the Dominican ministry of Sports, the president of the Dominican Baseball Federation (FEDOBE) was thankful and quoted saying \\"it allows our federation to fulfill the dream of helping Haiti in baseball.\\" He has pledged to put the Haitian Baseball Federation in relation to the international organizations. Coaches will be sent to Haiti for technical courses, referees and scorers by the Dominican Baseball Federation, while the Haitian Federation will support the logistics in the training and training programs.[35]","input":"What island is haiti and the dominican republic on?"},{"output":"In Christianity, Satan","context":"In the Abrahamic religions, fallen angels are angels who have sinned against God and were expelled from Heaven. They are former agents of God and the enemies of God and humanity. The term \\"fallen angel\\" does not appear in the Bible, but it is used of angels who sinned, such as those referred to in 2 Peter 2:4: \\"For if God did not spare angels when they sinned, but cast them into hell and committed them to chains of gloomy darkness to be kept until the judgment\\". It is also used to describe angels cast down to the Earth during the War in Heaven, as well as Satan (who is distinct from Lucifer, particularly in Luciferianism),[1] demons,[2] and certain Watchers.[3] A similar notion can be found in Nahj al-Balagha, an Islamic collection of sermons, letters, and narrations attributed to Ali: \\"Allah, the Glorified One, will not let a human being enter paradise if he does the same thing for which Allah turned an angel from it\\".[4] Al-Tha'alibi related in his Qisas Al-Anbiya a tradition, in which Satan is held to be chained in the lowest hell in the midst of the rebel angels.[5]\\r\\nMention of angels who physically descended (and figuratively \\"fell\\") to Mount Hermon is found in the Book of Enoch, which the Ethiopian Orthodox Church and Eritrean Orthodox Tewahedo Church accept as biblical canon; as well as in various pseudepigrapha.\\r\\nEvil angels, however, are those who have fallen from their first estate (see Jude 1:6) since the Creation. The Bible records several different times when angels fell to earth. Some have already fallen (Genesis 6:2; Amos 5:26; Revelation 12:4) and some will fall in the future (Revelation 6:13, 8:10-11, 9:1). It is Satan, the great dragon, who entices them (Revelation 12:4), perhaps with promises that they will be worshipped by men as gods or rule over an earthly kingdom. The demons learn wickedness and become servents and followers of their new master Satan.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe concept of angels sinning against God and being expelled from Heaven is mainly a Jewish concept, since it was mainly developed and found in Judaism during the Second Temple period, referring to Satan and his followers. This concept is mainly found in Jewish apocrypha, such as the First Book of Enoch, the Second Book of Enoch, and the Book of Jubilees.\\r\\nIn the period immediately preceding the composition of the New Testament, some sects of Judaism identified the \\"sons of God\\" ( ?) of Genesis 6:1ÿ4 as fallen angels.[6] Some scholars consider it most likely that this Jewish tradition of fallen angels predates, even in written form, the composition of Gen 6:1ÿ4.[7][8] Lester L. Grabbe calls the story of the sexual intercourse between angels and women \\"an old myth in Judaism\\".[9] Until the mid-2nd evidence that some early Christians accepted this Jewish Enochic pseudepigraphy and the application of the angelic descent myth to the \\"sons of God\\" passage in Genesis 6:1ÿ4.[10] Its presence not only in the East but also in the Latin-speaking West is attested by the polemic of Augustine of Hippo (354ÿ430) against the motif of giants born of the union between fallen angels and human women.[11] Rabbinic Judaism and Christian authorities rejected the tradition.[12] Those who adopted the tradition viewed the \\"sons of God\\" as fallen angels who married human women and begot the Nephilim through unnatural unions.[13]\\r\\nThe reference to heavenly beings called \\"Watchers\\" originates in Daniel 4, in which there are three mentions, twice in the singular (v. 13, 23), once in the plural (v. 17), of \\"watchers, holy ones\\". The Ancient Greek word for watchers is ?? (egr?goroi, plural of egr?goros), literally translated as \\"wakeful\\".[14] Note that, beginning by AD 150, the Greek letter eta () was iotacized to sound the same as iota (); and the Old Slavonic alphabets, both Cyrillic and Glagolitic, made no phonetic distinction between the letters they derived from Greek  and .[15] The Greek term was transcribed in the Jewish pseudepigraphon the Second Book of Enoch (Slavonic Enoch) as Grigori, referring to the same beings as those called Watchers of the (First) Book of Enoch.[16]\\r\\nThe concept of fallen angels is mostly found in the Book of Enoch, verses 6ÿ9; the Qumran Book of Giants; and perhaps in Genesis 6:1ÿ4.[17] These Watchers became \\"enamored\\" with human women (1 Enoch 7.2),[18] and had intercourse with them. The offspring of these unions, and the knowledge they were given, corrupted human beings and the earth (1 Enoch 10.11ÿ12).[18] A number of apocryphal works, including 1 Enoch (10.4),[18] link this transgression with the Great Deluge.[19] This fact was adopted by early Christianity, but abandoned by Rabbinic Judaism and later Christianity.[20] During the period immediately before the rise of Christianity, the intercourse between these Watchers and human women was often seen as the first fall of the angels.[21]\\r\\nThe concept of fallen angels is also mostly found in the Second Book of Enoch, which is sequel to the First Book of Enoch.\\r\\n2 Enoch 29:3 \\"Here Satanail was hurled from the height together with his angels\\"a probable Christian interpolation according to Charlesworth's Old Testament Pseudepigrapha\\r\\nThe text refers to \\"the Grigori, who with their prince Satanail rejected the Lord of light\\". The Grigori are identified with the Watchers of 1 Enoch.[22][23] The Grigori who \\"went down on to earth from the Lord's throne\\", married women and \\"befouled the earth with their deeds\\", resulting in confinement under earth (2 Enoch 18:1ÿ7) In the longer recension of 2 Enoch, chapter 29 refers to angels who were \\"thrown out from the height\\" when their leader tried to become equal in rank with the Lord's power (2 Enoch 29:1ÿ4).\\r\\nMost sources quote 2 Enoch as stating that those who descended to earth were three,[24] but Andrei A. Orlov, while quoting 2 Enoch as saying that three went down to the earth,[25] remarks in a footnote that some manuscripts put them at 200 or even 200 myriads.[22] In The Old Testament Pseudepigrapha: Apocalypic Literature and Testaments edited by James H. Charlesworth, manuscript Jtaken as the best representative of the longer recensionhas \\"and three of them descended\\" (p.?130); while manuscript Ataken as the best representative of the shorter recensionhas \\"and they descended\\", which might indicate that all the Grigori descended, or 200 princes of them, or 200 princes and 200 followers, since it follows the phrase that \\"[t]hese are the Grigori, 200 princes of whom turned aside, 200 walking in their train\\" (p.?131).\\r\\nChapter 29, referring to the second day of creation (before the creation of human beings), says that \\"one from out the order of angels\\"[26] or, according to other versions of 2 Enoch, \\"one of the order of archangels\\"[27] or \\"one of the ranks of the archangels\\"[28] \\"conceived an impossible thought, to place his throne higher than the clouds above the earth, that he might become equal in rank to [the Lord's] power. And [the Lord] threw him out from the height with his angels, and he was flying in the air continuously above the bottomless.\\" In this chapter, the name \\"Satanail\\" is mentioned only in a heading added in a single manuscript,[29][30] the GIM khlyudov manuscript,[31] which is a representative of the longer recension and was used in the English translation by R. H. Charles.\\r\\nThe Hebrew Bible personifies Satan as a character in only three places, always inferior to God's power: it portrays him as an accuser (Zechariah 3:1ÿ2), a tempter (1 Chronicles 21:1), and a heavenly persecutor (Job 2:1). It uses the Hebrew word, which means \\"adversary\\", elsewhere to speak of human opponents or some evil influence[32] and does not explicitly say that Satan is an angel nor that he is fallen.[32] However, the Oxford Dictionary of the Jewish Religion states that Satan appears in Jewish pseudepigraphaespecially apocalypsesas \\"ruler of a demonic host, influencing events throughout the world, cast out of heaven as a fallen angel\\", and ascribes the idea of Satan as a fallen angel to a misinterpretation of Isaiah 14:12.[32] Some also say that Lucifer is one of the archangels before he fell from Heaven. He thought that God's order to \\"love human kind more than God himself\\" was ridiculous, which made him hate humanity and that lead to his fall.\\r\\nIn Christianity, Satan is often seen as the leader of the fallen angels.[33] The New Testament mentions Satan 36 times in 33 verses, and the Book of Revelation tells of \\"that ancient serpent, who is called the devil and Satan, the deceiver of the whole world\\", being thrown down to the Earth together with his angels.[34] In Luke 10:18, Jesus says: \\"I saw Satan fall like lightning from heaven.\\" While the New Testament thus mentions Satan falling from Heaven, it never says that he was an angel, only that he masquerades as one in 2 Corinthians 11:14. The concept of fallen angels is not foreign to the New Testament, though; both 2 Peter 2:4 and Jude 1:6 refer to angels who have sinned against God and await punishment on Judgement Day.\\r\\nIn the New Testament, Revelation 12:3ÿ14 speaks of a great red dragon whose tail swept a third part of the stars of heaven and cast them to the earth. In verses 7ÿ9, after defeat in a War in Heaven in which the dragon and his angels fought against Michael and his angels, \\"the great dragon was thrown down, that ancient serpent, who is called the devil and Satan, the deceiver of the whole worldhe was thrown down to the earth, and his angels were thrown down with him\\".[35]\\r\\nThe Fall of Lucifer finds its earliest identification with a fallen angel in Origen,[citation needed] based on an interpretation of Isaiah 14:1ÿ17, which describes a king of Babylon as the fallen \\"morning star\\" (in Hebrew, ??). This description was interpreted typologically as an angel in addition to its literal application to a human king: the image of the fallen morning star or angel was thereby applied to Satan in both in Jewish pseudepigrapha[32] and by early Christian writers,[36][37] following the transfer of Lucifer to Satan in the pre-Christian century.[38]\\r\\nOrigen and other Christian writers linked the fallen morning star of Isaiah 14:12 to Jesus' statement in Luke 10:18 that \\"I saw Satan fall like lightning from heaven\\" and to the mention of a fall of Satan in Revelation 12:8ÿ9.[39] In Latin-speaking Christianity, the Latin word \\"lucifer\\" as employed in the late 4th-century AD Vulgate to translate ?, gave rise to the name \\"Lucifer\\" for the person believed to be referred to in the text. Orthodox Judaism does not believe the name Lucifer is a reference to Satan, but rather the text in chapter four indicates that it is a literal taunt against the King of Babylon.\\r\\nIndeed, Christian tradition has applied to Satan not only the image of the morning star in Isaiah 14:12, but also the denouncing in Ezekiel 28:11ÿ19 of the king of Tyre, who is spoken of as having been a \\"cherub\\". Rabbinic literature saw these two passages as in some ways parallel, even if it perhaps did not associate them with Satan, and the episode of the fall of Satan appears not only in writings of the early Church Fathers and in apocryphal and pseudepigraphic works, but also in rabbinic sources.[40] However, \\"no modern evangelical commentary on Isaiah or Ezekiel sees Isaiah 14 or Ezekiel 28 as providing information about the fall of Satan\\".[41]\\r\\nIn Islam, the concept of fallen angels is the same as the concept in Judaism and Christianity. However Islamic view of the rebellion of fallen angels differs from the Jewish and Christian views, where fallen angels did not try to usurp the throne of God, a concept alien to Islam. Instead they refused to bow down to Adam.\\r\\nThree entities are mentioned in Qur'an, who are sometimes identified as fallen angels: Iblis, Harut and Marut. The story of their fall are found in Islamic narrations, but not in the Quran.[42] Alternatively Iblis is rather thought as being a Jinni, another entity apart from the angels, supported by the fact, he is created from fire. Those who distinguish between Iblis as a fiery angel and the jinn, differentiate the jinn made out of smokeless fire, and the fire these angels are held to be composed of (according to Ibn Abbas from the fire of samum).[43] Those who reject the angelic origin of Harut and Marut prefer to view them as kings (malikayn) than angels (malak).[44]\\r\\nThe Quranexegete Tabari attributed a story to Ibn Masud and Ibn Abbas[45] about Harut and Marut complaining about the mischievousness of mankind and made a request to destroy them. Consequently, God offered a test determine whether or not the angels would do better than humans for long, then they are endowed with humanlike urges and Satan would have authority over them. However on Earth, they entertained and acted upon sexual desires and were guilty of idol worship, whereupon they even killed an innocent witness. For their deeds, they were not allowed to ascend to Heaven again.[46]\\r\\nAnother extra-quranic narrative states that Iblis was once send by God to battle a pre-adamite race, who shed blood and caused corruption on earth. After Iblis defeated them, he returned to heaven. Then God created human, Iblis and some angels argued, why God should create a human being, who will shed blood and confusion like those, whom they had just defeated before, while the angels prostrate before God and sing his glory day and night, never failing God's orders.[47] Since Iblis insisted on being superior than any other creature, even compared to other angels,[48] his status was reduced and he was turned away from heaven, endowed with the task to lead beings towards evil and wrong actions.[49] Those creatures from heaven, who followed Iblis, became demons,[50] not to be confused with the Jinn (another creature that is, unlike a demon, accessible to the good).[51]\\r\\nFurther references to fallen angels can be found in some Shia accounts. In a narrative from Ja'far al-Sadiq, Idris met an angel, which the wrath of God fell upon, and his wings and hair were cut off; after Idris prayed for him to God, his wings and hair were restored. In return they become friends and in request the angel took Idris to the Heavens to meet the angel of death.[52]\\r\\nIn Umm al-Kitab, a 8th century work of a Ghulat sect, the universe cames into existence because Azazil claims to be like God, but since there can just be one god, Azazil fell into lower spheres until he ends up on earth.[53]\\r\\nThe concept of fallen angels originated in Judaism from the Jewish texts from the Second Temple Period, being applied in particular to Satan and his followers. Since the Middle Ages certain Jewish scholars have rejected the belief in fallen angels; however, the concept of fallen angels persists within Judaism.\\r\\nChristianity adopted the concept of fallen angels from Judaism, mainly based on their interpretations of the Book of Revelation Chapter 12,[1] which plainly states that Satan and his team fought against Michael and his team, and Matthew 25:41, which states that eternal fire was prepared for Satan and his followers.\\r\\nIn Catholicism, the Catechism of the Catholic Church speaks of \\"the fall of the angels\\" not in spatial terms but as a radical and irrevocable rejection of God and his reign by some angels who, though created as good beings, freely chose evil, their sin being unforgivable because of the irrevocable character of their choice, not because of any defect in the infinite divine mercy.[54]\\r\\nIn 19th century Universalism, Universalists such as Thomas Allin (1891)[55] claimed that Clement of Alexandria, Origen, and Gregory of Nyssa taught that even the Devil and fallen angels will eventually be saved.[56]\\r\\nIn Unitarianism, Joseph Priestley suggested that the passages refer to the Korah.[57] William Graham (1772) suggested that they referred to the spies in Canaan.[58] These passages are generally held today to be commentary, positive, neutral, or negative, on Jewish traditions concerning Enoch circulating in the Early Church.[59]\\r\\nIn Islamic tradition, the rebellion of Angels rather resulted from their displeasure towards humanity. Accordingly, they held their way of serving God superior to the service of mankind.[60][61] The Islamic view of the fallen angels' rebellion against God differs from the Christian views in that the rebellion is seen as Satan's refusal to prostrate himself before Adam, not as an attempt to usurp God's throne.","input":"Who was the leader of the fallen angels?"},{"output":"a figure made from tires","context":"Bibendum, commonly referred to in English as the Michelin Man or Michelin Tyre Man, is the symbol of the Michelin tire company. Introduced at the Lyon Exhibition of 1894 where the Michelin brothers had a stand,[1] Bibendum is one of the world's oldest trademarks. The slogan Nunc est bibendum (Drink up) is taken from Horace's Odes (book I, ode xxxvii, line 1). He is also referred to as Bib or Bibelobis.[2]\\r\\nMichelin dominated the French tire industry and was one of the leading advertisers; to this day its famous guidebooks are widely used by travellers. Bibendum was depicted visually as a lord of industry, a master of all he surveyed, and a patriotic expounder of the French spirit. In the 1920s, Bibendum urged Frenchmen to adopt America's superior factory system, but to patriotically avoid using the \\"inferior\\" products of those factories. As automobiles diffused to the middle classes, Michelin advertising likewise shifted downscale, and its restaurant and hotel guides likewise covered a broader range of price categories.[3]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nWhile attending the Universal and Colonial Exposition in Lyon in 1894, douard and Andr Michelin noticed a stack of tires that suggested to douard the figure of a man without arms. Four years later, Andr met French cartoonist Marius Rossillon, popularly known as O'Galop, who showed him a rejected image he had created for a Munich brewerya large, regal figure holding a huge glass of beer and quoting Horace's phrase \\"Nunc est bibendum\\". Andr immediately suggested replacing the man with a figure made from tires. Thus O'Galop transformed the earlier image into Michelin's symbol. Today, Bibendum is one of the world's most recognised trademarks, representing Michelin in over 150 countries.\\r\\nThe 1898 poster showed him offering the toast Nunc est bibendum to his scrawny competitors with a glass full of road hazards, with the title and the tag C'est  dire?:  votre sant. Le pneu Michelin boit l'obstacle (\\"That is to say, to your health. The Michelin tire drinks up obstacles\\"). The implication is that Michelin tires will easily take on road hazards. The company used this basic poster format for fifteen years, adding its latest products to the table in front of the figure. It is unclear when the word \\"Bibendum\\" came to be the name of the character himself. At the latest, it was in 1908, when Michelin commissioned Curnonsky to write a newspaper column signed \\"Bibendum\\". In 1922, Michelin ran a contest for \\"naming the Michelin Tire Man\\" in the United States.[4]\\r\\nFrom 1912 onwards, tires became black in colour because carbon was added as a preservative and a strengthener to the basic rubber material. Before then, they were a gray-white or light and translucent-beige colour. Bibendum's appearance also changed. Though briefly featured in several print ads, Michelin quickly changed back his appearance, citing printing and aesthetic issues for the change, and not racial concerns as commonly believed.[5]\\r\\nThe name of the plump tire-man has entered the language to describe someone obese or wearing comically bulky clothing. (e.g. \\"How can I wrap up warm without looking like the Michelin Man?\\")[6]\\r\\nBibendum's shape has changed over the years. O'Galop's logo was based on bicycle tires, wore pince-nez glasses with lanyard, and smoked a cigar. By the 1980s, Bibendum was being shown running, and in 1998, his 100th anniversary, a slimmed-down version became the company's new logo. He had long since given up the cigar and pince-nez. The slimming of the logo reflected lower-profile, smaller tires of modern cars. Bib even had a similar-looking puppy as a companion when the duo were CGI animated for recent American television advertisements.\\r\\nA history of the emblem was written by Olivier Darmon and published in 1997: Le Grand Sicle de Bibendum; Paris: Ho?beke.[7]\\r\\nThe \\"Bibendum chair\\" was designed by Eileen Gray in 1925.\\r\\nCayce Pollard, the main character of William Gibson's novel Pattern Recognition, has a strong aversion to corporate brands and logos. The sight of Bibendum in particular gives her panic attacks.\\r\\nBibendum made a brief guest appearance in the Asterix series, as the chariot-wheel dealer in certain translations, including the English one, of Asterix in Switzerland. (The original French version used the Gaulish warrior mascot of French service-station company Antar.)\\r\\nMichelin sued the performance artist Momus for releasing a song about the trademarked Michelin Man.\\r\\nFrench reggae band Tryo sang about Bibendum on their album Grain de Sable. 'Monsieur Bibendum, il est vraiment norme / Monsieur Bibendum, le bonheur en personne' ('Mr Bibendum, he is truly enormous, Mr Bibendum; happiness in person').\\r\\nIn the 2009 animated, Academy Award-winning satire Logorama, a series of Bibendums play police detectives, a sheriff, and a squad of SWAT personnel who all work together to try to bring down a psychotic, ultraviolent criminal played by Ronald McDonald.","input":"What is the michelin man supposed to be?"},{"output":"15 March 2011","context":"","input":"When did the civil war started in syria?"},{"output":"short loin","context":"The strip steak is a cut of beef steaks from the short loin from a cow.

The title was almost without interruption held in conjunction with the rule of the Kingdom of Germany.[1][2][3]\\r\\nFrom an autocracy in Carolingian times the title evolved into an elected monarchy chosen by the prince-electors. The Holy Roman Emperor was widely perceived to rule by divine right by Roman Catholic rulers in Europe, and he often contradicted or rivaled the Pope, most notably during the Investiture controversy. In theory, the Holy Roman Emperor was primus inter pares (first among equals) among other Catholic monarchs. In practice, a Holy Roman Emperor was only as strong as his army and alliances, including marriage alliances, made him. There was never a Holy Roman Empress regnant, though women such as Theophanu and Maria Theresa of Austria served as de facto Empresses regnant.\\r\\nAfter the Reformation, many of the subject states in Germany turned Protestant while the Emperor continued to be a Roman Catholic. Until the Reformation, the Emperor elect (imperator electus) was required to be crowned by the Pope before assuming the imperial title.[citation needed] Various royal houses of Europe, at different times, became hereditary holders of the title. In particular the Habsburgs kept the longest possession of the title. The Holy Roman Empire was dissolved by Francis II, Holy Roman Emperor as a result of the collapse of the polity during the Napoleonic wars.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nFrom the time of Constantine I (4th century) the Roman emperors had, with very few exceptions, taken on a role as promoters and defenders of Christianity[citation needed]. The title of Emperor became defunct in Western Europe after the deposition of Julius Nepos in AD 480, although the rulers of the \\"barbarian kingdoms\\" continued to recognize the Eastern Emperor at least nominally well into the 6th century; both the title and connection between Emperor and Church continued in the Eastern Roman Empire until 1453, when it fell to the forces of the Ottoman Empire.\\r\\nIn the west, the title of Emperor (Imperator) was revived in 800, which also renewed ideas of imperialÿpapal cooperation. As the power of the papacy grew during the Middle Ages, popes and emperors came into conflict over church administration. The best-known and most bitter conflict was that known as the investiture controversy, fought during the 11th century between Henry?IV and Pope Gregory?VII.\\r\\nAfter Charlemagne was crowned Emperor of the Romans (Imperator Romanorum) by Pope Leo III, his successors maintained the title until the death of Berengar?I of Italy in 924. No pope appointed an emperor again until the coronation of Otto the Great in 962. Under Otto and his successors, much of the former Carolingian kingdom of Eastern Francia fell within the boundaries of the Holy Roman Empire. The various German princes elected one of their peers as King of the Germans, after which he would be crowned as emperor by the Pope. After Charles?V's coronation, all succeeding emperors were called elected Emperor due to the lack of papal coronation, but for all practical purposes they were simply called emperors.[citation needed]\\r\\nThe term sacrum (i.e., \\"holy\\") in connection with the German Roman Empire was first used in 1157 under Frederick?I Barbarossa.[4] Charles?V was the last Holy Roman Emperor to be crowned by the Pope (1530). The final Holy Roman Emperor-elect, Francis?II, abdicated in 1806 during the Napoleonic Wars that saw the Empire's final dissolution.\\r\\nThe standard designation of the Holy Roman Emperor was \\"August Emperor of the Romans\\" (Romanorum Imperator Augustus). When Charlemagne was crowned in?800, he was styled as \\"most serene Augustus, crowned by God, great and pacific emperor, governing the Roman Empire,\\" thus constituting the elements of \\"Holy\\" and \\"Roman\\" in the imperial title.[5]\\r\\nThe word Roman was a reflection of the principle of translatio imperii (or in this case restauratio imperii) that regarded the (Germanic) Holy Roman Emperors as the inheritors of the title of Emperor of the Western Roman Empire, despite the continued existence of the Eastern Roman Empire.\\r\\nIn German-language historiography, the term R?misch-deutscher Kaiser (\\"Roman-German emperor\\") is used to distinguish the title from that of Roman Emperor on one hand, and that of German Emperor (Deutscher Kaiser) on the other. The English term \\"Holy Roman Emperor\\" is a modern shorthand for \\"emperor of the Holy Roman Empire\\" not corresponding to the historical style or title, i.e., the adjective \\"holy\\" is not intended as modifying \\"emperor\\"; the English term \\"Holy Roman Emperor\\" gains currency in the interbellum period (1920s to 1930s); formerly the title had also been rendered \\"German-Roman emperor\\" in English.[6][7]\\r\\nThe elective monarchy of the kingdom of Germany goes back to the early 10th century, the election of Conrad I of Germany in 911 following the death without issue of Louis the Child, the last Carolingian ruler of Germany. Elections meant the kingship of Germany was only partially hereditary, unlike the kingship of France, although sovereignty frequently remained in a dynasty until there were no more male successors. The process of election meant that the prime candidate had to make concessions, by which the voters were kept on side, which were known as Wahlkapitulationen (electoral capitulation).\\r\\nConrad was elected by the German dukes, and it is not known precisely when the system of seven prince-electors was established. The papal decree Venerabilem by Innocent III (1202), addressed to Berthold V, Duke of Z?hringen, establishes the election procedure by (unnamed) princes of the realm, reserving for the pope the right to approve of the candidates. A letter of Pope Urban IV (1263), in the context of the disputed vote of 1256 and the subsequent the interregnum, suggests that by \\"immemorial custom\\", seven princes had the right to elect the King and future Emperor. The seven prince-electors are named in the Golden Bull of 1356: The Archbishop of Mainz, the Archbishop of Trier, the Archbishop of Cologne, the King of Bohemia, the Count Palatine of the Rhine, the Duke of Saxony and the Margrave of Brandenburg.\\r\\nAfter 1438, the Kings remained in the house of Habsburg and Habsburg-Lorraine, with the brief exception of Charles VII, who was a Wittelsbach. Maximilian I (Emperor 1508ÿ1519) and his successors no longer travelled to Rome to be crowned as Emperor by the Pope. Maximilian therefore named himself Elected Roman Emperor (Erw?hlter R?mischer Kaiser) in 1508 with papal approval. This title was in use by all his uncrowned successors. Of his successors only Charles V, the immediate one, received a papal coronation.\\r\\nThe Elector Palatine's seat was conferred on the Duke of Bavaria in 1621, but in 1648, in the wake of the Thirty Years' War, the Elector Palatine was restored, as eighth elector. Brunswick-Lneburg was added as ninth elector in 1692. The whole college was reshuffled in the German mediatization of 1803, a mere three years before the dissolution of the Empire.\\r\\nThis list includes all 47 German monarchs crowned from Charlemagne until the dissolution of the Holy Roman Empire (800ÿ1806).\\r\\nSeveral rulers were crowned King of the Romans (King of Germany) but not emperor, although they styled themselves thus, among whom were: Conrad I of Germany and Henry the Fowler in the 10th century, and Conrad IV, Rudolf I, Adolf and Albert I during the interregnum of the late 13th century.\\r\\nTraditional historiography assumes a continuity between the Carolingian Empire and the Holy Roman Empire, while a modern convention takes the coronation of Otto I in 962 as the starting point of the Holy Roman Empire (although the term Sacrum Imperium Romanum was not in use before the 13th century).\\r\\nThe rulers who were crowned as Roman Emperors in the Western Europe before 962 were as follows:\\r\\nThere was no emperor in the west between 924 and 962.\\r\\nWhile earlier Germanic and Italian monarchs had been crowned as Roman Emperors, the actual Holy Roman Empire is usually considered to have begun with the crowning of the Saxon king Otto I. It was officially an elective position, though at times it ran in families, notably the four generations of the Salian dynasty in the 11th century. From the end of the Salian dynasty through the middle 15th century, the Emperors drew from many different German dynasties, and it was rare for the throne to pass from father to son. That changed with the ascension of the Austrian House of Habsburg, as an unbroken line of Habsburgs would hold the Imperial throne until the 18th century, later a cadet branch known as the House of Habsburg-Lorraine would likewise pass it from father to son until the abolition of the Empire in 1806. Notably, the Habsburgs also dispensed with the requirement that emperors be crowned by the pope before exercising their office. Starting with Ferdinand I, all successive Emperors forwent the traditional coronation.\\r\\nThe interregnum of the Holy Roman Empire is taken to have lasted from the deposition of Frederick II by Pope Innocent IV (1245, alternatively form the death of Frederick 1250, or the death of Conrad IV 1254) and the election of Rudolf I of Germany (1273). Rudolf was not crowned emperor, nor were his successors Adolf and Albert. The next emperor was Henry VII, crowned on 29 June 1312 by Pope Clement V.\\r\\nThe Emperor was crowned in a special ceremony, traditionally performed by the Pope in Rome. Without that coronation, no king, despite exercising all powers, could call himself Emperor. In 1508, Pope Julius II allowed Maximilian I to use the title of Emperor without coronation in Rome, though the title was qualified as Electus Romanorum Imperator (\\"elected Emperor of the Romans\\"). Maximilian's successors adopted the same titulature, usually when they became the sole ruler of the Holy Roman Empire.[14] Maximilian's first successor Charles V was the last to be crowned Emperor.","input":"Who was crowned the first holy roman emperor?"},{"output":"5.9 trillion miles","context":"The light-year is a unit of length used to express astronomical distances. It is about 9.5 trillion kilometres or 5.9 trillion miles.[note 1] As defined by the International Astronomical Union (IAU), a light-year is the distance that light travels in vacuum in one Julian year (365.25 days).[2] Because it includes the word \\"year\\", the term light-year is sometimes misinterpreted as a unit of time.\\r\\nThe light-year is most often used when expressing distances to stars and other distances on a galactic scale, especially in nonspecialist and popular science publications. The unit usually used in professional astrometry is the parsec (symbol: pc, about 3.26 light-years; the distance at which one astronomical unit subtends an angle of one second of arc).[2]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nAs defined by the IAU, the light-year is the product of the Julian year[note 2] (365.25 days as opposed to the 365.2425-day Gregorian year) and the speed of light (7008299792458000000?299792458?m/s).[note 3] Both these values are included in the IAU (1976) System of Astronomical Constants, used since 1984.[4] From this, the following conversions can be derived. The IAU recognized abbreviation for light-year is ly,[2] although other standards like ISO 80000 uses \\"l.y.\\"[5][6] and localized symbols are frequent, such as \\"al\\" in French (from anne-lumire) and Spanish (from a?o luz), \\"Lj\\" in German (from Lichtjahr), etc.\\r\\nBefore 1984, the tropical year (not the Julian year) and a measured (not defined) speed of light were included in the IAU (1964) System of Astronomical Constants, used from 1968 to 1983.[7] The product of Simon Newcomb's J1900.0 mean tropical year of 7007315569259747000?31556925.9747 ephemeris seconds and a speed of light of 7008299792500000000?299792.5?km/s produced a light-year of 7015946053000000000?9.460530G1015?m (rounded to the seven significant digits in the speed of light) found in several modern sources[8][9][10] was probably derived from an old source such as C. W. Allen's 1973 Astrophysical Quantities reference work,[11] which was updated in 2000, including the IAU (1976) value cited above (truncated to 10 significant digits).[12]\\r\\nOther high-precision values are not derived from a coherent IAU system. A value of 7015946053620700000?9.460536207G1015?m found in some modern sources[13][14] is the product of a mean Gregorian year (365.2425 days or 7007315569520000000?31556952?s) and the defined speed of light (7008299792458000000?299792458?m/s). Another value, 7015946052840500000?9.460528405G1015?m,[15][16] is the product of the J1900.0 mean tropical year and the defined speed of light.\\r\\nAbbreviations used for light years and multiples of light years are\\r\\nThe light-year unit appeared a few years after the first successful measurement of the distance to a star other than the Sun, by Friedrich Bessel in 1838. The star was 61 Cygni, and he used a 6.2-inch (160?mm) heliometer designed by Joseph von Fraunhofer. The largest unit for expressing distances across space at that time was the astronomical unit, equal to the radius of the Earth's orbit (7011150000000000000?1.50G108?km or 7011149668992000000?9.30G107?mi). In those terms, trigonometric calculations based on 61 Cygni's parallax of 0.314 arcseconds, showed the distance to the star to be 7005660000000000000?660000 astronomical units (7016990000000000000?9.9G1013?km or 7016981699840000000?6.1G1013?mi). Bessel added that light employs 10.3 years to traverse this distance.[17] He recognized that his readers would enjoy the mental picture of the approximate transit time for light, but he refrained from using the light-year as a unit. He may have resented expressing distances in light-years because it would deteriorate the accuracy of his parallax data due to multiplying with the uncertain parameter of the speed of light. The speed of light was not yet precisely known in 1838; its value changed in 1849 (Fizeau) and 1862 (Foucault). It was not yet considered to be a fundamental constant of nature, and the propagation of light through the aether or space was still enigmatic. The light-year unit appeared, however, in 1851 in a German popular astronomical article by Otto Ule.[18] The paradox of a distance unit name ending on \\"year\\"' was explained by Ule by comparing it to a hiking road hour (Wegstunde). A contemporary German popular astronomical book also noticed that light-year is an odd name.[19] In 1868 an English journal labelled the light-year as a unit used by the Germans.[20] Eddington called the light-year an inconvenient and irrelevant unit, which had sometimes crept from popular use into technical investigations.[21]\\r\\nAlthough modern astronomers often prefer to use the parsec, light years are also popularly used to gauge the expanses of interstellar and intergalactic space.\\r\\nDistances expressed in light-years include those between stars in the same general area, such as those belonging to the same spiral arm or globular cluster. Galaxies themselves span from a few thousand to a few hundred thousand light-years in diameter, and are separated from neighbouring galaxies and galaxy clusters by millions of light-years. Distances to objects such as quasars and the Sloan Great Wall run up into the billions of light-years.\\r\\nDistances between objects within a star system tend to be small fractions of a light year, and are usually expressed in astronomical units. However, smaller units of length can similarly be formed usefully by multiplying units of time by the speed of light. For example, the light-second, useful in astronomy, telecommunications and relativistic physics, is exactly 7008299792458000000?299792458 metres or ?1?7007315576000000000?31557600 of a light-year. Units such as the light-minute, light-hour and light-day are sometimes used in popular science publications. The light-month, roughly one-twelfth of a light-year, is also used occasionally for approximate measures.[31][32] The Hayden Planetarium specifies the light month more precisely as 30 days of light travel time.[33]\\r\\nLight travels approximately one foot in a nanosecond; the term \\"light-foot\\" is sometimes used as an informal measure of time.[34]","input":"How many miles in a light year wiki?"},{"output":"Denis Villeneuve","context":"Blade Runner 2049 is an upcoming American neo-noir science fiction film directed by Denis Villeneuve and written by Hampton Fancher and Michael Green.[1] A sequel to Blade Runner (1982), it stars Ryan Gosling and Harrison Ford, who reprises his role as Rick Deckard, with Dave Bautista, Ana de Armas, Mackenzie Davis, Sylvia Hoeks, Lennie James, Carla Juri, Robin Wright and Jared Leto in supporting roles.

The term MAAG may still occasionally be used for such organizations helping promote military partnerships with several Latin American countries such as Peru and the Dominican Republic as well as in African countries such as Liberia.[citation needed]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nIn September 1950, US President Harry Truman sent the Military Assistance Advisory Group (MAAG) to Vietnam to assist the French in the First Indochina War. The President claimed they were not sent as combat troops, but to supervise the use of $10 million worth of US military equipment to support the French in their effort to fight the Viet Minh forces. By 1953, aid increased dramatically to $350 million to replace old military equipment owned by the French.[2]\\r\\nThe French Army however, was reluctant to take U.S. advice, and would not allow the Vietnamese army to be trained to use the new equipment, because it went against French policy. They were supposed to not only defeat enemy forces but to solidify themselves as a colonial power, and they could not do this with a Vietnamese Army. French commanders were so reluctant to accept advice that would weaken their time-honored colonial role that they got in the way of the various attempts by the MAAG to observe where the equipment was being sent and how it was being used. Eventually the French decided to cooperate, but at that point it was too late.[2]\\r\\nIn 1954 the commanding general of French forces in Indochina, General Henri Navarre, allowed the United States to send liaison officers to Vietnamese forces. But it was too late, because of the siege and fall of Dien Bien Phu in the spring. As stated by the Geneva Accords, France was forced to surrender the northern half of Vietnam and to withdraw from South Vietnam by April 1956.[3]\\r\\nAt a conference in Washington, D.C. on February 12, 1955, between officials of the U.S. State Department and the French Minister of Overseas Affairs, it was agreed that all U.S. aid would be funneled directly to South Vietnam and that all major military responsibilities would be transferred from the French to the MAAG under the command of Lieutenant General John O'Daniel. A problem arose however, because the French Expeditionary Force had to depart from South Vietnam in April 1956 pursuant to the Accords. After the French defeat, it was renamed the MAAG Vietnam in 1955, as the United States became more deeply involved in what would come to be known as the Vietnam War.\\r\\nThe next few years saw the rise of a Communist insurgency in South Vietnam, and President Diem looked increasingly to US military assistance to strengthen his position, albeit with certain reservations. Attacks on US military advisers in Vietnam became more frequent. On October 22, 1957, MAAG Vietnam and USIS installations in Saigon were bombed, injuring US military advisers.[4] In the summer of 1959, Communist guerrillas staged an attack on a Vietnamese military base in Bien Hoa, killing and wounding several MAAG personnel.[5] During this time, American advisers were not put in high-ranking positions, and President Diem was reluctant to allow American advisers into Vietnamese tactical units. He was afraid that the United States would gain control or influence over his forces if Americans got into the ranks of the army. The first signs that his position was beginning to shift came in 1960, when the number of official US military advisers in the country was increased from 327 to 685 at the request of the South Vietnamese government.[5] By 1961, communist guerrillas were becoming stronger and more active. This increased enemy contacts in size and intensity throughout South Vietnam. At this point, Diem was under pressure from US authorities to liberalize his regime and implement reforms. Although key elements in the US administration were resisting his requests for increased military funding and Army of the Republic of Vietnam (ARVN) troop ceilings, MAAG Vietnam played a significant role in advocating for a greater US presence in the country.[6] Throughout this period relations between the MAAG Vietnam and Diem were described as \\"excellent\\", even though the advisers were doubtful of his ability to hold off the insurgency.[7]\\r\\nNewly elected President John F. Kennedy agreed with MAAG Vietnam's calls for increases in ARVN troop levels and the U.S. military commitment in both equipment and men. In response, Kennedy provided $28.4 million in funding for ARVN, and overall military aid increased from $50 million per year to $144 million in 1961. In the first year of the Kennedy administration, MAAG Vietnam worked closely with administration officials, USOM, and the US Information Service to develop a counterinsurgency plan (CIP). The CIP's main initiatives included the strengthening of ARVN to combat the Communist insurgency, which had the corollary effect of strengthening Diem's political position.[8] At the same time President Diem agreed to the assignment of advisers to battalion level, significantly increasing the number of advisers; from 746 in 1961 to over 3,400 before MAAG Vietnam was placed under U.S. Military Assistance Command Vietnam (MACV) and renamed the Field Advisory Element, Vietnam. At the peak of the war in 1968, 9,430 Army personnel acted as advisors down to the district and battalion level to train, advise and mentor the Army of the Republic of Vietnam (ARVN), Republic of Vietnam Marine Corps, Republic of Vietnam Navy and the Republic of Vietnam Air Force.\\r\\nMAAG Indochina had three commanders: BG Francis G. Brink, October 1950 ÿ August 1952; MG Thomas J. H. Trapnell, August 1952 ÿ April 1954; and LTG John W. O'Daniel, April 1954 ÿ November 1955. MAAG Vietnam was commanded by LTG Samuel T. Williams, November 1955 ÿ September 1960; LTG Lionel C. McGarr, September 1960 ÿ January 1962; and GEN Paul D. Harkins, January 1962 ÿ June 1964.\\r\\nAs part of the military outreach of the USA to friendly countries in Southeast Asia, a MAAG was established in Bangkok, Thailand in September 1950.\\r\\nIt was replaced by the Joint US Military Advisory Group Thailand (JUSMAGTHAI) in September 1953, which operates until today.[9][10]\\r\\nMAAG Laos was preceded by the Programs Evaluation Office, established on 15 December 1955. Due to the limitations emplaced by international treaty, the PEO was set up with civilian personnel instead of a MAAG with a military staff. When political changes superseded the treaty, MAAG Laos was established in 1961 to replace the Programs Evaluation Office in its support of the Royal Lao Army's fight against the communist Pathet Lao. On July 23, 1962, several interested countries agreed in Geneva to guarantee the neutrality and independence of Laos. As such, the US removed the MAAG, replacing it with a Requirements Office, which served as a convenient cover for the CIA activities.[11]\\r\\nOne of MAAG Laos' commanders was Reuben Tucker.\\r\\nMAAG Cambodia was established on June 4, 1955, pursuant to the United States-Royal Government of Cambodia agreement of May 16, 1955. This agreement included the introduction of high-ranking US military personnel to advise the Cambodian armed forces as non-combatants.[12] The advisory group was staffed mainly by army personnel, with smaller contingents of navy and air force personnel.\\r\\nAs Cambodia's leadership took an official policy of neutrality in the Cold War, MAAG Cambodia's involvement in the country was terminated on November 20, 1963, by General Order 6, MAAG Cambodia, following the Cambodian government's cancellation of all U.S. aid.[13]\\r\\nIn Taiwan, U.S. Military Advisory Group generally refers to the United States Armed Forces in the Republic of China (Taiwan) from April 1951 to December 1978. The commander of these forces was U.S. Major General William C. Chase until his retirement in 1955 at which time he was succeeded by U.S. Brigadier General Lester Bork[14] American military advisers were tasked with providing arms and military advice, assisting with Taiwanese military training, implementation of the Sino-American Mutual Defense Treaty, maintaining military contacts, and monitoring Republic of China forces. In 1957 there were 10,000 Americans in Taiwan, the great majority being CIA and military personnel and their families.[15]\\r\\nSince 1979, the site of MAAG headquarters in Taipei has been occupied by American Institute in Taiwan/Taipei branch, which is scheduled to move to a new office complex in 2015.\\r\\n?This article incorporates?public domain material from the United States Army Center of Military History website http://www.history.army.mil/books/Vietnam/FA54-73/ch2.htm.","input":"When were the first us advisors sent to vietnam?"},{"output":"The Condor Passes","context":"El C܇ndor Pasa (pronounced?[el ?kondor pasa], Spanish for \\"The Condor Passes\\") is an orchestral musical piece from the zarzuela El C܇ndor Pasa by the Peruvian composer Daniel Aloma Robles, written in 1913 and based on traditional Andean music, specifically folk music from Peru.\\r\\nSince then, it has been estimated that around the world, more than 4000 versions of the melody have been produced, along with 300 sets of lyrics. In 2004, Peru declared this song as part of the national cultural heritage.[1] This song is now considered the second national anthem of Peru.[citation needed]\\r\\nIt is the best-known Peruvian song in the English-speaking world due to a 1970 cover by Simon & Garfunkel on their Bridge over Troubled Water album. Their version is called \\"El C܇ndor Pasa (If I Could)\\".\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1913, Peruvian songwriter Daniel Aloma Robles composed \\"El C܇ndor Pasa\\", and the song was first performed publicly at the Teatro Mazzi in Lima.[2] The song was originally a musical piece in the Peruvian zarzuela (musical play), El C܇ndor Pasa.\\r\\nIts music was composed by Daniel Aloma Robles in 1913 and its script was written by Julio de La Paz (pseudonym of the Limenian dramatist Julio Baudouin). The piano arrangement of this play's most famous melody was legally registered on May 3, 1933 by The Edward B. Marks Music Corp. in the Library of Congress, under the number 9643. The zarzuela is written in prose and consists of one musical play and two acts.\\r\\nIn July 2013, the Colectivo Cultural Centenario El C܇ndor Pasa cultural association re-edited the original script which had been lost for a period of time, and published it together with a CD containing the recorded dialogues and seven musical pieces. The music from the original score was reconstructed by musicologist Luis Salazar Meja with the collaboration of musicians Daniel Dorival and Claude Ferrier and the support of cultural promoter Mario Cerr܇n Fetta, and re-released on November 14, 15, and 16, 2013 at the Teatro UNI in Lima to celebrate its first centenary. The zarzuela included the famous homonymous melody, without lyrics, based on the traditional Andean music of Peru, where it was declared a National Cultural Heritage in 2004.\\r\\nIn 1965, the American musician Paul Simon heard for the first time a version of the melody by the band Los Incas in a performance at the Thatre de l'Est parisien in Paris in which both were participating. Simon became friendly with Los Incas band, later even touring with them and producing their first US-American album. He asked the band for permission to use the song in his production. The band's director and founding member Jorge Milchberg, who was collecting royalties for the song as co-author and arranger, responded erroneously that it was a traditional Peruvian composition. Milchberg told Simon he was registered as the arrangement's co-author and collected royalties.\\r\\nIn 1970, the Simon & Garfunkel duo covered the Los Incas version, adding some English lyrics which in turn added Paul Simon to the author credits under the song name \\"El C܇ndor Pasa (If I Could)\\". The instrumental version by Los Incas was used as the base track. They included the song on the 1970 album Bridge Over Troubled Water. Simon & Garfunkel released their version as a single in the U.S., which reached #18 on the Billboard Pop Singles chart and #6 on the Easy Listening chart,[3] in fall 1970. This cover achieved major international success and fame.\\r\\nIn regards to the Simon & Garfunkel version, Daniel Aloma Robles, Jorge Milchberg, and Paul Simon are now all listed as songwriters, with Simon listed alone as the author of the English lyrics. However, Daniel Aloma Robles was not originally listed as the composer because Jorge Milchberg had told Simon that the song was considered an Andean folk melody. He further stated that he was the registered co-author and arrangement of the composition.\\r\\nIn late 1970, Daniel Aloma Robles' son Armando Robles Godoy, a Peruvian filmmaker, filed a successful copyright lawsuit against Paul Simon. The grounds for the lawsuit extended that the song had been composed by his father, who had copyrighted the song in the United States in 1933.[2] Armando Robles Godoy has said that he bears no ill will towards Paul Simon for what he considers a \\"misunderstanding\\" and an \\"honest mistake\\".[4]\\r\\n\\"It was an almost friendly court case because Paul Simon was very respectful of other cultures. It was not carelessness on his part,\\" says Armando Robles Godoy.[4] \\"He happened to hear the song in Paris from a vernacular group Los Incas. He liked it, he went to ask the band for permission and they gave him the wrong information. Jorge Milchberg told him it was a traditional folk song from the 18th century and not my father's composition. It was a court case without further complications.\\"[4]\\r\\nLater that year, Perry Como released a cover of Paul Simon's English version on his album It's Impossible, while Julie Felix had a UK Top 20 hit with it, taking advantage of Simon & Garfunkel's decision not to release their version as a UK single.[5]\\r\\nArmando Robles Godoy subsequently wrote new Spanish lyrics for the song, taking Paul Simon's version as a reference.","input":"What is the meaning of el condor pasa?"},{"output":"7,869,820","context":"","input":"What is the population of long island new york?"},{"output":"intercept most greases and solids before they enter a wastewater disposal system","context":"A grease trap (also known as grease interceptor, grease recovery device and grease converter) is a plumbing device (a type of trap) designed to intercept most greases and solids before they enter a wastewater disposal system. Common wastewater contains small amounts of oils which enter into septic tanks and treatment facilities to form a floating scum layer. This scum layer is very slowly digested and broken down by microorganisms in the anaerobic digestion process. Large amounts of oil from food preparation in restaurants can overwhelm a septic tank or treatment facility, causing release of untreated sewage into the environment. High-viscosity fats and cooking grease such as lard solidify when cooled, and can combine with other disposed solids to block drain pipes.\\r\\nGrease traps have been used since Victorian days. Nathaniel Whiting obtained the first patent for a grease trap in the late 1800s. These reduce the amount of fats, oils and greases (FOGs) that enter sewers. They are boxes within the drain run that flows between the sinks in a kitchen the sewer system. They only have kitchen waste water flowing through them, and do not serve any other drainage system, such as toilets. They can be made from many different materials, such as stainless steel, plastics, concrete & cast iron. They range from 35 liter capacity to 45,000 liters and greater. They can be located above ground, below ground, inside the kitchen or outside the building.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThere are three primary types of devices. The most common are the types specified by ASME (American Society Of Mechanical Engineers), utilizing baffles, or a proprietary inlet diffuser.\\r\\nGrease trap sizing is based on the size of the 2- or 3-compartment sink, dishwasher, pot sinks, and mop sinks. The cumulative flow rates of these devices, as well as overall grease retention capacity (in pounds or kilograms) are considered. Currently, ASME Standard (ASME A112.14.3) is being adopted by both of the National Model Plumbing Codes that cover most of the US. This standard requires that grease interceptors remove a minimum of 90% of incoming FOGS (fats, oils and greases). It also requires that grease interceptors are third-party tested and certified to 90 days compliance with the standard pumping. This third-party testing must be conducted by a recognized and approved third-party testing laboratory.\\r\\nThe most common passive grease traps are smaller, point-of-use units used under three-compartment sinks or adjacent to dishwashers in the kitchen.\\r\\nThe second most common type of interceptor is the large in-ground tank, which is usually 500ÿ2,000 US gallons (1,900ÿ7,600?l; 420ÿ1,670?imp?gal). These units are constructed of concrete, fiberglass, or steel. By nature of their larger size, they have larger grease and solid storage capacities for high-flow applications such as a restaurant or hospital store. They are commonly called gravity interceptors. Interceptors require a retention time of 30 minutes to allow the fats, oils, grease and food solids to settle in the tank. As more waste water enters the tank, the grease-free water is pushed out of the tank. The rotting brown grease inside a grease trap or grease interceptor must be pumped out on a scheduled basis. The brown grease is not recycled and goes to landfill. On average 300 to 400 pounds (140 to 180?kg) of brown grease goes to landfill annually from each restaurant.\\r\\nA third system type, GRDs (grease recovery devices), removes the grease automatically when trapped. The recovered grease or \\"yellow grease\\" is recycled with the waste vegetable oil from the kitchen's deep-fryers. Restaurants must not pay for grease trap pumping as do restaurants with conventional grease traps or grease interceptors.\\r\\nPassive grease traps and passive grease interceptors must be emptied and cleaned when 25% full. As the passive devices fill with fats, oils, and grease, they become less productive for grease recovery. A full grease trap does not stop any FOG from entering the sanitary sewer system. The emptied contents or \\"brown grease\\" is considered hazardous waste in many jurisdictions. \\"Brown grease\\" is generally not recycled and goes to landfill waste.\\r\\nRestaurant and foodservice kitchens produce much waste grease which is present in the drain lines from various sinks, dishwashers and cooking equipment such as combi ovens and commercial woks. If not removed, the grease can clump and cause blockage and back-up in the sewer.\\r\\nIn the US, sewers back up annually an estimated 400,000 times, and municipal sewer overflows on 40,000 occasions.[1] The EPA has determined that sewer pipe blockages are the leading cause of sewer overflows, and grease is the primary cause of sewer blockages.[2] Even if accumulated FOG does not escalate into blockages and sanitary sewer overflows, it can disrupt wastewater utility operations and increase operations and maintenance requirements [3]\\r\\nFor these reasons, depending on the country, nearly all municipalities require commercial kitchen operations to use some type of interceptor device to collect grease before it enters sewers. Where FOG is a concern in the local wastewater system, communities have established inspection programs to ensure that these grease traps and/or interceptors are being routinely maintained.\\r\\nIt is estimated 50% of all sewer overflows are caused by grease blockages, with over 10?billion US gallons (3.8G1010?l; 8.3G109?imp?gal) of raw sewage spills annually.\\r\\nWhen the outflow from the kitchen sink enters the grease trap, the solid food particles sink to the bottom, while lighter grease and oil floats to the top. The relatively grease-free water is then fed into the normal septic system. The food solids at the bottom and floating oil and grease must be periodically removed in a manner similar to septic tank pumping. A traditional grease trap is not a food disposal unit. Unfinished food must be scraped into the garbage or food recycling bin. Milkshakes, gravy, sauces and food solids must be scraped off dishes before entering the sink or dishwasher.\\r\\nTo maintain some degree of efficiency, there has been a trend to specify larger traps. Unfortunately, providing a large tank for the effluent to stand also means that food waste has time to settle to the bottom of the tank, reducing available volume and adding to clean-out problems. Also, rotting food contained within an interceptor breaks down, producing toxic waste (such as sulfur gases) - hydrogen sulfide combines with the water present to create sulfuric acid. This attacks mild steel and concrete materials, resulting in \\"rot out\\", On the other hand, polyethylene has acid-resisting properties. A bigger interceptor is not a better interceptor. In most cases, multiple interceptors in series will separate grease much better.\\r\\nBecause it has been in the trap for some time, grease thus collected will be contaminated and is unsuitable for further use. This type of grease is called brown grease.\\r\\nWaste from passive grease traps and gravity interceptors is called brown grease. Brown grease is rotted food solids in combination with fats, oils, and grease (FOG). Brown grease is pumped from the traps and interceptors by grease pumping trucks. Unlike the collected yellow grease, the majority of brown grease goes to landfill sites. New facilities (2012) and new technology are beginning to allow brown grease to be recycled.","input":"What is the purpose of a grease trap?"}]`),M={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:C},data(){return{visibleCount:20,poemsData:I}},computed:{visiblePoems(){return this.poemsData.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{loadMore(){this.visibleCount+=20}}},x={class:"card-container"};function B(h,t,n,c,u,i){const m=p("PoemCard");return a(),o(l,null,[t[1]||(t[1]=e("section",null,[e("div",{class:"top-Banner"},[e("div",{class:"top-Banner-Title"},[e("div",{class:"top-Banner-Title-Text"},"🎉Q&A Life🥳")])])],-1)),e("section",null,[e("div",x,[(a(!0),o(l,null,g(i.visiblePoems,(r,f)=>(a(),y(m,{key:f,poem:r},null,8,["poem"]))),128))]),i.hasMorePoems?(a(),o("button",{key:0,class:"load-more-button",onClick:t[0]||(t[0]=(...r)=>i.loadMore&&i.loadMore(...r))},"See more")):w("",!0)])],64)}const P=d(M,[["render",B]]),F=JSON.parse('{"title":"","description":"","frontmatter":{"page":true},"headers":[],"relativePath":"qapage/40.md","filePath":"qapage/40.md"}'),H={name:"qapage/40.md"},W=Object.assign(H,{setup(h){return(t,n)=>(a(),o("div",null,[b(P)]))}});export{F as __pageData,W as default};
