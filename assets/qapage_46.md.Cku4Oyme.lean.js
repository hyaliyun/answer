The founders, clergy exiled under Mary I, returned to England shortly after the accession of Elizabeth I of England in 1558.\\r\\nPuritanism played a significant role in English history during the first half of the 17th century. One of the most effective stokers of anti-Catholic feeling was John Pym, whose movement succeeded in taking control of the government of London at the time of the Grand Remonstrance of 1641.\\r\\nPuritans were blocked from changing the established church from within and were severely restricted in England by laws controlling the practice of religion. Their beliefs, however, were transported by the emigration of congregations to the Netherlands, and later to New England in North America, and by evangelical clergy to Ireland (and later to Wales), and were spread into lay society and parts of the educational system, particularly certain colleges of the University of Cambridge. They took on distinctive beliefs about clerical dress and in opposition to the episcopal system, particularly after the 1619 conclusions of the Synod of Dort were resisted by the English bishops. They largely adopted Sabbatarianism in the 17th century, and were influenced by millennialism.\\r\\nThe Puritans were in alliance with the growing commercial world, with the parliamentary opposition to the royal prerogative, and with the Scottish Presbyterians in the late 1630s with whom they had much in common. Consequently, they became a major political force in England and came to power as a result of the First English Civil War (1642ÿ46). Almost all Puritan clergy left the Church of England after the Restoration of 1660 and the 1662 Uniformity Act, with many continuing to practice their faith in nonconformist denominations, especially in Congregationalist, as well as in Presbyterian churches.[2] The nature of the movement in England changed radically, although it retained its character for a much longer period in New England.\\r\\nPuritans by definition were dissatisfied with the limited extent of the English Reformation and with the Church of England's tolerance of practices which they associated with the Catholic Church. They formed and identified with various religious groups advocating greater purity of worship and doctrine, as well as personal and group piety. Puritans adopted a Reformed theology and, in that sense, were Calvinists (as were many of their earlier opponents), but they also took note of radical criticisms of Zwingli in Zurich and Calvin in Geneva. In church polity, some advocated separation from all other established Christian denominations in favor of autonomous gathered churches. These separatist and independent strands of Puritanism became prominent in the 1640s, when the supporters of a Presbyterian polity in the Westminster Assembly were unable to forge a new English national church.\\r\\nThe Puritans were never a formally defined sect or religious division within Protestantism, and the term \\"Puritan\\" itself was rarely used to describe people after the turn of the 18th century. Some Puritan ideals became incorporated into the Church of England, such as the formal rejection of Roman Catholicism; some were absorbed into the many Protestant denominations that emerged in the late 17th and early 18th centuries in the Americas and Britain. The Congregationalist Churches, widely considered to be a part of the Reformed tradition, are descended from the Puritans.[3][4] Moreover, Puritan beliefs are enshrined in the Savoy Declaration, the confession of faith held by the Congregationalist Churches, which they originated.[5]\\r\\nHistorically, the word \\"Puritan\\" was considered a pejorative term that characterized Protestant groups as extremists, similar to the Cathars of France. According to Thomas Fuller in his Church History, the term dates to 1564. Archbishop Matthew Parker of that time used it and \\"precisian\\" with the sense of the modern \\"stickler\\".[6] In modern times, the word \\"puritan\\" is often used to mean \\"against pleasure\\".[7]\\r\\nThe \\"Puritan\\" movement referred to the desire and goal of purifying the Church of England and Roman Catholic Church from within, in contrast to \\"Separatists\\" such as the Pilgrims, who believed that the established churches could not be reformed and the only hope was to set up separate churches. In this sense, the term \\"Puritan\\" was coined in the 1560s, when it first appeared as a term of abuse for those who found the Elizabethan Religious Settlement of 1559 inadequate. The term Puritan, therefore, was not intended to refer to strict morality, a common modern misunderstanding, but to a reforming attitude towards established churches.\\r\\nThe word \\"Puritan\\" was applied unevenly to a number of Protestant churches (and religious groups within the Anglican Church) from the late 16th century onwards. Puritans did not originally use the term for themselves. The practitioners knew themselves as members of particular churches or movements, and not by a single term. \\"Precise men\\" and \\"Precisians\\" were other early derogatory terms for Puritans, who preferred to call themselves \\"the godly\\" and the \\"saints\\". Seventeenth century English Puritan preacher Thomas Watson used \\"the godly\\" to describe Puritans in the title of one of his more famous works The Godly Man's Picture. The parliament that came into being on 4 July 1653, after a request by Oliver Cromwell and the Army Council of Offices was known by its supporters as the Parliament of Saints and the Barebones Parliament by its Royalist detractors.\\r\\nSome Puritans are known as \\"non-separating Puritans,\\" those who were not satisfied with the Reformation of the Church of England but who remained within it, advocating further reforms. This group disagreed among themselves about how much further reformation was possible or even necessary. Others thought that the Church of England was so corrupt that true Christians should separate from it altogether; they are known as \\"separating Puritans\\" or simply \\"Separatists\\". The term \\"Puritan\\" in the wider sense includes both groups.[8][9] Separatists had no particular Church title.\\r\\nThe Mayflower Pilgrims[10] were referred to only as Separatists.[11] Plymouth Colony leaders John Robinson and William Brewster were separatists.[12][13] In contrast, John Winthrop and the other main leaders of Puritan emigration to New England in 1629 were non-separating Puritans.[14] There is no current consensus among modern historians whether Separatists can properly be counted as Puritans,[15] but separatists and non-separatists alike have traditionally been viewed as two branches of the Puritan view.\\r\\nSeparating Puritans were called \\"Dissenters,\\" especially after the English Restoration of 1660. The 1662 Uniformity Act caused almost all Puritan clergy to leave the Church of England, the so-called Great Ejection or Black Bartholomew's Day (see below). Some of these 2,000 \\"ejected\\" clergymen became nonconformist ministers (later Congregationalists, Baptists, Unitarians, Presbyterians, etc.). The movement in England changed radically at this time, though this change was not as immediate across the Atlantic (see History of the Puritans in North America).\\r\\nIn modern usage, the word \\"puritan\\" is often used to describe someone who adheres to strict, joyless moral or religious principles. In this usage, hedonism and puritanism are antonyms.[7] In fact, Puritans embraced sexuality but placed it in the context of marriage. Peter Gay writes of the Puritans' standard reputation for \\"dour prudery\\" as a \\"misreading that went unquestioned in the nineteenth century\\", commenting how unpuritanical they were in favour of married sexuality, and in opposition to the Catholic veneration of virginity, citing Edward Taylor and John Cotton.[16] One Puritan settlement in Western Massachusetts banished a husband and sent him into exile because he refused to fulfill his marital duties to his wife.[17]\\r\\nPuritanism has a historical importance over a period of a century, followed by 50 years of development in New England. It changed character and emphasis almost decade-by-decade over that time.\\r\\nElizabethan Puritanism contended with the Elizabethan religious settlement, with little to show for it. The Lambeth Articles of 1595, a high-water mark for Calvinism within the Church of England, failed to receive royal approval.\\r\\nThe accession of James I brought the Millenary Petition, a Puritan manifesto of 1603 for reform of the English church, but James wanted a new religious settlement along different lines. He called the Hampton Court Conference in 1604, and heard the teachings of four prominent Puritan leaders there, including Laurence Chaderton, but largely sided with his bishops. He was well informed on theological matters by his education and Scottish upbringing, and he dealt shortly with the peevish legacy of Elizabethan Puritanism, pursuing an eirenic religious policy, in which he was arbiter.\\r\\nMany of his episcopal appointments were Calvinists, notably James Montague, who was an influential courtier. Puritans still opposed much of the Catholic summation in the Church of England, notably the Book of Common Prayer, but also the use of non-secular vestments (cap and gown) during services, the sign of the Cross in baptism, and kneeling to receive Holy Communion.[18] Some of the bishops under both Elizabeth and James tried to suppress the Puritan Movement, though other bishops were more tolerant and, in many places, individual ministers were able to omit disliked portions of the Book of Common Prayer.\\r\\nThe Puritan movement of Jacobean times became distinctive by adaptation and compromise, with the emergence of \\"semi-separatism,\\" \\"moderate puritanism,\\" the writings of William Bradshaw, who adopted the term \\"Puritan\\" as self-identification, and the beginnings of congregationalism.[19] Most Puritans of this period were non-separating and remained within the Church of England, and Separatists who left the Church of England altogether were numerically much fewer.\\r\\nThe Puritan movement in England was riven over decades by emigration and inconsistent interpretations of Scripture, as well as some political differences that surfaced at that time. The Fifth Monarchy Men, a radical millenarian wing of Puritanism, aided by strident, popular clergy like Vavasor Powell, agitated from the right wing of the movement, even as sectarian groups like the Ranters, Levelers, and Quakers pulled from the left.[20][21] The fragmentation created a collapse of the center and, ultimately, sealed a political failure, while depositing an enduring spiritual legacy that would remain and grow in English-speaking Christianity.[22]\\r\\nThe Westminster Assembly was called in 1643, assembling clergy of the Church of England. The Assembly was able to agree to the Westminster Confession of Faith doctrinally, a consistent Reformed theological position. The Directory of Public Worship was made official in 1645, and the larger framework (now called the Westminster Standards) was adopted by the Church of Scotland. In England, the Standards were contested by Independents up to 1660.[23]\\r\\nThe Westminster Divines, on the other hand, were divided over questions of church polity and split into factions supporting a reformed episcopacy, presbyterianism, congregationalism, and Erastianism. The membership of the Assembly was heavily weighted towards the Presbyterians, but Oliver Cromwell was a Congregationalist separatist who imposed his doctrines upon them. The Church of England of the Interregnum (1649ÿ60) was run along Presbyterian lines but never became a national Presbyterian church, such as existed in Scotland, and England was not the theocratic state which leading Puritans had called for as \\"godly rule\\".[24]\\r\\n\\r\\nAt the time of the English Restoration in 1660, the Savoy Conference was called to determine a new religious settlement for England and Wales. Under the Act of Uniformity 1662, the Church of England was restored to its pre-Civil War constitution with only minor changes, and the Puritans found themselves sidelined. A traditional estimate of historian Calamy is that around 2,400 Puritan clergy left the Church in the \\"Great Ejection\\" of 1662.[25] At this point, the term \\"Dissenter\\" came to include \\"Puritan,\\" but more accurately described those (clergy or lay) who \\"dissented\\" from the 1662 Book of Common Prayer.[citation needed]\\r\\nThe Dissenters divided themselves from all Christians in the Church of England and established their own separatist congregations in the 1660s and 1670s. An estimated 1,800 of the ejected clergy continued in some fashion as ministers of religion, according to Richard Baxter.[25] The government initially attempted to suppress these schismatic organisations by using the Clarendon Code. There followed a period in which schemes of \\"comprehension\\" were proposed, under which Presbyterians could be brought back into the Church of England, but nothing resulted from them. The Whigs opposed the court religious policies and argued that the Dissenters should be allowed to worship separately from the established Church, and this position ultimately prevailed when the Toleration Act was passed in the wake of the Glorious Revolution in 1689. This permitted the licensing of Dissenting ministers and the building of chapels. The term \\"Nonconformist\\" generally replaced the term \\"Dissenter\\" from the middle of the 18th century.\\r\\nThe idea of personal Biblical interpretation through the Holy Spirit was central to Puritan beliefs, though it was shared with most Protestants in general at that time. Puritans sought both individual and corporate conformity to the teaching of the Bible, with moral purity pursued down to the smallest detail, as well as ecclesiastical purity to the highest level. They believed that man existed for the glory of God, that his first concern in life was to do God's will and so to receive future happiness. They believed that Jesus Christ was the center of public and personal affairs, and was to be exalted above all other names.[26]\\r\\nVarious strands of Calvinistic theology in the 17th century were taken up by different parts of the Puritan movement and, in particular, Amyraldism was adopted by some influential figures, including John Davenant, Samuel Ward and, to some extent, Richard Baxter. In the same fashion, there is no theory of church polity that is uniquely Puritan, and ideology differed beyond opposition to Erastianism (state control), though even that had its small group of supporters in the Westminster Assembly. Some approved of the existing church hierarchy with bishops, but others sought to reform the Episcopal churches on the Presbyterian model. Some Separatist Puritans were Presbyterian, but most were early Congregationalists. The separating Congregationalists believed that the Divine Right of Kings was heresy but, on the other hand, there were many royalist Presbyterians, in terms of allegiance in the political struggle.\\r\\nMigration also brought out differences and brought together Puritan communities with their own regional customs and beliefs. The New World Puritans' policies of church governance diverged from those remaining in the British Isles, who faced different issues.[27]\\r\\nPuritans believed in the active existence of demonic forces, as did almost all Christians of this period. Puritan pastors undertook exorcisms for demonic possession in some high-profile cases, and believed in some allegations of witchcraft. Exorcist John Darrell was supported by Arthur Hildersham in the case of Thomas Darling.[28] Samuel Harsnett, a skeptic on witchcraft and possession, attacked Darrell. However, Harsnett was in the minority, and many clergy, not only Puritans, believed in witchcraft and possession.[29] The possession case of Richard Dugdale was taken up by ejected nonconformist Thomas Jollie and other local ministers in 1689.\\r\\nThe context of the Salem witch trials of 1692ÿ93 shows the intricacy of trying to place \\"Puritan\\" beliefs as distinctive. The publication of Saducismus Triumphatus, an anti-skeptical tract that has been implicated in the moral panic at Salem, involved Joseph Glanvill (a latitudinarian) and Henry More (a Cambridge Platonist) as editors, and Anthony Horneck, an evangelical German Anglican, as translator of a pamphlet about a Swedish witch hunt. None of these was a Puritan. Glanvill and More had been vehemently opposed in the 1670s by skeptic John Webster, an Independent and sometime chaplain to the Parliamentary forces.\\r\\nPuritan millennialism has been placed in the broader context of European Reformed beliefs about the millennium and interpretation of Biblical prophecy, for which representative figures of the period were Johannes Piscator, Thomas Brightman, Joseph Mede, Johannes Heinrich Alsted, and John Amos Comenius.[30] Both Brightman and Mede were Puritan by conviction, and so are identified as such by their biographers, though neither clashed with the church authorities. David Brady describes a \\"lull before the storm\\" in the early 17th century, in which \\"reasonably restrained and systematic\\" Protestant exegesis of the Book of Revelation was seen with Brightman, Mede, and Hugh Broughton, after which \\"apocalyptic literature became too easily debased\\" as it became more populist and less scholarly.[31]\\r\\nWilliam Lamont argues that, within the church, the Elizabethan millennial beliefs of John Foxe became sidelined, with Puritans adopting instead the \\"centrifugal\\" doctrines of Thomas Brightman, while the Laudians replaced the \\"centripetal\\" attitude of Foxe to the \\"Christian Emperor\\" by the national and episcopal Church closer to home, with its royal head, as leading the Protestant world iure divino (by divine right).[32] Viggo Norskov Olsen writes[33] that Mede \\"broke fully away from the Augustinian-Foxian tradition, and is the link between Brightman and the premillennialism of the 17th century\\".\\r\\nThe dam broke in 1641 when the traditional retrospective reverence for Thomas Cranmer and other martyred bishops in the Acts and Monuments was displaced by forward-looking attitudes to prophecy among radical Puritans.[32]\\r\\nSome strong religious beliefs common to Puritans had direct impacts on culture. Education was essential to the masses so that they could read the Bible for themselves.\\r\\nThe opposition to acting as public performance, typified by William Prynne's book Histriomastix, was not a concern with drama as a form. John Milton wrote Samson Agonistes as verse drama, and had contemplated writing Paradise Lost in that form at an early stage. N.H. Keeble writes:\\r\\n...when Milton essayed drama, it was with explicit Pauline authority and neither intended for the stage nor in the manner of the contemporary theatre.\\r\\nBut the sexualization of Restoration theatre was attacked as strongly as ever by Thomas Gouge, as Keeble points out.[34] Puritans eliminated the use of musical instruments in their religious services for theological and practical reasons. The only music remaining in church services was the setting of the psalms. Church organs were commonly damaged or destroyed in the Civil War period, such as when an axe was taken to the organ of Worcester Cathedral in 1642.[35]\\r\\nThe Merton Thesis is an argument about the nature of early experimental science proposed by Robert K. Merton. Similar to Max Weber's famous claim on the link between Protestant ethic and the capitalist economy, Merton argued for a similar positive correlation between the rise of Protestant Pietism in Germany and as well English Puritanism and early experimental science.[36] The Merton Thesis has resulted in continuous debates.[37] As an example, seven of 10 nucleus members of the Royal Society were Puritans. In the year 1663 sixty-two percent of the members of the Royal Society were similarly identified.[38]\\r\\nBased on Biblical portrayals of Adam and Eve, Puritans believed that marriage was rooted in procreation, love, and, most importantly, salvation.[39] Husbands were the spiritual heads of the household, while women were to demonstrate religious piety and obedience under male authority.[40] Furthermore, marriage represented not only the relationship between husband and wife, but also the relationship between spouses and God. Puritan husbands commanded authority through family direction and prayer. The female relationship to her husband and to God was marked by submissiveness and humility.[41]\\r\\nThomas Gataker describes Puritan marriage as:\\r\\n... together for a time as copartners in grace here, [that] they may reigne together forever as coheires in glory hereafter.[42]\\r\\nThe paradox created by female inferiority in the public sphere and the spiritual equality of men and women in marriage, then, gave way to the informal authority of women concerning matters of the home and childrearing.[43] With the consent of their husbands, wives made important decisions concerning the labour of their children, property, and the management of inns and taverns owned by their husbands.[44] Pious Puritan mothers laboured for their children's righteousness and salvation, connecting women directly to matters of religion and morality.[45] In her poem titled \\"In Reference to her Children,\\" poet Anne Bradstreet reflects on her role as a mother:\\r\\nI had eight birds hatched in one nest; Four cocks there were, and hens the rest. I nursed them up with pain and care, Nor cost nor labor I did spare.\\r\\nBradstreet alludes to the temporality of motherhood by comparing her children to a flock of birds on the precipice of leaving home. While Puritans praised the obedience of young children, they also believed that, by separating children from their mothers at adolescence, children could better sustain a superior relationship with God.[46] A child could only be redeemed through religious education and obedience. Girls carried the additional burden of Eve's corruption and were catechised separately from boys at adolescence. Boys' education prepared them for vocations and leadership roles, while girls were educated for domestic and religious purposes. The pinnacle of achievement for children in Puritan society, however, occurred with the conversion process.[45]\\r\\nPuritans viewed the relationship between master and servant similarly to that of parent and child. Just as parents were expected to uphold Puritan religious values in the home, masters assumed the parental responsibility of housing and educating young servants. Older servants also dwelt with masters and were cared for in the event of illness or injury. African-American and Indian servants were likely excluded from such benefits.[47]\\r\\nPuritans left for New England, particularly in the years after 1630, supporting the founding of the Massachusetts Bay Colony and other settlements among the northern colonies. The large-scale Puritan emigration to New England ceased by 1641, with around 21,000 having moved across the Atlantic. This English-speaking population in America did not all consist of original colonists, since many returned to England shortly after arriving on the continent, but it produced more than 16 million descendants.[48][49] This so-called \\"Great Migration\\" is not so named because of sheer numbers, which were much less than the number of English citizens who emigrated to Virginia and the Caribbean during this time.[50] The rapid growth of the New England colonies (around 700,000 by 1790) was almost entirely due to the high birth rate and lower death rate per year.[51]\\r\\nPuritan hegemony lasted for at least a century. That century can be broken down into three parts: the generation of John Cotton and Richard Mather, 1630ÿ61 from the founding to the Restoration, years of virtual independence and nearly autonomous development; the generation of Increase Mather, 1662ÿ89 from the Restoration and the Halfway Covenant to the Glorious Revolution, years of struggle with the British crown; and the generation of Cotton Mather, 1689ÿ1728 from the overthrow of Edmund Andros (in which Cotton Mather played a part) and the new charter, mediated by Increase Mather, to the death of Cotton Mather.[52]\\r\\nIn the area of education, New England differed from its mother country, where nothing in English statute required schoolmasters or the literacy of children. The Puritan model of education in New England was unique, with the possible exception of Scotland. John Winthrop claimed in 1630 that the society which they would form in New England would be \\"as a city upon a hill,\\"[53] and the colony leaders would educate all. These were men of letters. They had attended Oxford or Cambridge and communicated with intellectuals all over Europe. In 1636, they founded the school that soon became Harvard College.\\r\\nBesides the Bible, children needed to read to \\"understand ... the capital laws of this country,\\" as the Massachusetts code declared, order being of the utmost importance, and children not taught to read would grow \\"barbarous\\" (the 1648 amendment to the Massachusetts law and the 1650 Connecticut code both used the word \\"barbarisme\\"). By the 1670s, all New England colonies except Rhode Island had passed legislation that mandated literacy for children. In 1647, Massachusetts passed a law that required towns to hire a schoolmaster to teach writing.\\r\\nForms of schooling ranged from dame schools to \\"Latin\\" schools for boys already literate in English and ready to master preparatory grammar for Latin, Hebrew, and Greek. Reading schools were often the single source of education for girls, whereas boys would go to the town grammar schools. Gender largely determined educational practices; women introduced all children to reading, and men taught boys in higher pursuits. Latin grammar schools did not accept girls (nor did Harvard), since grammar schools were designed to \\"instruct youth so far as they may be fited for the university,\\" and girls could play no role in the ministry. Most evidence suggests that girls could not attend the less ambitious town schools, the lower-tier writing-reading schools mandated for townships of over 50 families.\\r\\nThe Plymouth Colony Puritans of New England disapproved of Christmas celebrations, as did some other Protestant churches of the time. Celebration was outlawed in Boston from 1659.[54] The ban was revoked in 1681 by the English-appointed governor Edmund Andros, who also revoked a Puritan ban on festivities on Saturday nights.[54] Nevertheless, it was not until the mid-19th century that celebrating Christmas became fashionable in the Boston region.[55] Likewise, the colonies banned many secular entertainments on moral grounds, such as drama and games of chance.[56]\\r\\nThey were not, however, opposed to drinking alcohol in moderation.[57] Early New England laws banning the sale of alcohol to Native Americans were criticised because it was \\"not fit to deprive Indians of any lawfull comfort aloweth to all men by the use of wine.\\" Laws banned the practice of individuals toasting each other, with the explanation that it led to wasting God's gift of beer and wine, as well as being carnal. Bounds were not set on enjoying sexuality within the bounds of marriage, as a gift from God.[58] In fact, spouses were disciplined if they did not perform their sexual marital duties, in accordance with 1 Corinthians 7 and other biblical passages. Women and men were equally expected to fulfill marital responsibilities.[59] Women and men could file for divorce based on this issue alone. In Massachusetts colony, which had some of the most liberal colonial divorce laws, one out of every six divorce petitions was filed on the basis on male impotence.[60] An issue which held significant cultural ramifications, Puritans publicly punished drunkenness and sexual relations outside marriage.\\r\\nThe Puritans exhibited intolerance to other religious views, including Quaker, Anglican and Baptist theologies. The Puritans of the Massachusetts Bay Colony were the most active of the New England persecutors of Quakers, and the persecuting spirit was shared by the Plymouth Colony and the colonies along the Connecticut river.[61]\\r\\nIn 1660, one of the most notable victims of the religious intolerance was English Quaker Mary Dyer, who was hanged in Boston for repeatedly defying a Puritan law banning Quakers from the colony.[61] She was one of the four executed Quakers known as the Boston martyrs. The hanging of Dyer on Boston Common marked the beginning of the end of the Puritan theocracy.[62] In 1661, King Charles II explicitly forbade Massachusetts from executing anyone for professing Quakerism.[62] In 1684, England revoked the Massachusetts charter, sent over a royal governor to enforce English laws in 1686 and, in 1689, passed a broad Toleration Act.[62]\\r\\nThe first two of the four Boston martyrs were executed by the Puritans on October 27, 1659, and in memory of this, October 27 is now International Religious Freedom Day to recognize the importance of freedom of religion.[63] Anti-Catholic sentiment appeared in New England with the first Pilgrim and Puritan settlers.[64] In 1647, Massachusetts passed a law prohibiting any Jesuit Roman Catholic priests from entering territory under Puritan jurisdiction.[65] Any suspected person who could not clear himself was to be banished from the colony; a second offense carried a death penalty.[66]\\r\\nAlexis de Tocqueville suggested in Democracy in America that Puritanism was the very thing that provided a firm foundation for American democracy. As Sheldon Wolin puts it, \\"Tocqueville was aware of the harshness and bigotry of the early colonists\\". However, on the other hand, he saw them as \\"archaic survivals, not only in their piety and discipline but in their democratic practices\\".[67] The theme of a religious basis of economic discipline is echoed in sociologist Max Weber's work, but both de Tocqueville and Weber argued that this discipline was not a force of economic determinism, but one factor among many that should be considered when evaluating the relative economic success of the Puritans.\\r\\nThe literature on Puritans, particularly biographical literature on individual Puritan ministers, was already voluminous in the 17th century and, indeed, the interests of Puritans in the narratives of early life and conversions made the recording of the internal lives important to them. The historical literature on Puritans is, however, quite problematic and subject to controversies over interpretation. The early writings are those of the defeated, excluded and victims. The great interest of authors of the 19th century in Puritan figures was routinely accused in the 20th century of consisting of anachronism and the reading back of contemporary concerns.\\r\\nA debate continues on the definition of \\"Puritanism\\".[68] English historian Patrick Collinson believes that \\"Puritanism had no content beyond what was attributed to it by its opponents.\\"[69] The analysis of \\"mainstream Puritanism\\" in terms of the evolution from it of Separatist and antinomian groups that did not flourish, and others that continue to this day, such as Baptists and Quakers, can suffer in this way. The national context (England and Wales, as well as the kingdoms of Scotland and Ireland) frames the definition of Puritans, but was not a self-identification for those Protestants who saw the progress of the Thirty Years' War from 1620 as directly bearing on their denomination, and as a continuation of the religious wars of the previous century, carried on by the English Civil Wars. English historian Christopher Hill, who has contributed to analyses of Puritan concerns that are more respected than accepted, writes of the 1630s, old church lands, and the accusations that William Laud was a crypto-Catholic:\\r\\nTo the heightened Puritan imagination it seemed that, all over Europe, the lamps were going out: the Counter-Reformation was winning back property for the church as well as souls: and Charles I and his government, if not allied to the forces of the Counter-Reformation, at least appeared to have set themselves identical economic and political objectives.[70]\\r\\nPuritans were politically important in England, but it is debated whether the movement was in any way a party with policies and leaders before the early 1640s. While Puritanism in New England was important culturally for a group of colonial pioneers in America, there have been many studies trying to pin down exactly what the identifiable cultural component was. Fundamentally, historians remain dissatisfied with the grouping as \\"Puritan\\" as a working concept for historical explanation. The conception of a Protestant work ethic, identified more closely with Calvinist or Puritan principles, has been criticised at its root,[by whom?] mainly as a post hoc ergo propter hoc fallacy aligning economic success with a narrow religious scheme.","input":"Who were the puritans and what were their beliefs and practices?"},{"output":"the majority of the area between the crest of the Rocky Mountains and the crest of the Appalachian Mountains, except for various regions drained to Hudson Bay by the Red River of the North","context":"The Mississippi River is the chief river of the second-largest drainage system on the North American continent, second only to the Hudson Bay drainage system.[13][14] The stream is entirely within the United States (although its drainage basin reaches into Canada), its source is in northern Minnesota and it flows generally south for 2,320 miles (3,730?km)[14] to the Mississippi River Delta in the Gulf of Mexico. With its many tributaries, the Mississippi's watershed drains all or parts of 31 U.S. states and two Canadian provinces between the Rocky and Appalachian Mountains. The Mississippi ranks as the fourth-longest and fifteenth-largest river in the world by discharge. The river either borders or passes through the states of Minnesota, Wisconsin, Iowa, Illinois, Missouri, Kentucky, Tennessee, Arkansas, Mississippi, and Louisiana.[15][16]\\r\\nNative Americans long lived along the Mississippi River and its tributaries. Most were hunter-gatherers, but some, such as the Mound Builders, formed prolific agricultural societies. The arrival of Europeans in the 16th century changed the native way of life as first explorers, then settlers, ventured into the basin in increasing numbers.[17] The river served first as a barrier, forming borders for New Spain, New France, and the early United States, and then as a vital transportation artery and communications link. In the 19th century, during the height of the ideology of manifest destiny, the Mississippi and several western tributaries, most notably the Missouri, formed pathways for the western expansion of the United States.\\r\\nFormed from thick layers of the river's silt deposits, the Mississippi embayment is one of the most fertile agricultural regions of the country, which resulted in the river's storied steamboat era. During the American Civil War, the Mississippi's capture by Union forces marked a turning point towards victory due to the river's importance as a route of trade and travel, not least to the Confederacy. Because of substantial growth of cities and the larger ships and barges that supplanted riverboats, the first decades of the 20th century saw the construction of massive engineering works such as levees, locks and dams, often built in combination.\\r\\nSince modern development of the basin began, the Mississippi has also seen its share of pollution and environmental problems ÿ most notably large volumes of agricultural runoff, which has led to the Gulf of Mexico dead zone off the Delta. In recent years, the river has shown a steady shift towards the Atchafalaya River channel in the Delta; a course change would be an economic disaster for the port city of New Orleans.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe word Mississippi itself comes from Messipi, the French rendering of the Anishinaabe (Ojibwe or Algonquin) name for the river, Misi-ziibi (Great River).\\r\\nIn the 18th century, the river was the primary western boundary of the young United States, and since the country's expansion westward, the Mississippi River has been widely considered a convenient if approximate dividing line between the Eastern, Southern, and Midwestern United States, and the Western United States. This is exemplified by the Gateway Arch in St. Louis and the phrase \\"Trans-Mississippi\\" as used in the name of the Trans-Mississippi Exposition.\\r\\nIt is common to qualify a regionally superlative landmark in relation to it, such as \\"the highest peak east of the Mississippi\\"[18] or \\"the oldest city west of the Mississippi\\".[19] The FCC also uses it as the dividing line for broadcast callsigns, which begin with W to the east and K to the west, mixing together in media markets along the river.\\r\\nThe geographical setting of the Mississippi River includes considerations of the course of the river itself, its watershed, its outflow, its prehistoric and historic course changes, and possibilities of future course changes. The New Madrid Seismic Zone along the river is also noteworthy. These various basic geographical aspects of the river in turn underlie its human history and present uses of the waterway and its adjacent lands.\\r\\nThe Mississippi River can be divided into three sections: the Upper Mississippi, the river from its headwaters to the confluence with the Missouri River; the Middle Mississippi, which is downriver from the Missouri to the Ohio River; and the Lower Mississippi, which flows from the Ohio to the Gulf of Mexico.\\r\\nThe Upper Mississippi runs from its headwaters to its confluence with the Missouri River at St. Louis, Missouri. It is divided into two sections:\\r\\nThe source of the Upper Mississippi branch is traditionally accepted as Lake Itasca, 1,475 feet (450?m) above sea level in Itasca State Park in Clearwater County, Minnesota. The name \\"Itasca\\" was chosen to designate the \\"true head\\" of the Mississippi River as a combination of the last four letters of the Latin word for truth (veritas) and the first two letters of the Latin word for head (caput).[20] However, the lake is in turn fed by a number of smaller streams.\\r\\nFrom its origin at Lake Itasca to St. Louis, Missouri, the waterway's flow is moderated by 43 dams. Fourteen of these dams are located above Minneapolis in the headwaters region and serve multiple purposes, including power generation and recreation. The remaining 29 dams, beginning in downtown Minneapolis, all contain locks and were constructed to improve commercial navigation of the upper river. Taken as a whole, these 43 dams significantly shape the geography and influence the ecology of the upper river. Beginning just below Saint Paul, Minnesota, and continuing throughout the upper and lower river, the Mississippi is further controlled by thousands of wing dikes that moderate the river's flow in order to maintain an open navigation channel and prevent the river from eroding its banks.\\r\\nThe head of navigation on the Mississippi is the Coon Rapids Dam in Coon Rapids, Minnesota. Before it was built in 1913, steamboats could occasionally go upstream as far as Saint Cloud, Minnesota, depending on river conditions.\\r\\nThe uppermost lock and dam on the Upper Mississippi River is the Upper St. Anthony Falls Lock and Dam in Minneapolis. Above the dam, the river's elevation is 799 feet (244?m). Below the dam, the river's elevation is 750 feet (230?m). This 49-foot (15?m) drop is the largest of all the Mississippi River locks and dams. The origin of the dramatic drop is a waterfall preserved adjacent to the lock under an apron of concrete. Saint Anthony Falls is the only true waterfall on the entire Mississippi River. The water elevation continues to drop steeply as it passes through the gorge carved by the waterfall.\\r\\nAfter the completion of the St. Anthony Falls Lock and Dam in 1963, the river's head of navigation moved upstream, to the Coon Rapids Dam. However, the Locks were closed in 2015 to control the spread of invasive Asian carp, making Minneapolis once again the site of the head of navigation of the river.[21]\\r\\nThe Upper Mississippi has a number of natural and artificial lakes, with its widest point being Lake Winnibigoshish, near Grand Rapids, Minnesota, over 11 miles (18?km) across. Lake Onalaska, created by Lock and Dam No. 7, near La Crosse, Wisconsin, is more than 4 miles (6.4?km) wide. Lake Pepin, a natural lake formed behind the delta of the Chippewa River of Wisconsin as it enters the Upper Mississippi, is more than 2 miles (3.2?km) wide.[22]\\r\\nBy the time the Upper Mississippi reaches Saint Paul, Minnesota, below Lock and Dam No. 1, it has dropped more than half its original elevation and is 687 feet (209?m) above sea level. From St. Paul to St. Louis, Missouri, the river elevation falls much more slowly, and is controlled and managed as a series of pools created by 26 locks and dams.[23]\\r\\nThe Upper Mississippi River is joined by the Minnesota River at Fort Snelling in the Twin Cities; the St. Croix River near Prescott, Wisconsin; the Cannon River near Red Wing, Minnesota; the Zumbro River at Wabasha, Minnesota; the Black, La Crosse, and Root rivers in La Crosse, Wisconsin; the Wisconsin River at Prairie du Chien, Wisconsin; the Rock River at the Quad Cities; the Iowa River near Wapello, Iowa; the Skunk River south of Burlington, Iowa; and the Des Moines River at Keokuk, Iowa. Other major tributaries of the Upper Mississippi include the Crow River in Minnesota, the Chippewa River in Wisconsin, the Maquoketa River and the Wapsipinicon River in Iowa, and the Illinois River in Illinois.\\r\\nThe Upper Mississippi is largely a multi-thread stream with many bars and islands. From its confluence with the St. Croix River downstream to Dubuque, Iowa, the river is entrenched, with high bedrock bluffs lying on either side. The height of these bluffs decreases to the south of Dubuque, though they are still significant through Savanna, Illinois. This topography contrasts strongly with the Lower Mississippi, which is a meandering river in a broad, flat area, only rarely flowing alongside a bluff (as at Vicksburg, Mississippi).\\r\\nThe Mississippi River is known as the Middle Mississippi from the Upper Mississippi River's confluence with the Missouri River at St. Louis, Missouri, for 190 miles (310?km) to its confluence with the Ohio River at Cairo, Illinois.[24][25]\\r\\nThe Middle Mississippi is relatively free-flowing. From St. Louis to the Ohio River confluence, the Middle Mississippi falls 220 feet (67?m) over 180 miles (290?km) for an average rate of 1.2 feet per mile (23?cm/km). At its confluence with the Ohio River, the Middle Mississippi is 315 feet (96?m) above sea level. Apart from the Missouri and Meramec rivers of Missouri and the Kaskaskia River of Illinois, no major tributaries enter the Middle Mississippi River.\\r\\nThe Mississippi River is called the Lower Mississippi River from its confluence with the Ohio River to its mouth at the Gulf of Mexico, a distance of about 1,000 miles (1,600?km). At the confluence of the Ohio and the Middle Mississippi, the long-term mean discharge of the Ohio at Cairo, Illinois is 281,500 cubic feet per second (7,970 cubic metres per second),[26] while the long-term mean discharge of the Mississippi at Thebes, Illinois (just upriver from Cairo) is 208,200?cu?ft/s (5,900?m3/s).[27] Thus, by volume, the main branch of the Mississippi River system at Cairo can be considered to be the Ohio River (and the Allegheny River further upstream), rather than the Middle Mississippi.\\r\\nIn addition to the Ohio River, the major tributaries of the Lower Mississippi River are the White River, flowing in at the White River National Wildlife Refuge in east central Arkansas; the Arkansas River, joining the Mississippi at Arkansas Post; the Big Black River in Mississippi; and the Yazoo River, meeting the Mississippi at Vicksburg, Mississippi. The widest point of the Mississippi River is in the Lower Mississippi portion where it exceeds 1 mile (1.6?km) in width in several places.\\r\\nDeliberate water diversion at the Old River Control Structure in Louisiana allows the Atchafalaya River in Louisiana to be a major distributary of the Mississippi River, with 30% of the Mississippi flowing to the Gulf of Mexico by this route, rather than continuing down the Mississippi's current channel past Baton Rouge and New Orleans on a longer route to the Gulf.[28][29][30] Although the Red River is commonly thought to be a tributary, it is actually not, because its water flows separately into the Gulf of Mexico through the Atchafalaya River.\\r\\nThe Mississippi River has the world's fourth-largest drainage basin (\\"watershed\\" or \\"catchment\\"). The basin covers more than 1,245,000 square miles (3,220,000?km2), including all or parts of 31[31] U.S. states and two Canadian provinces. The drainage basin empties into the Gulf of Mexico, part of the Atlantic Ocean. The total catchment of the Mississippi River covers nearly 40% of the landmass of the continental United States. The highest point within the watershed is also the highest point of the Rocky Mountains, Mount Elbert at 14,440 feet (4,400?m).[32]\\r\\nIn the United States, the Mississippi River drains the majority of the area between the crest of the Rocky Mountains and the crest of the Appalachian Mountains, except for various regions drained to Hudson Bay by the Red River of the North; to the Atlantic Ocean by the Great Lakes and the Saint Lawrence River; and to the Gulf of Mexico by the Rio Grande, the Alabama and Tombigbee rivers, the Chattahoochee and Appalachicola rivers, and various smaller coastal waterways along the Gulf.\\r\\nThe Mississippi River empties into the Gulf of Mexico about 100 miles (160?km) downstream from New Orleans. Measurements of the length of the Mississippi from Lake Itasca to the Gulf of Mexico vary somewhat, but the United States Geological Survey's number is 2,320 miles (3,730?km). The retention time from Lake Itasca to the Gulf is typically about 90 days.[33]\\r\\nThe Mississippi River discharges at an annual average rate of between 200 and 700 thousand cubic feet per second (7,000ÿ20,000?m3/s).[34] Although it is the fifth-largest river in the world by volume, this flow is a small fraction of the output of the Amazon, which moves nearly 7 million cubic feet per second (200,000?m3/s) during wet seasons. On average, the Mississippi has only 8% the flow of the Amazon River.[35]\\r\\nFresh river water flowing from the Mississippi into the Gulf of Mexico does not mix into the salt water immediately. The images from NASA's MODIS (to the right) show a large plume of fresh water, which appears as a dark ribbon against the lighter-blue surrounding waters. These images demonstrate that the plume did not mix with the surrounding sea water immediately. Instead, it stayed intact as it flowed through the Gulf of Mexico, into the Straits of Florida, and entered the Gulf Stream. The Mississippi River water rounded the tip of Florida and traveled up the southeast coast to the latitude of Georgia before finally mixing in so thoroughly with the ocean that it could no longer be detected by MODIS.\\r\\nBefore 1900, the Mississippi River transported an estimated 400?million metric tons of sediment per year from the interior of the United States to coastal Louisiana and the Gulf of Mexico. During the last two decades, this number was only 145?million metric tons per year. The reduction in sediment transported down the Mississippi River is the result of engineering modification of the Mississippi, Missouri, and Ohio rivers and their tributaries by dams, meander cutoffs, river-training structures, and bank revetments and soil erosion control programs in the areas drained by them.[36]\\r\\nOver geologic time, the Mississippi River has experienced numerous large and small changes to its main course, as well as additions, deletions, and other changes among its numerous tributaries, and the lower Mississippi River has used different pathways as its main channel to the Gulf of Mexico across the delta region.\\r\\nThrough a natural process known as avulsion or delta switching, the lower Mississippi River has shifted its final course to the mouth of the Gulf of Mexico every thousand years or so. This occurs because the deposits of silt and sediment begin to clog its channel, raising the river's level and causing it to eventually find a steeper, more direct route to the Gulf of Mexico. The abandoned distributaries diminish in volume and form what are known as bayous. This process has, over the past 5,000 years, caused the coastline of south Louisiana to advance toward the Gulf from 15 to 50 miles (24 to 80?km). The currently active delta lobe is called the Birdfoot Delta, after its shape, or the Balize Delta, after La Balize, Louisiana, the first French settlement at the mouth of the Mississippi.\\r\\nThe current form of the Mississippi River basin was largely shaped by the Laurentide Ice Sheet of the most recent Ice Age. The southernmost extent of this enormous glaciation extended well into the present-day United States and Mississippi basin. When the ice sheet began to recede, hundreds of feet of rich sediment were deposited, creating the flat and fertile landscape of the Mississippi Valley. During the melt, giant glacial rivers found drainage paths into the Mississippi watershed, creating such features as the Minnesota River, James River, and Milk River valleys. When the ice sheet completely retreated, many of these \\"temporary\\" rivers found paths to Hudson Bay or the Arctic Ocean, leaving the Mississippi Basin with many features \\"oversized\\" for the existing rivers to have carved in the same time period.\\r\\nIce sheets during the Illinoian Stage about 300,000 to 132,000 years before present, blocked the Mississippi near Rock Island, Illinois, diverting it to its present channel farther to the west, the current western border of Illinois. The Hennepin Canal roughly follows the ancient channel of the Mississippi downstream from Rock Island to Hennepin, Illinois. South of Hennepin, to Alton, Illinois, the current Illinois River follows the ancient channel used by the Mississippi River before the Illinoian Stage.[37][38]\\r\\nTimeline of outflow course changes[39]\\r\\nIn March 1876, the Mississippi suddenly changed course near the settlement of Reverie, Tennessee, leaving a small part of Tipton County, Tennessee, attached to Arkansas and separated from the rest of Tennessee by the new river channel. Since this event was an avulsion, rather than the effect of incremental erosion and deposition, the state line still follows the old channel.[40]\\r\\nThe town of Kaskaskia, Illinois once stood on a peninsula at the confluence of the Mississippi and Kaskaskia (Okaw) Rivers. Founded as a French colonial community, it later became the capital of the Illinois Territory and was the first state capital of Illinois until 1819. Beginning in 1844, successive flooding caused the Mississippi River to slowly encroach east. A major flood in 1881 caused it to overtake the lower 10 miles of the Kaskaskia River, forming a new Mississippi channel and cutting off the town from the rest of the state. Later flooding destroyed most of the remaining town, including the original State House. Today, the remaining 2,300 acre island and community of 14 residents is known as an enclave of Illinois and is accessible only from the Missouri side.[41]\\r\\nThe New Madrid Seismic Zone, along the Mississippi River near New Madrid, Missouri, between Memphis and St. Louis, is related to an aulacogen (failed rift) that formed at the same time as the Gulf of Mexico. This area is still quite active seismically. Four great earthquakes in 1811 and 1812, estimated at approximately 8 on the Richter magnitude scale, had tremendous local effects in the then sparsely settled area, and were felt in many other places in the midwestern and eastern U.S. These earthquakes created Reelfoot Lake in Tennessee from the altered landscape near the river.\\r\\nWhen measured from its traditional source at Lake Itasca, the Mississippi has a length of 2,320 miles (3,730 km). When measured from its longest stream source (most distant source from the sea), Brower's Spring in Montana, the source of the Missouri River. it has a length of 3,710 miles, making it the fourth longest river in the world after the Nile, Amazon, and Yangtze.[42] When measured by the largest stream source (by water volume), the Ohio River, by extension the Allegheny River, would be the source, and the Mississippi would begin in Pennsylvania.[citation needed]\\r\\nThe Mississippi River runs through or along 10 states, from Minnesota to Louisiana, and is used to define portions of these states' borders, with Wisconsin, Illinois, Kentucky, Tennessee, and Mississippi along the east side of the river, and Iowa, Missouri, and Arkansas along its west side. Substantial parts of both Minnesota and Louisiana are on either side of the river, although the Mississippi defines part of the boundary of each of these states.\\r\\nIn all of these cases, the middle of the riverbed at the time the borders were established was used as the line to define the borders between adjacent states.[43][44] In various areas, the river has since shifted, but the state borders have not changed, still following the former bed of the Mississippi River as of their establishment, leaving several small isolated areas of one state across the new river channel, contiguous with the adjacent state. Also, due to a meander in the river, a small part of western Kentucky is contiguous with Tennessee, but isolated from the rest of its state.\\r\\nMany of the communities along the Mississippi River are listed below; most have either historic significance or cultural lore connecting them to the river. They are sequenced from the source of the river to its end.\\r\\nThe road crossing highest on the Upper Mississippi is a simple steel culvert, through which the river (locally named \\"Nicolet Creek\\") flows north from Lake Nicolet under \\"Wilderness Road\\" to the West Arm of Lake Itasca, within Itasca State Park.[45]\\r\\nThe earliest bridge across the Mississippi River was built in 1855. It spanned the river in Minneapolis, Minnesota where the current Hennepin Avenue Bridge is located.[46] No highway or railroad tunnels cross under the Mississippi River.\\r\\nThe first railroad bridge across the Mississippi was built in 1856. It spanned the river between the Rock Island Arsenal in Illinois and Davenport, Iowa. Steamboat captains of the day, fearful of competition from the railroads, considered the new bridge a hazard to navigation. Two weeks after the bridge opened, the steamboat Effie Afton rammed part of the bridge, setting it on fire. Legal proceedings ensued, with Abraham Lincoln defending the railroad. The lawsuit went to the Supreme Court of the United States, which ruled in favor of the railroad.[47]\\r\\nBelow is a general overview of selected Mississippi bridges which have notable engineering or landmark significance, with their cities or locations. They are sequenced from the Upper Mississippi's source to the Lower Mississippi's mouth.\\r\\nA clear channel is needed for the barges and other vessels that make the main stem Mississippi one of the great commercial waterways of the world. The task of maintaining a navigation channel is the responsibility of the United States Army Corps of Engineers, which was established in 1802.[48] Earlier projects began as early as 1829 to remove snags, close off secondary channels and excavate rocks and sandbars.\\r\\nSteamboats entered trade in the 1820s, so the period 1830ÿ1850 became the golden age of steamboats. As there were few roads or rails in the lands of the Louisiana Purchase, river traffic was an ideal solution. Cotton, timber and food came down the river, as did Appalachian coal. The port of New Orleans boomed as it was the trans-shipment point to deep sea ocean vessels. As a result, the image of the twin stacked, wedding cake Mississippi steamer entered into American mythology. Steamers worked the entire route from the trickles of Montana, to the Ohio River; down the Missouri and Tennessee, to the main channel of the Mississippi. Only with the arrival of the railroads in the 1880s did steamboat traffic diminish. Steamboats remained a feature until the 1920s. Most have been superseded by pusher tugs. A few survive as iconsthe Delta Queen and the River Queen for instance.\\r\\nA series of 29 locks and dams on the upper Mississippi, most of which were built in the 1930s, is designed primarily to maintain a 9-foot-deep (2.7?m) channel for commercial barge traffic.[49][50] The lakes formed are also used for recreational boating and fishing. The dams make the river deeper and wider but do not stop it. No flood control is intended. During periods of high flow, the gates, some of which are submersible, are completely opened and the dams simply cease to function. Below St. Louis, the Mississippi is relatively free-flowing, although it is constrained by numerous levees and directed by numerous wing dams.\\r\\nOn the lower Mississippi, from Baton Rouge to the mouth of the Mississippi, the navigation depth is 45 feet (14?m), allowing container ships and cruise ships to dock at the Port of New Orleans and bulk cargo ships shorter than 150-foot (46?m) air draft that fit under the Huey P. Long Bridge to traverse the Mississippi to Baton Rouge.[51] There is a feasibility study to dredge this portion of the river to 50 feet (15?m) to allow New Panamax ship depths.[52]\\r\\nIn 1829, there were surveys of the two major obstacles on the upper Mississippi, the Des Moines Rapids and the Rock Island Rapids, where the river was shallow and the riverbed was rock. The Des Moines Rapids were about 11 miles (18?km) long and just above the mouth of the Des Moines River at Keokuk, Iowa. The Rock Island Rapids were between Rock Island and Moline, Illinois. Both rapids were considered virtually impassable.\\r\\nIn 1848, the Illinois and Michigan Canal was built to connect the Mississippi River to Lake Michigan via the Illinois River near Peru, Illinois. The canal allowed shipping between these important waterways. In 1900, the canal was replaced by the Chicago Sanitary and Ship Canal. The second canal, in addition to shipping, also allowed Chicago to address specific health issues (typhoid fever, cholera and other waterborne diseases) by sending its waste down the Illinois and Mississippi river systems rather than polluting its water source of Lake Michigan.\\r\\nThe Corps of Engineers recommended the excavation of a 5-foot-deep (1.5?m) channel at the Des Moines Rapids, but work did not begin until after Lieutenant Robert E. Lee endorsed the project in 1837. The Corps later also began excavating the Rock Island Rapids. By 1866, it had become evident that excavation was impractical, and it was decided to build a canal around the Des Moines Rapids. The canal opened in 1877, but the Rock Island Rapids remained an obstacle. In 1878, Congress authorized the Corps to establish a 4.5-foot-deep (1.4?m) channel to be obtained by building wing dams which direct the river to a narrow channel causing it to cut a deeper channel, by closing secondary channels and by dredging. The channel project was complete when the Moline Lock, which bypassed the Rock Island Rapids, opened in 1907.\\r\\nTo improve navigation between St. Paul, Minnesota, and Prairie du Chien, Wisconsin, the Corps constructed several dams on lakes in the headwaters area, including Lake Winnibigoshish and Lake Pokegama. The dams, which were built beginning in the 1880s, stored spring run-off which was released during low water to help maintain channel depth.\\r\\nIn 1907, Congress authorized a 6-foot-deep (1.8?m) channel project on the Mississippi, which was not complete when it was abandoned in the late 1920s in favor of the 9-foot-deep (2.7?m) channel project.\\r\\nIn 1913, construction was complete on Lock and Dam No. 19 at Keokuk, Iowa, the first dam below St. Anthony Falls. Built by a private power company (Union Electric Company of St. Louis) to generate electricity (originally for streetcars in St. Louis), the Keokuk dam was one of the largest hydro-electric plants in the world at the time. The dam also eliminated the Des Moines Rapids. Lock and Dam No. 1 was completed in Minneapolis, Minnesota in 1917. Lock and Dam No. 2, near Hastings, Minnesota, was completed in 1930.\\r\\nBefore the Great Mississippi Flood of 1927, the Corps's primary strategy was to close off as many side channels as possible to increase the flow in the main river. It was thought that the river's velocity would scour off bottom sediments, deepening the river and decreasing the possibility of flooding. The 1927 flood proved this to be so wrong that communities threatened by the flood began to create their own levee breaks to relieve the force of the rising river.\\r\\nThe Rivers and Harbors Act of 1930 authorized the 9-foot (2.7?m) channel project, which called for a navigation channel 9 feet (2.7?m) feet deep and 400 feet (120?m) wide to accommodate multiple-barge tows.[53][54] This was achieved by a series of locks and dams, and by dredging. Twenty-three new locks and dams were built on the upper Mississippi in the 1930s in addition to the three already in existence.\\r\\nUntil the 1950s, there was no dam below Lock and Dam 26 at Alton, Illinois. Chain of Rocks Lock (Lock and Dam No. 27), which consists of a low-water dam and an 8.4-mile-long (13.5?km) canal, was added in 1953, just below the confluence with the Missouri River, primarily to bypass a series of rock ledges at St. Louis. It also serves to protect the St. Louis city water intakes during times of low water.\\r\\nU.S. government scientists determined in the 1950s that the Mississippi River was starting to switch to the Atchafalaya River channel because of its much steeper path to the Gulf of Mexico. Eventually the Atchafalaya River would capture the Mississippi River and become its main channel to the Gulf of Mexico, leaving New Orleans on a side channel. As a result, the U.S. Congress authorized a project called the Old River Control Structure, which has prevented the Mississippi River from leaving its current channel that drains into the Gulf via New Orleans.[56]\\r\\nBecause the large scale of high-energy water flow threatened to damage the structure, an auxiliary flow control station was built adjacent to the standing control station. This $300?million project was completed in 1986 by the Corps of Engineers. Beginning in the 1970s, the Corps applied hydrological transport models to analyze flood flow and water quality of the Mississippi. Dam 26 at Alton, Illinois, which had structural problems, was replaced by the Mel Price Lock and Dam in 1990. The original Lock and Dam 26 was demolished.\\r\\nThe Corps now actively creates and maintains spillways and floodways to divert periodic water surges into backwater channels and lakes, as well as route part of the Mississippi's flow into the Atchafalaya Basin and from there to the Gulf of Mexico, bypassing Baton Rouge and New Orleans. The main structures are the Birds Point-New Madrid Floodway in Missouri; the Old River Control Structure and the Morganza Spillway in Louisiana, which direct excess water down the west and east sides (respectively) of the Atchafalaya River; and the Bonnet Carr Spillway, also in Louisiana, which directs floodwaters to Lake Pontchartrain (see diagram). Some experts blame urban sprawl for increases in both the risk and frequency of flooding on the Mississippi River.[57]\\r\\nSome of the pre-1927 strategy is still in use today, with the Corps actively cutting the necks of horseshoe bends, allowing the water to move faster and reducing flood heights.[58]\\r\\nThe area of the Mississippi River basin was first settled by hunting and gathering Native American peoples and is considered one of the few independent centers of plant domestication in human history.[59] Evidence of early cultivation of sunflower, a goosefoot, a marsh elder and an indigenous squash dates to the 4th millennium BCE. The lifestyle gradually became more settled after around 1000 BCE during what is now called the Woodland period, with increasing evidence of shelter construction, pottery, weaving and other practices. A network of trade routes referred to as the Hopewell interaction sphere was active along the waterways between about 200 and 500 CE, spreading common cultural practices over the entire area between the Gulf of Mexico and the Great Lakes. A period of more isolated communities followed, and agriculture introduced from Mesoamerica based on the Three Sisters (maize, beans and squash) gradually came to dominate. After around 800 CE there arose an advanced agricultural society today referred to as the Mississippian culture, with evidence of highly stratified complex chiefdoms and large population centers. The most prominent of these, now called Cahokia, was occupied between about 600 and 1400 CE[60] and at its peak numbered between 8,000 and 40,000 inhabitants, larger than London, England of that time. At the time of first contact with Europeans, Cahokia and many other Mississippian cities had dispersed, and archaeological finds attest to increased social stress.[61][62][63]\\r\\nModern American Indian nations inhabiting the Mississippi basin include Cheyenne, Sioux, Ojibwe, Potawatomi, Ho-Chunk, Fox, Kickapoo, Tamaroa, Moingwena, Quapaw and Chickasaw.\\r\\nThe word Mississippi itself comes from Messipi, the French rendering of the Anishinaabe (Ojibwe or Algonquin) name for the river, Misi-ziibi (Great River).[64][65] The Ojibwe called Lake Itasca Omashkoozo-zaaga'igan (Elk Lake) and the river flowing out of it Omashkoozo-ziibi (Elk River). After flowing into Lake Bemidji, the Ojibwe called the river Bemijigamaag-ziibi (River from the Traversing Lake). After flowing into Cass Lake, the name of the river changes to Gaa-miskwaawaakokaag-ziibi (Red Cedar River) and then out of Lake Winnibigoshish as Wiinibiigoonzhish-ziibi (Miserable Wretched Dirty Water River), Gichi-ziibi (Big River) after the confluence with the Leech Lake River, then finally as Misi-ziibi (Great River) after the confluence with the Crow Wing River.[66] After the expeditions by Giacomo Beltrami and Henry Schoolcraft, the longest stream above the juncture of the Crow Wing River and Gichi-ziibi was named \\"Mississippi River\\". The Mississippi River Band of Chippewa Indians, known as the Gichi-ziibiwininiwag, are named after the stretch of the Mississippi River known as the Gichi-ziibi. The Cheyenne, one of the earliest inhabitants of the upper Mississippi River, called it the M?xe-?ometaa?e (Big Greasy River) in the Cheyenne language. The Arapaho name for the river is Beesniice.[67] The Pawnee name is Kickatit.[68]\\r\\nThe Mississippi was spelled Mississipi or Missisipi during French Louisiana and was also known as the Rivire Saint-Louis.[69][70][71]\\r\\nOn May 8, 1541, Spanish explorer Hernando de Soto became the first recorded European to reach the Mississippi River, which he called Ro del Espritu Santo (\\"River of the Holy Spirit\\"), in the area of what is now Mississippi. In Spanish, the river is called Ro Mississippi.[72]\\r\\nFrench explorers Louis Jolliet and Jacques Marquette began exploring the Mississippi in the 17th century. Marquette traveled with a Sioux Indian who named it Ne Tongo (\\"Big river\\" in Sioux language) in 1673. Marquette proposed calling it the River of the Immaculate Conception.\\r\\nWhen Louis Jolliet explored the Mississippi Valley in the 17th century, natives guided him to a quicker way to return to French Canada via the Illinois River. When he found the Chicago Portage, he remarked that a canal of \\"only half a league\\" (less than 2 miles (3.2?km), 3?km) would join the Mississippi and the Great Lakes.[73] In 1848, the continental divide separating the waters of the Great Lakes and the Mississippi Valley was breached by the Illinois and Michigan canal via the Chicago River.[74] This both accelerated the development, and forever changed the ecology of the Mississippi Valley and the Great Lakes.\\r\\nIn 1682, Ren-Robert Cavelier, Sieur de La Salle and Henri de Tonti claimed the entire Mississippi River Valley for France, calling the river Colbert River after Jean-Baptiste Colbert and the region La Louisiane, for King Louis XIV. On March 2, 1699, Pierre Le Moyne d'Iberville rediscovered the mouth of the Mississippi, following the death of La Salle.[75] The French built the small fort of La Balise there to control passage.[76]\\r\\nIn 1718, about 100 miles (160?km) upriver, New Orleans was established along the river crescent by Jean-Baptiste Le Moyne, Sieur de Bienville, with construction patterned after the 1711 resettlement on Mobile Bay of Mobile, the capital of French Louisiana at the time.\\r\\nFollowing Britain's victory in the Seven Years War the Mississippi became the border between the British and Spanish Empires. The Treaty of Paris (1763) gave Great Britain rights to all land east of the Mississippi and Spain rights to land west of the Mississippi. Spain also ceded Florida to Britain to regain Cuba, which the British occupied during the war. Britain then divided the territory into East and West Florida.\\r\\nArticle 8 of the Treaty of Paris (1783) states, \\"The navigation of the river Mississippi, from its source to the ocean, shall forever remain free and open to the subjects of Great Britain and the citizens of the United States\\". With this treaty, which ended the American Revolutionary War, Britain also ceded West Florida back to Spain to regain the Bahamas, which Spain had occupied during the war. In 1800, under duress from Napoleon of France, Spain ceded an undefined portion of West Florida to France. When France then sold the Louisiana Territory to the U.S. in 1803, a dispute arose again between Spain and the U.S. on which parts of West Florida exactly had Spain ceded to France, which would in turn decide which parts of West Florida were now U.S. property versus Spanish property. These aspirations ended when Spain was pressured into signing Pinckney's Treaty in 1795.\\r\\nFrance reacquired 'Louisiana' from Spain in the secret Treaty of San Ildefonso in 1800. The United States then secured effective control of the river when it bought the Louisiana Territory from France in the Louisiana Purchase of 1803. The last serious European challenge to U.S. control of the river came at the conclusion of War of 1812 when British forces mounted an attack on New Orleans ÿ the attack was repulsed by an American army under the command of General Andrew Jackson.\\r\\nIn the Treaty of 1818, the U.S. and Great Britain agreed to fix the border running from the Lake of the Woods to the Rocky Mountains along the 49th parallel north. In effect, the U.S. ceded the northwestern extremity of the Mississippi basin to the British in exchange for the southern portion of the Red River basin.\\r\\nSo many settlers traveled westward through the Mississippi river basin, as well as settled in it, that Zadok Cramer wrote a guide book called The Navigator, detailing the features and dangers and navigable waterways of the area. It was so popular that he updated and expanded it through 12 editions over a period of 25 years.\\r\\nThe colonization of the area was barely slowed by the three earthquakes in 1811 and 1812, estimated at approximately 8 on the Richter magnitude scale, that were centered near New Madrid, Missouri.\\r\\nMark Twain's book, Life on the Mississippi, covered the steamboat commerce which took place from 1830 to 1870 on the river before more modern ships replaced the steamer. The book was published first in serial form in Harper's Weekly in seven parts in 1875. The full version, including a passage from the then unfinished Adventures of Huckleberry Finn and works from other authors, was published by James R. Osgood & Company in 1885.\\r\\nThe first steamboat to travel the full length of the Lower Mississippi from the Ohio River to New Orleans was the New Orleans in December 1811. Its maiden voyage occurred during the series of New Madrid earthquakes in 1811ÿ12. The Upper Mississippi was treacherous, unpredictable and to make traveling worse, the area was not properly mapped out or surveyed. Until the 1840s only two trips a year to the Twin Cities landings were made by steamboats which suggests it was not very profitable.[77]\\r\\nSteamboat transport remained a viable industry, both in terms of passengers and freight until the end of the first decade of the 20th century. Among the several Mississippi River system steamboat companies was the noted Anchor Line, which, from 1859 to 1898, operated a luxurious fleet of steamers between St. Louis and New Orleans.\\r\\nItalian explorer Giacomo Beltrami, wrote about his journey on the Virginia, which was the first steam boat to make it to Fort St. Anthony in Minnesota. He referred to his voyage as a promenade that was once a journey on the Mississippi. The steamboat era changed the economic and political life of the Mississippi, as well as the nature of travel itself. The Mississippi was completely changed by the steamboat era as it transformed into a flourishing tourists trade.[78]\\r\\nControl of the river was a strategic objective of both sides in the American Civil War. In 1862 Union forces coming down the river successfully cleared Confederate defenses at Island Number 10 and Memphis, Tennessee, while Naval forces coming upriver from the Gulf of Mexico captured New Orleans, Louisiana. The remaining major Confederate stronghold was on the heights overlooking the river at Vicksburg, Mississippi, and the Union's Vicksburg Campaign (December 1862 to July 1863), and the fall of Port Hudson, completed control of the lower Mississippi River. The Union victory ending the Siege of Vicksburg on July 4, 1863, was pivotal to the Union's final victory of the Civil War.\\r\\nThe \\"Big Freeze\\" of 1918ÿ19 blocked river traffic north of Memphis, Tennessee, preventing transportation of coal from southern Illinois. This resulted in widespread shortages, high prices, and rationing of coal in January and February.[79]\\r\\nIn the spring of 1927, the river broke out of its banks in 145 places, during the Great Mississippi Flood of 1927 and inundated 27,000?sq?mi (70,000?km2) to a depth of up to 30 feet (9.1?m).\\r\\nIn 1962 and 1963, industrial accidents spilled 3.5?million US gallons (13,000,000?L) of soybean oil into the Mississippi and Minnesota rivers. The oil covered the Mississippi River from St. Paul to Lake Pepin, creating an ecological disaster and a demand to control water pollution.[80]\\r\\nOn October 20, 1976, the automobile ferry, MV George Prince, was struck by a ship traveling upstream as the ferry attempted to cross from Destrehan, Louisiana, to Luling, Louisiana. Seventy-eight passengers and crew died; only eighteen survived the accident.\\r\\nIn 1988, the water level of the Mississippi fell to 10 feet (3.0?m) below zero on the Memphis gauge. The remains of wooden-hulled water craft were exposed in an area of 4.5 acres (18,000?m2) on the bottom of the Mississippi River at West Memphis, Arkansas. They dated to the late 19th to early 20th centuries. The State of Arkansas, the Arkansas Archeological Survey, and the Arkansas Archeological Society responded with a two-month data recovery effort. The fieldwork received national media attention as good news in the middle of a drought.[81]\\r\\nThe Great Flood of 1993 was another significant flood, primarily affecting the Mississippi above its confluence with the Ohio River at Cairo, Illinois.\\r\\nTwo portions of the Mississippi were designated as American Heritage Rivers in 1997: the lower portion around Louisiana and Tennessee, and the upper portion around Iowa, Illinois, Minnesota and Missouri. The Nature Conservancy's project called \\"America's Rivershed Initiative\\" announced a 'report card' assessment of the entire basin in October 2015 and gave the grade of D+. The assessment noted the aging navigation and flood control infrastructure along with multiple environmental problems.[82]\\r\\nIn 2002, Slovenian long-distance swimmer Martin Strel swam the entire length of the river, from Minnesota to Louisiana, over the course of 68 days. In 2005, the Source to Sea Expedition[83] paddled the Mississippi and Atchafalaya Rivers to benefit the Audubon Society's Upper Mississippi River Campaign.[84][85]\\r\\nGeologists believe that the lower Mississippi could take a new course to the Gulf. Either of two new routesthrough the Atchafalaya Basin or through Lake Pontchartrainmight become the Mississippi's main channel if flood-control structures are overtopped or heavily damaged during a severe flood.[86][87][88][89][90]\\r\\nFailure of the Old River Control Structure, the Morganza Spillway, or nearby levees would likely re-route the main channel of the Mississippi through Louisiana's Atchafalaya Basin and down the Atchafalaya River to reach the Gulf of Mexico south of Morgan City in southern Louisiana. This route provides a more direct path to the Gulf of Mexico than the present Mississippi River channel through Baton Rouge and New Orleans.[88] While the risk of such a diversion is present during any major flood event, such a change has so far been prevented by active human intervention involving the construction, maintenance, and operation of various levees, spillways, and other control structures by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers.\\r\\nThe Old River Control Structure, between the present Mississippi River channel and the Atchafalaya Basin, sits at the normal water elevation and is ordinarily used to divert 30% of the Mississippi's flow to the Atchafalaya River. There is a steep drop here away from the Mississippi's main channel into the Atchafalaya Basin. If this facility were to fail during a major flood, there is a strong concern the water would scour and erode the river bottom enough to capture the Mississippi's main channel. The structure was nearly lost during the 1973 flood, but repairs and improvements were made after engineers studied the forces at play. In particular, the Corps of Engineers made many improvements and constructed additional facilities for routing water through the vicinity. These additional facilities give the Corps much more flexibility and potential flow capacity than they had in 1973, which further reduces the risk of a catastrophic failure in this area during other major floods, such as that of 2011.\\r\\nBecause the Morganza Spillway is slightly higher and well back from the river, it is normally dry on both sides.[91] Even if it failed at the crest during a severe flood, the flood waters would have to erode to normal water levels before the Mississippi could permanently jump channel at this location.[citation needed] During the 2011 floods, the Corps of Engineers opened the Morganza Spillway to 1/4 of its capacity to allow 150,000?ft3/sec of water to flood the Morganza and Atchafalaya floodways and continue directly to the Gulf of Mexico, bypassing Baton Rouge and New Orleans.[92] In addition to reducing the Mississippi River crest downstream, this diversion reduced the chances of a channel change by reducing stress on the other elements of the control system.[93]\\r\\nSome geologists have noted that the possibility for course change into the Atchafalaya also exists in the area immediately north of the Old River Control Structure. Army Corps of Engineers geologist Fred Smith once stated, \\"The Mississippi wants to go west. 1973 was a forty-year flood. The big one lies out there somewherewhen the structures can't release all the floodwaters and the levee is going to have to give way. That is when the river's going to jump its banks and try to break through.\\"[94]\\r\\nAnother possible course change for the Mississippi River is a diversion into Lake Pontchartrain near New Orleans. This route is controlled by the Bonnet Carr Spillway, built to reduce flooding in New Orleans. This spillway and an imperfect natural levee about 4ÿ6 meters (12 to 20 feet) high are all that prevents the Mississippi from taking a new, shorter course through Lake Pontchartrain to the Gulf of Mexico.[95] Diversion of the Mississippi's main channel through Lake Pontchartrain would have consequences similar to an Atchafalaya diversion, but to a lesser extent, since the present river channel would remain in use past Baton Rouge and into the New Orleans area.\\r\\nThe sport of water skiing was invented on the river in a wide region between Minnesota and Wisconsin known as Lake Pepin.[96] Ralph Samuelson of Lake City, Minnesota, created and refined his skiing technique in late June and early July 1922. He later performed the first water ski jump in 1925 and was pulled along at 80?mph (130?km/h) by a Curtiss flying boat later that year.[96]\\r\\nThere are seven National Park Service sites along the Mississippi River. The Mississippi National River and Recreation Area is the National Park Service site dedicated to protecting and interpreting the Mississippi River itself. The other six National Park Service sites along the river are (listed from north to south):\\r\\nThe Mississippi basin is home to a highly diverse aquatic fauna and has been called the \\"mother fauna\\" of North American fresh water.[97]\\r\\nAbout 375 fish species are known from the Mississippi basin, far exceeding other North Hemisphere river basin exclusively within temperate/subtropical regions,[97] except the Yangtze.[98] Within the Mississippi basin, streams that have their source in the Appalachian and Ozark highlands contain especially many species. Among the fish species in the basin are numerous endemics, as well as relicts such as paddlefish, sturgeon, gar and bowfin.[97]\\r\\nBecause of its size and high species diversity, the Mississippi basin is often divided into subregions. The Upper Mississippi River alone is home to about 120 fish species, including walleye, sauger, large mouth bass, small mouth bass, white bass, northern pike, bluegill, crappie, channel catfish, flathead catfish, common shiner, freshwater drum and shovelnose sturgeon.[99][100]\\r\\nIn addition to fish, several species of turtles (such as snapping, musk, mud, map, cooter, painted and softshell turtles), American alligator, aquatic amphibians (such as hellbender, mudpuppy, three-toed amphiuma and lesser siren),[101] and cambarid crayfish (such as the red swamp crayfish) are native to the Mississippi basin.[102]\\r\\nNumerous introduced species are found in the Mississippi and some of these are invasive. Among the introductions are fish such as Asian carp, including the silver carp that have become infamous for outcompeting native fish and their potentially dangerous jumping behavior. They have spread throughout much of the basin, even approaching (but not yet invading) the Great Lakes.[103] The Minnesota Department of Natural Resources has designated much of the Mississippi River in the state as infested waters by the exotic species zebra mussels and Eurasian watermilfoil.[104]","input":"What are the approximate eastern and western boundaries of the mississippi watershed?"},{"output":"March 2, 1899","context":"Mount Rainier National Park is a United States National Park located in southeast Pierce County and northeast Lewis County in Washington state.[3] It was established on March 2, 1899 as the fifth national park in the United States. The park encompasses 236,381 acres (369.35?sq?mi; 956.60?km2)[1] including all of Mount Rainier, a 14,411-foot (4,392?m) stratovolcano.[4] The mountain rises abruptly from the surrounding land with elevations in the park ranging from 1,600 feet to over 14,000 feet (490 - 4,300?m). The highest point in the Cascade Range, around it are valleys, waterfalls, subalpine meadows, old-growth forest and more than 25 glaciers. The volcano is often shrouded in clouds that dump enormous amounts of rain and snow on the peak every year.\\r\\nMount Rainier is circled by the Wonderland Trail and is covered by several glaciers and snowfields totaling some 35 square miles (91?km2). Carbon Glacier is the largest glacier by volume in the contiguous United States, while Emmons Glacier is the largest glacier by area. Mount Rainier is a popular peak for mountaineering with some 10,000 attempts per year with approximately 50% making it to the summit.\\r\\nThe park contains outstanding subalpine meadows and 91,000 acres (37,000?ha) of old growth forests.[5]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nNinety-seven percent of the park is preserved as wilderness under the National Wilderness Preservation System, including Clearwater Wilderness and Mount Rainier Wilderness, a designation it received in 1988. It is abutted by the Tatoosh Wilderness. The park was designated a National Historic Landmark on February 18, 1997 as a showcase for the National Park Service Rustic style architecture (or parkitecture) of the 1920s and 1930s, exemplified by the Paradise Inn and a masterpiece of early NPS master planning. As an Historic Landmark district, the park was administratively listed on the National Register of Historic Places.[6]\\r\\nThe film Track of the Cat (1954) was filmed in and around Mount Rainer National Park.[7]\\r\\nThe earliest evidence of human activity in the area which is now Mount Rainier National Park, a projectile point dated to circa 4,000-5,800 BP (before present) found along Bench Lake Trail (the first section of Snow Lake Trail).[8][9]\\r\\nA more substantial archeological find was a rock shelter near Fryingpan Creek, east of Goat Island Mountain. Hunting artifacts were found in the shelter. The shelter would not have been used all year round. Cultural affinities suggest the site was used by Columbia Plateau Tribes from 1000 to 300 BP.[8][9]\\r\\nIn 1963 the National Park Service contracted the Washington State University to study Native American use of the Mount Rainier area. Richard D. Daugherty lead an archeological study of the area and concluded that prehistoric humans used the area most heavily between 8000 and 4500 BP. Allan H. Smith interviewed elderly Native Americans and studied ethnographic literature. He found no evidence of permanent habitation in the park area. The park was used for hunting and gathering and for occasional spirit quests. Smith also came to tentative conclusions that the park was divided among five tribes along watershed boundaries; the Nisqually, Puyallup, Muckleshoot, Yakama, and Taidnapam (Upper Cowlitz). Subsequent studies cast doubt on Smith's theory that the tribes had agreed upon boundaries before they entered into treaties with the United States in 1854-55.[8]\\r\\nMammals that inhabit this national park are especially the cougar, black bear, raccoon, coyote, bobcat, snowshoe hare, weasel, mole, beaver, red fox, porcupine, skunk, marmot, deer, marten, shrew, pika, elk, and mountain goat. The common birds of this park including raptors are the thrush, chickadee, kinglet, northern goshawk, willow flycatcher, spotted owl, steller's jay, Clark's nutcracker, bald eagle, ptarmigan, harlequin duck, grouse, peregrine falcon, gray jay, golden eagle, grosbeak and finch.\\r\\nOn March 2, 1899, President William McKinley signed a bill passed by Congress authorizing the creation of Mount Rainier National Park, the nation's fifth national park.[11] It was the first national park created from a national forest.[10] The Pacific Forest Reserve had been created in 1893 and included Mount Rainier. It was enlarged in 1897 and renamed Mount Rainier Forest Reserve. John Muir had visited Mount Rainier in 1888. Muir and nine others, including Edward Sturgis Ingraham, Charles Piper, and P. B. Van Trump, climbed to the summit in what became the fifth recorded ascent.[12][13]\\r\\nThe trip to Mount Rainier had played a role in reinvigorating Muir and convincing him to rededicate his life to the preservation of nature as national parks. At the time national forests, called forest reserves at first, were being created throughout the American West, under the utilitarian \\"conservation-through-use\\" view of Gifford Pinchot. Muir came to be known as a \\"preservationist\\". He wanted nature preserved under the more protected status of national parks. But during the 1890s there was more public support for creating national forests than national parks. During that decade, Muir and his supporters were only able to protect one national forest[which?] as a national park. When the Pacific Forest Reserve was created in 1893, Muir quickly persuaded the newly formed Sierra Club to support a movement to protect Rainier as a national park. Other groups soon joined, such as the National Geographic Society and scientific associations wanting Mount Rainier preserved as a place to study volcanism and glaciology. Commercial leaders in Tacoma and Seattle were also in support, as was the Northern Pacific Railway. The effort lasted over five years and involved six different attempts to push a bill through Congress. Congress eventually agreed, but only after acquiring assurances that none of the new park was suitable for farming or mining and that no federal appropriations would be necessary for its management.[10]\\r\\nMount Rainier National Park closed because of extensive flooding as a result of the 6 November 2006 Pineapple Express rainstorm when 18 inches (460?mm) of rain fell in a 36-hour period. Campsites and roads throughout the park were washed away. Power to Paradise and Longmire was disrupted. Sunshine Point Campground, shortly inside the Nisqually Entrance, was destroyed and has not reopened. [14] On 5 May 2007, the park reopened to automobile traffic via State Route 706 at the Nisqually Entrance.[15]\\r\\nThe entire park was designated a National Historic Landmark District on February 18, 1997, in recognition of the consistently high standard of design and preservation the park's National Park Service Rustic-style architecture.[16] The park contains 42 locations designated on the National Register of Historic Places, including four National Historic Landmarks.\\r\\nParadise (4647N 12144W? / ?46.79N 121.74W? / 46.79; -121.74? (Paradise)[17]) is the name of an area at approximately 5,400 feet (1,600?m) on the south slope of Mount Rainier in the national park. Paradise is the most popular destination for visitors to Mount Rainier National Park.[18] 62% of the over 1.3 million people who visited the park in 2000 went to Paradise.[19] Paradise, near the subalpine valley of the Paradise River, is the location of the historic Paradise Inn (built 1916),[20] Paradise Guide House (built 1920) and Henry M. Jackson Visitor Center (built 1966;[21] demolished and replaced, 2008). [22]\\r\\nThe National Park Service says that \\"Paradise is the snowiest place on Earth where snowfall is measured regularly.\\"[23] 1,122 inches (28.5?m) of snow fell during the winter of 1971/72, setting a world record for that year.[23][24] Subsequently, in the winter of 1998/99, Mount Baker Ski Area received 1,140 inches (29?m).[25] Paradise holds the Cascade Range record for most snow on the ground with 367 inches (9.32?m) on 10 March 1956.[26]\\r\\nUnder the K?ppen climate classification, the park has a subarctic climate (Dfc) with a drying trend in the summer.\\r\\nLongmire (4645N 12149W? / ?46.75N 121.81W? / 46.75; -121.81?

The area is in the Nisqually River valley at an elevation of 2,761 feet (842?m)[29] between The Ramparts Ridge and the Tatoosh Range. Longmire is surrounded by old-growth Douglas fir, western red cedar and western hemlock.\\r\\nLongmire is the location of Mount Rainier's National Park Inn, the Longmire Museum, and the 1928 National Park Service Administration Building, which is now a Wilderness Information Center. The National Park Inn is the only accommodation in the park open all year round.[30]\\r\\nLongmire is the second most popular destination for visitors to Mount Rainier National Park after Paradise. Of the more than 1.3 million people who visited the park in 2000, 38% visited Longmire.[19] The Cougar Rock Campground is about 2 miles (3.2?km) north west of Longmire [3] with 173 individual campsites and 5 group sites and open from late May through late September. Longmire is one of the starting points of the Wonderland Trail.\\r\\nSunrise (4655N 12138W? / ?46.91N 121.64W? / 46.91; -121.64?

At an elevation of 6,400 feet (1,950?m), it is the highest point in the park that is accessible by vehicle. There are miles of trails located all around Sunrise, such as Mount Fremont, Burroughs Mountain, and Sourdough Ridge. The lodge is reachable via a 10-mile (16?km) turnoff from SR 410 near the White River entrance.\\r\\nOhanapecosh /o??h?n?p?k???/ is a campground (with 188 individual sites and 2 group sites, open from late May through late September), visitor center (closed during the 2013 season), and ranger station located in the southeastern portion of the park, approximately 3 miles (4.8?km) from the park boundary off Highway 123. Located in a deep valley among old growth forest at an elevation below 2,000 feet (610?m), it is the only developed area of the park without a view of Mount Rainier. The Ohanapecosh Hot Springs, Grove of the Patriarchs, and Silver Falls are all located in the Ohanapecosh area.\\r\\nThe Carbon River Entrance Station is located in the northwest corner of the park off Highway 165 and is the site of the only rainforest at Mount Rainier. There is a campground and a short trail through the rainforest, as well as a trail to the Carbon Glacier, one of the lowest glaciers in the contiguous United States.\\r\\nMowich Lake is the largest and deepest lake in the park, located south of Carbon at the south end of Highway 165. A campground, picnic area, and hiking trail are located near the lake.\\r\\nThe two major roads into the northwest quadrant of the Park were severely damaged by the floods of 2006. The ranger station at the Carbon River entrance is staffed during the summer. No motor vehicles are permitted beyond that point.","input":"When did mount rainier become a national park?"},{"output":"the Great St. Bernard Pass","context":"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe St. Bernard or St Bernard (UK: /?b??rn?rd/, US: /b?r?n?rd/) is a breed of very large working dog from the western Alps. They were originally bred for rescue at the Great St Bernard Pass on the Italian-Swiss border, and Little St Bernard Pass in the Italian-French border,[2] located close to one another. The two hospices were built and run by the same monk brotherhood. The breed has become famous through tales of alpine rescues, as well as for its enormous size.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe St. Bernard is a giant dog. The average weight of the breed is between 65 and 120?kg (140 and 260?lb) or more, and the approximate height at the withers is 70 to 90?cm (28 to 35?in).[3]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe coat can be either smooth or rough; the smooth coat being close and flat while the rough is dense, flat, and more profuse around the neck and legs. The colour is typically a red shade with white, or a mahogany brindle with white. Black shading is usually found on the face and ears.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe tail is long and heavy, hanging low.\\r\\n\\r\\nEyes are usually brown, but sometimes can be icy blue, and should have naturally tight lids, with haws only slightly visible.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe ancestors of the St. Bernard share a history with the Sennenhunds. The St. Bernard, also called Alpine Mountain Dogs or Alpine Cattle Dogs, are the large farm dogs of the farmers and dairymen of most notably the French Alps, livestock guardians, herding dogs, and draft dogs as well as hunting dogs, search and rescue dogs, and watchdogs. These dogs are thought to be descendants of molosser type dogs brought into the Alps by the ancient Romans, and the St. Bernard is recognized internationally today as one of the Molossoid breeds.[4]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe earliest written records of the St. Bernard breed are from monks at the Great St Bernard Hospice at the Great St. Bernard Pass in 1707, with paintings and drawings of the dog dating even earlier.[5]\\r\\nThe most famous St. Bernard to save people at the pass was Barry (sometimes spelled Berry), who reportedly saved somewhere between 40 and 100 lives. There is a monument to Barry in the Cimetire des Chiens, and his body was preserved in the Natural History Museum in Berne.[6]\\r\\nAnother famous dog was Rutor, the faithful companion of the priest Pierre Chanoux, who was named after the peak Tte du Rutor located above the Little St Bernard pass.\\r\\nThe classic St. Bernard looked very different from the St. Bernard of today because of cross-breeding.  Severe winters from 1816 to 1818 led to increased numbers of avalanches, killing many of the dogs used for breeding while they were performing rescues.[7][8] In an attempt to preserve the breed, the remaining St. Bernards were crossed with Newfoundlands brought from the Colony of Newfoundland in the 1850s, and so lost much of their use as rescue dogs in the snowy climate of the alps because the long fur they inherited would freeze and weigh them down.[9]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe dogs never received any special training from the monks. Instead, younger dogs would learn how to perform search and rescue operations from older dogs.[10]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Swiss St. Bernard Club was founded in Basel on 15 March 1884. The St. Bernard was the very first breed entered into the Swiss Stud Book in 1884, and the breed standard was finally approved in 1888. Since then, the breed has been a Swiss national dog.[5]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe dogs at the St Bernard hospice were working dogs that were smaller than today's show St Bernard's dogs. Originally about the size of a German Shepherd Dog,[11] the St Bernard grew to the size of today's dog as kennel clubs and dog shows emphasized appearance over the dog's working ability, along with a closed stud book.[12]\\r\\n\\r\\nAn open stud book would have allowed breeders to correct such errors by breeding in Working dogs of other dog breeds.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe name \\"St. Bernard\\" originates from the passes of Great and Little St Bernard. The two traveler's hospices and passes are located only few miles away in the Western Alps between Switzerland Italy and France, near the Mont-Blanc. The passes, the lodges, and the dogs are named for Bernard of Menthon, the 11th century monk who established the stations.[13]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\"St. Bernard\\" was not in widespread use until the middle of the 19th century. The dogs were called \\"Saint Dogs\\", \\"Noble Steeds\\", \\"Alpenmastiff\\", or \\"Barry Dogs\\" before that time.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe breed is strikingly similar to the English Mastiff, with which it shares a common ancestor known as the Alpine Mastiff. The modern St. Bernard breed is radically different than the original dogs kept at the St. Bernard hospice, most notably by being much larger in size and build. Since the late 1800s, the St. Bernard breed has been ever refined and improved using many different large Molosser breeds, including the Newfoundland, Great Pyrenees, Greater Swiss Mountain Dog, Bernese Mountain Dog, Great Dane, English Mastiff, and possibly the Tibetan Mastiff and Caucasian Ovcharka. Other breeds such as the Rottweiler, Boxer, and English Bulldog may have contributed to the St. Bernard's bloodline as well. It is suspected that many of these large breeds were used to redevelop each other to combat the threat of their extinction after World War II, which may explain why all of them played a part in the creation of the St. Bernard as seen today.[14]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe four Sennenhund breeds, the Grosser Schweizer Sennenhund (Greater Swiss Mountain Dog), the Berner Sennenhund, (Bernese Mountain Dog), the Appenzeller Sennenhund, (Appenzeller), and the Entlebucher Sennenhund (Entlebucher Mountain Dog) are similar in appearance and share the same location and history, but are tricolor rather than red and white.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Russian army kennels crossbreed St Bernards with Caucasian Ovcharka to produce the Moscow Watchdogs that are still used as military service dogs in Russia today.[15] St Bernards have in common many characteristics of other Mountain dog breeds.\\r\\n\\r\\nAlpine Mastiffs Reanimating a Distressed Traveler by Edwin Landseer (1820)\\r\\n\\r\\nA St. Bernard with short coat\\r\\n\\r\\nSt. Bernard Dog in winter\\r\\n\\r\\nLonghaired St. Bernards\\r\\n\\r\\nLonghaired St. Bernard Dog\\r\\n\\r\\nSt. Bernard puppy with colours not distinctively pronounced\\r\\n\\r\\nThe St. Bernard is recognised internationally by the Fdration Cynologique Internationale as a Molosser in Group 2, Section 2. The breed is recognised by The Kennel Club (UK), the Canadian Kennel Club, and the American Kennel Club in the Working Dog breed group. The United Kennel Club in the United States places the breed in the Guardian Dog Group. The New Zealand Kennel Club and the Australian National Kennel Council place the breed in the Utility Group\\r\\n\\r\\nSt. Bernard dogs are no longer used for Alpine rescues, the last recorded instance of which was in 1955. As late as 2004, the Great St Bernard Hospice still retained 18 of the dogs for reasons of tradition and sentiment. In that year the Barry Foundation created breeding kennels for the breed at the town of Martigny down the Great Saint Bernard Pass, and purchased the remaining dogs from the Hospice. During the summer months each year a number of the animals are temporarily relocated from Martigny to the Hospice for viewing by tourists.\\r\\n\\r\\nAn annual celebration of the breed takes place on the Little Saint Bernard Pass and at the town of Rosires-Montvalzan on the French side. Saint Bernard dog enthusiasts and breeders gather for a dog show and parades.[16]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe animals bred by the Foundation are trained to participate in a variety of dog sports including carting and weight pulling. The dogs at the Barry Foundation are reportedly smaller than the average St Bernard.[citation needed]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe very fast growth rate and the weight of a St. Bernard can lead to very serious deterioration of the bones if the dog does not get proper food and exercise. Many dogs are genetically affected by hip dysplasia or elbow dysplasia. Osteosarcoma (bone cancer) has been shown to be hereditary in the breed.[17] They are susceptible to eye disorders called entropion and ectropion, in which the eyelid turns in or out. The breed standard indicates that this is a major fault. The breed is also susceptible to epilepsy and seizures, a heart disease called dilated cardiomyopathy, and eczema.\\r\\n\\r\\nUS and UK breed clubs put the average lifespan for a St. Bernard at 8ÿ10 years.[18][19][20] A 2003 Danish breed survey (35 dogs) puts the median lifespan at 9.5 years while a UK breed survey in 2004 (53 dogs) puts the median lifespan at 7 years. In the UK survey about one in five lived to >10 years with the longest lived dog at 12 years and 9 months.[21][22]\\r\\n\\r\\nA study of genetically related polyneuropathy in the breed was conducted.[23]\\r\\n\\r\\nKnown as a classic example of a Gentle Giant, the Saint Bernard is calm, patient and sweet with adults, and especially children. However St. Bernards, like all very large dogs, must be well socialized with people and other dogs in order to prevent fearfulness and any possible aggression or territoriality. The biggest threat to small children is being knocked over by this breed's larger size. Overall they are a sweet, gentle, calm, loyal and affectionate breed, and if socialized are very friendly. Because of its large adult size, it is essential that proper training and socialization begin while the St. Bernard is still a puppy, so as to avoid the difficulties that normally accompany training large dogs. An unruly St. Bernard may present problems for even a strong adult, so control needs to be asserted from the beginning of the dog's training. While generally not instinctively protective, a St. Bernard may bark at strangers, and their size makes them good deterrents against possible intruders.[24][25]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Saint Bernard was bred to be a working companion and to this day the St.Bernard lives to please its master and is an amiable yet hard worker. St.Bernards have retained their natural ability for scent work and depending on the skill of the trainer and the talents of the dog, St. Bernards can participate in tracking events or even become involved in search and rescue work.[26]\\r\\n\\r\\nSt. Bernards were exported to England in the mid-19th century, where they were bred with mastiffs to create an even larger dog. Plinlimmon, a famous St. Bernard of the time, was measured at 95?kg (210?lbs) and 87.5?cm (34?1?2ins), and was sold to an American for $7000.[13] Commercial pressure encouraged breeding ever larger dogs until \\"the dogs became so gross that they had difficulties in getting from one end of a show ring to another\\".[13]\\r\\n\\r\\nAn 1895 New York Times report mentions a St. Bernard named Major F. measuring 8?feet 6?inches (2.59?m) in length, who, if the claims are true, would be the longest dog in history.[27] Another St. Bernard named Benedictine V Schwarzwald Hof (Pierson, Michigan - USA) also reached 315?lb (143?kg), which earned a place in the 1981 edition of the Guinness Book of World Records.[28]\\r\\n\\r\\nSt. Bernards are often portrayed, especially in old live action comedies such as Swiss Miss, the TV series Topper, and classic cartoons, wearing small barrels of brandy around their necks. Avalanche victims supposedly drank the brandy to stay warm while awaiting rescue, although this is medically unsound. The monks of the St. Bernard Hospice deny that any St. Bernard has ever carried casks or small barrels around their necks; they attribute the image to an 1820 painting by Edwin Landseer, perhaps Alpine Mastiffs Reanimating a Distressed Traveler (which became a popular engraving in 1831 by Charles Landseer).[29] The monks did keep casks around for photographs by tourists.[30]\\r\\n\\r\\nThere was apparently at least one dog that really did carry brandy. In The Percy Anecdotes, by Thomas Byerley, published in 1823, the following anecdote appears, and was often quoted in other books in the 19th century:\\r\\n\\r\\nThe breed of dogs kept by the monks to assist them ... has been long celebrated for its sagacity and fidelity. All the oldest and most tried of them were lately buried, along with some unfortunate travellers, under a valanche [sic]; but three or four hopeful puppies were left at home in the convent, and still survive. The most celebrated of those who are no more, was a dog called Barry. This animal served the hospital for the space of twelve years, during which time he saved the lives of forty individuals. His zeal was indefatigable. Whenever the mountain was enveloped in fogs and snow, he set out in search of lost travellers. He was accustomed to run barking until he lost breath, and would frequently venture on the most perilous places. When he found his strength was insufficient to draw from the snow a traveller benumbed with cold, he would run back to the hospital in search of the monks.\\r\\nWhen old age deprived him of strength, the Prior of the Convent pensioned him at Berney, by way of reward. After his death, his hide was stuffed and deposited in the museum of that town. The little phial, in which he carried a reviving liquor for the distressed travellers whom he found among the mountains, is still suspended from his neck.[31]\\r\\nA Punch magazine cartoon from 1949 depicts a man with a St. Bernard and several puppies, all of which are wearing neck casks. The man explains, \\"Of course, I only breed them for the brandy.\\"\\r\\n\\r\\nA frequent joke in old MGM and Warner Brothers shorts is to depict the dogs as compulsive alcoholics who engage in frequent nips from their own casks.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe famous St. Bernard dog Barry found a small boy in the snow and persuaded the boy to climb on his back, and then carried the boy to safety.[9]","input":"How did st bernard dog get its name?"},{"output":"Lenn Moreno","context":"Rafael Correa\\r\\nPAIS Alliance\\r\\nLenin Moreno\\r\\nPAIS Alliance\\r\\nGeneral elections were held in Ecuador on 19 February 2017 alongside a referendum on tax havens.[1] Voters elected a new President and National Assembly. Incumbent President Rafael Correa of the PAIS Alliance was not eligible for re-election, having served two terms. In the first round of the presidential elections, PAIS Alliance candidate Lenn Moreno received 39% of the vote. Although he was more than 10% ahead of his nearest rival, Guillermo Lasso of the Creating Opportunities party, Moreno was just short of the 40% threshold required to avoid a run-off. As a result a second round was held on 2 April.[2] In the second round Moreno was elected President with 51.16% of the vote.[3][4]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nFollowing nearly a decade of political volatility in Ecuador that was characterized by impeachments, economic crises, and public unrest, [5] Raphael Correa, the nations current president, began his ascendance to power. During his 2006 campaign Correa established the PAIS Alliance, a coalition of leftist organizations that is the same party that president-elect Lenin Moreno, Correas vice president, ran under in the most recent presidential election. [6] [7][8]\\r\\nThroughout his campaign and during his presidency Correa mobilized populist rhetoric to gain support, framing himself in opposition to the former political elite and current economic elite: Correa used the terms neoliberal night (noche neoliberal) and partyarchy (partidocracia) to refer to those groups, respectively, and characterized his own movement as a citizens revolution (La revolucion ciudadana). [9][10] Correas success was part of a larger wave of leftist movements in Latin American that began around the turn of century, frequently referred to as the pink tide. Other countries that elected left-leaning presidents in the early 2000s include Argentina (Nstor Kirchner), Venezuela (Hugo Chvez), and Brazil (Luiz Incio Lula da Silva), among others.[10][11]\\r\\nOne of the most significant events that took place during Correas time in office was the ratification of a new constitution in 2008.[5] Correa advocated for the new constitution and his supporters welcomed it, citing a focus on civil rights and social programs for the impoverished.[12] [13] However, the constitution was also met with much opposition, as its detractors feared that the document would give too much economic authority to the executive and initially believed its elimination of term limits would benefit Correa himself, although a provision on the amendment assured the law would not be put into action until after his presidency had ended.[10]\\r\\nGuillermo Lasso, a former banker, initially ran for president in 2013, but lost to Correa by more than 30% of the vote in the first round. [14] In both his first and second bids for president, Lasso was aligned with the Creating Opportunities Party (Creando Oportunidades), a conservative learning party that formed in 2012 and focused on celebrating the market, eliminating taxes, as well as advocating for an independent judiciary and free speech. [15][16]\\r\\nWith Correa ineligible for re-election, his supporters formed an organisation Rafael Contigo Siempre (Always with you Rafael) to campaign for a constitutional amendment to allow him to run again.[17] With signatures from 8% of the electorate required to hold a referendum (929,062), a total of 1.2 million were collected.[18] However, Correa stated that he was planning on retiring from politics and would not run again.[19] Instead, on 2 October 2016 the PAIS Alliance nominated Lenn Moreno, Correa's vice president from 2007 to 2013, as its candidate, with incumbent vice president Jorge Glas as his running mate.[20] Moreno was challenged by Guillermo Lasso, a former banker.[21]\\r\\nA central issue in the presidential election was corruption; scandals in the Petroecuador state oil company and Odebrecht cases led to demands that candidates develop substantive plans to deal with corruption. Moreno proposed an anti-corruption law, while Lasso proposed a Truth Commission, which would be created with assistance from the United Nations.[22]\\r\\nThe two main candidates had very different visions for the country; Moreno's policy ideas were fairly similar to Correa's, while Lasso said he wanted to attack corruption and lower taxes.[21]\\r\\nLasso said before the elections that he would not allow Julian Assange to continue living in the Ecuadorian embassy in London.[23]\\r\\nThe President was elected using a modified two-round system, with a candidate required to get over 50% of the vote, or get over 40% of the vote and be 10% ahead of their nearest rival to be elected in the first round.[24] The President is limited to two consecutive four year terms.[25]\\r\\nThe 137 members of the National Assembly were elected by three methods?: 15 were elected from a nationwide constituency, 116 were elected in 31 districts (21 corresponding to the 21 smallest provinces and 10 within the 3 largest provinces, range 2-6 seats per district), and six elected from three two-member constituencies representing Ecuadorians living overseas. Elections are by open list proportional represenation (every voter can vote for as many candidates as there are seats to be awarded), with the 15 seats national seats allocated using the Webster method and the rest using the d'Hondt method.[26] Voting was compulsory except for voters aged 16ÿ18 or over 65 and people classed as illiterate.[27] Members of the National Assembly are limited to two four-year terms, either consecutive or not. There are gender quotas for the party lists, meaning there is alternation between men and women. There are no quotas for minority representation.[25]\\r\\nParties have to receive at least 5% of the vote in national elections in order to maintain their legal registration.[28]\\r\\nThe first-round count was delayed for four days, far longer than usual, raising suspicions from the Lasso camp. In past years, the first-round results were known on election day. Election officials blamed the delays on \\"numerical inconsistencies\\" in some ballots. Moreno maintained a consistent lead throughout the count. However, by the fourth day of counting, it was no longer mathematically possible for him to win an outright victorysetting the stage for the runoff.[2]\\r\\nA recount would have taken weeks and Lenin Moreno (usually referred to as just Lenin) challenged all the allegations of fraud. President Correa said that \\"the moral fraud committed by the right will not go unpunished.\\" Moreno said he will represent those who voted and those who didnt, tweeting \\"Long live Ecuador! Welcome fighters of peace and of life along with a picture of him immediately after winning the election. His opponent Lasso, however, encouraged the people to peacefully protest the election results. He tweeted: \\"Let's act in a peaceful but firm manner, we must go to the streets and say 'don't steal my vote' because we want a change in Ecuador.\\"[29]\\r\\nThe National Electoral Council announced on 13 April that it would recount all ballots contested by both parties, accounting to about 10% of the total vote.[30] Moreno also led the vote after recount of some of the votes, increasing the number of votes obtained by 1,594.[31]\\r\\nThe National Assembly makes up the legislative branch of Ecuadorean government. These elected officials have the power to pass laws, while judges of the national court of justice are chosen by a separate judicial council.[32]","input":"Who is the new elected president of ecuador?"},{"output":"13,725 at the 2011 census","context":"Grand Falls-Windsor is a town located in the central region of the island of Newfoundland in the province of Newfoundland and Labrador, Canada, with a population of 13,725 at the 2011 census.[2] The town is the largest in the central region, the fifth largest in the province, and is home to the annual Exploits Valley Salmon Festival.[3] Grand Falls-Windsor was incorporated in 1991 when the two former towns of Grand Falls and Windsor amalgamated.\\r\\nThe town is known as \\"Qapskuk\\" in the Mi'kmaq language.[4]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1768, Lieutenant John Cartwright, while following the Exploits River through the Exploits Valley, named the waterfall he found \\"Grand Falls\\"; however, it took until 1905 before the town of Grand Falls was established.[5] Worried about the impending war in Europe, Alfred Harmsworth (Baron Northcliffe) began looking for an alternative source of newsprint for his family's newspaper and publishing business. During their search for a suitable location to build and operate a pulp and paper mill, Harold Harmsworth and Mayson Beeton, son of Isabella Beeton, the author of Mrs Beeton's Book of Household Management, discovered Grand Falls. The site had great potential due to access to lumber, the possibility of hydroelectricity and a deep-water port available in nearby Botwood. On January 7, 1905, the Harmsworths and Robert Gillespie Reid, owner of the Newfoundland Railway, formed the Anglo-Newfoundland Development Company, and the mill was constructed and opened on October 9, 1909. The first roll of salable newsprint was not produced until December 22, 1909. Workers came from throughout the colony and the world to help develop the new area. At that time, only employees of the mill and workers from private businesses were permitted to live in Grand Falls. Other people settled north of the railway in a shack town known as Grand Falls Station, which became Windsor, named for the English Royal Family.\\r\\nThe Anglo Newfoundland Development Company, owners of the town, catered to the social and athletic needs of the people living there. The Grand Falls Athletic Club was formed in 1907. Sports such as hockey, boxing, golf, soccer and baseball were played in the area. Increasing interest in music and the arts reflected in the creation of several clubs, including The Andophians, The Exploits Amateur Theatre Company, the Northcliffe Drama Club (1951) and Another Newfoundland Drama Company Inc. (A.N.D. Company Inc.) (1998) Several musical groups were formed. From 1905ÿ1906, the religious needs of the residents were filled by visiting clergy. However, because of the increasing population of Grand Falls, several churches were built.\\r\\nDue to its continued growth, Grand Falls Station became a vibrant town. Main Street, in what is now the former town of Windsor, featured lines of small business that catered to the needs of the residents and the town was officially incorporated on November 1, 1938. During the incorporation, Grand Falls Station changed its name to Windsor in honour of the British Royal Family, the House of Windsor.\\r\\nIn 1961, Price Brothers and Company Limited acquired a large amount of A.N.D. Company stock. An election for the first municipal government was soon held which eventually led to the incorporation of the town of Grand Falls. In 1988, the town took the title of the World Forestry Capital briefly. Finally, in 1991, the towns of Grand Falls and Windsor were forced by the provincial government to amalgamate, becoming the current town of Grand Falls-Windsor.\\r\\nToday the 2nd Battalion of the Royal Newfoundland Regiment, part of the 5th Canadian Division is stationed in the town.\\r\\nGrand Falls-Windsor is centrally located on the island of Newfoundland. It is approximately an hour west of Gander, two and a half hours west of Clarenville and about four hours west of St. John's. On the other hand, the town is slightly over two hours east of Deer Lake, two hours and forty-five minutes east of Corner Brook and close to five hours east of Port Aux Basques, when traveling on the Newfoundland and Labrador Route 1, part of the Trans-Canada Highway.\\r\\nThe town itself consists of the former towns of Grand Falls and Windsor. The Newfoundland and Labrador Route 1 runs through the middle of town, with exits for Main Street, Station Road, Cromer Avenue, Union Street, Grenfell Heights and New Bay Road. Main thoroughfares in the town include Lincoln Road, Cromer Avenue, Main Street, High Street, and Scott Avenue, though this list isn't extensive.\\r\\nGrand Falls-Windsor has a humid continental climate, its classification being similar to the remainder of Newfoundland. Due to its farther inland position than most localities the influence of the Atlantic Ocean and its moderation is less prevalent, rendering the warmest summers on the island. Winter lows are also more extreme than in St. John's and Corner Brook, although swings are very moderate when compared to areas on similar latitudes in continental Canada.\\r\\nOn December 4, 2008, Abitibi Bowater released a statement concerning imminent closure of the pulp and paper mill in Grand Falls-Windsor, representing a cutback of 205 000 tons of paper. The mill produced its last roll of newsprint on February 12, 2009. The closure was effected due to exchange rate volatility, energy, and fiber pricing, as well as structural challenges in the North American newsprint industry. At the time of closure, the paper mill was the second largest employer of the town. From 2016 to 2017, the mill was completely demolished.\\r\\nLike most other communities in Newfoundland and Labrador, Grand Falls-Windsor has suffered from outmigration.

The most widely held view is that Sri Lankan composer Ananda Samarakoon wrote the music and lyrics to the song inspired/influenced by Bengali poet Rabindranath Tagore.[1][2][3][4] A minority suggest that Tagore wrote the anthem in full.[5][6][7][8] Some have suggested that Tagore wrote the music whilst Samarakoon wrote the lyrics.[9][10] Samarakoon had been a pupil of Tagore at Visva-Bharati University, Santiniketan.[11][12] After returning to Ceylon Samarakoon taught music at Mahinda College, Galle.[13][14] The song, which was then known as Namo Namo Mata, was first sung by students at Mahinda College.[15][16] After it was sung by the choir from Musaeus College, Colombo at a public event it became hugely popular in Ceylon and was widely played on radio.[17]\\r\\nPrior to Ceylon's independence (1948) the Lanka Gandharva Sabha had organised a competition to find a national anthem.[18][19] Among the entries were Namo Namo Matha by Samarakoon and Sri Lanka Matha Pala Yasa Mahima by P. B. Illangasinghe and Lionel Edirisinghe.[18][19] The latter won the competition but this was controversial as Illangasinghe and Edirisinghe were members of the judging panel.[18][19] Sri Lanka Matha Pala Yasa Mahima was broadcast by Radio Ceylon on the morning of 4 February 1948, independence day, but it was not sung at the official Freedom Day celebrations.[18][19] Ceylon continued to use the British national anthem as its official national anthem after independence.[20] At the first independence day ceremony held on 4 February 1949 at the Independence Memorial Hall in Torrington Square both Namo Namo Matha and Sri Lanka Matha Pala Yasa Mahima were sung, in Sinhala and Tamil, as \\"national songs\\".[18][21]\\r\\nMore specifically, in 1950 Minister of Finance J. R. Jayewardene requested that the government recognise Samarakoon's Namo Namo Matha as the official national anthem.[17] The government appointed a committee headed by Edwin Wijeyeratne, Minister of Home Affairs and Rural Development, to pick a new national anthem.[20] The committee heard several songs but, after much deliberation, picked Namo Namo Matha.[7][17][20] The committee made a minor change to Samarakoon's song, with his approval, changing the tenth line from \\"Nawajeewana Damine\\" to \\"Nawa Jeewana Demine Nithina Apapupudu Karan Matha\\".[17] The committee's decision was endorsed by the government on 22 November 1951.[13][20] The anthem was translated into the Tamil language by M. Nallathamby.[17][22][23] Namo Namo Matha was first sung as Ceylon's official national anthem at the independence day ceremony in 1952.[17][24]\\r\\nIn the late 1950s controversy arose over first line of the anthem, \\"Namo Namo Matha, Apa Sri Lanka\\".[16][17] It was deemed to be \\"unlucky\\" and blamed for the country's misfortunes including the deaths of two prime ministers.[16] In February 1961 the government changed the line to their present form, \\"Sri Lanka Matha, Apa Sri Lanka\\", despite Samarakoon's strong opposition.[17][22] Samarakoon committed suicide in April 1962, leaving a note complaining that his anthem had been mutilated.[17]\\r\\nThe Second Republican Constitution of 1978 gave Sri Lanka Matha constitutional recognition.[25]\\r\\nThe Sri Lankan national anthem is available in an identical version in two languages, Sinhala and Tamil, both official languages of the country. It is just one of a number that are sung in more than one language: Belgium (French, Dutch and German), Canada (English, French and Inuktitut), New Zealand (English and Mori), South Africa (Xhosa, Zulu, Sesotho, Afrikaans and English), Suriname (Dutch and Sranan Tongo) and Switzerland (German, French, Italian and Romansh).[23]\\r\\nSri Lanka Thaaye, the Tamil version of the Sri Lankan national anthem, is an exact translation of Sri Lanka Matha, the Sinhala version, and has the same music.[26] Although it has existed since independence in 1948 it was generally only sung in the north and east of the country where the Tamil language predominates.[26]\\r\\nThe majority of Sri Lankans (around 75%) speak the Sinhala language. More specifically, \\"Tamil is the native language for the Tamil people, who constitute about 15% of Sri Lankans, and for Muslims who are nearly 10%\\", according to the BBC.[26] Until early 2016, the Sinhala version was the only one to be used during official government events and it was the only version used during international sports and other events.[23] Although the Sinhala version of the anthem was used at official/state events, the Tamil version was also sung at some events in spite of the unofficial ban which ended in early 2016.\\r\\nThe Sinhala version of Sri Lanka Matha was used in all parts of the country with the exception of the North and the East which have a large Tamil population.[22][27][28] Some reports indicate that the Tamil version was used at official events held in the Tamil speaking regions in the North and East of Sri Lanka.[22][23] The Tamil version was sung at Tamil medium schools throughout the country.[22][23] The Tamil version was even used during the period when Sinhala was the only official language of the country (1956ÿ87).[22][23]\\r\\nOn 12 December 2010 The Sunday Times reported that the Cabinet of Sri Lanka headed by President Mahinda Rajapaksa had taken the decision to scrap the Tamil translation of Sri Lanka Matha at official and state functions, as \\"in no other country was the national anthem used in more than one language\\" - even though the national anthems of Canada, South Africa and those of several other countries have more than one language version.[27] The Cabinet's decision had followed a paper on the national flag and national anthem produced by Public Administration and Home Affairs Minister W. D. J. Senewiratne.[22][29] The paper had drawn on the Singaporean model where the national anthem is sung in the official lyrics and not any translation of the lyrics.[22] Based on this the paper recommended that the Sri Lankan national anthem only be sung in Sinhala and the Tamil translation be abolished.[22] The paper's authors had failed to realise that the official lyrics of the Singaporean national anthem are in Malay, a minority language (75% of Singaporeans are Chinese).[30]\\r\\nGovernment minister Wimal Weerawansa had labelled the Tamil version a \\"joke\\" on Derana TV, and had cited India as an analogy.[31][32][33] Some journalists, such as D. B. S. Jeyaraj,[22] claimed that it was wrong of Weerawansa to cite India as an analogy because according to them the Indian national anthem was not in Hindi, which is the most widely spoken language of India, but in Bengali, a minority language.[34][35][36][37] Although sources based on an official Government of India website state that the Indian National anthem was adopted in its Hindi version by the Constituent Assembly of India,[38][39] the proceedings of the Constituent Assembly of India on 24 January 1950 does not mention that the National Anthem was \\"adopted\\", nor does it mention that it was done so in its Hindi version.[40][41] In actual practice the unaltered Bengali version is the version sung as the National Anthem, with its words in original Bengali Tatsama, a highly Sanskritized form of Bengali that has Sanskrit words common to both Hindi and Bengali.[42]\\r\\nThe Cabinet's December 2010 decision to scrap the Tamil translation of the anthem[43] (which was not subsequently enacted) caused much furore in Sri Lanka. Later, the government denied allegations that the Tamil translation was to be abolished.[44] The Presidential Secretariat has stated that there was no basis to the media report and follow up reports which intimated the same.[45] Nevertheless, an unofficial ban[28] on the Tamil version came into being as fearful public officials in Tamil speaking areas stopped using the Tamil version or blocked attempts to use it.[23][46] The Sri Lankan Army forcefully stopped any use of the Tamil version and taught school children to sing only the Sinhala version.[46][47][48][49]\\r\\nIn March 2015 newly elected President Maithripala Sirisena announced that he would be issuing a circular which would state that there was no ban on singing the national anthem in Tamil.[50][51] Sirisena's announcement was attacked by Sinhalese Buddhist nationalists.[52][53][54][55]\\r\\nDuring Sri Lanka's 68th national independence day celebrations on 4 February 2016, the Tamil version of the anthem was sung for the first time since 1949 at an official government event, the independence day celebrations.[56] Lifting of the unofficial ban on the Tamil version had been approved by President Maithripala Sirisena (who had said he would unite the nation after the nearly 26-year civil war that ended in 2009) and by others in the government.[28] This step was viewed as part of the plan for \\"post-civil war ethnic reconciliation\\".[57]\\r\\nNaturally, Sri Lanka Matha was also sung in the majority Sinhalese. Some groups, and Sri Lanka's former President Mahinda Rajapaksa, were opposed to the government officially allowing the Tamil version to be sung.[26][58][26][59][60]\\r\\n????? ???? ????\\r\\n?? ?????....... ???? ??? ??? ??? ??? ????\\r\\n?????? ????????? ?????? ??? ?????? ????\\r\\n?????? ??? ??? ??? ?????? ???? ?? ????? ??????\\r\\n?? ?? ??? ???? ??? ???? ?????? ????\\r\\n??????? ??? ?? ????? ????\\r\\n??? ??? ????\\r\\n?? ????? ...... ???? ??? ??? ??? ??? ????\\r\\n\\r\\n?? ?? ?? ???????\\r\\n?? ?? ?? ??????\\r\\n?? ?? ?? ?????\\r\\n?? ?? ??? ?????\\r\\n?? ?? ?????\\r\\n???? ??????????\\r\\n?? ?? ???? ??\\r\\n?? ??????? ?? ??\\r\\n\\r\\n?? ???? ?????? ????? ?? ?????? ???? ????\\r\\n??? ????? ?????? ????? ??? ??? ?? ???? ???\\r\\n?? ????? ??? ??? ??????\\r\\n??? ??? ?? ?????\\r\\n?????? ??? ??? ??? ????? ?? ??? ??? ????\\r\\n?? ?????........ ???? ??? ??? ??? ??? ????\\r\\n???? ????? ???? - ??? ???? ?????\\r\\n??? ??? ??? ??? ????\\r\\n????????? ???? ?????\\r\\n??????? ?????? ???? ??????? ?????\\r\\n????? ????? ?? ???? ??? ??? ????\\r\\n????????? ???? ?????\\r\\n?????? ???????? ?? ?????????\\r\\n?????? ??? ????\\r\\n????? ?????? ???? ????????\\r\\n???????? ???? - ??? ???? ?????\\r\\n??? ??? ??? ??? ????\\r\\n\\r\\n????????? ?????\\r\\n??? ????? ??????????\\r\\n?????? ?????????\\r\\n????? ?????????? ?????\\r\\n????????? ??????\\r\\n??? ??? ?????????\\r\\n????????? ????????\\r\\n???????? ?????????\\r\\n\\r\\n?????? ??? ????\\r\\n???? ???? ?? ??????? ????\\r\\n?????????? ??? ????? ????????\\r\\n????????? ??????? ????\\r\\n?????? ???????? ??? ????\\r\\n?????? ????????????\\r\\n?? ??????? ???????? ?????\\r\\n??? ??? ???? - ??? ???? ?????\\r\\n??? ??? ??? ??? ????\\r\\nSri Lanka Matha, Apa Sri Lanka\\r\\nNamo Namo Namo Namo Matha\\r\\nSundara siri barini\\r\\nSurendi athi sobamana Lanka\\r\\nDhanya dhanaya neka\\r\\nMal palathuru piri, jaya bhoomiya ramya\\r\\nApa hata sapa siri setha sadana\\r\\nJeewanaye Matha!\\r\\nPiliganu mena apa bhakthi puja\\r\\nNamo Namo Matha, Apa Sri Lanka\\r\\nNamo Namo Namo Namo Matha\\r\\n\\r\\nObawe apa widya\\r\\nObamaya apa sathya\\r\\nObawe apa shakti\\r\\nApa hada thula bhakthi\\r\\nOba apa aloke\\r\\nAapage anuprane\\r\\nOba apa jeewana we\\r\\nApa mukthiya obawe\\r\\n\\r\\nNawa jeewana demine\\r\\nNnithina apa pubudu karan Matha\\r\\nGnana weerya wadawamina ragena\\r\\nYanu mena jaya bhoomi kara\\r\\nEka mawekuge daru kala bawina\\r\\nYamu yamu wee nopama\\r\\nPrema wada sama bheda durara da\\r\\nNamo Namo Matha, Apa Sri Lanka\\r\\nNamo Namo Namo Namo Matha\\r\\nSrؐ la?k ty ÿ nam Srؐ la?k\\r\\nNam nam nam nam ty\\r\\nNalle?il poli cؐra?i\\r\\nNala?ka? yvum ni?ai v?ma?i la?k\\r\\n?lam puka? va?a vayal nati malai malar\\r\\nNa?u?clai ko? la?k\\r\\nNamatu?u pukali?am e?a o?irvy\\r\\nNamatuti l ty\\r\\nNamatalai ni?ata?i ml vaittm\\r\\nNamatuyir ty ÿ nam Srؐ la?k\\r\\nNam nam nam nam ty\\r\\n\\r\\nNamatraru? ?y\\r\\nNavai tavir u?arv?y\\r\\nNamatere valiy?y\\r\\nNavil cutantiram ?y\\r\\nNamati?amaiyai n??\\r\\nNaku ma?i ta?aiy??\\r\\nAmaivu?um a?ivu?a?\\r\\nA?alce?i tu?ivaru?\\r\\n\\r\\nNamatr o?i va?am\\r\\nNa?iya malar e?a nilavum ty\\r\\nYmellm oru karu?ai a?aipayanta\\r\\nE?ilko? cyka? e?av\\r\\nIyalu?u pi?avuka? tamai a?av\\r\\nI?ive?a nؐkki?uvm\\r\\nؐ?a cirma?i v?vu?u pma?i\\r\\nNam nam ty ÿ nam Srؐ la?k\\r\\nNam nam nam nam ty\\r\\nThou Mother Lanka,\\r\\nOh Mother Lanka we salute, salute, salute, salute Thee!\\r\\nPlenteous in prosperity, Thou,\\r\\nBeauteous in grace and love,\\r\\nLaden with grain and luscious fruit,\\r\\nAnd fragrant flowers of radiant hue,\\r\\nGiver of life and all good things,\\r\\nOur land of joy and victory,\\r\\nReceive our grateful praise sublime, we worship, worship Thee.\\r\\nOh Mother Lanka!

Planned improvements to Enhanced Autopilot include transitioning from one freeway to another and exiting the freeway when your destination is near.\\r\\nAs an upgrade above and beyond Enhanced Autopilot's capabilities, the company's stated intent is to offer full self-driving at a future time, acknowledging that legal, regulatory, and technical hurdles must be overcome to achieve this goal.[2]\\r\\nAs of February 2018, Tesla indicates that a demonstration of a self driving coast to coast drive will be ready in three to six months.[3]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nAutopilot was first offered on October 9, 2014, for Tesla Model S, followed by the Model X upon its release.[4] Autopilot was included within a \\"Tech Package\\" option. At that time Autopilot features included semi-autonomous drive and parking capabilities.[5][6][7] Initial versions of Autopilot were developed in partnership with the Israeli company Mobileye.[8] Tesla and Mobileye ended their partnership in July 2016.[9][10]\\r\\nIn October 2015, Tesla released Autopilot version 7.0 to its customers.[11] In December 2015, Tesla announced that it will remove some self-driving features to discourage customers from engaging in risky behavior. Autopilot Firmware 7.1 made those changes and includes remote parking technology known as Summon that can park and can bring the car to the driver without the driver in the car.[12][13][14]\\r\\nOn August 31, 2016, Elon Musk announced Autopilot 8.0, that processes radar signals to create a coarse point cloud similar to Lidar to help navigate in low visibility conditions, and even to 'see' in front of the car ahead.[15][16] Autopilot, as of version 8, uses radar as the primary sensor instead of the camera.[17] In November 2016, Autopilot 8.0 was updated to have a more noticeable signal to the driver that it is engaged and it requires drivers to touch the steering wheel more frequently, otherwise Autopilot will turn off.[18][19] By November 2016, Autopilot had operated actively on hardware version 1 vehicles for 300 million miles (500 million km) and 1.3 billion miles (2 billion km) in shadow mode.[20]\\r\\nAs of October 2016, Tesla said all vehicles come with the necessary sensing and computing hardware, known as Hardware version 2 (HW2), for future fully autonomous operation (SAE Level 5), with software being made available as it matures.[21] The company offers various free/extra-cost options for enabling Autopilot-associated features/services. Autopilot on hardware version 1 cars is available for US$2,500 ($3,000 after delivery). For HW2 cars, Autopilot is available as \\"Enhanced Autopilot\\" for $5,000 ($6,000 after delivery) and future full self-driving capability is an additional $3,000 ($4,000 after delivery).[22]\\r\\nThe first release of Autopilot for HW2 cars was in February 2017. It included adaptive cruise control, autosteer that was enabled on divided highways, autosteer on 'local roads up to a speed of 35?mph or a specified number of mph over the local speed limit.[23] Firmware version 8.1 for HW2 began in June 2017 that has many new features including a new Autopilot driving-assist algorithm, full-speed braking and handling parallel and perpendicular parking.[24]\\r\\nOn April 28, 2017, Elon Musk predicted that in around two years drivers would be able to sleep in their Tesla until it finishes the trip.[25]\\r\\nIn the middle of 2017, Tesla planned to demonstrate full self-driving by the end of 2017.[26][27] In February 2018, Tesla indicates the demonstration of a self driving coast to coast drive will be ready in three to six months.[3]\\r\\nVehicles manufactured after late September 2014 are equipped with a camera mounted at the top of the windshield, forward looking radar (supplied by Bosch)[28][29] in the lower grille and ultrasonic acoustic location sensors in the front and rear bumpers that provide a 360-degree view around the car. The computer is the Mobileye EyeQ3.[30] This equipment allows Model S to detect road signs, lane markings, obstacles, and other vehicles. Upgrading from Hardware 1 to Hardware 2 is not offered as it would require substantial work and cost.[31]\\r\\nHardware 2, included in all vehicles manufactured after October 2016, includes an Nvidia Drive PX 2[32] GPU for CUDA based GPGPU computation.[33][34] Tesla claimed that Hardware 2 provided the necessary equipment to allow full self-driving capability at SAE Level 5. The hardware includes 8 surround cameras and 12 ultrasonic sensors, in addition to forward-facing radar with enhanced processing capabilities.[21] The Autopilot computer is replaceable to allow for future upgrades.[35] The radar is claimed to be able to observe beneath and ahead of the vehicle in front of the Tesla; the radar can see vehicles through heavy rain, fog or dust.[36]\\r\\nHardware 1\\r\\nHardware 2\\r\\nAn updated Hardware version referred to as 'HW 2.5' (also known as '2.1') was released in July 2017, with cars built from August 2017 containing the updated hardware set. In HW 2.5 there is a secondary node (without a GPU) to provide more computing power and wiring redundancy which is to slightly improve reliability.[53][54]\\r\\nTesla requires operators to monitor the vehicle at all times, just as the Federal Aviation Administration requires pilots to monitor aircraft on autopilot. Autopilot includes multiple capabilities, including adaptive cruise control and lane departure warning.\\r\\nAutopilot-enabled cars receive Autopilot software updates wirelessly, the same as all other Tesla software updates.\\r\\nAutopilot has the ability to follow another car, maintaining a safe distance from it as it speeds up and slows down. It can observe a second vehicle in front of the vehicle that it is following. It also slows on tight curves and when a car crosses the road in front of it. It can be enabled at any speed above 17?mph. By default, it sets the limit at the current speed limit plus/minus any driver-specified offset.\\r\\nAutopilot alerts the driver under various circumstances, such as a surprising situation on the road or excessive inattention by the driver. If the driver dismisses three audio warnings within an hour, Autopilot is disabled until the car is parked. This is to prevent experienced drivers from excessive reliance on built-in safety features. At speeds under 8?mph on divided highways, Autopilot functions indefinitely without the driver's hands on the wheel. Under 45?mph free hands are allowed for five minutes, unless the car detects lateral acceleration. Above 45?mph free hands are allowed for three minutes if following another vehicle or one minute without following a car.[36]\\r\\nAutopark drives the car into a parking spot, while Summon drives it out. Configuration settings control maximum distance, side clearance and bumper clearance. This feature activates Homelink to open and close garage doors and it is available using the fob or the Tesla mobile app.[55] As of March 2017, Summon was available in \\"beta\\" for HW2. Controls include bumper, side clearance and summon distance.[56]\\r\\nAutosteer steers the car to remain in whatever lane it is in (known as lane-keeping). With HW1, it is also able to safely change lanes as directed by a tap of the turn signal.[57] As of May 2017, HW2 is limited to 90?mph (145?km/h) on highway roads and the former 35?mph (56?km/h) speed limit on non-highway roads was removed, instead limiting to five over the speed limit or 45?mph (72?km/h) if no speed limit is detected.[58]\\r\\nThe Autopilot can detect a potential front or side collision with another vehicle, bicycle or pedestrian within a distance of 525 feet (160?m), if one is found it sounds a warning.[59] Autopilot has automatic emergency braking that detects objects that may hit the car and applies the brakes. Autopilot also can automatically adjust the high/low beam headlights as the nighttime lighting changes.\\r\\nFront-facing cameras detect speed limit signs and display the current limit on the dashboard or center display. Limits are compared against GPS data if no signs are present.[59]\\r\\nSome industry experts have raised questions about the legal status of autonomous driving in the U.S. and whether Tesla owners would violate current state regulations when using the Autopilot function. The few states that have passed laws allowing autonomous cars on the road, limit their use for testing purposes; not for use by the general public. Also, there are questions about the liability for autonomous cars in case there is a mistake.[60] A Tesla spokesman said there is \\"nothing in our autopilot system that is in conflict with current regulations.\\" \\"We are not getting rid of the pilot. This is about releasing the driver from tedious tasks so they can focus and provide better input.\\" Google's director of self-driving cars said he does not think there is a regulatory block as long as the self-driving vehicle met crash-test and other safety standards. A spokesman for the U.S. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) said that \\"any autonomous vehicle would need to meet applicable federal motor vehicle safety standards\\" and the NHTSA \\"will have the appropriate policies and regulations in place to ensure the safety of this type of vehicles.\\"[60]\\r\\nAccording to Elon Musk, \\"We really designed the Model S to be a very sophisticated computer on wheels. Tesla is a software company as much as it is a hardware company. A huge part of what Tesla is, is a Silicon Valley software company. We view this the same as updating your phone or your laptop.\\"[61] Full autonomy is really a software limitation: The hardware exists to create full autonomy, so its really about developing advanced, narrow AI for the car to operate on.[62][63]\\r\\nThe Autopilot development focus is on \\"increasingly sophisticated neural nets that can operate in reasonably sized computers in the car.[62][63] According to Musk, \\"the car will learn over time\\", including from other cars.[64] Early data after 47 million miles of driving in Autopilot mode shows the probability of an accident is at least 50% lower when using Autopilot.[65] However, Ars Technica notes that the brake system tends to initiate later than some drivers expect.[66] One driver claimed that Tesla's Autopilot failed to brake, resulting in collisions. Tesla pointed out that the driver deactivated the cruise control of the car prior to the crash.[67] Ars Technica also notes that the lane changes are semi-automatic; the driver must activate the turn signal in order for the car to initiate a lane change.[68]\\r\\nTesla's Autopilot with Hardware version 1 (HW1) can be classified as somewhere between levels 2 and 3 under the U.S. Department of Transportations National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) five levels of vehicle automation. At this level, the car can act autonomously but requires the driver to be prepared to take control at a moment's notice.[69][70] HW1 is suitable only on limited-access highways, and sometimes will fail to detect lane markings and disengage itself. In urban driving the system will not read traffic signals or obey stop signs. This system also does not detect pedestrians or cyclists,[71] and while AP1 detects motorcycles,[72] there has been two instances of AP rear-ending motorcycles.[73]\\r\\nThere has been significant controversy over the media response to the fatal Tesla accident described in the below section. Whilst a significant amount of blame was apportioned to Tesla for the failure of its Autopilot system, it must be noted that the system at the time of the accident was in a beta phase and not ready for widespread public use, and also required the driver to ensure that their hands remained on the steering wheel at all times, and to be prepared to resume manual driving at any moment.[74][undue weight? ÿ discuss] Hence, when used as an assistive feature (as intended by Tesla), some hold the view that Autopilot can only enhance road safety,[74] assuming it does not lull the driver into complacent inattention.\\r\\nAutopilot potentially saved the life of a pedestrian in Washington, D.C. on the night of July 17, 2016,[75][76] and played a pivotal role in a medical emergency involving 37-year-old Joshua Neally that same month.[77] Neally was driving his Tesla Model X when he suffered a pulmonary embolism that caused intense panic and rendered him incapable of driving.[78] Neally used Autopilot to drive most of the highway to a local hospital. At the off-ramp, Neally took control of the car and drove to the emergency room.[78]\\r\\nTesla's Autopilot is facing a class action suit that claims the second-generation Enhanced Autopilot system is \\"dangerously defective.\\"[79]\\r\\nOn January 20, 2016, the driver of a Tesla Model S in Handan, China was killed when their car crashed into a stationary truck.[80] The Tesla was following a car in the far left lane of a multi-lane highway; the car in front moved to the right lane to avoid a truck stopped on the left shoulder, and the Tesla, which the driver's father believes was in Autopilot mode, did not slow before colliding with the stopped truck.[81] According to footage captured by a dashboard camera, the stationary street sweeper on the left side of the expressway partially extended into the far left lane, and the driver did not appear to respond to the unexpected obstacle.[82]\\r\\nIn September 2016, the media reported the driver's family had filed a lawsuit in July against the Tesla dealer who sold the car.[83] The family's lawyer stated the suit was intended \\"to let the public know that self-driving technology has some defects. We are hoping Tesla, when marketing its products, will be more cautious. Dont just use self-driving as a selling point for young people.\\"[81] Tesla released a statement which said they \\"have no way of knowing whether or not Autopilot was engaged at the time of the crash\\" since the car telemetry could not be retrieved remotely due to damage caused by the crash.[81] Telemetry was recorded locally to a SD card and given to Tesla, who decoded it and provided that data to a third party for independent review. Tesla added that \\"while the third-party appraisal is not yet complete, we have no reason to believe that Autopilot on this vehicle ever functioned other than as designed.\\"[84]\\r\\nThe first known fatal accident involving a Tesla engaged in Autopilot mode took place in Williston, Florida, on May 7, 2016. The driver was killed in a crash with a 18-wheel tractor-trailer.\\r\\nBy late June 2016, the U.S. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) opened a formal investigation into the accident, working with the Florida Highway Patrol. According to the NHTSA, preliminary reports indicate the crash occurred when the tractor-trailer made a left turn in front of the Tesla at an intersection on a non-controlled access highway, and the car failed to apply the brakes. The car continued to travel after passing under the trucks trailer.[85][86][87] The diagnostic log of the Tesla indicated it was traveling at a speed of 74?mi/h (119?km/h) when it collided with and traveled under the trailer, which was not equipped with a side underrun protection system.[88]:12 The underride collision sheared off the Tesla's glasshouse, destroying everything above the beltline, and caused fatal injuries to the driver.[88]:6ÿ7; 13 Approximately nine seconds after colliding with the trailer, the Tesla traveled another 886.5 feet (270.2?m) and came to rest after colliding with two chain-link fences and a utility pole.[88]:7; 12\\r\\nThe NHTSA's preliminary evaluation was opened to examine the design and performance of any automated driving systems in use at the time of the crash, which involves a population of an estimated 25,000 Model S cars.[89] On July 8, 2016, the NHTSA requested Tesla Inc. to hand over to the agency detailed information about the design, operation and testing of its Autopilot technology. The agency also requested details of all design changes and updates to Autopilot since its introduction, and Tesla's planned updates scheduled for the next four months.[90]\\r\\nAccording to Tesla, \\"neither autopilot nor the driver noticed the white side of the tractor-trailer against a brightly lit sky, so the brake was not applied.\\" The car attempted to drive full speed under the trailer, \\"with the bottom of the trailer impacting the windshield of the Model S.\\" Tesla also stated that this was Teslas first known Autopilot-related death in over 130 million miles (208 million km) driven by its customers while Autopilot was activated. According to Tesla there is a fatality every 94 million miles (150 million km) among all type of vehicles in the U.S.[85][86][91] It is estimated that billions of miles will need to be traveled before Tesla Autopilot can claim to be safer than humans with statistical significance (although fewer than billions of miles will be needed if Tesla Autopilot is more dangerous). Researchers say that Tesla and others need to release more data on the limitations and performance of automated driving systems if self-driving cars are to become safe and understood enough for mass market use.[92][93]\\r\\nThe truck's driver told the Associated Press that he could hear a Harry Potter movie playing in the crashed car, and said the car was driving so quickly that \\"he went so fast through my trailer I didn't see him.\\" \\"It was still playing when he died and snapped a telephone pole a quarter mile down the road.\\" According to the Florida Highway Patrol, they found in the wreckage an aftermarket portable DVD player. It is not possible to watch videos on the Model S touchscreen display.[87][94] A laptop computer was recovered during the post-crash examination of the wreck, along with an adjustable vehicle laptop mount attached to the front passenger's seat frame. The NHTSA concluded the laptop was probably mounted and the driver may have been distracted at the time of the crash.[88]:17ÿ19; 21\\r\\nIn July 2016, the U.S. National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) announced it had opened a formal investigation into the fatal accident while Autopilot was engaged. The NTSB is an investigative body that only has the power to make policy recommendations. An agency spokesman said, \\"It's worth taking a look and seeing what we can learn from that event, so that as that automation is more widely introduced we can do it in the safest way possible.\\" The NTSB opens annually about 25 to 30 highway investigations.[95] In September 2017, the NTSB released its report, determining that \\"the probable cause of the Williston, Florida, crash was the truck drivers failure to yield the right of way to the car, combined with the car drivers inattention due to overreliance on vehicle automation, which resulted in the car drivers lack of reaction to the presence of the truck. Contributing to the car drivers overreliance on the vehicle automation was its operational design, which permitted his prolonged disengagement from the driving task and his use of the automation in ways inconsistent with guidance and warnings from the manufacturer.\\"[96].\\r\\nIn January 2017, the NHTSA Office of Defects Investigations (ODI) released a preliminary evaluation, finding that the driver in the crash had seven seconds to see the truck and identifying no defects in the Autopilot system; the ODI also found that the Tesla car crash rate dropped by 40 percent after Autosteer installation,[97][98] but later also clarified that it did not assess the effectiveness of this technology or whether it was engaged in its crash rate comparison.[99] The NHTSA Special Crash Investigation team published its report in January 2018.[88] According to the report, for the drive leading up to the crash, the driver engaged Autopilot for 37 minutes and 26 seconds, and the system provided 13 \\"hands not detected\\" alerts, to which the driver responded after an average delay of 16 seconds.[88]:24 The report concluded \\"Regardless of the operational status of the Teslas ADAS technologies, the driver was still responsible for maintaining ultimate control of the vehicle. All evidence and data gathered concluded that the driver neglected to maintain complete control of the Tesla leading up to the crash.\\"[88]:25\\r\\nOn January 22, 2018, a Tesla Model S crashed into a fire truck parked on the side of the I-405 freeway in Culver City, California while traveling at a speed exceeding 50?mph (80?km/h) and the driver survived.[100] The driver said he was using Autopilot, according to the Culver City Fire Department, which reported the crash over Twitter at approximately 8:30?A.M. The fire truck and a California Highway Patrol vehicle were parked in the left emergency lane and carpool lane of the southbound 405, blocking off the scene of an earlier accident, with emergency lights flashing.[101]\\r\\nAutopilot may not detect stationary vehicles at highway speeds and it cannot detect some objects.[102] Other advanced driver-assistance systems have similar limitations. Raj Rajkumar, who studies autonomous driving systems at Carnegie Mellon University, believes the radars used for Autopilot are designed to detect moving objects, but are \\"not very good in detecting stationary objects\\".[103] Both NTSB and NHTSA have dispatched teams to investigate the crash.[104] Hod Lipson, director of Columbia University's Creative Machines Lab, faulted the diffusion of responsibility concept: \\"If you give the same responsibility to two people, they each will feel safe to drop the ball. Nobody has to be 100%, and that's a dangerous thing.\\"[105]\\r\\nOn March 23, 2018, a second US Autopilot fatality occurred in Mountain View, California.[106] The crash occurred just before 9:30?A.M. on southbound US 101 at the carpool lane exit for southbound Highway 85, at a concrete barrier where the left-hand offramp separates from 101. After the Model X crashed into the narrow concrete barrier, it was struck again by two following vehicles, and then it caught on fire.[107]\\r\\nBoth the NHTSA and NTSB are investigating the March 2018 crash.[108] Another driver of a Model S demonstrated that Autopilot appeared to be confused by the road stripes in April 2018. The gore ahead of the barrier is marked by diverging solid white lines (a vee-shape); the Autosteer feature of the Model S appeared to mistakenly use the left-side white line instead of the right-side white line as the lane marking for the far left lane, which would have led the Model S into the same concrete barrier had the driver not taken control.[109] Ars Technica concluded \\"that as Autopilot gets better, drivers could become increasingly complacent and pay less and less attention to the road.\\"[110]\\r\\nIn a corporate blog post, Tesla noted the impact attenuator separating the offramp from US 101 had been previously crushed and not replaced prior to the Model X crash on March 23.[106][111] The post also stated that Autopilot was engaged at the time of the crash, and the driver's hands had not been detected manipulating the steering wheel for six seconds before the crash.

The largest family is the Mantidae (\\"mantids\\"). Mantises are distributed worldwide in temperate and tropical habitats. They have triangular heads with bulging eyes supported on flexible necks. Their elongated bodies may or may not have wings, but all Mantodea have forelegs that are greatly enlarged and adapted for catching and gripping prey; their upright posture, while remaining stationary with forearms folded, has led to the common name praying mantis.\\r\\nThe closest relatives of mantises are the termites and cockroaches (Blattodea), which are all within the superorder Dictyoptera. Mantises are sometimes confused with stick insects (Phasmatodea), other elongated insects such as grasshoppers (Orthoptera), or other unrelated insects with raptorial forelegs such as mantisflies (Mantispidae). Mantises are mostly ambush predators, but a few ground-dwelling species are found actively pursuing their prey. They normally live for about a year. In cooler climates, the adults lay eggs in autumn, then die. The eggs are protected by their hard capsules and hatch in the spring. Females sometimes practice sexual cannibalism, eating their mates after copulation.\\r\\nMantises were considered to have supernatural powers by early civilizations, including Ancient Greece, Ancient Egypt, and Assyria. A cultural trope popular in cartoons imagines the female mantis as a femme fatale. Mantises are among the insects most commonly kept as pets.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nOver 2,400 species of mantis in about 430 genera are recognized.[1] They are predominantly found in tropical regions, but some live in temperate areas.[2][3] The systematics of mantises have long been disputed. Mantises, along with stick insects (Phasmatodea), were once placed in the order Orthoptera with the cockroaches (now Blattodea) and rock crawlers (now Grylloblattodea). Kristensen (1991) combined the Mantodea with the cockroaches and termites into the order Dictyoptera, suborder Mantodea.[4][5] The name mantodea is formed from the Ancient Greek words ?? (mantis) meaning \\"prophet\\", and ?Ѵ? (eidos) meaning \\"form\\" or \\"type\\". It was coined in 1838 by the German entomologist Hermann Burmeister.[6][7] The order is occasionally called the mantes, using a Latinized plural of Greek mantis. The name mantid properly refers only to members of the family Mantidae, which was, historically, the only family in the order. The other common name, praying mantis, applied to any species in the order,[8] (though in Europe mainly to Mantis religiosa), comes from the typical \\"prayer-like\\" posture with folded fore limbs.[9][10] The vernacular plural \\"mantises\\" (used in this article) was confined largely to the USA, with \\"mantids\\" predominantly used as the plural in the UK and elsewhere, until the family Mantidae was further split in 2002.[11][12]\\r\\nOne of the earliest classifications splitting an all-inclusive Mantidae into multiple families was that proposed by Beier in 1968, recognizing eight families[13], though it was not until Ehrmann's reclassification into 15 families in 2002[12] that a multiple-family classification became universally adopted. Klass, in 1997, studied the external male genitalia and postulated that the families Chaeteessidae and Metallyticidae diverged from the other families at an early date.[14] However, the Mantidae and Thespidae are still both considered polyphyletic, so the Mantodea will have to be revised.[15]\\r\\nThe earliest mantis fossils are about 135 million years old, from Siberia.[15] Fossils of the group are rare: by 2007, only about 25 fossil species were known.[15] Fossil mantises, including one from Japan with spines on the front legs as in modern mantises, have been found in Cretaceous amber.[16] Most fossils in amber are nymphs; compression fossils (in rock) include adults. Fossil mantises from the Crato Formation in Brazil include the 10?mm (0.39?in) long Santanmantis axelrodi, described in 2003; as in modern mantises, the front legs were adapted for catching prey. Well-preserved specimens yield details as small as 5 m through X-ray computed tomography.[15]\\r\\nBecause of the superficially similar raptorial forelegs, mantidflies may be confused with mantises, though they are unrelated. Their similarity is an example of convergent evolution; mantidflies do not have tegmina (leathery forewings) like mantises, their antennae are shorter and less thread-like, and the raptorial tibia is more muscular than that of a similar-sized mantis and bends back further in preparation for shooting out to grasp prey.[17]\\r\\nMantises have large, triangular heads with a beak-like snout and mandibles. They have two bulbous compound eyes, three small simple eyes, and a pair of antennae. The articulation of the neck is also remarkably flexible; some species of mantis can rotate their heads nearly 180.[10] The mantis thorax consists of a prothorax, a mesothorax, and a metathorax. In all species apart from the genus Mantoida, the prothorax, which bears the head and forelegs, is much longer than the other two thoracic segments. The prothorax is also flexibly articulated, allowing for a wide range of movements of the head and fore limbs while the remainder of the body remains more or less immobile.[18][19]\\r\\nMantises have two spiked, grasping forelegs (\\"raptorial legs\\") in which prey items are caught and held securely. In most insect legs, including the posterior four legs of a mantis, the coxa and trochanter combine as an inconspicuous base of the leg; in the raptorial legs, however, the coxa and trochanter combine to form a segment about as long as the femur, which is a spiky part of the grasping apparatus (see illustration). Located at the base of the femur is a set of discoidal spines, usually four in number, but ranging from none to as many as five depending on the species. These spines are preceded by a number of tooth-like tubercles, which, along with a similar series of tubercles along the tibia and the apical claw near its tip, give the foreleg of the mantis its grasp on its prey. The foreleg ends in a delicate tarsus used as a walking appendage, made of four or five segments and ending in a two-toed claw with no arolium.[18][20]\\r\\nMantises can be loosely categorized as being macropterous (long-winged), brachypterous (short-winged), micropterous (vestigial-winged), or apterous (wingless). If not wingless, a mantis has two sets of wings: the outer wings, or tegmina, are usually narrow and leathery. They function as camouflage and as a shield for the hind wings, which are clearer and more delicate.[18][21] The abdomen of all mantises consists of 10 tergites, with a corresponding set of nine sternites visible in males and seven visible in females. The abdomen tends to be slimmer in males than females, but ends in a pair of cerci in both sexes.[18]\\r\\nMantises have stereo vision.[22][23][24] They locate their prey by sight; their compound eyes contain up to 10,000 ommatidia. A small area at the front called the fovea has greater visual acuity than the rest of the eye, and can produce the high resolution necessary to examine potential prey. The peripheral ommatidia are concerned with perceiving motion; when a moving object is noticed, the head is rapidly rotated to bring the object into the visual field of the fovea. Further motions of the prey are then tracked by movements of the mantis's head so as to keep the image centered on the fovea.[20][25] The eyes are widely spaced and laterally situated, affording a wide binocular field of vision and precise stereoscopic vision at close range.[26] The dark spot on each eye that moves as it rotates its head is a pseudopupil. This occurs because the ommatidia that are viewed \\"head-on\\" absorb the incident light, while those to the side reflect it.[27]\\r\\nAs their hunting relies heavily on vision, mantises are primarily diurnal. Many species, however, fly at night, and then may be attracted to artificial lights. Mantises in the family Liturgusidae collected at night have been shown to be predominately males;[28] this is probably true for most mantises. Nocturnal flight is especially important to males in locating less-mobile females by detecting their pheromones. Flying at night exposes mantises to fewer bird predators than diurnal flight would. Many mantises also have an auditory thoracic organ that helps them avoid bats by detecting their echolocation calls and responding evasively.[29][30]\\r\\nMantises are generalist predators of arthropods.[2] The majority of mantises are ambush predators that only feed upon live prey within their reach. They either camouflage themselves and remain stationary, waiting for prey to approach, or stalk their prey with slow, stealthy movements.[31] Larger mantises sometimes eat smaller individuals of their own species,[32] as well as small vertebrates such as lizards, frogs, and small birds.[33][34]\\r\\nMost mantises stalk tempting prey if it strays close enough, and will go further when they are especially hungry.[35] Once within reach, mantises strike rapidly to grasp the prey with their spiked raptorial forelegs.[36] Some ground and bark species pursue their prey in a more active way. For example, members of a few genera such as the ground mantises, Entella, Ligaria, and Ligariella run over dry ground seeking prey, much as tiger beetles do.[18]\\r\\nThe fore gut of some species extends the whole length of the insect and can be used to store prey for digestion later. This may be advantageous in an insect that feeds intermittently.[37] Chinese mantises live longer, grow faster, and produce more young when they are able to eat pollen.[38]\\r\\nMantises are preyed on by vertebrates such as frogs, lizards, and birds, and by invertebrates such as spiders, large species of hornets, and ants.[39] Some hunting wasps, such as some species of Tachytes also paralyse some species of mantis to feed their young.[40] Generally, mantises protect themselves by camouflage, most species being cryptically colored to resemble foliage or other backgrounds, both to avoid predators and to better snare their prey.[41] Those that live on uniformly colored surfaces such as bare earth or tree bark are dorsoventrally flattened so as to eliminate shadows that might reveal their presence.[42] The species from different families called flower mantises are aggressive mimics: they resemble flowers convincingly enough to attract prey that come to collect pollen and nectar.[43][44][45] Some species in Africa and Australia are able to turn black after a molt towards the end of the dry season; at this time of year, bush fires occur and this coloration enables them to blend in with the fire-ravaged landscape (fire melanism).[42]\\r\\nWhen directly threatened, many mantis species stand tall and spread their forelegs, with their wings fanning out wide. The fanning of the wings makes the mantis seem larger and more threatening, with some species enhancing this effect with bright colors and patterns on their hind wings and inner surfaces of their front legs. If harassment persists, a mantis may strike with its forelegs and attempt to pinch or bite. As part of the bluffing (deimatic) threat display, some species may also produce a hissing sound by expelling air from the abdominal spiracles. Mantises lack chemical protection, so their displays are largely bluff. When flying at night, at least some mantises are able to detect the echolocation sounds produced by bats; when the frequency begins to increase rapidly, indicating an approaching bat, they stop flying horizontally and begin a descending spiral toward the safety of the ground, often preceded by an aerial loop or spin. If caught, they may slash captors with their raptorial legs.[42][46][47]\\r\\nMantises, like stick insects, show rocking behavior in which the insect makes rhythmic, repetitive side-to-side movements. Functions proposed for this behavior include the enhancement of crypsis by means of the resemblance to vegetation moving in the wind. However, the repetitive swaying movements may be most important in allowing the insects to discriminate objects from the background by their relative movement, a visual mechanism typical of animals with simpler sight systems. Rocking movements by these generally sedentary insects may replace flying or running as a source of relative motion of objects in the visual field.[48] As ants may be predators of mantises, genera such as Loxomantis, Orthodera, and Statilia, like many other arthropods, avoid attacking them. Exploiting this behavior, a variety of arthropods, including some early-instar mantises, mimic ants to evade their predators.[49]\\r\\nLeaf mimicry: Choeradodis has leaf-like fore wings and a widened green thorax.\\r\\nAdult female Iris oratoria performs a bluffing threat display, rearing back with the forelegs and wings spread and mouth opened.\\r\\nThe jeweled flower mantis, Creobroter gemmatus: the brightly colored wings are opened suddenly in a deimatic display to startle predators.\\r\\nSome mantis nymphs mimic ants to avoid predators.\\r\\nThe mating season in temperate climates typically takes place in autumn,[50][51] while in tropical areas, mating can occur at any time of the year.[51] To mate following courtship, the male usually leaps onto the female's back, clasping her thorax and wing bases with his forelegs. He then arches his abdomen to deposit and store sperm in a special chamber near the tip of the female's abdomen. The female lays between 10 and 400 eggs, depending on the species. Eggs are typically deposited in a froth mass-produced by glands in the abdomen. This froth hardens, creating a protective capsule, which together with the egg mass is called an ootheca. Depending on the species, the ootheca can be attached to a flat surface, wrapped around a plant, or even deposited in the ground. Despite the versatility and durability of the eggs, they are often preyed on, especially by several species of parasitoid wasps. In a few species, mostly ground and bark mantises in the family Tarachodidae, the mother guards the eggs.[50] The cryptic Tarachodes maurus positions herself on bark with her abdomen covering her egg capsule, ambushing passing prey and moving very little until the eggs hatch.[4] An unusual reproductive strategy is adopted by Brunner's stick mantis from the southern United States; no males have ever been found in this species, and the females breed parthenogenetically.[2] The ability to reproduce by parthenogenesis has been recorded in at least two other species, Sphodromantis viridis and Miomantis sp., although these species usually reproduce sexually.[52][53][54] In temperate climates, adults do not survive the winter and the eggs undergo a diapause, hatching in the spring.[5]\\r\\nAs in closely related insect groups in the superorder Dictyoptera, mantises go through three life stages: egg, nymph, and adult (mantises are among the hemimetabolous insects). For smaller species, the eggs may hatch in 3ÿ4 weeks as opposed to 4ÿ6 weeks for larger species. The nymphs may be colored differently from the adult, and the early stages are often mimics of ants. A mantis nymph grows bigger as it molts its exoskeleton. Molting can happen five to 10 times before the adult stage is reached, depending on the species. After the final molt, most species have wings, though some species remain wingless or brachypterous (\\"short-winged\\"), particularly in the female sex. The lifespan of a mantis depends on the species; smaller ones may live 4ÿ8 weeks, while larger species may live 4ÿ6 months.[2][19]\\r\\nMantis religiosa mating (brown male, green female)\\r\\nStagmomantis carolina laying ootheca\\r\\nRecently laid ootheca by Mantis religiosa\\r\\nNewly hatched mantises\\r\\nSexual cannibalism is common among most predatory species of mantises in captivity. It has sometimes been observed in natural populations, where about a quarter of male-female encounters result in the male being eaten by the female.[55][56][57] Around 90% of the predatory species of mantises participate in sexual cannibalism.[58] Adult males typically outnumber females at first, but their numbers may be fairly equivalent later in the adult stage,[5] possibly because females selectively eat the smaller males.[59] In Tenodera sinensis, 83% of males escape cannibalism after an encounter with a female, but since multiple matings occur, the probability of a male's being eaten increases cumulatively.[56]\\r\\nThe female may begin feeding by biting off the male's head (as they do with regular prey), and if mating has begun, the male's movements may become even more vigorous in its delivery of sperm. Early researchers thought that because copulatory movement is controlled by a ganglion in the abdomen, not the head, removal of the male's head was a reproductive strategy by females to enhance fertilization while obtaining sustenance. Later, this behavior appeared to be an artifact of intrusive laboratory observation. Whether the behavior is natural in the field or also the result of distractions caused by the human observer remains controversial. Mantises are highly visual organisms and notice any disturbance in the laboratory or field, such as bright lights or moving scientists. Chinese mantises that had been fed ad libitum (so that they were not hungry) actually displayed elaborate courtship behavior when left undisturbed. The male engages the female in a courtship dance, to change her interest from feeding to mating.[60] Under such circumstances, the female has been known to respond with a defensive deimatic display by flashing the colored eyespots on the inside of her front legs.[61]\\r\\nThe reason for sexual cannibalism has been debated; experiments show that females on low quality diets have a higher chance to engage in sexual cannibalism compared to females on high quality diets.[62] Some consider that submissive males gain a selective advantage by producing offspring. This theory is supported by a quantifiable increase in the duration of copulation among males which are cannibalized, in some cases doubling both the duration and the chance of fertilization. This is contrasted by a study where males were seen to approach hungry females with more caution, and were shown to remain mounted on hungry females for a longer time, indicating that males that actively avoid cannibalism may mate with multiple females. The same study also found that hungry females generally attracted fewer males than those that were well fed.[63] The act of dismounting after copulation is dangerous for males, for at this time, females most frequently cannibalize their mates. An increase in mounting duration appears to indicate that males wait for an opportune time to dismount a hungry female, who would be likely to cannibalize her mate.[61]\\r\\nOne of the earliest mantis references is in the ancient Chinese dictionary Erya, which gives its attributes in poetry, where it represents courage and fearlessness, and a brief description. A later text, the Jingshi Zhenglei Daguan Bencao (\\"Great History of Medical Material Annotated and Arranged by Types, Based upon the Classics and Historical Works\\") from 1108, gives accurate details of the construction of the egg packages, the development cycle, anatomy, and the function of the antennae. Although mantises are rarely mentioned in Ancient Greek sources, a female mantis in threat posture is accurately illustrated on a series of fifth-century BC silver coins, including didrachms, from Metapontum in Sicily.[64] In the 10th century AD, Byzantine era Adages, Suidas describes an insect resembling a slow-moving green locust with long front legs.[65] He translates Zenobius 2.94 with the words seriphos (maybe a mantis) and graus, an old woman, implying a thin, dried-up stick of a body.[66]\\r\\nWestern descriptions of the biology and morphology of the mantises became more accurate in the 18th century. Roesel von Rosenhof illustrated and described mantises and their cannibalistic behavior in the Insekten-Belustigungen (Insect Entertainments).[67]\\r\\nAldous Huxley made philosophical observations about the nature of death while two mantises mated in the sight of two characters in his 1962 novel Island (the species was Gongylus gongylodes). The naturalist Gerald Durrell's humorously autobiographical 1956 book My Family and Other Animals includes a four-page account of an almost evenly matched battle between a mantis and a gecko. Shortly before the fatal dnouement, Durrell narrates:\\r\\nhe [Geronimo the gecko] crashed into the mantis and made her reel, and grabbed the underside of her thorax in his jaws. Cicely [the mantis] retaliated by snapping both her front legs shut on Geronimo's hindlegs. They rustled and staggered across the ceiling and down the wall, each seeking to gain some advantage.[68]\\r\\nM. C. Escher's woodcut Dream depicts a human-sized mantis standing on a sleeping bishop.[69] The 1957 film The Deadly Mantis features a mantis as a giant monster.\\r\\nA cultural trope imagines the female mantis as a femme fatale. The idea is propagated in cartoons by Cable, Guy and Rodd, LeLievre, T. McCracken, and Mark Parisi, among others.[70][71][72][73] It ends Isabella Rossellini's short film about the life of a praying mantis in her 2008 Green Porno season for the Sundance Channel.[74][75]\\r\\nTwo martial arts separately developed in China have movements and fighting strategies based on those of the mantis.[76][77] As one of these arts was developed in northern China, and the other in southern parts of the country, the arts are nowadays referred to (both in English and Chinese) as 'Northern Praying Mantis'[78] and 'Southern Praying Mantis'.[77] Both are very popular in China, and have also been exported to the West in recent decades.[77][78][79][80]\\r\\nThe mantis was revered by the southern African Khoi and San in whose cultures man and nature were intertwined; for its praying posture, the mantis was even named Hottentotsgot (\\"god of the Khoi\\") in the Afrikaans language that had developed among the first European settlers.[81] However, at least for the San, the mantis was only one of the manifestations of a trickster-deity who could assume many other forms, such as a snake, hare or vulture.[82] Several ancient civilizations did consider the insect to have supernatural powers; for the Greeks, it had the ability to show lost travelers the way home; in the Ancient Egyptian Book of the Dead the \\"bird-fly\\" is a minor god that leads the souls of the dead to the underworld; in a list of 9th-century BC Nineveh grasshoppers (buru), the mantis is named necromancer (buru-enmeli) and soothsayer (buru-enmeli-ashaga).[67][83]\\r\\nMantises are among the insects most widely kept as pets.[84][85] Because the lifespan of a mantis is only about a year, people who want to keep mantises often breed them. In 2013 at least 31 species were kept and bred in the United Kingdom, the Netherlands, and the United States.[86] In 1996 at least 50 species were known to be kept in captivity by members of the Mantis Study Group.[87] The Independent described the \\"giant Asian praying mantis\\" as \\"part stick insect with a touch of Buddhist monk\\",[88] and stated that they needed a vivarium around 30?cm (12?in) on each side.[88] The Daily South argued that a pet insect was no weirder than a pet rat or ferret, and that while a pet mantis was unusual, it would not \\"bark, shed, [or] need shots or a litter box\\".[89]\\r\\nGardeners who prefer to avoid pesticides may encourage mantises in the hope of controlling insect pests.[90] However, mantises do not have key attributes of biological pest control agents; they do not specialize in a single pest insect, and do not multiply rapidly in response to an increase in such a prey species, but are general predators.[90] They eat whatever they can catch, including both harmful and beneficial insects.[89] They therefore have \\"negligible value\\" in biological control.[90]\\r\\nTwo species, the Chinese mantis and the European mantis, were deliberately introduced to North America in the hope that they would serve as pest controls for agriculture; they have spread widely in both the United States and Canada.[91]\\r\\nA prototype robot inspired by the forelegs of the praying mantis has front legs that allow the robot to walk, climb steps, and grasp objects. The multi-jointed leg provides dexterity via a rotatable joint. Future models may include a more spiked foreleg to improve the grip and ability to support more weight.[92]","input":"What are the predators of the praying mantis?"},{"output":"March 23, 2017","context":"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nNaruto: Shippuden is an anime series adapted from Part II of Masashi Kishimoto's manga series, with exactly 500 episodes.

The sections are centered on the main east/west roads that pass through the county.\\r\\nSouth Santa Rosa County comprises the area from Holley and Navarre in the east to Gulf Breeze at the western end of the Gulf Breeze Peninsula (Fairpoint Peninsula), and along U.S. Highway 98. A section of Santa Rosa Island, containing the unincorporated community of Navarre Beach, is also part of South Santa Rosa County. Major bodies of water including Santa Rosa Sound, Pensacola Bay and East Bay strongly influence the housing and life style of citizens in the southern part of the county.

A typical work week is generally 40 hours a week with a Saturday-Sunday weekend. Public holidays with paid time off is generally defined to occur on a day that is within the employee's work week. When a holiday occurs on Saturday or Sunday, that holiday is shifted to either Friday or Monday. Most employers follow a holiday schedule similar to the federal holidays of the United States, with exceptions or additions. The federal holiday schedule mainly benefits employees of government and government regulated businesses. However, this sector only comprises 15% of the working population. At the discretion of the employer, other non-federal holidays such as Christmas Eve and the Day after Thanksgiving are common additions to the list of paid holidays while Columbus Day and Veterans Day are common omissions. Besides paid holidays are festival and food holidays that also have wide acceptance based on sales of goods and services that are typically associated with that holiday. Halloween and Valentine's Day are such examples of widely celebrated uncompensated holidays.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nPublic holidays had their origins from established federal holidays that were enacted by Congress. They were typically observed on days that have significance for various sectors of American society and are observed at all levels of society including government, the private sector, and are typically derived from the history, religion and the cultures of the U.S. demographics and have changed over time. Observances of holidays are most commonly observed with paid time off, however, many holiday celebrations are done with festivities without time off. Some are observed with community work depending on the meaning of the holiday. They are however not mandated by any government, agencies, whether it be federal, state, or local governments. There are no national holidays on which all businesses are closed by law. Federal holidays are only established for certain federally chartered and regulated businesses (such as federal banks), and for Washington, D.C. All other public holidays are created by the States; most states also allow local jurisdictions (cities, villages, etc.) to establish their own local holidays. As a result, holidays have not historically been governed at the federal level and federal law does not govern business opening. Some states restrict some business activities on some holidays.[1] Business closures are mandated on some holidays in some states for certain kinds of businesses by Blue Laws. For example, some businesses cannot open on Thanksgiving Day in some New England states if the businesses operated on more than 5000 square feet of space. The most notable businesses to close on such occasions are car dealerships and establishments selling alcohol.\\r\\nAs of 2012[update], there were eleven federal holidays in the United States, ten annual holidays and one quadrennial holiday (Inauguration Day).[2] Pursuant to the Uniform Monday Holiday Act of 1968 (effective 1971), official holidays are observed on a Monday, except for New Year's Day, Independence Day, Veterans Day, Thanksgiving, and Christmas.[3]\\r\\nWhile all current federal holidays have also been made public holidays in all 50 states for federal organizations, each state is not bound to observe the holidays on the same dates as the federal holidays. Many states also have additional holidays that are not observed by the U.S. federal government.[4] Many businesses likewise observe certain holidays as well, which are also not mandated by any government agency. A list of \\"recommended diversity holidays\\" recognizes many cultures that range from Christianity to Islam, as well as racial diversity where various ethnic holidays such as St. Patrick's Day, Kwanzaa, Diwali, Mardi Gras, and Cinco de Mayo are celebrated by individuals in the workplace, as a matter of best practice.[5] In light of recent race issues in the United States, many municipalities both at the city and state levels have begun celebrating Malcolm X Day and Rosa Parks Day in addition to Martin Luther King, Jr. Day to embrace the mostly disenfranchised African American community in the form of festivals and parades if not done as a legal public holiday. Illinois and Berkeley, California are two places where Malcolm X is honored with a legal holiday with offices closed whereas Missouri honored Rosa Parks on her birthday.[6][7] Today, the United States is the 85th most ethnically diverse country in the world. While the popularity of each public holiday cannot easily be measured, the holiday with the highest greeting card sales is Christmas.[8] Major retail establishments such as malls, shopping centers and most retail stores close only on Thanksgiving and Christmas and some on Easter Sunday as well, but remain open on all other holidays (early closing on Christmas Eve and New Year's Eve, and sometimes on other major holidays).[9] Virtually all companies observe and close on the major holidays (New Year's Day, Memorial Day, Independence Day, Labor Day, Thanksgiving, and Christmas). Some non-retail business close on the day after Thanksgiving, while some (such as federal banks and post offices) are not allowed to close on the day after Thanksgiving. Some smaller businesses normally open on Sunday will close on Easter Sunday, if it is their experience they will have very few customers that day.[10]\\r\\n\\r\\n The labor force in the United States comprises about 62% (as of 2014) of the general population.[46] In the United States, 97% of the private sector businesses determine what days this sector of the population gets paid time off, according to a study by the Society for Human Resource Management. The following holidays are observed by the majority of the U.S. businesses with paid time off:\\r\\n\\r\\nThis list of holidays is based off the official list of Federal Holidays by Year from the U.S. Government. The holidays however are at the discretion of employers whose statistics are measured by the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Another list from the Society for Human Resource Management shows actual percentages of employers offering paid time off for each holiday. The term \\"major holiday\\" (bolded) coincides for those holidays that 90% or more of employers offered paid time off.[48]\\r\\n* List of Federal Holidays by Year from the U.S. Government[63] (see Office of Personnel Management)\\r\\n** Additional holidays referenced by the Society for Human Resource Management: Good Friday 26%, Easter Monday 6%, Yom Kippur 7%, Day before Thanksgiving 3ÿ8%, Day after Thanksgiving 69ÿ75%, Day before Christmas Eve 33%, Christmas Eve 78ÿ79%, Day after Christmas 40ÿ64%, Day before New Years Eve 25ÿ71% depending if it falls on a weekend, New Years Eve 71%, Passover 3%, Hanukkah 1%, Ramadan 1%, Ash Wednesday 1%, Diwali 1%, Eid al-Adha 1%, Vietnamese New Year <1%, Chinese New Year <1%\\r\\nAn academic year typically spans from early fall to early summer, with two or three months of summer vacation marking the end of year. K-12 public schools generally observe local, state, and federal holidays, plus additional days off around Thanksgiving, the period from before Christmas until after New Year's Day, a spring break (usually a week in April) and sometimes a winter break (a week in February or March). Two or three days per year are sometimes devoted to professional development for teachers, and students have the day off.\\r\\nMost colleges and universities divide the school year into two semesters. The fall semester often begins the day after Labor Day in early September and runs until mid-December. The spring semester typically starts in the middle or end of January and runs until May. Winter and summer classes might be offered in January and MayÿAugust. Major federal, state, and local holidays are often observed, including the day after and usually before Thanksgiving. Spring break is usually a week in March or early April, and in college party culture traditionally involves a warm-weather trip.\\r\\nUnscheduled weather-related cancellations and emergency cancellations can also affect school calendars.\\r\\nWhen taking summer school or summer camp schedules into account, the Independence Day holiday on July?4 is usually a scheduled holiday observance for which the summer program closes.\\r\\nThe federal government sector labor force consisted of about 2,729,000 (as of 2014) of the total labor force of 150,539,900, which is roughly about 1.8% of the total labor force or about 1.1% of the total population. In addition, state and local governments consist of another 19,134,000 bringing the U.S. total government sector employees to about 15% of the total labor force.[64] This sector of the population is entitled to paid time off designated as Federal holidays by Congress in Title V of the United States Code (5 U.S.C.??6103). Both federal and state government employees generally observe the same federal holidays.\\r\\nU.S. banks generally observe the federal holidays because of their reliance on the U.S. Federal Reserve for certain activities such as wire transfers and Automated Clearing House (ACH) transactions.[65] For example, JP Morgan Chase observes all federal holidays except Columbus Day,[66] while U.S. Bank observes all of them.[67]\\r\\nThe New York Stock Exchange also closely follows the federal holidays except for Columbus Day. However, the agency also has extra holidays on the day before Independence Day and Good Friday.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn general, most state governments observe the same holidays that the federal government observes. However, while that is true for most states, every state includes and omits holidays to fit the culture relevant to its population.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe U.S. state of California has separate definitions of \\"state holidays\\" which are different from \\"legal holidays\\".\\r\\nLincoln's Birthday (February 12) was removed from California's education holiday calendar in 2009[78]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nFlorida's laws separately defines \\"paid holidays\\" versus \\"legal holidays\\", which does not have any obligation to include as \\"paid holidays\\".\\r\\nFlorida's laws separate the definitions between paid versus legal holidays.

The statutes require the public schools to include instruction relating to the holidays. In this list of holidays, all schools remain open.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhile most federal holidays are observed at the state level, some of these holidays are observed with different names, are observed on different days, or completely not observed in some states of the United States. ^ a.

However, the First Amendment to the United States Constitution provides that \\"Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof ....\\" and Article VI specifies that \\"no religious Test shall ever be required as a Qualification to any Office or public Trust under the United States.\\" As a result, various religious faiths have flourished, as well as perished, in the United States. A majority of Americans report that religion plays a \\"very important\\" role in their lives, a proportion unique among developed nations.[138]\\r\\nThe majority of Americans (73ÿ80%) identify themselves as Christians and about 15ÿ20% have no religious affiliation.[139] According to the American Religious Identification Survey (ARIS) (2008) 76% of the American adult population identified themselves as Christians, with 51% professing attendance at a variety of churches that could be considered Protestant or unaffiliated, and 25% professing Catholic beliefs.[140] The same survey says that other religions (including, for example, Judaism, Buddhism, Islam, and Hinduism) collectively make up about 4% of the adult population, another 15% of the adult population claim no religious affiliation, and 5.2% said they did not know, or they refused to reply. According to a 2012 survey by the Pew forum, 36 percent of Americans state that they attend services nearly every week or more.[141]\\r\\nThe following memorialize the historic Confederate States of America from the American Civil War:\\r\\nAccording to the National Institutes of Health, about 86% of the U.S. population over 18 drinks alcohol recreationally or socially.[144] In the United States, the holidays that are considered the most \\"festive\\" are generally regarded as some of the \\"most drunken holidays.\\" Celebrations usually revolve around barbecues and beer. Although many of these holiday lack any official status, these holidays are generally observed by the drinking culture for the fact that these holidays revolve around drinking. One measurement of the popularity of these holidays can be measured by the amount of alcohol purchased for the occasion. One particular survey names New Years Eve as the holiday for which the most alcohol is consumed based on sales.[145] While many holidays are listed, some are generally notable for their drinking requirement while others are known for abstinence.[146]\\r\\nAfrican Americans make up about 12% of the U.S. population. While some customs have come from abroad, many of the customs were developed inside the United States. Kwanzaa, for example, is a custom has greatly influenced American culture originating from the \\"turbulent 60's\\" when race relations in the United States was at its lowest.[149] Most of the newer holidays revolve around a particular civil rights activist and have recently gained attention from city and state level governments. At the federal level, only Martin Luther King, Jr. was honored.\\r\\nWith 73% of the U.S. population identifying themselves as Christian, many holidays from the liturgical calendar are observed by this segment of the population. With 94% of businesses including federal, state, and local governments closing on Christmas, arguably the most significant holiday of the Christian religion, many stores are also closed on Christmas, but with a relatively small exception. For example, convenience stores operating on less than 5,000 square feet of space such as 7-Eleven and CVS Pharmacy can remain open.[156] A reference in A Christmas Story shows a Chinese restaurant being the only establishment open on Christmas.\\r\\nSome private businesses and certain other institutions are closed on Good Friday.[157] The financial market and stock market is closed on Good Friday.[158] Most retail stores remain open although some might close early. Public schools and most universities are closed on Good Friday, either as a holiday of its own, or part of spring break. The postal service operates, and banks regulated by the federal government do not close for Good Friday.[2]\\r\\nMany companies, including banks, malls, shopping centers and most private retail stores that normally open on Sundays are closed on Easter.[10]\\r\\nMany Americans decorate hard-boiled eggs and give baskets of candy, fruit, toys and so on, especially to children; but gifts of age-appropriate Easter baskets for the elderly, the infirm and the needy are increasingly popular. An annual Easter Egg Roll has been held at the White House South Lawn for young children on Easter Monday since President Hayes started the tradition in 1878.[174] Not a federal holiday due to the fact that it always falls on a Sunday, which is a non-working day for federal and state employees. Many companies that are normally open on Sunday close for Easter.\\r\\nAccording to some sources, the Hindu holidays of Diwali and Holi are commonly celebrated as a \\"mainstream\\" holiday throughout the United States, not only by Indian Americans or peoples of Indian descent. Many firms that hire a people from India will even go as far as observing the holidays with a celebration within the company or even approving it as a paid day off.[175][176] Holi, the \\"festival of colors\\" has inspired a Broadway musical based on this festival.[177] New York City Council has voted on a resolution that may make Diwali and Holi a legal holiday in Resolution 1863-2013.[178] As of August 2013, the resolution has passed and the holidays are now officially legal holidays in New York City.[179] CNN reported that the Diwali holiday is shown in American pop culture through an episode of The Office.[180][181]\\r\\nAccording to various sources, the three most commonly celebrated Jewish holidays are Rosh Hashanah, Yom Kippur and Hanukkah.[189] Passover and Yom Kippur in addition to Rosh Hashannah and Hanukkah are recognized as an optional state level holiday in the U.S. state of Texas[190][191] All Jewish holidays start the night before, as that is when the Jewish day begins.\\r\\nThis day marks the end of the Ten Days of Penitence that began with Rosh Hashanah. It is described in Leviticus as a \\"Sabbath of rest,\\" and synagogue services begin the preceding sundown, resume the following morning, and continue to sundown. Orthodox and many Conservative Jews fast on Yom Kippur. In regions with large Jewish populations, schools and universities may close on Yom Kippur.\\r\\nAccording to various sources, the major holidays of Ramadan, Eid al-Fitr, and Eid al-Adha have been recognized in the United States. Awareness of these holidays can be found in calendars published by major calendar manufacturers.[192][193][194] According to Al-Jazeera, schools in the U.S. states of New York and Michigan (mainly Dearborn) may begin to close in observance of all Muslim holidays.[195]\\r\\nIn addition to the federal/national holidays, many religious, ethnic, and other traditional holidays populate the calendar, as well as observances proclaimed by officials and lighter celebrations. These are rarely observed by businesses as holidays (Except for Easter and most often also on Good Friday);[10] indeed, many are viewed as opportunities for commercial promotion. Because of this commercialization, some critics apply the deprecatory term Hallmark holiday to such days, after the Hallmark greeting card company.\\r\\n(federal) = federal holidays, (state) = state holidays, (religious) = religious holidays, (week) = weeklong holidays, (month) = monthlong holidays, (36) = Title 36 Observances and Ceremonies\\r\\nBold indicates major holidays commonly celebrated in the United States, which often represent the major celebrations of the month.","input":"What is the most popular holiday in america?"},{"output":"takes most cyclists 10 to 14 days","context":"\\r\\n\\r\\nLand's End to John o' Groats is the traversal of the whole length of the island of Great Britain between two extremities, in the southwest and northeast.

Traditionally considered to be a walk, the route is now traversed in a number of ways, with cycling and multi-modal expeditions being particularly popular in recent years.\\r\\n\\r\\nMost trips are done by individuals or small groups for personal fulfilment. Some expeditions are organised as charity fundraisers, sometimes involving celebrities: examples include cricketer Ian Botham's 1985 walk and athlete Jane Tomlinson in 2003. In recent history the route has been used as a rite of passage by cyclists taking on the most iconic cycling challenge in Britain.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe first recorded end-to-end walk (actually from John o' Groats to Land's End) was undertaken by the brothers John and Robert Naylor in 1871.[4]  Since then the walk has been undertaken many times, more particularly since 1960, after a well-publicised road walk by Dr Barbara Moore.  In 1960 the entrepreneur Billy Butlin organised a road walking race, which gave further impetus to the idea.\\r\\n\\r\\nSince the 1960s, walkers have mostly chosen off-road routes, using the growing network of long-distance footpaths.  A classic account is from 1966 by the travel writer John Hillaby.[5] Off-road walkers usually complete the journey in two to three months. There is a considerable choice of off-road routes, but all are much longer than the shortest road distance, usually 1,200 miles (1,900?km) or more.  The walk is still undertaken by road walkers, often doing the walk, like Sir Ian Botham, for charity, or as a \\"challenge walk\\".  They typically take a month or even less.\\r\\n\\r\\nSome walkers aim to complete the route piecemeal, perhaps over several years, to achieve the walk within the time constraints of a working life and before the possible health problems of retirement.[6]\\r\\n\\r\\nThere is no continuous long-distance path from Land's End to John o' Groats.  There are long-distance paths for substantial sections of the route, and where they do not exist walkers connect them by rights of way and minor roads. Most walkers broadly follow these routes:[7]\\r\\n\\r\\nThere are several annual mass participation cycle rides that go from Land's End to John o' Groats, the biggest of which is the Deloitte Ride Across Britain,[8] run by Threshold Sports. The Ride Across Britain takes over 800 riders the full length of Britain, taking nine days and covering 969 miles (1,559?km), with each rider covering an average of 107 miles (172?km) per day.

He completed the run in just over 17 days.[22]\\r\\n\\r\\nFred Hicks was an early record holder. He ran the journey between the 20th and 30th of May, 1977 in 10 days 3 hours and 30 minutes. He ran this for charity, not aiming to set any records, and it was only later, when he was approached by the Road Running association asking if they could pursue the record with Guinness, that he became aware he had set a new record.[citation needed]\\r\\n\\r\\nOn 12 July 2009 British ultramarathon runner Kevin Carr successfully completed the first ever attempt to run the route off-road, becoming the first athlete to run the length of the UK as a fell/trail run. Like Driver, Carr ran unsupported and soloa format commonly known amongst fell runners as a mountain marathon. Carr ran the challenge as part of an event organised by Benumber1, an event that saw several top-level British athletes (mainly Olympians) completing the challenge. The event was designed to encourage school students to participate in sport and to realise the benefits of a healthy lifestyle, whilst raising funds for the British Heart Foundation. The run covered 1,254 miles (2,018?km) over footpaths, bridleways, canal paths, river banks, national trails, fields, moorland and mountains. Over 80% of the route was off-road, the route resorting to tarmac only when necessary to link two trails, or where a trail passed through a village/town. The run took 6 weeks 3 days and 17 hours (including three rest days). Factoring in the rest days, this run called for an average effort of just under 30 miles (50?km) a day, every day, for more than six weeks.[citation needed]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn July 2011, a team of runners from Calday Grange Grammar School, Wirral completed a relay from Land's End to John o' Groats, becoming the first school to do so.[23] They raised S200,000[24] for Alder Hey Children's Hospital, Liverpool.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn mid summer of 2011 Anthony Band from Surrey ran 1000 miles barefoot, all in aid for Help for heroes. Band took 29 days, running on average 36 miles per day.[citation needed]\\r\\n\\r\\nOn 3 August 2014, Marie-Claire Oziem became the first female runner to complete the distance unsupported and solo.[25] She pushed all her provisions in a pram and camped along the way. Her route consisted of both on and off-road sections. Oziem ran for the charity Mind, based in Taunton for its project Go Wild, Stay Well, which aims to support those with mental illness through the use of various green therapy schemes. She started her run on 23 June and finished on 3 August 2014, regularly running distances of over 32 miles daily.[better?source?needed]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe journey with a horse is generally completed north to south, starting in April to avoid the midges in the Highlands but also to benefit from warmer weather.[citation needed]\\r\\n\\r\\nEvelyn Burnaby was the younger brother of the famous English Long Rider Colonel Frederick Burnaby. Whereas the elder brother was famous for having ridden across Central Asia and the Ottoman Empire, Evelyn decided to keep his equestrian adventures closer to home. He set off in 1892 to ride from Lands End, Cornwall to John o Groats, Scotland. Evelyns journey was soon serialised in a popular publication, The Country Gentleman, and was published in book form the following year as A Ride from Land's End to John O' Groats.[26]\\r\\n\\r\\nCommunist John Richard Penistan rode his horse, Billy-a-Journey from Lands End to John o Groats in 1948 (or 1930[27]) taking him 56 days.

In 1911, Ivan B. Hart-Davies became the holder of the final Land's End to John o' Groats record for solo motorcycles. Riding his 3.5?hp single-speed Triumph, he covered the 886 miles (1,426?km) in 29 hours, 12 minutes. As his average speed exceeded the then-maximum of 20?mph, further official record attempts were banned by the A. C. U.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Motor Cycling Club (which had been running the London to Land's End Trial since 1908, still held today, at least in name) put on an annual Land's End to John o' Groats Run from 1923 to 1928 which included cars as well as motorcycles.  These events were also known as the End to End. In 2006, BBC Television ran a series of three programmes called The Lost World of Friese-Greene covering Claude Friese-Greene's 1920s-era road trip from Land's End to John o' Groats.  The trip had originally been filmed using the Biocolour process, developed by Claude's father William Friese-Greene and the film had degraded. The original print of Claude's film was subjected to computer enhancement by the British Film Institute to remove the flickering problem inherent in the Biocolour process.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1984, Neal Champion covered 884 miles (1,423?km) from John o' Groats to Land's End in 11 hours, 14 minutes, on a Kawasaki GPZ750 Turbo.[33]\\r\\nin 1984, Christian Conzendorf-Mattner, covered the route from Land's End to John o' Groatsthere and back non-stop other than for fuelin 21 hours 22 mins in a 1941 BMW 327.\\r\\nThe record run was monitored by a team of journalists from a motoring magazine and is the current record for prewar classic cars end to end, non-stop, one driver.

The route takes a long 1,400-mile (2,300?km) route, using remote upland roads of the west of England, Wales (during the night), the Pennines and Scotland.  Medals are awarded in gold, silver and bronze categories.[35]\\r\\n\\r\\nOn 15ÿ16 April 1997, Hugh Edeleanu drove the route in a JCB excavator in a time of 22 hours, 10 minutes and 30 seconds.[36]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn June 2001, Wayne Booth became the first person to do the journey by motorcycle without stopping; the 37-year-old completed the historic trip in 14 hours and 52 minutes, averaging 57?mph, on a modified 1,000cc Honda Varedero, complete with additional 74-litre petrol tank. The meticulously researched route of 854 miles (1,374?km) passed through just two sets of traffic lights and was completed within all highway regulations, law and speed limits.[37][38] Booth and the dozen strong support team raised over S1,000 for The National Childbirth Trust and Macmillan Cancer Relief.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn 22 May 2011, Kevin Sharpe and David Peilow completed the first end-to-end run from John o' Groats to Land's End in an electric car over two days, using only charging stations available to the general public, in a Tesla Roadster sports car.[39]\\r\\n\\r\\nOn 7 August 2011, Darren Whitehead & Tony Dwight travelled 1,071 miles (1,724?km) from John o' Groats to Land's End (including crossing the Welsh border) in 5 days using two ride-on Wheel Horse lawn mowers.[40] They also raised money for charity during the trip which was named The Lawn Way Down.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn 30 November 2013, Lucy Grogan, travelling on a BMW GS R1200 motorbike, and her father Martin Grogan, travelling in a Mini Cooper Works, travelled from Land's End to John o' Groats in 19 hours, leaving Land's End at 4:30am and arriving at John o' Groats at 11:30pm same day.

Ligaments join one bone to another bone, while tendons connect muscle to bone.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nHistologically, tendons consist of dense regular connective tissue fascicles encased in dense irregular connective tissue sheaths. Normal healthy tendons are composed mostly of parallel arrays of collagen fibers closely packed together. They are anchored to bone by Sharpey's fibres. The dry mass of normal tendons, which makes up about 30% of their total mass, is composed of about 86% collagen, 2% elastin, 1ÿ5% proteoglycans, and 0.2% inorganic components such as copper, manganese, and calcium.[1][2] The collagen portion is made up of 97ÿ98% type I collagen, with small amounts of other types of collagen. These include type II collagen in the cartilaginous zones, type III collagen in the reticulin fibres of the vascular walls, type IX collagen, type IV collagen in the basement membranes of the capillaries, type V collagen in the vascular walls, and type X collagen in the mineralized fibrocartilage near the interface with the bone.[1][3]\\r\\nCollagen fibres coalesce into macroaggregates. After secretion from the cell, the terminal peptides are cleaved by procollagen N- and C-proteinases, and the tropocollagen molecules spontaneously assemble into insoluble fibrils. A collagen molecule is about 300?nm long and 1ÿ2?nm wide, and the diameter of the fibrils that are formed can range from 50ÿ500?nm. In tendons, the fibrils then assemble further to form fascicles, which are about 10?mm in length with a diameter of 50ÿ300 m, and finally into a tendon fibre with a diameter of 100ÿ500 m.[4] Fascicles are bound by the endotendineum, which is a delicate loose connective tissue containing thin collagen fibrils.[5][6] and elastic fibres.[7] Groups of fascicles are bounded by the epitenon. Filling the interstitia within the fascia where the tendon is located is the paratenon a fatty areolar tissue.[8]\\r\\nThe collagen in tendons are held together with proteoglycan components including decorin and, in compressed regions of tendon, aggrecan, which are capable of binding to the collagen fibrils at specific locations.[9] The proteoglycans are interwoven with the collagen fibrils?ÿ  their glycosaminoglycan (GAG) side chains have multiple interactions with the surface of the fibrils?ÿ  showing that the proteoglycans are important structurally in the interconnection of the fibrils.[10] The major GAG components of the tendon are dermatan sulfate and chondroitin sulfate, which associate with collagen and are involved in the fibril assembly process during tendon development. Dermatan sulfate is thought to be responsible for forming associations between fibrils, while chondroitin sulfate is thought to be more involved with occupying volume between the fibrils to keep them separated and help withstand deformation.[11] The dermatan sulfate side chains of decorin aggregate in solution, and this behavior can assist with the assembly of the collagen fibrils. When decorin molecules are bound to a collagen fibril, their dermatan sulfate chains may extend and associate with other dermatan sulfate chains on decorin that is bound to separate fibrils, therefore creating interfibrillar bridges and eventually causing parallel alignment of the fibrils.[12]\\r\\nThe tenocytes produce the collagen molecules, which aggregate end-to-end and side-to-side to produce collagen fibrils. Fibril bundles are organized to form fibres with the elongated tenocytes closely packed between them. There is a three-dimensional network of cell processes associated with collagen in the tendon. The cells communicate with each other through gap junctions, and this signalling gives them the ability to detect and respond to mechanical loading.[13]\\r\\nBlood vessels may be visualized within the endotendon running parallel to collagen fibres, with occasional branching transverse anastomoses.\\r\\nThe internal tendon bulk is thought to contain no nerve fibres, but the epitenon and paratenon contain nerve endings, while Golgi tendon organs are present at the junction between tendon and muscle.\\r\\nTendon length varies in all major groups and from person to person. Tendon length is, in practice, the deciding factor regarding actual and potential muscle size. For example, all other relevant biological factors being equal, a man with a shorter tendons and a longer biceps muscle will have greater potential for muscle mass than a man with a longer tendon and a shorter muscle. Successful bodybuilders will generally have shorter tendons. Conversely, in sports requiring athletes to excel in actions such as running or jumping, it is beneficial to have longer than average Achilles tendon and a shorter calf muscle.[14]\\r\\nTendon length is determined by genetic predisposition, and has not been shown to either increase or decrease in response to environment, unlike muscles, which can be shortened by trauma, use imbalances and a lack of recovery and stretching.[15]\\r\\nTraditionally, tendons have been considered to be a mechanism by which muscles connect to bone, functioning to transmit forces. This connection allows tendons to passively modulate forces during locomotion, providing additional stability with no active work. However, over the past two decades, much research focused on the elastic properties of some tendons and their ability to function as springs. Not all tendons are required to perform the same functional role, with some predominantly positioning limbs, such as the fingers when writing (positional tendons) and others acting as springs to make locomotion more efficient (energy storing tendons).[16] Energy storing tendons can store and recover energy at high efficiency. For example, during a human stride, the Achilles tendon stretches as the ankle joint dorsiflexes. During the last portion of the stride, as the foot plantar-flexes (pointing the toes down), the stored elastic energy is released. Furthermore, because the tendon stretches, the muscle is able to function with less or even no change in length, allowing the muscle to generate greater force.\\r\\nThe mechanical properties of the tendon are dependent on the collagen fiber diameter and orientation. The collagen fibrils are parallel to each other and closely packed, but show a wave-like appearance due to planar undulations, or crimps, on a scale of several micrometers.[17] In tendons, the collagen fibres have some flexibility due to the absence of hydroxyproline and proline residues at specific locations in the amino acid sequence, which allows the formation of other conformations such as bends or internal loops in the triple helix and results in the development of crimps.[18] The crimps in the collagen fibrils allow the tendons to have some flexibility as well as a low compressive stiffness. In addition, because the tendon is a multi-stranded structure made up of many partially independent fibrils and fascicles, it does not behave as a single rod, and this property also contributes to its flexibility.[19]\\r\\nThe proteoglycan components of tendons also are important to the mechanical properties. While the collagen fibrils allow tendons to resist tensile stress, the proteoglycans allow them to resist compressive stress. These molecules are very hydrophilic, meaning that they can absorb a large amount of water and therefore have a high swelling ratio. Since they are noncovalently bound to the fibrils, they may reversibly associate and disassociate so that the bridges between fibrils can be broken and reformed. This process may be involved in allowing the fibril to elongate and decrease in diameter under tension.[20] However, the proteoglycans may also have a role in the tensile properties of tendon. The structure of tendon is effectively a fibre composite material, built as a series of hierarchical levels. At each level of the hierarchy, the collagen units are bound together by either collagen crosslinks, or the proteoglycans, to create a structure highly resistant to tensile load.[21] The elongation and the strain of the collagen fibrils alone have been shown to be much lower than the total elongation and strain of the entire tendon under the same amount of stress, demonstrating that the proteoglycan-rich matrix must also undergo deformation, and stiffening of the matrix occurs at high strain rates.[22] This deformation of the non-collagenous matrix occurs at all levels of the tendon hierarchy, and by modulating the organisation and structure of this matrix, the different mechanical properties required by different tendons can be achieved.[23] Energy storing tendons have been shown to utilise significant amounts of sliding between fascicles to enable the high strain characteristics they require, whilst positional tendons rely more heavily on sliding between collagen fibres and fibrils.[24] However, recent data suggests that energy storing tendons may also contain fascicles which are twisted, or helical, in nature - an arrangement that would be highly beneficial for providing the spring-like behaviour required in these tendons.[25]\\r\\nTendons are viscoelastic structures, which means they exhibit both elastic and viscous behaviour. When stretched, tendons exhibit typical \\"soft tissue\\" behavior. The force-extension, or stress-strain curve starts with a very low stiffness region, as the crimp structure straightens and the collagen fibres align suggesting negative Poisson's ratio in the fibres of the tendon.[26] More recently, tests carried out in vivo (through MRI) and ex vivo (through mechanical testing of various cadaveric tendon tissue) have shown that healthy tendons are highly anisotropic and exhibit a negative Poisson's ratio (auxetic) in some planes when stretched up to 2% along their length, i.e. within their normal range of motion.[27] After this 'toe' region, the structure becomes significantly stiffer, and has a linear stress-strain curve until it begins to fail. The mechanical properties of tendons vary widely, as they are matched to the functional requirements of the tendon. The energy storing tendons tend to be more elastic, or less stiff, so they can more easily store energy, whilst the stiffer positional tendons tend to be a little more viscoelastic, and less elastic, so they can provide finer control of movement. A typical energy storing tendon will fail at around 12-15% strain, and a stress in the region of 100-150 MPa, although some tendons are notably more extensible than this, for example the superficial digital flexor in the horse, which stretches in excess of 20% when galloping.[28] Positional tendons can fail at strains as low as 6-8%, but can have moduli in the region of 700-1000 MPa.[29]\\r\\nSeveral studies have demonstrated that tendons respond to changes in mechanical loading with growth and remodeling processes, much like bones. In particular, a study showed that disuse of the Achilles tendon in rats resulted in a decrease in the average thickness of the collagen fiber bundles comprising the tendon.[30] In humans, an experiment in which people were subjected to a simulated micro-gravity environment found that tendon stiffness decreased significantly, even when subjects were required to perform restiveness exercises.[31] These effects have implications in areas ranging from treatment of bedridden patients to the design of more effective exercises for astronauts.\\r\\nThe tendons in the foot are highly complex and intricate. Therefore, the healing process for a broken tendon is long and painful. Most people who do not receive medical attention within the first 48 hours of the injury will suffer from severe swelling, pain, and a burning sensation where the injury occurred.\\r\\nIt was believed that tendons could not undergo matrix turnover and that tenocytes were not capable of repair. However, it has since been shown that, throughout the lifetime of a person, tenocytes in the tendon actively synthesize matrix components as well as enzymes such as matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) can degrade the matrix.[32] Tendons are capable of healing and recovering from injuries in a process that is controlled by the tenocytes and their surrounding extracellular matrix.\\r\\nThe three main stages of tendon healing are inflammation, repair or proliferation, and remodeling, which can be further divided into consolidation and maturation. These stages can overlap with each other. In the first stage, inflammatory cells such as neutrophils are recruited to the injury site, along with erythrocytes. Monocytes and macrophages are recruited within the first 24 hours, and phagocytosis of necrotic materials at the injury site occurs. After the release of vasoactive and chemotactic factors, angiogenesis and the proliferation of tenocytes are initiated. Tenocytes then move into the site and start to synthesize collagen III.[33][34] After a few days, the repair or proliferation stage begins. In this stage, the tenocytes are involved in the synthesis of large amounts of collagen and proteoglycans at the site of injury, and the levels of GAG and water are high.[35] After about six weeks, the remodeling stage begins. The first part of this stage is consolidation, which lasts from about six to ten weeks after the injury. During this time, the synthesis of collagen and GAGs is decreased, and the cellularity is also decreased as the tissue becomes more fibrous as a result of increased production of collagen I and the fibrils become aligned in the direction of mechanical stress.[34] The final maturation stage occurs after ten weeks, and during this time there is an increase in crosslinking of the collagen fibrils, which causes the tissue to become stiffer. Gradually, over about one year, the tissue will turn from fibrous to scar-like.[35]\\r\\nMatrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) have a very important role in the degradation and remodeling of the ECM during the healing process after a tendon injury. Certain MMPs including MMP-1, MMP-2, MMP-8, MMP-13, and MMP-14 have collagenase activity, meaning that, unlike many other enzymes, they are capable of degrading collagen I fibrils. The degradation of the collagen fibrils by MMP-1 along with the presence of denatured collagen are factors that are believed to cause weakening of the tendon ECM and an increase in the potential for another rupture to occur.[36] In response to repeated mechanical loading or injury, cytokines may be released by tenocytes and can induce the release of MMPs, causing degradation of the ECM and leading to recurring injury and chronic tendinopathies.[34]\\r\\nA variety of other molecules are involved in tendon repair and regeneration. There are five growth factors that have been shown to be significantly upregulated and active during tendon healing: insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-I), platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF), vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF), and transforming growth factor beta (TGF-).[35] These growth factors all have different roles during the healing process. IGF-1 increases collagen and proteoglycan production during the first stage of inflammation, and PDGF is also present during the early stages after injury and promotes the synthesis of other growth factors along with the synthesis of DNA and the proliferation of tendon cells.[35] The three isoforms of TGF- (TGF-1, TGF-2, TGF-3) are known to play a role in wound healing and scar formation.[37] VEGF is well known to promote angiogenesis and to induce endothelial cell proliferation and migration, and VEGF mRNA has been shown to be expressed at the site of tendon injuries along with collagen I mRNA.[38] Bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs) are a subgroup of TGF- superfamily that can induce bone and cartilage formation as well as tissue differentiation, and BMP-12 specifically has been shown to influence formation and differentiation of tendon tissue and to promote fibrogenesis.\\r\\nIn animal models, extensive studies have been conducted to investigate the effects of mechanical strain in the form of activity level on tendon injury and healing. While stretching can disrupt healing during the initial inflammatory phase, it has been shown that controlled movement of the tendons after about one week following an acute injury can help to promote the synthesis of collagen by the tenocytes, leading to increased tensile strength and diameter of the healed tendons and fewer adhesions than tendons that are immobilized. In chronic tendon injuries, mechanical loading has also been shown to stimulate fibroblast proliferation and collagen synthesis along with collagen realignment, all of which promote repair and remodeling.[35] To further support the theory that movement and activity assist in tendon healing, it has been shown that immobilization of the tendons after injury often has a negative effect on healing. In rabbits, collagen fascicles that are immobilized have shown decreased tensile strength, and immobilization also results in lower amounts of water, proteoglycans, and collagen crosslinks in the tendons.[33]\\r\\nSeveral mechanotransduction mechanisms have been proposed as reasons for the response of tenocytes to mechanical force that enable them to alter their gene expression, protein synthesis, and cell phenotype, and eventually cause changes in tendon structure. A major factor is mechanical deformation of the extracellular matrix, which can affect the actin cytoskeleton and therefore affect cell shape, motility, and function. Mechanical forces can be transmitted by focal adhesion sites, integrins, and cell-cell junctions. Changes in the actin cytoskeleton can activate integrins, which mediate outside-in and inside-out signaling between the cell and the matrix. G-proteins, which induce intracellular signaling cascades, may also be important, and ion channels are activated by stretching to allow ions such as calcium, sodium, or potassium to enter the cell.[35]\\r\\nSinew was widely used throughout pre-industrial eras as a tough, durable fiber. Some specific uses include using sinew as thread for sewing, attaching feathers to arrows (see fletch), lashing tool blades to shafts, etc. It is also recommended in survival guides as a material from which strong cordage can be made for items like traps or living structures. Tendon must be treated in specific ways to function usefully for these purposes. Inuit and other circumpolar people utilized sinew as the only cordage for all domestic purposes due to the lack of other suitable fiber sources in their ecological habitats. The elastic properties of particular sinews were also used in composite recurved bows favoured by the steppe nomads of Eurasia. The first stone throwing artillery also used the elastic properties of sinew.\\r\\nSinew makes for an excellent cordage material for three reasons: It is extremely strong, it contains natural glues, and it shrinks as it dries, doing away with the need for knots.\\r\\nTendon (in particular, beef tendon) is used as a food in some Asian cuisines (often served at yum cha or dim sum restaurants). One popular dish is suan bao niu jin, in which the tendon is marinated in garlic. It is also sometimes found in the Vietnamese noodle dish ph?.\\r\\nTendons are subject to many types of injuries. There are various forms of tendinopathies or tendon injuries due to overuse. These types of injuries generally result in inflammation and degeneration or weakening of the tendons, which may eventually lead to tendon rupture.[33] Tendinopathies can be caused by a number of factors relating to the tendon extracellular matrix (ECM), and their classification has been difficult because their symptoms and histopathology often are similar.\\r\\nThe first category of tendinopathy is paratenonitis, which refers to inflammation of the paratenon, or paratendinous sheet located between the tendon and its sheath. Tendinosis refers to non-inflammatory injury to the tendon at the cellular level. The degradation is caused by damage to collagen, cells, and the vascular components of the tendon, and is known to lead to rupture.[39] Observations of tendons that have undergone spontaneous rupture have shown the presence of collagen fibrils that are not in the correct parallel orientation or are not uniform in length or diameter, along with rounded tenocytes, other cell abnormalities, and the ingrowth of blood vessels.[33] Other forms of tendinosis that have not led to rupture have also shown the degeneration, disorientation, and thinning of the collagen fibrils, along with an increase in the amount of glycosaminoglycans between the fibrils.[34] The third is paratenonitis with tendinosis, in which combinations of paratenon inflammation and tendon degeneration are both present. The last is tendinitis, which refers to degeneration with inflammation of the tendon as well as vascular disruption.[1]\\r\\nTendinopathies may be caused by several intrinsic factors including age, body weight, and nutrition. The extrinsic factors are often related to sports and include excessive forces or loading, poor training techniques, and environmental conditions.[32]\\r\\nIn some organisms, notable ones being birds[40] and ornithischian dinosaurs,[41] portions of the tendon can become ossified. In this process, osteocytes infiltrate the tendon and lay down bone as they would in sesamoid bone such as the patella. In birds, tendon ossification primarily occurs in the hindlimb, while in ornithischian dinosaurs, ossified axial muscle tendons form a latticework along the neural and haemal spines on the tail, presumably for support.","input":"What kind of tissue is tendons and ligaments?"},{"output":"sixth season","context":"Isobel Katherine \\"Izzie\\" Stevens, M.D. is a fictional character from the medical drama television series Grey's Anatomy, which airs on the American Broadcasting Company (ABC) in the United States. The character was created by series producer Shonda Rhimes, and was portrayed by actress Katherine Heigl from 2005 to 2010. Introduced as a surgical intern at the fictional Seattle Grace Hospital, Izzie worked her way up to resident level, while her relationships with her colleagues Meredith Grey (Ellen Pompeo), Cristina Yang (Sandra Oh), George O'Malley (T.R. Knight) and Alex Karev (Justin Chambers) formed a focal point of the series.\\r\\nHeigl garnered critical acclaim for her performance as Izzie and received numerous awards and nominations for her role, winning the \\"Outstanding Supporting Actress In A Drama Series\\" at the 2007 Emmy Awards. She was critical of the character's development during the show's fourth season, particularly her romance with George. She declined to put herself forward for the 2008 Emmy Awards, citing insufficient material in the role. After speculation that Izzie would be killed off in the fifth season, the character was diagnosed with Stage 4 metastatic melanoma. She married Alex in the series' one-hundredth episode, and afterwards, her tumor was successfully removed. Izzie made her final appearance in the sixth season, leaving Seattle after Alex refused to resume their marriage. Heigl requested to be released from her contract 18?months early, in order to spend more time with her family. In January 2012, Heigl reported that she would like to return to Grey's Anatomy to give closure to her character, however, Rhimes confirmed that there were no plans to have the character return at that time and has since stated that she has no plans to ever re-approach Izzie's storyline again.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nIzzie appears in the first episode of Grey's Anatomy, meeting fellow interns Meredith Grey, Cristina Yang, Alex Karev, and George O'Malley.[1] She and George move in with Meredith and become best friends.[2] Izzie's boyfriend, hockey player Hank (Jonathan Scarfe), struggles to accept her new role as a surgeon, and the two break up.[3] Izzie is hurt when Alex exposes her past as a lingerie model.[4] However, the two later go on to begin a friendship and then a romance.[5] Alex experiences sexual dysfunction with Izzie and cheats on her with nurse Olivia Harper (Sarah Utterback).[6] When Izzie finds out, she breaks up with him, though they briefly reunite following a bomb incident at the hospital.[7] Izzie reveals while treating a pregnant teenager that she had a daughter at the age of 16 and gave up for adoption. Izzie falls in love with cardiothoracic patient Denny Duquette (Jeffrey Dean Morgan), and the two become engaged. When Denny's condition deteriorates, Izzie deliberately worsens his health further by cutting his LVAD wire to move him up the donor register.[8] Although Denny receives a new heart, he has a stroke hours later and dies.[9] Izzie is the sole beneficiary of Denny's will, inheriting $8.7?million.[10] She uses the money to open a free clinic at the hospital: the Denny Duquette Memorial Clinic.[11]\\r\\nIzzie disapproves of George's relationship and marriage to orthopedic resident Callie Torres (Sara Ramirez).[12] She and George sleep together, and attempt to keep their liaison a secret.[13] George and resident Miranda Bailey (Chandra Wilson) are the only people aware that Izzie gave birth to a daughter at the age of sixteen; ultimately the child was given up for adoption. He supports Izzie when her daughter Hannah (Liv Hutchings), diagnosed with leukemia, arrives at Seattle Grace Hospital in need of a bone marrow transplant from Izzie.[14] Izzie's feelings for George grow, and she reveals that she has fallen in love with him.[15] When Callie discovers George has been unfaithful, the two separate,[16] and George and Izzie embark on a short-lived relationship, only to discover there is no real chemistry between them.[17]\\r\\nIzzie supports Alex when he discovers his new girlfriend has psychiatric problems, and convinces him to have her committed. She is also handed primary responsibility for the clinic, as Bailey cuts back on her responsibilities.[18] Izzie and Alex go on to rekindle their relationship, though Izzie is concerned when she begins hallucinating Denny.[19] She discovers she has metastatic melanoma (Stage IV) which has spread to her liver, skin, and brain, causing the hallucinations. Her survival chances are estimated at only 5%.[20] She is admitted to Seattle Grace as a patient, and Derek Shepherd (Patrick Dempsey) successfully removes a tumor from her brain.[21] Izzie spends her time in the hospital planning Meredith and Derek's wedding, but when her condition worsens and Derek discovers a second brain tumor, they give the ceremony to Izzie and Alex, who marry in front of all their friends.[22] The procedure to remove the second tumor from Izzie's brain causes her to lose her short-term memory, and although she soon regains it, she flatlines moments later. The fifth season ends with her friends ignoring her DNR order and attempting to resuscitate her, transposed with images of Izzie in an elevator encountering George, who has been in an accident and is also currently flatlining.[23] Though George dies, Izzie is resuscitated and recovers enough to return to work.[24]\\r\\nIzzie makes a treatment error that endangers the life of a patient, and is fired from the hospital's surgical program. Believing Alex is partially to blame, she writes him a Dear John letter and leaves.[25] Izzie later learns that Alex was not responsible for her lost job, and returns to make amends with him, but Meredith informs her that Alex is moving on. Izzie informs Alex that she no longer has cancer. Although he is pleased, Alex officially breaks up with Izzie, telling her that he loves her but deserves better. She leaves Seattle to start fresh.[26] Several episodes later, Alex informs Meredith that Izzie sent divorce papers, which he signs in the episode \\"How Insensitive\\".[27] In the sixth-season finale, Alex is shot and asks for Izzie. Imagining that Meredith's half-sister Lexie (Chyler Leigh) is Izzie, he apologizes and asks her never to leave him again.[28] In the 300th episode, Alex reveals he never found out what happened to Izzie, but envisions a perfect, happy life for her, always smiling, now that he has moved on.\\r\\nIzzie was created by Grey's Anatomy producer Shonda Rhimes, with actress Katherine Heigl cast in the role. Heigl originally wanted to play Izzie as a brunette, but was requested to retain her natural blond for the part.[29] Heigl's comprehension of medical procedures and terminology is slight; the actress explained that while she has an admiration for doctors, she is not as fascinated by medicine as other cast members.[30] When Kate Walsh's character Addison Montgomery left Grey's Anatomy to launch the spin-off show Private Practice, Heigl disclosed that she had hoped for a spin-off for Izzie.[31]\\r\\nHeigl declined to put her name forward for consideration at the 2008 Emmy Awards, claiming that she had been given insufficient material on the series to warrant a nomination.[32] Following Heigl's statement, speculation arose that her character would suffer a brain tumor and be killed off Grey's Anatomy, substantiated by the announcement Jeffrey Dean Morgan would return to the series as Denny, who died at the end of season two.[33] ABC's entertainment president Steve McPherson denied the rumor, stating: \\"There is an unbelievable storyline for her this year, which is really central to everything that's going to go on this season\\".[34]\\r\\nSpeculation resumed, however, when Dean Morgan returned to the show for a second time in its fifth season.[35] Cast member James Pickens, Jr. announced that both Heigl and T.R. Knight were set to depart from the show,[36] but he later retracted his comment.[37] During the course of the fifth season, Izzie was diagnosed with metastatic melanoma (Stage IV) which spread to her liver, skin and brain. Following the show's one-hundredth episode wrap party, Heigl revealed she did not know if Izzie would survive, as no one on the production team would disclose her character's fate to her.[38] It was confirmed in June 2009 that Heigl would return as Izzie for the show's sixth season.[39] Heigl's appearances in the season were sporadic, seeing Izzie depart and return twice.[40] Although she was scheduled to appear in the final five episodes of the season, Heigl requested that she be released from her contract 18?months early, and made her final appearance on January 21, 2010.[41] Heigl explained that she wanted to spend more time with her family, and did not think it would be respectful to Grey's Anatomy viewers to have Izzie return and depart yet again.[40] Michael Ausiello spoke further on Katherine Heigl's perspective on Izzie's departure. He said, \\"[Katherine] thinks her Jan. 21 farewell - while not originally intended to be her last episode - oddly works as a bookend to Izzie's story. \\"Even though there's a part of me that would like to go back and do the quick Izzie farewell, \\" she says, \\"I also think that my last scene - where Meredith says to Izzie, 'Don't go, we're your family,' and Izzie's response was, 'No you're not, you're just a bunch of people I worked with, and I can find that anywhere' - was kind of tragic and appropriate all at the same time. When I was playing the scene I was really trying to convey that, for Izzie, that was a lie that she had to tell herself to have the courage to have to move on.\\"[42]\\r\\nIn August 2010, Rhimes stated that she did not feel Izzie's character arcspecifically her relationship with Alexhad fully concluded, and hoped to give proper closure to their relationship in the seventh season.[43] She later confirmed that she had intended to kill off Izzie off-screen, but opted against this a day later as she felt that it would destroy Alex, rather than give him closure. Instead, she concluded: \\"I'm open to seeing Izzie again. So if she [Katherine] were to come back, we would be thrilled to [wrap up her story]. But if she doesn't, we'll just move on.\\"[44] Heigl also went on to say in October 2010 that the character returning to show looks bleak because, \\"that chapter is closed, and it's sad. And it's hard.\\" She also felt that Izzie coming back to the show would, \\"just feel manipulative.\\"[45]\\r\\nHowever, in January 2012, Heigl stated in an interview that she has asked the producers if she could return to the show to give closure to Izzie's storyline: \\"I've told them I want to [return],\\" she said. \\"I really, really, really want to see where [Izzie] is. I just want to know what happened to her and where she went and what she's doing now. My idea is that she actually like figures it out, and finds some success and does really well in a different hospital. She was always floundering you know, and so she was always one step behind the eight ball and I want to see that girl take some power back.\\"[46] She later went on to say that she regrets leaving the show, \\"Oh yeah, sometimes, yeah. You miss it. I miss my friends. It was a great work environment ... and it becomes a family. I spent six years together with these people every day ... you grow up together, in a way,\\" and again commented on Izzie possibly returning to the show, \\"I always felt that if they wanted me to come back and sort of wrap up that storyline ... I want them to know that I'm down with it if they want me to, but I completely understand if it doesn't necessarily work ... They've got a lot of story lines going on there.\\"[47] But in March 2012, Shonda Rhimes said that there are no plans at the moment for the character to return, \\"I think it was really nice to hear her appreciating the show. At the same time we are on a track we have been planning. The idea of changing that track is not something we are interested in right now.\\"[48] Three years later, Rhimes said she has completely moved on from the idea of Izzie coming back, Im done with that story. Ive turned that idea over in my mind a thousand times and thought about how it would go. And I dont think so.[49]\\r\\nHeigl believes that the Grey's Anatomy writers incorporate much of the actors' personalities into their roles, and that Izzie is a \\"super moral\\" version of herself.[50] Episode \\"Bring the Pain\\", which aired as the fifth episode of the second season, was originally intended to be the final episode of the first season. Rhimes explained that Izzie's character in this episode came \\"full circle\\" from her role in the pilot: \\"Izzie, so vulnerable and underestimated when we first meet her, is the girl who removes her heart from her sleeve in \\"Bring the Pain\\".\\"[51] Discussing Izzie's personality in a 2006 Cosmopolitan interview, Heigl assessed that she is \\"immensely kind\\" and patient.[29] When Denny died in the season two episode \\"Losing My Religion\\", Rhimes discussed the impact it had on Izzie, noting that Izzie is forced to abandon her idealism, which in turn leads to her letting go of medicine.[52] In the aftermath of Denny's death, Heigl came to believe that Izzie was not cut out to be a doctor.[50] Executive producer Betsy Beers explained, however, that Denny's death served to make Izzie more mature,[50] and Heigl affirmed that \\"At the beginning of the [third] season they were trying to show how lost Izzie was. She lost her optimism. She realizes now that life is difficult, but she still tries very hard to see the best in people.\\"[50] In order to demonstrate Izzie's dislike of George's love-interest Callie, Rhimes penned a scene which she deemed one of her favorite moments on the show, in which Callie urinates in front of a stunned Izzie and Meredith. Rhimes assessed that: \\"I love that Mer and Izzie respond with all the trauma of having viewed a car crash [...] the point is Callie pees and Izzie tortures her a tiny bit about the hand washing and that made me overjoyed because thats the kind of thing people do.\\"[53]\\r\\nDiscussing Izzie's relationship with Alex in a 2006 Cosmopolitan interview, Heigl assessed that \\"Even when Alex was a complete dirtbag to her [Izzie], she forgave him and gave him another chance. And he really screwed her over. [...] To go for a guy like that is to say I want to be damaged.'\\"[29] Writer Stacy McKee deemed Izzie's moving on from Alex to patient Denny Duquette \\"karma\\", as Alex previously treated Izzie badly, yet as he begins to realize his true feelings, he is forced to watch her embark on a romance with \\"the undeniably handsome - and totally charming\\" Denny.[54] Series writer Blythe Robe commented on Izzie and Denny: \\"I love the way Izzie lights up when she's around him. I love their relationship because it's so pure and honest and completely game free.\\"[55] Writer Elizabeth Klaviter noted at this time the way Izzie \\"seems to be sacrificing her reputation because of her feelings for Denny.\\"[56] When Izzie deliberately worsened Denny's condition to move him up the transplant list, series writer Mark Wilding questioned the morality of the actions, asking: \\"is Izzie bad for doing it? Is she tremendously irresponsible? She cut the LVAD wire for love so does that make her action understandable?\\"[57]\\r\\nRhimes discussed costuming choices in the scene which saw the interns gather around Denny's deathbed, explaining: \\"Meredith and George and Cristina and Callie and Alex are all dressed, not for a prom, but for a funeral. Everyone in dark colors, everyone dressed somberly. As if they were in mourning. Only Izzie is in happy pink. Only Izzie looks like she didnt know this was coming.\\"[52] Following Denny's death, Heigl approached Rhimes to ask when her character would next have a romantic liaison. Rhimes explained that \\"Izzie doesn't sleep around\\".[50] Heigl expressed a desire for Izzie to reunite with Alex, explaining: \\"I believe on some level, there's a connection between Izzie and Alex. He can do honorable things even though he's cutting and sarcastic. I would like to ultimately see them together, if not this season, then next.\\"[50]\\r\\nYahoo! Voices wrote that Stevens in the third season \\"has become more condescending and passive aggressive herself, more than anyone else.\\"[59] Heigl was critical of her character's development in the show's fourth season, particularly her affair with George, which she deemed \\"a ratings ploy\\".[58] Heigl explained: \\"They really hurt somebody, and they didn't seem to be taking a lot of responsibility for it. I have a really hard time with that kind of thing. I'm maybe a little too black and white about it. I don't really know Izzie very well right now. She's changed a lot.\\"[58] Attempting to rationalise Izzie's actions, Heigl later assessed that:\\r\\nPeople who are so infallible, perfect and moral tend to be the first to slip and fall. But I would love to see how she deals with the consequences of what she's done, because whats interesting is when people make decisions that shake their world, they suddenly have to go, 'Woo, I didn't know I was capable of this.' I'd like to see Izzie take some culpability.[60]\\r\\nHeigl was nominated for the \\"Best Supporting Actress in a TV Series\\" award at the 2007 and 2008 Golden Globe Awards for her role as Izzie.[61] She was named \\"Favorite Female TV Star\\" at the 34th People's Choice Awards,[62] and awarded \\"Outstanding Supporting Actress In A Drama Series\\" at the 2007 Emmy Awards.[63] Prior to the ceremony, considering Heigl's chances of winning the Emmy, Variety's Stuart Levine assessed of her performance: \\"Heigl has little difficulty reaching Izzie's highest highs and lowest lows. Showrunner Shonda Rhimes puts a lot of pressure on Heigl to carry many intense storylines, and she's up to the challenge.\\"[64] Levine also noted, however: \\"There are times when Izzie becomes completely irrational during crisis situations, which may bother some.\\"[64] Fox News included Izzie in its list of \\"The Best TV Doctors For Surgeon General\\".[65] The character was listed in Wetpaint's \\"10 Hottest Female Doctors on TV\\" and in BuzzFeed's \\"16 Hottest Doctors On Television\\".[66][67]\\r\\nDuring the show's third season, the New York Post's Robert Rorke deemed Izzie to be \\"the heart and soul\\" of Grey's Anatomy. He deemed her the show's heroine, and wrote that: \\"Izzie is a welcome, calming presence, despite the devastation she experienced when she failed to save her patient and fiance Denny Duquette. [...] Besides the formidable Dr. Bailey (Chandra Wilson), Izzie seems to be the only adult intern at Seattle Grace; the character has achieved a depth lacking in her fellow interns.\\"[50] Eyder Peralta of The Houston Chronicle was critical of Izzie's ethics in cutting Denny's LVAD wire, writing that she \\"should not be practising medicine\\" and stating: \\"That's the reason I don't watch Grey's Anatomy, anymore, because the super hot blond chick can make an earth-shattering, fatal decision and she doesn't get canned.\\"[68]\\r\\nThe season four romance between Izzie and George proved unpopular with viewers, and resulted in a fan backlash among Alex and Izzie fans.[69] The return of Izzie's deceased fianc Denny and the resumption of their romance during the show's fifth season also proved unpopular with fans,[70] and was deemed \\"the world's worst storyline\\" by Mary McNamara of the Los Angeles Times.[71] McNamara was also critical of the episode \\"Now or Never\\", which saw Izzie flatline following neurosurgery, opining that Izzie ought to die.[71] The episode in which Izzie married long-term love Alex received 15.3 million viewers, the largest television audience of the night.[72]\\r\\nIzzie's cancer storyline received a mixed response from the medical community. Otis Brawley, chief medical officer at the American Cancer Society, commented that Izzie's treatment options were unrealistic. Whereas in the show she was offered the drug interleukin-2, in reality the drug is never recommended to patients when melanoma has spread to the brain, as it can cause bleeding and strokes. Brawley explained that such patients would instead be offered radiosurgery.[73] Conversely however, Tim Turnham, executive director of the Melanoma Research Foundation, praised Grey's Anatomy for bringing about greater public awareness of melanoma, stating: \\"We welcome the national spotlight Grey's Anatomy has created for melanoma and its efforts to encourage viewers to learn more about the importance of prevention, early detection and research.\\"[74]\\r\\nSpecific\\r\\nGeneral\\r\\nIzzie Stevens on IMDb","input":"What episode did izzy leave grey's anatomy?"},{"output":"smoke","context":"The chimney (smokestack or stack in American and Canadian English) is the part of a steam locomotive through which smoke leaves the boiler. Steam locomotive exhaust systems typically vent cylinder exhaust through the chimney to enhance draught through the boiler. Chimneys are designed to carry exhaust steam and smoke clear of the driver's line of sight while remaining short enough to clear overhead structures. Some chimneys included features to avoid dispersing sparks.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe chimney was usually located above the smokebox at the leading end of the locomotive, furthest away from the driver's cab and firebox. The earliest locomotive chimneys were typically tall enough to sustain temperature-induced density difference draught through a fire-tube boiler while the locomotive was stationary; but following the example of Richard Trevithick's first locomotive in 1804, most designs diverted steam cylinder exhaust upward through the chimney to create a vacuum in the smokebox and accelerate airflow through the firebox while the locomotive was in motion.[1]\\r\\nLocomotives with high chimneys and low footplates had the additional advantage of keeping smoke and condensing steam above the engine driver's field of vision. Grade limitations of railways through hilly terrain required tunnels and overhead bridges imposing a loading gauge limiting the height of chimneys. Increasing the velocity of steam exhaust tended to both accelerate airflow through the firebox and lift the smoke higher above the end of the chimney. By the 1830s steam exhaust was directed through a contracted nozzle called a blastpipe to achieve desired velocity through the chimney. Pressure drop through the blastpipe nozzle was subtracted from the boiler pressure available to the steam pistons. Robert Stephenson estimated some locomotives lost half their power through blastpipe back pressure.[2]\\r\\nAs boiler design improved heat transfer efficiency, blast pipe diameters increased to reduce back pressure; and blastpipes became shorter to discharge below the chimney rather than within it. Ross Winans placed conical \\"petticoat pipes\\" above blastpipes about 1848[2] to form the convergent portion of a venturi tube with the chimney forming the divergent portion.[3] Improved understanding of compressible flow encouraged more sophisticated blastpipe and venturi chimney designs. George Jackson Churchward, working at Swindon on the Great Western Railway, formulated a simple equation for calculating the ideal dimensions for chimneys which worked well for the early years of the 20th century, but soon become outdated as engine powers increased. Andr Chapelon in France continued to work on chimney dimensions, and studied them in conjunction with blastpipe dimensions as a complete Steam locomotive exhaust system, such as his famous Kylchap system as fitted to many locomotive classes worldwide. Even after the end of commercial steam in most of the developed world, the Argentinean engineer Livio Dante Porta continued to work on developing steam locomotive exhaust systems including refining equations to give better chimney dimensions.\\r\\nLocomotives built in Great Britain, where coke was the most common fuel, often used chimneys of cast iron, as they lasted longer than chimneys fabricated from sheet metal. Early North American locomotives often used wood fuel; and large numbers of glowing embers were carried through the boiler and out of the chimney by high velocity exhaust steam.[4] Spark arrestors became a common feature of wood-burning locomotive chimneys to reduce the number of fires started by escaped embers. The difficulty of casting complex spark arrestors encouraged fabrication of sheet metal chimneys for wood-burning locomotives.[5]\\r\\nEarly spark arrestors were simply iron wire screens installed within the stack. This screen reduced the rate at which smoke and steam could escape from the boiler. Embers caught upon the screen further reduced available space for passing steam and smoke and heat generated by these burning embers rapidly melted the restraining wire screen. Chimney top diameters enlarged to increase screen surface area and reduce smoke velocity through the screen so embers might fall away from the screen into collection hoppers. Baldwin Locomotive Works compiled a diagram illustrating 57 different spark arresting chimney designs in response to an 1857 patent infringement claim.[4]\\r\\nThe most popular design was a bonnet chimney. The bonnet was a funnel-shaped sheet metal cone fitted over a conventional cylindrical chimney. The lower, small-diameter portion of the cone served as a collection hopper for falling embers. The upper portion of the cone concealed an inner cone at the top of the cylindrical chimney which deflected escaping steam, smoke and embers outward against the inner walls of the outer cone. The heavier embers were expected to fall into the hopper below while the lighter steam and smoke passed upward through a wire screen over the upper, large-diameter end of the outer cone. Deflection of the embers typically lengthened screen life to three or four weeks. Some of these chimneys had provisions dropping collected embers into a portion of the smokebox called the subtreasury. Sophisticated designs like the Radley & Hunter included various centrifugal separation baffles into the bonnet. As coal replaced wood fuel, the bonnet was reduced into a simple diamond stack housing the inner deflecting cone (with or without the upper wire screen) but without any collection hopper.[4]\\r\\nThe bonnet chimney became one of the most distinctive features contributing, with the large rectangular oil headlamp, an air of frontal grandeur to 19th-century American locomotives.[4] Many designers or railway companies had their own distinctive style, such as the William Adams' \\"Stovepipe\\" chimney on the 19th century LSWR, or the copper-capped chimneys on the Great Western Railway.\\r\\nAs locomotive boilers grew larger, the space available for chimneys was reduced, as they still had to fit within the same loading gauge. This reduced their effectiveness at keeping the exhaust gases away from the driver's line of sight, and as a result locomotives had to be fitted with devices such as smoke deflectors.","input":"What comes out of a steam train funnel?"},{"output":"4.6 billion years ago","context":"The formation and evolution of the Solar System began 4.6 billion years ago with the gravitational collapse of a small part of a giant molecular cloud.[1] Most of the collapsing mass collected in the center, forming the Sun, while the rest flattened into a protoplanetary disk out of which the planets, moons, asteroids, and other small Solar System bodies formed.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis model, known as the nebular hypothesis and now refined as the Nice model (2005), was first developed in the 18th century by Emanuel Swedenborg, Immanuel Kant, and Pierre-Simon Laplace. Its subsequent development has interwoven a variety of scientific disciplines including astronomy, physics, geology, and planetary science. Since the dawn of the space age in the 1950s and the discovery of extrasolar planets in the 1990's, the model has been both challenged and refined to account for new observations.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Solar System has evolved considerably since its initial formation. Many moons have formed from circling discs of gas and dust around their parent planets, while other moons are thought to have formed independently and later been captured by their planets. Still others, such as Earth's Moon, may be the result of giant collisions. Collisions between bodies have occurred continually up to the present day and have been central to the evolution of the Solar System. The positions of the planets often shifted due to gravitational interactions.[2] This planetary migration is now thought to have been responsible for much of the Solar System's early evolution.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn roughly 5?billion years, the Sun will cool and expand outward to many times its current diameter (becoming a red giant), before casting off its outer layers as a planetary nebula and leaving behind a stellar remnant known as a white dwarf. In the far distant future, the gravity of passing stars will gradually reduce the Sun's retinue of planets. Some planets will be destroyed, others ejected into interstellar space. Ultimately, over the course of tens of billions of years, it is likely that the Sun will be left with none of the original bodies in orbit around it.[3]\\r\\n\\r\\nIdeas concerning the origin and fate of the world date from the earliest known writings; however, for almost all of that time, there was no attempt to link such theories to the existence of a \\"Solar System\\", simply because it was not generally thought that the Solar System, in the sense we now understand it, existed. The first step toward a theory of Solar System formation and evolution was the general acceptance of heliocentrism, which placed the Sun at the centre of the system and the Earth in orbit around it. This concept had developed for millennia (Aristarchus of Samos had suggested it as early as 250 BC), but was not widely accepted until the end of the 17th century. The first recorded use of the term \\"Solar System\\" dates from 1704.[4]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe current standard theory for Solar System formation, the nebular hypothesis, has fallen into and out of favour since its formulation by Emanuel Swedenborg, Immanuel Kant, and Pierre-Simon Laplace in the 18th century. The most significant criticism of the hypothesis was its apparent inability to explain the Sun's relative lack of angular momentum when compared to the planets.[5] However, since the early 1980s studies of young stars have shown them to be surrounded by cool discs of dust and gas, exactly as the nebular hypothesis predicts, which has led to its re-acceptance.[6]\\r\\n\\r\\nUnderstanding of how the Sun is expected to continue to evolve required an understanding of the source of its power. Arthur Stanley Eddington's confirmation of Albert Einstein's theory of relativity led to his realisation that the Sun's energy comes from nuclear fusion reactions in its core, fusing hydrogen into helium.[7] In 1935, Eddington went further and suggested that other elements also might form within stars.[8] Fred Hoyle elaborated on this premise by arguing that evolved stars called red giants created many elements heavier than hydrogen and helium in their cores. When a red giant finally casts off its outer layers, these elements would then be recycled to form other star systems.[8]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe nebular hypothesis says that the Solar System formed from the gravitational collapse of a fragment of a giant molecular cloud.[9] The cloud was about 20?parsec (65 light years) across,[9] while the fragments were roughly 1?parsec (three and a quarter light-years) across.[10] The further collapse of the fragments led to the formation of dense cores 0.01ÿ0.1?pc (2,000ÿ20,000?AU) in size.[note 1][9][11] One of these collapsing fragments (known as the pre-solar nebula) formed what became the Solar System.[12] The composition of this region with a mass just over that of the Sun (M?) was about the same as that of the Sun today, with hydrogen, along with helium and trace amounts of lithium produced by Big Bang nucleosynthesis, forming about 98% of its mass. The remaining 2% of the mass consisted of heavier elements that were created by nucleosynthesis in earlier generations of stars.[13] Late in the life of these stars, they ejected heavier elements into the interstellar medium.[14]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe oldest inclusions found in meteorites, thought to trace the first solid material to form in the pre-solar nebula, are 4568.2 million years old, which is one definition of the age of the Solar System.[1] Studies of ancient meteorites reveal traces of stable daughter nuclei of short-lived isotopes, such as iron-60, that only form in exploding, short-lived stars. This indicates that one or more supernovae occurred near the Sun while it was forming. A shock wave from a supernova may have triggered the formation of the Sun by creating relatively dense regions within the cloud, causing these regions to collapse.[15] Because only massive, short-lived stars produce supernovae, the Sun must have formed in a large star-forming region that produced massive stars, possibly similar to the Orion Nebula.[16][17] Studies of the structure of the Kuiper belt and of anomalous materials within it suggest that the Sun formed within a cluster of between 1,000 and 10,000 stars with a diameter of between 6.5 and 19.5 light years and a collective mass of 3,000?M?. This cluster began to break apart between 135 million and 535 million years after formation.[18][19] Several simulations of our young Sun interacting with close-passing stars over the first 100 million years of its life produce anomalous orbits observed in the outer Solar System, such as detached objects.[20]\\r\\n\\r\\nBecause of the conservation of angular momentum, the nebula spun faster as it collapsed. As the material within the nebula condensed, the atoms within it began to collide with increasing frequency, converting their kinetic energy into heat. The centre, where most of the mass collected, became increasingly hotter than the surrounding disc.[10] Over about 100,000 years,[9] the competing forces of gravity, gas pressure, magnetic fields, and rotation caused the contracting nebula to flatten into a spinning protoplanetary disc with a diameter of about 200?AU[10] and form a hot, dense protostar (a star in which hydrogen fusion has not yet begun) at the centre.[21]\\r\\n\\r\\nAt this point in its evolution, the Sun is thought to have been a T Tauri star.[22] Studies of T Tauri stars show that they are often accompanied by discs of pre-planetary matter with masses of 0.001ÿ0.1?M?.[23] These discs extend to several hundred?AUthe Hubble Space Telescope has observed protoplanetary discs of up to 1000?AU in diameter in star-forming regions such as the Orion Nebula[24]and are rather cool, reaching a surface temperature of only about 1000 kelvin at their hottest.[25]\\r\\nWithin 50?million years, the temperature and pressure at the core of the Sun became so great that its hydrogen began to fuse, creating an internal source of energy that countered gravitational contraction until hydrostatic equilibrium was achieved.[26] This marked the Sun's entry into the prime phase of its life, known as the main sequence. Main-sequence stars derive energy from the fusion of hydrogen into helium in their cores. The Sun remains a main-sequence star today.[27]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe various planets are thought to have formed from the solar nebula, the disc-shaped cloud of gas and dust left over from the Sun's formation.[28] The currently accepted method by which the planets formed is accretion, in which the planets began as dust grains in orbit around the central protostar. Through direct contact, these grains formed into clumps up to 200 metres in diameter, which in turn collided to form larger bodies (planetesimals) of ~10?kilometres (km) in size.[29] These gradually increased through further collisions, growing at the rate of centimetres per year over the course of the next few million years.[29]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe inner Solar System, the region of the Solar System inside 4?AU, was too warm for volatile molecules like water and methane to condense, so the planetesimals that formed there could only form from compounds with high melting points, such as metals (like iron, nickel, and aluminium) and rocky silicates. These rocky bodies would become the terrestrial planets (Mercury, Venus, Earth, and Mars). These compounds are quite rare in the Universe, comprising only 0.6% of the mass of the nebula, so the terrestrial planets could not grow very large.[10] The terrestrial embryos grew to about 0.05 Earth masses (M?) and ceased accumulating matter about 100,000?years after the formation of the Sun; subsequent collisions and mergers between these planet-sized bodies allowed terrestrial planets to grow to their present sizes (see Terrestrial planets below).[30]\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen the terrestrial planets were forming, they remained immersed in a disk of gas and dust. The gas was partially supported by pressure and so did not orbit the Sun as rapidly as the planets. The resulting drag and, more importantly, gravitational interactions with the surrounding material caused a transfer of angular momentum, and as a result the planets gradually migrated to new orbits. Models show that density and temperature variations in the disk governed this rate of migration,[31][32] but the net trend was for the inner planets to migrate inward as the disk dissipated, leaving the planets in their current orbits.[33]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe giant planets (Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune) formed further out, beyond the frost line, which is the point between the orbits of Mars and Jupiter where the material is cool enough for volatile icy compounds to remain solid. The ices that formed the Jovian planets were more abundant than the metals and silicates that formed the terrestrial planets, allowing the giant planets to grow massive enough to capture hydrogen and helium, the lightest and most abundant elements.[10] Planetesimals beyond the frost line accumulated up to 4?M? within about 3?million years.[30] Today, the four giant planets comprise just under 99% of all the mass orbiting the Sun.[note 2] Theorists believe it is no accident that Jupiter lies just beyond the frost line. Because the frost line accumulated large amounts of water via evaporation from infalling icy material, it created a region of lower pressure that increased the speed of orbiting dust particles and halted their motion toward the Sun. In effect, the frost line acted as a barrier that caused material to accumulate rapidly at ~5?AU from the Sun. This excess material coalesced into a large embryo (or core) on the order of 10?M?, which began to accumulate an envelope via accretion of gas from the surrounding disc at an ever-increasing rate.[34][35]  Once the envelope mass became about equal to the solid core mass, growth proceeded very rapidly, reaching about 150?Earth masses ~105?years thereafter and finally topping out at 318?M?.[36]  Saturn may owe its substantially lower mass simply to having formed a few million years after Jupiter, when there was less gas available to consume.[30][37]\\r\\n\\r\\nT Tauri stars like the young Sun have far stronger stellar winds than more stable, older stars. Uranus and Neptune are thought to have formed after Jupiter and Saturn did, when the strong solar wind had blown away much of the disc material. As a result, the planets accumulated little hydrogen and heliumnot more than 1?M? each. Uranus and Neptune are sometimes referred to as failed cores.[38] The main problem with formation theories for these planets is the timescale of their formation. At the current locations it would have taken millions of years for their cores to accrete.[37]  This means that Uranus and Neptune  may have formed closer to the Sunnear or even between Jupiter and Saturnand later migrated or were ejected outward (see Planetary migration below).[38][39] Motion in the planetesimal era was not all inward toward the Sun; the Stardust sample return from Comet Wild 2 has suggested that materials from the early formation of the Solar System migrated from the warmer inner Solar System to the region of the Kuiper belt.[40]\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter between three and ten?million years,[30] the young Sun's solar wind would have cleared away all the gas and dust in the protoplanetary disc, blowing it into interstellar space, thus ending the growth of the planets.[41][42]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe planets were originally thought to have formed in or near their current orbits. From that a minimum mass of the nebula i.e. the protoplanetary disc, was derived that was necessary to form the planets - the minimum mass solar nebula. It was derived that the nebula mass must have exceeded 3585 times that of the Earth.\\r\\n\\r\\nHowever, this has been questioned during the last 20 years. Currently, many planetary scientists think that the Solar System might have looked very different after its initial formation: several objects at least as massive as Mercury were present in the inner Solar System, the outer Solar System was much more compact than it is now, and the Kuiper belt was much closer to the Sun.[43]\\r\\n\\r\\nAt the end of the planetary formation epoch the inner Solar System was populated by 50ÿ100 Moon- to Mars-sized planetary embryos.[44][45] Further growth was possible only because these bodies collided and merged, which took less than 100?million years. These objects would have gravitationally interacted with one another, tugging at each other's orbits until they collided, growing larger until the four terrestrial planets we know today took shape.[30] One such giant collision is thought to have formed the Moon (see Moons below), while another removed the outer envelope of the young Mercury.[46]\\r\\n\\r\\nOne unresolved issue with this model is that it cannot explain how the initial orbits of the proto-terrestrial planets, which would have needed to be highly eccentric to collide, produced the remarkably stable and nearly circular orbits they have today.[44] One hypothesis for this \\"eccentricity dumping\\" is that the terrestrials formed in a disc of gas still not expelled by the Sun. The \\"gravitational drag\\" of this residual gas would have eventually lowered the planets' energy, smoothing out their orbits.[45] However, such gas, if it existed, would have prevented the terrestrial planets' orbits from becoming so eccentric in the first place.[30] Another hypothesis is that gravitational drag occurred not between the planets and residual gas but between the planets and the remaining small bodies. As the large bodies moved through the crowd of smaller objects, the smaller objects, attracted by the larger planets' gravity, formed a region of higher density, a \\"gravitational wake\\", in the larger objects' path. As they did so, the increased gravity of the wake slowed the larger objects down into more regular orbits.[47]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe outer edge of the terrestrial region, between 2 and 4?AU from the Sun, is called the asteroid belt. The asteroid belt initially contained more than enough matter to form 2ÿ3 Earth-like planets, and, indeed, a large number of planetesimals formed there. As with the terrestrials, planetesimals in this region later coalesced and formed 20ÿ30 Moon- to Mars-sized planetary embryos;[48] however, the proximity of Jupiter meant that after this planet formed, 3?million years after the Sun, the region's history changed dramatically.[44] Orbital resonances with Jupiter and Saturn are particularly strong in the asteroid belt, and gravitational interactions with more massive embryos scattered many planetesimals into those resonances. Jupiter's gravity increased the velocity of objects within these resonances, causing them to shatter upon collision with other bodies, rather than accrete.[49]\\r\\n\\r\\nAs Jupiter migrated inward following its formation (see Planetary migration below), resonances would have swept across the asteroid belt, dynamically exciting the region's population and increasing their velocities relative to each other.[50] The cumulative action of the resonances and the embryos either scattered the planetesimals away from the asteroid belt or excited their orbital inclinations and eccentricities.[48][51] Some of those massive embryos too were ejected by Jupiter, while others may have migrated to the inner Solar System and played a role in the final accretion of the terrestrial planets.[48][52][53] During this primary depletion period, the effects of the giant planets and planetary embryos left the asteroid belt with a total mass equivalent to less than 1% that of the Earth, composed mainly of small planetesimals.[51]\\r\\nThis is still 10ÿ20 times more than the current mass in the main belt, which is now about 1/2,000?M?.[54] A secondary depletion period that brought the asteroid belt down close to its present mass is thought to have followed when Jupiter and Saturn entered a temporary 2:1 orbital resonance (see below).\\r\\n\\r\\nThe inner Solar System's period of giant impacts probably played a role in the Earth acquiring its current water content (~6G1021?kg) from the early asteroid belt. Water is too volatile to have been present at Earth's formation and must have been subsequently delivered from outer, colder parts of the Solar System.[55] The water was probably delivered by planetary embryos and small planetesimals thrown out of the asteroid belt by Jupiter.[52] A population of main-belt comets discovered in 2006 has been also suggested as a possible source for Earth's water.[55][56] In contrast, comets from the Kuiper belt or farther regions delivered not more than about 6% of Earth's water.[2][57] The panspermia hypothesis holds that life itself may have been deposited on Earth in this way, although this idea is not widely accepted.[58]\\r\\n\\r\\nAccording to the nebular hypothesis, the outer two planets may be in the \\"wrong place\\". Uranus and Neptune (known as the \\"ice giants\\") exist in a region where the reduced density of the solar nebula and longer orbital times render their formation highly implausible.[59] The two are instead thought to have formed in orbits near Jupiter and Saturn, where more material was available, and to have migrated outward to their current positions over hundreds of millions of years.[38]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe migration of the outer planets is also necessary to account for the existence and properties of the Solar System's outermost regions.[39] Beyond Neptune, the Solar System continues into the Kuiper belt, the scattered disc, and the Oort cloud, three sparse populations of small icy bodies thought to be the points of origin for most observed comets. At their distance from the Sun, accretion was too slow to allow planets to form before the solar nebula dispersed, and thus the initial disc lacked enough mass density to consolidate into a planet.[59] The Kuiper belt lies between 30 and 55?AU from the Sun, while the farther scattered disc extends to over 100?AU,[39] and the distant Oort cloud begins at about 50,000?AU.[60] Originally, however, the Kuiper belt was much denser and closer to the Sun, with an outer edge at approximately 30?AU. Its inner edge would have been just beyond the orbits of Uranus and Neptune, which were in turn far closer to the Sun when they formed (most likely in the range of 15ÿ20?AU), and in 50% of simulations ended up opposite locations, with Uranus farther from the Sun than Neptune.[61][2][39]\\r\\n\\r\\nAccording to the Nice model, after the formation of the Solar System, the orbits of all the giant planets continued to change slowly, influenced by their interaction with the large number of remaining planetesimals. After 500ÿ600?million years (about 4?billion years ago) Jupiter and Saturn fell into a 2:1 resonance: Saturn orbited the Sun once for every two Jupiter orbits.[39] This resonance created a gravitational push against the outer planets, possibly causing Neptune to surge past Uranus and plough into the ancient Kuiper belt.[61]\\r\\nThe planets scattered the majority of the small icy bodies inwards, while themselves moving outwards. These planetesimals then scattered off the next planet they encountered in a similar manner, moving the planets' orbits outwards while they moved inwards.[39] This process continued until the planetesimals interacted with Jupiter, whose immense gravity sent them into highly elliptical orbits or even ejected them outright from the Solar System. This caused Jupiter to move slightly inward.[note 3] Those objects scattered by Jupiter into highly elliptical orbits formed the Oort cloud;[39] those objects scattered to a lesser degree by the migrating Neptune formed the current Kuiper belt and scattered disc.[39] This scenario explains the Kuiper belt's and scattered disc's present low mass. Some of the scattered objects, including Pluto, became gravitationally tied to Neptune's orbit, forcing them into mean-motion resonances.[62] Eventually, friction within the planetesimal disc made the orbits of Uranus and Neptune circular again.[39][63]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn contrast to the outer planets, the inner planets are not thought to have migrated significantly over the age of the Solar System, because their orbits have remained stable following the period of giant impacts.[30]\\r\\n\\r\\nAnother question is why Mars came out so small compared with Earth. A study by Southwest Research Institute, San Antonio, Texas, published June 6, 2011 (called the Grand tack hypothesis), proposes that Jupiter had migrated inward to 1.5?AU. After Saturn formed, migrated inward, and established the 2:3 mean motion resonance with Jupiter, the study assumes that both planets migrated back to their present positions. Jupiter thus would have consumed much of the material that would have created a bigger Mars. The same simulations also reproduce the characteristics of the modern asteroid belt, with dry asteroids and water-rich objects similar to comets.[64][65]  However, it is unclear whether conditions in the solar nebula would have allowed Jupiter and Saturn to move back to their current positions, and according to current estimates this possibility appears unlikely.[66] Moreover, alternative explanations for the small mass of Mars exist.[67][68][69]\\r\\n\\r\\nGravitational disruption from the outer planets' migration would have sent large numbers of asteroids into the inner Solar System, severely depleting the original belt until it reached today's extremely low mass.[51] This event may have triggered the Late Heavy Bombardment that occurred approximately 4?billion years ago, 500ÿ600?million years after the formation of the Solar System.[2][70] This period of heavy bombardment lasted several hundred million years and is evident in the cratering still visible on geologically dead bodies of the inner Solar System such as the Moon and Mercury.[2][71] The oldest known evidence for life on Earth dates to 3.8?billion years agoalmost immediately after the end of the Late Heavy Bombardment.[72]\\r\\n\\r\\nImpacts are thought to be a regular (if currently infrequent) part of the evolution of the Solar System. That they continue to happen is evidenced by the collision of Comet ShoemakerÿLevy 9 with Jupiter in 1994, the 2009 Jupiter impact event, the Tunguska event, the Chelyabinsk meteor and the impact feature Meteor Crater in Arizona. The process of accretion, therefore, is not complete, and may still pose a threat to life on Earth.[73][74]\\r\\n\\r\\nOver the course of the Solar System's evolution, comets were ejected out of the inner Solar System by the gravity of the giant planets, and sent thousands of AU outward to form the Oort cloud, a spherical outer swarm of cometary nuclei at the farthest extent of the Sun's gravitational pull. Eventually, after about 800 million years, the gravitational disruption caused by galactic tides, passing stars and giant molecular clouds began to deplete the cloud, sending comets into the inner Solar System.[75] The evolution of the outer Solar System also appears to have been influenced by space weathering from the solar wind, micrometeorites, and the neutral components of the interstellar medium.[76]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe evolution of the asteroid belt after Late Heavy Bombardment was mainly governed by collisions.[77] Objects with large mass have enough gravity to retain any material ejected by a violent collision. In the asteroid belt this usually is not the case. As a result, many larger objects have been broken apart, and sometimes newer objects have been forged from the remnants in less violent collisions.[77] Moons around some asteroids currently can only be explained as consolidations of material flung away from the parent object without enough energy to entirely escape its gravity.[78]\\r\\n\\r\\nMoons have come to exist around most planets and many other Solar System bodies. These natural satellites originated by one of three possible mechanisms:\\r\\n\\r\\nJupiter and Saturn have several large moons, such as Io, Europa, Ganymede and Titan, which may have originated from discs around each giant planet in much the same way that the planets formed from the disc around the Sun.[79][80][81] This origin is indicated by the large sizes of the moons and their proximity to the planet. These attributes are impossible to achieve via capture, while the gaseous nature of the primaries also make formation from collision debris unlikely. The outer moons of the giant planets tend to be small and have eccentric orbits with arbitrary inclinations. These are the characteristics expected of captured bodies.[82][83] Most such moons orbit in the direction opposite the rotation of their primary. The largest irregular moon is Neptune's moon Triton, which is thought to be a captured Kuiper belt object.[74]\\r\\n\\r\\nMoons of solid Solar System bodies have been created by both collisions and capture. Mars's two small moons, Deimos and Phobos, are thought to be captured asteroids.[84]\\r\\nThe Earth's Moon is thought to have formed as a result of a single, large head-on collision.[85][86]\\r\\nThe impacting object probably had a mass comparable to that of Mars, and the impact probably occurred near the end of the period of giant impacts. The collision kicked into orbit some of the impactor's mantle, which then coalesced into the Moon.[85] The impact was probably the last in the series of mergers that formed the Earth.\\r\\nIt has been further hypothesized that the Mars-sized object may have formed at one of the stable EarthÿSun Lagrangian points (either L4 or L5) and drifted from its position.[87] The moons of trans-Neptunian objects Pluto (Charon) and Orcus (Vanth) may also have formed by means of a large collision: the PlutoÿCharon, OrcusÿVanth and EarthÿMoon systems are unusual in the Solar System in that the satellite's mass is at least 1% that of the larger body.[88][89]\\r\\n\\r\\nAstronomers estimate that the Solar System as we know it today will not change drastically until the Sun has fused almost all the hydrogen fuel in its core into helium, beginning its evolution from the main sequence of the HertzsprungÿRussell diagram and into its red-giant phase. Even so, the Solar System will continue to evolve until then.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Solar System is chaotic over million- and billion-year timescales,[90] with the orbits of the planets open to long-term variations. One notable example of this chaos is the NeptuneÿPluto system, which lies in a 3:2 orbital resonance. Although the resonance itself will remain stable, it becomes impossible to predict the position of Pluto with any degree of accuracy more than 10ÿ20?million years (the Lyapunov time) into the future.[91] Another example is Earth's axial tilt, which, due to friction raised within Earth's mantle by tidal interactions with the Moon (see below), will be incomputable at some point between 1.5 and 4.5 billion years from now.[92]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe outer planets' orbits are chaotic over longer timescales, with a Lyapunov time in the range of 2ÿ230?million years.[93]\\r\\nIn all cases this means that the position of a planet along its orbit ultimately becomes impossible to predict with any certainty (so, for example, the timing of winter and summer become uncertain), but in some cases the orbits themselves may change dramatically. Such chaos manifests most strongly as changes in eccentricity, with some planets' orbits becoming significantly moreor lesselliptical.[94]\\r\\n\\r\\nUltimately, the Solar System is stable in that none of the planets are likely to collide with each other or be ejected from the system in the next few billion years.[93] Beyond this, within five?billion years or so Mars's eccentricity may grow to around 0.2, such that it lies on an Earth-crossing orbit, leading to a potential collision. In the same timescale, Mercury's eccentricity may grow even further, and a close encounter with Venus could theoretically eject it from the Solar System altogether[90] or send it on a collision course with Venus or Earth.[95] This could happen within a billion years, according to numerical simulations in which Mercury's orbit is perturbed.[96]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe evolution of moon systems is driven by tidal forces. A moon will raise a tidal bulge in the object it orbits (the primary) due to the differential gravitational force across diameter of the primary. If a moon is revolving in the same direction as the planet's rotation and the planet is rotating faster than the orbital period of the moon, the bulge will constantly be pulled ahead of the moon. In this situation, angular momentum is transferred from the rotation of the primary to the revolution of the satellite. The moon gains energy and gradually spirals outward, while the primary rotates more slowly over time.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Earth and its Moon are one example of this configuration. Today, the Moon is tidally locked to the Earth; one of its revolutions around the Earth (currently about 29 days) is equal to one of its rotations about its axis, so it always shows one face to the Earth. The Moon will continue to recede from Earth, and Earth's spin will continue to slow gradually. In about 50?billion years, if they survive the Sun's expansion, the Earth and Moon will become tidally locked to each other; each will be caught up in what is called a \\"spinÿorbit resonance\\" in which the Moon will circle the Earth in about 47 days and both Moon and Earth will rotate around their axes in the same time, each only visible from one hemisphere of the other.[97][98] Other examples are the Galilean moons of Jupiter (as well as many of Jupiter's smaller moons)[99] and most of the larger moons of Saturn.[100]\\r\\n\\r\\nA different scenario occurs when the moon is either revolving around the primary faster than the primary rotates, or is revolving in the direction opposite the planet's rotation. In these cases, the tidal bulge lags behind the moon in its orbit. In the former case, the direction of angular momentum transfer is reversed, so the rotation of the primary speeds up while the satellite's orbit shrinks. In the latter case, the angular momentum of the rotation and revolution have opposite signs, so transfer leads to decreases in the magnitude of each (that cancel each other out).[note 4] In both cases, tidal deceleration causes the moon to spiral in towards the primary until it either is torn apart by tidal stresses, potentially creating a planetary ring system, or crashes into the planet's surface or atmosphere. Such a fate awaits the moons Phobos of Mars (within 30?to?50?million years),[101] Triton of Neptune (in 3.6 billion years),[102] Metis and Adrastea of Jupiter,[103] and at least 16 small satellites of Uranus and Neptune. Uranus's Desdemona may even collide with one of its neighboring moons.[104]\\r\\n\\r\\nA third possibility is where the primary and moon are tidally locked to each other. In that case, the tidal bulge stays directly under the moon, there is no transfer of angular momentum, and the orbital period will not change. Pluto and Charon are an example of this type of configuration.[105]\\r\\n\\r\\nPrior to the 2004 arrival of the CassiniÿHuygens spacecraft, the rings of Saturn were widely thought to be much younger than the Solar System and were not expected to survive beyond another 300?million years. Gravitational interactions with Saturn's moons were expected to gradually sweep the rings' outer edge toward the planet, with abrasion by meteorites and Saturn's gravity eventually taking the rest, leaving Saturn unadorned.[106] However, data from the Cassini mission led scientists to revise that early view. Observations revealed 10?km-wide icy clumps of material that repeatedly break apart and reform, keeping the rings fresh. Saturn's rings are far more massive than the rings of the other giant planets. This large mass is thought to have preserved Saturn's rings since it first formed 4.5?billion years ago, and is likely to preserve them for billions of years to come.[107]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the long term, the greatest changes in the Solar System will come from changes in the Sun itself as it ages. As the Sun burns through its supply of hydrogen fuel, it gets hotter and burns the remaining fuel even faster. As a result, the Sun is growing brighter at a rate of ten percent every 1.1?billion years.[108] In one billion years' time, as the Sun's radiation output increases, its circumstellar habitable zone will move outwards, making the Earth's surface too hot for liquid water to exist there naturally. At this point, all life on land will become extinct.[109] Evaporation of water, a potent greenhouse gas, from the oceans' surface could accelerate temperature increase, potentially ending all life on Earth even sooner.[110] During this time, it is possible that as Mars's surface temperature gradually rises, carbon dioxide and water currently frozen under the surface regolith will release into the atmosphere, creating a greenhouse effect that will heat the planet until it achieves conditions parallel to Earth today, providing a potential future abode for life.[111] By 3.5?billion years from now, Earth's surface conditions will be similar to those of Venus today.[108]\\r\\n\\r\\nAround 5.4?billion years from now, the core of the Sun will become hot enough to trigger hydrogen fusion in its surrounding shell.[109] This will cause the outer layers of the star to expand greatly, and the star will enter a phase of its life in which it is called a red giant.[112][113] Within 7.5?billion years, the Sun will have expanded to a radius of 1.2?AU256 times its current size. At the tip of the red giant branch, as a result of the vastly increased surface area, the Sun's surface will be much cooler (about 2600?K) than now and its luminosity much higherup to 2,700?current solar luminosities. For part of its red giant life, the Sun will have a strong stellar wind that will carry away around 33% of its mass.[109][114][115] During these times, it is possible that Saturn's moon Titan could achieve surface temperatures necessary to support life.[116][117]\\r\\n\\r\\nAs the Sun expands, it will swallow the planets Mercury and Venus.[118] Earth's fate is less clear; although the Sun will envelop Earth's current orbit, the star's loss of mass (and thus weaker gravity) will cause the planets' orbits to move farther out.[109] If it were only for this, Venus and Earth would probably escape incineration,[114] but a 2008 study suggests that Earth will likely be swallowed up as a result of tidal interactions with the Sun's weakly bound outer envelope.[109]\\r\\n\\r\\nGradually, the hydrogen burning in the shell around the solar core will increase the mass of the core until it reaches about 45% of the present solar mass. At this point the density and temperature will become so high that the fusion of helium into carbon will begin, leading to a helium flash; the Sun will shrink from around 250 to 11?times its present (main-sequence) radius. Consequently, its luminosity will decrease from around 3,000 to 54 times its current level, and its surface temperature will increase to about 4770?K. The Sun will become a horizontal giant, burning helium in its core in a stable fashion much like it burns hydrogen today. The helium-fusing stage will last only 100?million years. Eventually, it will have to again resort to the reserves of hydrogen and helium in its outer layers and will expand a second time, turning into what is known as an asymptotic giant. Here the luminosity of the Sun will increase again, reaching about 2,090 present luminosities, and it will cool to about 3500?K.[109] This phase lasts about 30?million years, after which, over the course of a further 100,000?years, the Sun's remaining outer layers will fall away, ejecting a vast stream of matter into space and forming a halo known (misleadingly) as a planetary nebula. The ejected material will contain the helium and carbon produced by the Sun's nuclear reactions, continuing the enrichment of the interstellar medium with heavy elements for future generations of stars.[119]\\r\\n\\r\\nThis is a relatively peaceful event, nothing akin to a supernova, which the Sun is too small to undergo as part of its evolution. Any observer present to witness this occurrence would see a massive increase in the speed of the solar wind, but not enough to destroy a planet completely. However, the star's loss of mass could send the orbits of the surviving planets into chaos, causing some to collide, others to be ejected from the Solar System, and still others to be torn apart by tidal interactions.[120] Afterwards, all that will remain of the Sun is a white dwarf, an extraordinarily dense object, 54% its original mass but only the size of the Earth. Initially, this white dwarf may be 100?times as luminous as the Sun is now. It will consist entirely of degenerate carbon and oxygen, but will never reach temperatures hot enough to fuse these elements. Thus the white dwarf Sun will gradually cool, growing dimmer and dimmer.[121]\\r\\n\\r\\nAs the Sun dies, its gravitational pull on the orbiting bodies such as planets, comets and asteroids will weaken due to its mass loss. All remaining planets' orbits will expand; if Venus, Earth, and Mars still exist, their orbits will lie roughly at 1.4?AU (210,000,000?km), 1.9?AU (280,000,000?km), and 2.8?AU (420,000,000?km). They and the other remaining planets will become dark, frigid hulks, completely devoid of any form of life.[114] They will continue to orbit their star, their speed slowed due to their increased distance from the Sun and the Sun's reduced gravity. Two billion years later, when the Sun has cooled to the 6000ÿ8000K range, the carbon and oxygen in the Sun's core will freeze, with over 90% of its remaining mass assuming a crystalline structure.[122] Eventually, after billions more years, the Sun will finally cease to shine altogether, becoming a black dwarf.[123]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Solar System travels alone through the Milky Way in a circular orbit approximately 30,000?light years from the Galactic Centre. Its speed is about 220?km/s. The period required for the Solar System to complete one revolution around the Galactic Centre, the galactic year, is in the range of 220ÿ250 million years. Since its formation, the Solar System has completed at least 20 such revolutions.[124]\\r\\n\\r\\nVarious scientists have speculated that the Solar System's path through the galaxy is a factor in the periodicity of mass extinctions observed in the Earth's fossil record. One hypothesis supposes that vertical oscillations made by the Sun as it orbits the Galactic Centre cause it to regularly pass through the galactic plane. When the Sun's orbit takes it outside the galactic disc, the influence of the galactic tide is weaker; as it re-enters the galactic disc, as it does every 20ÿ25?million years, it comes under the influence of the far stronger \\"disc tides\\", which, according to mathematical models, increase the flux of Oort cloud comets into the Solar System by a factor of 4, leading to a massive increase in the likelihood of a devastating impact.[125]\\r\\n\\r\\nHowever, others argue that the Sun is currently close to the galactic plane, and yet the last great extinction event was 15 million years ago. Therefore, the Sun's vertical position cannot alone explain such periodic extinctions, and that extinctions instead occur when the Sun passes through the galaxy's spiral arms. Spiral arms are home not only to larger numbers of molecular clouds, whose gravity may distort the Oort cloud, but also to higher concentrations of bright blue giants, which live for relatively short periods and then explode violently as supernovae.[126]\\r\\n\\r\\nAlthough the vast majority of galaxies in the Universe are moving away from the Milky Way, the Andromeda Galaxy, the largest member of the Local Group of galaxies, is heading toward it at about 120?km/s.[127] In 4?billion years, Andromeda and the Milky Way will collide, causing both to deform as tidal forces distort their outer arms into vast tidal tails. If this initial disruption occurs, astronomers calculate a 12% chance that the Solar System will be pulled outward into the Milky Way's tidal tail and a 3% chance that it will become gravitationally bound to Andromeda and thus a part of that galaxy.[127] After a further series of glancing blows, during which the likelihood of the Solar System's ejection rises to 30%,[128] the galaxies' supermassive black holes will merge. Eventually, in roughly 6?billion years, the Milky Way and Andromeda will complete their merger into a giant elliptical galaxy. During the merger, if there is enough gas, the increased gravity will force the gas to the centre of the forming elliptical galaxy. This may lead to a short period of intensive star formation called a starburst.[127] In addition, the infalling gas will feed the newly formed black hole, transforming it into an active galactic nucleus. The force of these interactions will likely push the Solar System into the new galaxy's outer halo, leaving it relatively unscathed by the radiation from these collisions.[127][128]\\r\\n\\r\\nIt is a common misconception that this collision will disrupt the orbits of the planets in the Solar System. Although it is true that the gravity of passing stars can detach planets into interstellar space, distances between stars are so great that the likelihood of the Milky WayÿAndromeda collision causing such disruption to any individual star system is negligible. Although the Solar System as a whole could be affected by these events, the Sun and planets are not expected to be disturbed.[129]\\r\\n\\r\\nHowever, over time, the cumulative probability of a chance encounter with a star increases, and disruption of the planets becomes all but inevitable. Assuming that the Big Crunch or Big Rip scenarios for the end of the Universe do not occur, calculations suggest that the gravity of passing stars will have completely stripped the dead Sun of its remaining planets within 1?quadrillion (1015) years. This point marks the end of the Solar System. Although the Sun and planets may survive, the Solar System, in any meaningful sense, will cease to exist.[3]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe time frame of the Solar System's formation has been determined using radiometric dating. Scientists estimate that the Solar System is 4.6?billion years old. The oldest known mineral grains on Earth are approximately 4.4?billion years old.[130] Rocks this old are rare, as Earth's surface is constantly being reshaped by erosion, volcanism, and plate tectonics. To estimate the age of the Solar System, scientists use meteorites, which were formed during the early condensation of the solar nebula. Almost all meteorites (see the Canyon Diablo meteorite) are found to have an age of 4.6?billion years, suggesting that the Solar System must be at least this old.[131]\\r\\n\\r\\nStudies of discs around other stars have also done much to establish a time frame for Solar System formation. Stars between one and three million years old have discs rich in gas, whereas discs around stars more than 10?million years old have little to no gas, suggesting that giant planets within them have ceased forming.[30]\\r\\n\\r\\nNote: All dates and times in this chronology are approximate and should be taken as an order of magnitude indicator only.\\r\\n\\r\\nSolar System?L Local Interstellar Cloud?L Local Bubble?L Gould Belt?L Orion Arm?L Milky Way?L Milky Way subgroup?L Local Group?L Virgo Supercluster?L Laniakea Supercluster?L Observable universe?L UniverseEach arrow (L) may be read as \\"within\\" or \\"part of\\".","input":"When did the earth and solar system form?"},{"output":"having the highest tidal range in the world","context":"The Bay of Fundy (French: Baie de Fundy) is a bay on the Atlantic coast of North America, on the northeast end of the Gulf of Maine between the Canadian provinces of New Brunswick and Nova Scotia, with a small portion touching the U.S. state of Maine. Some sources believe the name \\"Fundy\\" is a corruption of the French word Fendu, meaning \\"split\\",[1] while others believe it comes from the Portuguese funda, meaning \\"deep\\".[2] The bay was also named Baie Fran?aise (French Bay) by explorer-cartographer Samuel de Champlain during a 1604 expedition led by Pierre Dugua, Sieur de Monts which resulted in a failed settlement attempt on St. Croix Island.\\r\\nThe Bay of Fundy is known for having the highest tidal range in the world. Rivaled by Ungava Bay in northern Quebec, King Sound in Western Australia, Gulf of Khambhat in India, and the Severn Estuary in the UK, it has one of the highest vertical tidal ranges in the world. The Guinness Book of World Records (1975) declared that Burntcoat Head, Nova Scotia has the highest tides in the world:\\r\\nThe Natural World, Greatest Tides: The greatest tides in the world occur in the Bay of Fundy.... Burntcoat Head in the Minas Basin, Nova Scotia, has the greatest mean spring range with 14.5 metres (47.5 feet) and an extreme range of 16.3 metres (53.5 feet).\\r\\nPortions of the Bay of Fundy, Shepody Bay and Minas Basin, form one of six Canadian sites in the Western Hemisphere Shorebird Reserve Network, and are classified as a Hemispheric site.[3] It is administered by the provinces of New Brunswick and Nova Scotia, and the Canadian Wildlife Service, and is managed in conjunction with Ducks Unlimited Canada and the Nature Conservancy of Canada.\\r\\nIn July 2009, the Bay of Fundy was named as a finalist for the New 7 Wonders of Nature contest that ended in November 2011. It was not chosen as a wonder.[4]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe International Hydrographic Organization defines the southwest limit of the Bay of Fundy as \\"A line running northwesterly from Cape St. Mary (4405'N) Nova Scotia, through Machias Seal Island (6706'W) and on to Little River Head (4439'N) in the State of Maine\\".[5]\\r\\nThe Bay of Fundy is known for its high tidal range. The quest for world tidal dominance has led to a rivalry between the Minas Basin in the Bay of Fundy and the Leaf Basin in Ungava Bay, over which body of water lays claim to the highest tides in the world, with supporters in each region claiming the record.\\r\\nThe Canadian Hydrographic Service finally declared it a statistical tie, with measurements of a 16.8-metre (55-foot) tidal range in Leaf Basin for Ungava Bay and 17 meters (56 feet) at Burntcoat Head for the Bay of Fundy.[6] The highest water level ever recorded in the Bay of Fundy system occurred at the head of the Minas Basin on the night of October 4ÿ5, 1869 during a tropical cyclone named the Saxby Gale. The water level of 21.6 meters (71 feet) resulted from the combination of high winds, abnormally low atmospheric pressure, and a spring tide.\\r\\nLeaf Basin has only been measured in recent years, whereas the Fundy system has been measured for many decades. The tide at Leaf Basin is higher on average than tides at Minas Basin; however, the highest recorded tidal ranges ever measured are at Burntcoat Head and result from spring tides measured at the peak of the tidal cycle every 18 years.\\r\\nTraditional Mi'kmaq folklore states that the tides in the Bay of Fundy are caused by a giant whale splashing in the water. Oceanographers attribute it to tidal resonance resulting from a coincidence of timing: the time it takes a large wave to go from the mouth of the bay to the inner shore and back is practically the same as the time from one high tide to the next. During the 12.4-hour tidal period, 115 billion tonnes of water flow in and out of the bay.[7]\\r\\nThe tides in the Bay of Fundy are semidiurnal, which means that they have two highs and two lows each day.[8] The height that the water rises and falls to each day during these tides are approximately equal.[9] There are approximately six hours and thirteen minutes between each high and low tide.[10]\\r\\nAlternative forms of energy are being explored in depth in a number of unique areas. Tidal energy harnesses the movement of ocean water to generate electricity through a number of mechanisms. Currently a process of gathering tidal energy called \\"In-stream turbine technology\\" is being tested in the Minas Passage, Nova Scotia. This project is being spearheaded by the Fundy Ocean Research Center for Energy or FORCE.[11]\\r\\nIn-stream tidal turbine technology is a relatively simple design. An elevated turbine is submerged under water in a location that enables its movement with tidal cycles. As the blades of the turbine move they create energy that powers an electric generator at the base. From here the power travels to a cable attached to the seafloor and back to an offsite facility where it can be added to the power grid.[12]\\r\\nWhile this technology has shown to be successful in its early stages of testing, FORCE has not officially begun the process for energy collection. However, the installation of the undersea cable in December 2013 indicates that the project is moving along swiftly.[13]\\r\\nA megawatt-scale turbine was installed at Cape Sharp near Partridge Island in November 2016. Project managers intend to install 16 MW by 2017, and 300 MW by 2020.[14]\\r\\nThe Bay of Fundy lies in a rift valley called the Fundy Basin; as the rift began to separate from mainland North America, volcanic activity occurred, forming volcanoes and flood basalts. These flood basalts poured out over the landscape, covering much of southern Nova Scotia. Sections of the flood basalts have been eroded away, but still form a basaltic mountain range known as North Mountain. As a result, much of the basin floor is made of tholeiitic basalts giving its brown color. The rift valley eventually failed (see aulacogen) as the Mid-Atlantic Ridge continued to separate North America, Europe, and Africa.\\r\\nThe upper part of the bay splits into Chignecto Bay in the northeast and the Minas Basin in the east. Chignecto Bay is further subdivided into Cumberland Basin and Shepody Bay and the extreme eastern portion of Minas Basin is called Cobequid Bay. Some of these upper reaches exhibit exposed red bay muds, for which the Bay of Fundy is noted (for their appearance and biological productivity).\\r\\nCape Chignecto defines Chignecto Bay whereas Cape Split defines the Minas Channel, leading to the Minas Basin. The Minas Channel connects the Minas Basin with the main body of the bay. The channel is 5.6 kilometers across and approximately 106.7 meters deep.[9] The tides that flow through the channel are very powerful. They are as powerful as 8000 train engines or 25 million horses.[15] Facing Cape Split at the entrance to the Minas Channel are the basalt cliffs of Cape d'Or.\\r\\nThe lower part of the bay is also home to four important sub-basins: Passamaquoddy Bay and Back Bay on the New Brunswick shore, Cobscook Bay on the Maine shore, and the Annapolis Basin on the Nova Scotia shore.\\r\\nThe bay is home to several islands, the largest of which is Grand Manan at the boundary with the Gulf of Maine. Other important islands on the north side of the bay include Campobello Island, Moose Island, and Deer Island in the Passamaquoddy Bay area. Brier Island and Long Island can be found on the south side of the bay while Isle Haute is in the upper bay off Cape Chignecto. Smaller islands and islets also exist in Passamaquoddy Bay, Back Bay, and Annapolis Basin. The Five Islands, in the Minas Basin, are particularly scenic.\\r\\nThe Bay of Fundy is also home to another interesting geologic feature, the Hopewell Rocks formation. This formation is where the famous flower-pot rocks are located on a short, one kilometer long portion of Shepody Bay.[16] These rocks are shaped by the tides, the strength of the rocks, and the presence of the joints in the rocks. The rock in the cliffs the stacks are being cut from are arkosic sandstone and coarse poorly sorted conglomerates. The tides that are eroding away the cliffs are between 10.7 meters and 14.7 meters high on average.[16]\\r\\nThe bay receives the waters of several rivers, including:\\r\\nNew Brunswick\\r\\nNova Scotia\\r\\nThe bay's extreme tidal range causes several interesting phenomena in the various rivers which empty into it.\\r\\nNear the mouth of the Saint John River, where it passes through the city of Saint John, is the famous Reversing Falls. Here the changing tide causes alternating strong upriver and downriver flows several times a day as the tidal cycle changes. A narrow granite gorge and rocky bottom heavily restricts waterflow and creates strong rapids that flow upriver at high tide, and downriver at low tide.\\r\\nRivers in the upper Bay of Fundy have a smaller flow-rate than the Saint John, and a shallower slope. As a result, extensive mud flats are deposited throughout the tidal range of the rivers.\\r\\nAnother phenomenon which occurs in these rivers of the upper bay is a \\"tidal bore\\", where a wave front of water \\"bores\\" its way up a river against its normal flow.[17] The narrow and shallow river estuaries around the upper Bay of Fundy regularly produce bores when the advancing tide is slowed by shallow waters creating a build-up with a steep surge of advancing water. Tidal bores are found on the Salmon River at Truro, the Petitcodiac River at Moncton as well as on the Shubenacadie River, the St. Croix River, the Maccan River, Kennetcook River and at River Herbert.[18]\\r\\nOne of the better examples of a tidal bore can be seen on the Shubenacadie River near the town of Truro and the village of Maitland, where local ecotourism operators offer the chance to experience rafting the bore upriver. Another good example of a tidal bore may be viewed on the Salmon River in the town of Truro. The once-famous tidal bores on the Petitcodiac and Avon rivers have been severely disrupted as a result of causeway construction in the 1960sÿ1970s which have caused excessive siltation.\\r\\nThe largest population centre on the bay is the New Brunswick city of Saint John.\\r\\nThe New Brunswick towns of St. Andrews, Blacks Harbour, St. Martins and Sackville as well as the Nova Scotia towns of Amherst, Parrsboro, Truro, Windsor, Wolfville, Annapolis Royal, and Digby are also on the bay.\\r\\nThe Mi'kmaq fished in the Bay of Fundy and lived in communities around the bay for centuries before the first Europeans arrived and continue to live and work around the Bay. The first European settlement was at ?le-Saint-Croix and then Port Royal was founded by Pierre Dugua, Sieur de Mons and Samuel de Champlain in 1605. The village was the first permanent European settlement north of St. Augustine, Florida. (Two years later, the English made their first permanent settlement in Jamestown, Virginia.) Approximately seventy-five years after Port Royal was founded, Acadians migrated from the capital and established what would become the other major Acadian settlements before the Expulsion of the Acadians: Grand-Pr, Chignecto, Cobequid (present-day Truro, Nova Scotia) and Pisiguit (present-day Windsor, Nova Scotia).[19]\\r\\nThere were numerous naval battles as well as naval attacks on the settlements surrounding the Bay of Fundy. Port Royal was raided numerous times during the Acadian Civil War. There were also numerous battles and raids during six wars that engulfed the region over a period of 75 years: the four French and Indian Wars, Father Rale's War and Father Le Loutre's War. During King William's War, there was the naval Action of July 14, 1696 off Saint John, New Brunswick and Major Benjamin Church arrived by sea from Boston and raided various Acadian communities around the Bay (See Raid on Chignecto (1696)). During Queen Anne's War, Church attacked the Acadian communities around the Bay again (See Raid on Grand Pr).[19]\\r\\nDuring Father Le Loutre's War, there were naval assaults on the communities of Chignecto (See Battle at Chignecto) and the Acadian Exodus from the Cobequid. Finally, during the last French and Indian War, the British expelled the Acadians in the Bay of Fundy Campaign (1755), which was followed three years later with campaigns which targeted the Saint John River and the Petitcodiac River.[20]\\r\\nDuring the American Revolution, the upper reaches of the Basin saw a significant rebellion and battle at the Siege of Fort Cumberland and American attacks at Saint John, New Brunswick as well as numerous privateering raids against towns like Annapolis Royal, Nova Scotia. After the War, the boundary between the United States and the newly created province of New Brunswick remained uncertain, resulting in a thriving smuggling trade in the region, especially on the waters of Passamaquoddy Bay.[21] The Bay saw some action during the War of 1812 as well, mostly in the form of privateering and small patrol ships.[22] After the War of 1812, the smuggling resumed and culminated in the so-called \\"plaster war\\" of 1820.\\r\\nThe Bay of Fundy's ports and basins became major shipbuilding and shipping centres in the 19th Century. Led at first by shipbuilders like James Moran of St. Martins, New Brunswick, shipbuilding to all shores of the Bay of Fundy and eventually included shipbuilders such as Joseph Salter in Moncton and William D. Lawrence of Maitland, Nova Scotia who build some of the larges sailing ships ever constructed in Canada. Among other accomplishments, Fundy ports produced the fastest ship in the world, the ship Marco Polo; the largest wooden ship ever built in Canada, the ship William D. Lawrence; and the first female sea captain in the western world, Molly Kool of Alma, New Brunswick. The fabled mystery ship the Mary Celeste was also built on the Bay.\\r\\nThe port of Saint John gives access to the pulp and paper industry and the Irving oil refinery. Hantsport, Nova Scotia, on the Avon River is also home to a pulp and paper mill and is the shipment point for raw gypsum exports to the United States. The ports of Bayside, Charlotte County, (near St. Andrews) and Eastport, Maine, are important local ports.\\r\\nA result of shipping traffic has been the potential for increased collisions between ships and the North Atlantic right whale. In 2003, the Canadian Coast Guard adjusted shipping lanes crossing prime whale feeding areas at the entrance to the Bay of Fundy to lessen the risk of collision.\\r\\nThe bay is also traversed by several passenger and automobile ferry services:\\r\\nA number of parks preserve and interpret the Bay of Fundy's coastal ecosystem. They include Fundy National Park in New Brunswick and Cape Chignecto Provincial Park and Five Islands Provincial Park and Blomidon Provincial Park in Nova Scotia. The Canadian Wildlife Service maintains a number of National Wildlife Areas in the Bay of Fundy including a proposed designation of Isle Haute in the middle of the Bay.\\r\\nCoordinates: 4500N 6545W? / ?45.000N 65.750W? / 45.000; -65.750","input":"What is the bay of fundy known for?"},{"output":"the Caddo word taysha (or tayshas) meaning \\"friends\\" or \\"allies\\"","context":"","input":"What is the origin of the name texas?"},{"output":"coffee","context":"","input":"Brazil is the world's largest exporter of what crop?"},{"output":"Dean Ambrose","context":"The WWE Raw Tag Team Championship is a professional wrestling world tag team championship created and promoted by the American professional wrestling promotion WWE on the Raw brand.

The current champions are Dean Ambrose and Seth Rollins, who are in their first reign as a team. Individually, this is the first reign for Dean Ambrose, and the second reign for Seth Rollins.\\r\\nThe championship was originally established as the WWE Tag Team Championship on October 20, 2002, and the team of Kurt Angle and Chris Benoit were the inaugural champions. It was introduced for the SmackDown brand as a second title for tag teams in the promotion to complement WWE's original World Tag Team Championship, which became exclusive to Raw. Both titles were unified in 2009 and were collectively referred to as the \\"Unified WWE Tag Team Championship\\" while officially remaining independently active until the World Tag Team Championship was formally decommissioned in 2010. As a result of the 2016 draft, the championship became exclusive to Raw with a subsequent rename, and SmackDown created the SmackDown Tag Team Championship as a counterpart title.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter the company's initial brand extension in the spring of 2002, the original World Tag Team Championship was reassigned that following summer to appear and be defended exclusively on the Raw brand, leaving the SmackDown brand without a tag team title. As a result, then-SmackDown General Manager Stephanie McMahon introduced the WWE Tag Team Championship and commissioned it to be the tag team title for the SmackDown brand. She stated that the inaugural champions would be determined from an eight-team tournament. On October 20, 2002, the team of Kurt Angle and Chris Benoit defeated Rey Mysterio and Edge at No Mercy in the tournament final to become the inaugural WWE Tag Team Champions.[1]\\r\\nOn October 17, 2007, SmackDown and ECW announced a talent sharing agreement that enabled talent from either brand's roster to compete on both brands. As a result, the title became eligible to be contended and defended on both brands. In late 2008 through early 2009, then-WWE Tag Team Champions The Col܇ns (Carlito and Primo) engaged in rivalry with then-World Tag Team Champions John Morrison and The Miz, which resulted in the announcement on the March 17 episode of ECW that at WrestleMania XXV, both teams would defend their titles against each other and the winning team would hold both titles.[2] The Col܇ns defeated Morrison and Miz, and thus unified the titles into what became known as the Unified WWE Tag Team Championship, the umbrella term for what officially remained two active championships that were now collectively defended.[3]\\r\\nThe championships would be defended as the Unified WWE Tag Team Championship on any brand until August 2010. That month, the Anonymous Raw General Manager announced that the World Tag Team Championship would be decommissioned and combined into the WWE Tag Team Championship, which received a new, single set of championship belts, which were presented to then-champions The Hart Dynasty by Bret Hart. The belts featured a centerpiece dominated by two Spartan helmets, with two side plates on either side, the first side plate with the WWE logo, and the second with a helmet; the plates were bronze colored and the straps were black. The WWE Tag Team Championship became the sole tag team championship in WWE and was defended on any brand. The first brand extension ended in August 2011.[4] In August 2014, the WWE Tag Team Championship belts, along with all other pre-existing championship belts in WWE at the time, received a minor update, replacing the long-standing scratch logo with WWE's new logo originally used for the WWE Network.\\r\\nFollowing the reintroduction of the brand extension in July 2016, then-champions The New Day were drafted to the Raw brand, making the championship exclusive to Raw. In response, SmackDown created the SmackDown Tag Team Championship on August 23, 2016. The WWE Tag Team Championship was subsequently renamed to reflect its exclusivity to Raw.[1] The championship's belt design was updated on December 19, 2016; the basic design is the same, but with silver plates on red straps, countering the silver plates on blue straps design of the SmackDown Tag Team Championship belts.\\r\\nFollowing the events of the WWE brand extension, an annual WWE draft was established, in which select members of the WWE roster are reassigned to a different brand.[5] After the WWE Tag Team Championship was unified with the World Tag Team Championship as the Unified WWE Tag Team Championship, the champions could appear and defend the titles on any WWE brand.[6] The titles were combined as the WWE Tag Team Championship in August 2010 with a single set of belts, and continued to be defended on any brand.[7] The brand extension was discontinued on August 29, 2011, but it was revived on July 19, 2016. The following is a list of dates indicating the transitions of the WWE (Raw) Tag Team Championship between the Raw, SmackDown, and ECW brands.\\r\\nThe inaugural champions were Kurt Angle and Chris Benoit. John Cena and The Miz's 9-minute reign is the shortest in the title's history, while The New Day (Big E, Kofi Kingston, and Xavier Woods) have the longest single reign at 483 days, and the longest combined reign at 532 days (WWE recognizes their combined reign as 533 days).\\r\\nDean Ambrose and Seth Rollins are the current champions in their first reign as a team.

The latest version is macOS High Sierra, which was publicly released in September 2017.\\r\\n\\r\\nBetween 1999 and 2009, Apple sold a separate series of operating systems called Mac OS X Server. The initial version, Mac?OS?X Server 1.0, was released in 1999 with a user interface similar to Mac OS 8.5.  After this, new versions were introduced concurrently with the desktop version of Mac OS X. Beginning with Mac OS X 10.7 Lion, the server functions were made available as a separate package on the Mac App Store.[11]\\r\\n\\r\\nmacOS is based on technologies developed between 1985 and 1997 at NeXT, a company that Apple co-founder Steve Jobs created after leaving the company. The \\"X\\" in Mac OS X and OS X is the Roman numeral for the number 10 and is pronounced as such. The X was a prominent part of the operating system's brand identity and marketing in its early years, but gradually receded in prominence since the release of Snow Leopard in 2009. UNIX 03 certification was achieved for the Intel version of Mac OS X 10.5 Leopard[12] and all releases from Mac OS X 10.6 Snow Leopard up to the current version also have UNIX 03 certification.[13][14][15][16][17][18][19][20] macOS shares its Unix-based core, named Darwin, and many of its frameworks with iOS,[21] tvOS and watchOS. A heavily modified version of Mac OS X 10.4 Tiger was used for the first-generation Apple TV.[22]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nReleases of Mac OS X from 1999 to 2005 can run only on the PowerPC-based Macs from that time period. After Apple announced that they were switching to Intel CPUs from 2006 onwards, a separate version of Mac OS X 10.4 Tiger was made and distributed exclusively with early Intel-based Macs; it included an emulator known as Rosetta, which allowed users to run most PowerPC applications on Intel-based Macs. Mac OS X 10.5 Leopard was the sole release to be built as a universal binary, meaning that the installer disc supported both Intel and PowerPC processors. Mac OS X 10.6 Snow Leopard was the first release to be available exclusively for Intel-based Macs. In 2011, Apple released Mac OS X 10.7 Lion, which no longer supported 32-bit Intel processors and also did not include Rosetta. All versions of the system released since then run exclusively on 64-bit Intel CPUs and do not support PowerPC applications.\\r\\nThe heritage of what would become macOS had originated at NeXT, a company founded by Steve Jobs following his departure from Apple in 1985. There, the Unix-like NeXTSTEP operating system was developed, and then launched in 1989. The kernel of NeXTSTEP is based upon the Mach kernel, which was originally developed at Carnegie Mellon University, with additional kernel layers and low-level user space code derived from parts of BSD. Its graphical user interface was built on top of an object-oriented GUI toolkit using the Objective-C programming language.\\r\\n\\r\\nThroughout the early 1990s, Apple had tried to create a \\"next-generation\\" OS to succeed its classic Mac OS through the Taligent, Copland and Gershwin projects, but all of them were eventually abandoned.[23] This led Apple to purchase NeXT in 1996, allowing NeXTSTEP, then called OPENSTEP, to serve as the basis for Apple's next generation operating system.[24]\\r\\nThis purchase also led to Steve Jobs returning to Apple as an interim, and then the permanent CEO, shepherding the transformation of the programmer-friendly OPENSTEP into a system that would be adopted by Apple's primary market of home users and creative professionals. The project was first code named \\"Rhapsody\\" and then officially named Mac OS X.[25][26]\\r\\n\\r\\nMac OS X was originally presented as the tenth major version of Apple's operating system for Macintosh computers; current versions of macOS retain the major version number \\"10\\". Previous Macintosh operating systems (versions of the classic Mac OS) were named using Arabic numerals, as with Mac OS 8 and Mac OS 9. The letter \\"X\\" in Mac OS X's name refers to the number 10, a Roman numeral. It is therefore correctly pronounced \\"ten\\" in this context.[27][28] However, it is also commonly pronounced like the letter \\"X\\".[29]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe first version of Mac OS X, Mac OS X Server 1.0, was a transitional product, featuring an interface resembling the classic Mac OS, though it was not compatible with software designed for the older system. Consumer releases of Mac OS X included more backward compatibility. Mac OS applications could be rewritten to run natively via the Carbon API; many could also be run directly through the Classic Environment with a reduction in performance.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe consumer version of Mac OS X was launched in 2001 with Mac OS X 10.0. Reviews were variable, with extensive praise for its sophisticated, glossy Aqua interface but criticizing it for sluggish performance.[30] With Apple's popularity at a low, the makers of several classic Mac applications such as FrameMaker and PageMaker declined to develop new versions of their software for Mac OS X.[31] Ars Technica columnist John Siracusa, who reviewed every major OS X release up to 10.10, described the early releases in retrospect as 'dog-slow, feature poor' and Aqua as 'unbearably slow and a huge resource hog'.[30][32][33]\\r\\n\\r\\nApple rapidly developed several new releases of Mac OS X.[34] Siracusa's review of version 10.3, Panther, noted \\"It's strange to have gone from years of uncertainty and vaporware to a steady annual supply of major new operating system releases.\\"[35] Version 10.4, Tiger, reportedly shocked executives at Microsoft by offering a number of features, such as fast file searching and improved graphics processing, that Microsoft had spent several years struggling to add to Windows with acceptable performance.[36]\\r\\n\\r\\nAs the operating system evolved, it moved away from the classic Mac OS, with applications being added and removed.[37] Considering music to be a key market, Apple developed the iPod music player and music software for the Mac, including iTunes and GarageBand.[38] Targeting the consumer and media markets, Apple emphasized its new \\"digital lifestyle\\" applications such as the iLife suite, integrated home entertainment through the Front Row media center and the Safari web browser. With increasing popularity of the internet, Apple offered additional online services, including the .Mac, MobileMe and most recently iCloud products. It later began selling third-party applications through the Mac App Store.\\r\\n\\r\\nNewer versions of Mac OS X also included modifications to the general interface, moving away from the striped gloss and transparency of the initial versions. Some applications began to use a brushed metal appearance, or non-pinstriped titlebar appearance in version 10.4.[39] In Leopard, Apple announced a unification of the interface, with a standardized gray-gradient window style.[40][41]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 2006, the first Intel Macs released used a specialized version of Mac OS X 10.4 Tiger.[42]\\r\\n\\r\\nA key development for the system was the announcement and release of the iPhone from 2007 onwards. While Apple's previous iPod media players used a minimal operating system, the iPhone used an operating system based on Mac OS X, which would later be called \\"iPhone OS\\" and then iOS. The simultaneous release of two operating systems based on the same frameworks placed tension on Apple, which cited the iPhone as forcing it to delay Mac OS X 10.5 Leopard.[43] However, after Apple opened the iPhone to third-party developers its commercial success drew attention to Mac OS X, with many iPhone software developers showing interest in Mac development.[44]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 2007, Mac OS X 10.5 Leopard was the sole release with universal binary components, allowing installation on both Intel Macs and select PowerPC Macs.[45] It is also the final release with PowerPC Mac support. Mac OS X 10.6 Snow Leopard was the first version of OS X to be built exclusively for Intel Macs, and the final release with 32-bit Intel Mac support.[46] The name was intended to signal its status as an iteration of Leopard, focusing on technical and performance improvements rather than user-facing features; indeed it was explicitly branded to developers as being a 'no new features' release.[47] Since its release, several OS X or macOS releases (namely OS X Mountain Lion, OS X El Capitan and macOS High Sierra) follow this pattern, with a name derived from its predecessor, similar to the 'tick-tock model' used by Intel.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn two succeeding versions, Lion and Mountain Lion, Apple moved some applications to a highly skeuomorphic style of design inspired by contemporary versions of iOS, at the same time simplifying some elements by making controls such as scroll bars fade out when not in use.[32] This direction was, like brushed metal interfaces, unpopular with some users, although it continued a trend of greater animation and variety in the interface previously seen in design aspects such as the Time Machine backup utility, which presented past file versions against a swirling nebula, and the glossy translucent dock of Leopard and Snow Leopard.[48] In addition, with Mac OS X 10.7 Lion, Apple ceased to release separate server versions of Mac OS X, selling server tools as a separate downloadable application through the Mac App Store. A review described the trend in the server products as becoming \\"cheaper and simpler... shifting its focus from large businesses to small ones.\\"[49]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 2012, with the release of OS X 10.8 Mountain Lion, the name of the system was shortened from Mac OS X to OS X. That year, Apple removed the head of OS X development, Scott Forstall, and design was changed towards a more minimal direction.[50] Apple's new user interface design, using deep color saturation, text-only buttons and a minimal, 'flat' interface, was debuted with iOS 7 in 2013. With OS X engineers reportedly working on iOS 7, the version released in 2013, OS X 10.9 Mavericks, was something of a transitional release, with some of the skeuomorphic design removed, while most of the general interface of Mavericks remained unchanged.[51] The next version, OS X 10.10 Yosemite, adopted a design similar to iOS 7 but with greater complexity suitable for an interface controlled with a mouse.[52]\\r\\n\\r\\nFrom 2012 onwards, the system has shifted to an annual release schedule similar to that of iOS. It also steadily cut the cost of updates from Snow Leopard onwards, before removing upgrade fees altogether from 2013 onwards.[53] Some journalists and third-party software developers have suggested that this decision, while allowing more rapid feature release, meant less opportunity to focus on stability, with no version of OS X recommendable for users requiring stability and performance above new features.[54] Apple's 2015 update, OS X 10.11 El Capitan, was announced to focus specifically on stability and performance improvements.[55]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 2016, with the release of macOS 10.12 Sierra, the name was changed from OS X to macOS to streamline it with the branding of Apple's other primary operating systems: iOS, watchOS, and tvOS.[56] macOS 10.12 Sierra's main features are the introduction of Siri to macOS, Optimized Storage, improvements to included applications, and greater integration with Apple's iPhone and Apple Watch. The Apple File System (APFS) was announced at the Apple Worldwide Developers Conference in 2016 as a replacement for HFS+, a highly criticized file system.[57] At the 2017 Worldwide Developers Conference Apple previewed macOS 10.13 High Sierra.  It uses APFS, rather than HFS+, on solid state drives.[citation needed]\\r\\n\\r\\nAt macOS's core is a POSIX compliant operating system built on top of the XNU kernel, with standard Unix facilities available from the command line interface. Apple has released this family of software as a free and open source operating system named Darwin. On top of Darwin, Apple layered a number of components, including the Aqua interface and the Finder, to complete the GUI-based operating system which is macOS.[58]\\r\\n\\r\\nWith its original introduction as Mac OS X, the system brought a number of new capabilities to provide a more stable and reliable platform than its predecessor, the classic Mac OS. For example, pre-emptive multitasking and memory protection improved the system's ability to run multiple applications simultaneously without them interrupting or corrupting each other.[59]\\r\\nMany aspects of macOS's architecture are derived from OPENSTEP, which was designed to be portable, to ease the transition from one platform to another. For example, NeXTSTEP was ported from the original 68k-based NeXT workstations to x86 and other architectures before NeXT was purchased by Apple,[60]\\r\\nand OPENSTEP was later ported to the PowerPC architecture as part of the Rhapsody project.\\r\\n\\r\\nPrior to macOS High Sierra, and on drives other than solid state drives (SSDs), the default file system is HFS+, which it inherited from the classic Mac OS. Operating system designer Linus Torvalds has criticized HFS+, saying it is \\"probably the worst file system ever\\", whose design is \\"actively corrupting user data\\". He criticized the case insensitivity of file names, a design made worse when Apple extended the file system to support Unicode.[61][62] Initially, HFS+ was designed for classic Mac OS, which runs on big-endian 68K and PowerPC systems. When Apple switched Macintosh to little-endian Intel processors, it continued to use big-endian byte order on HFS+ file systems. As a result, macOS on current Macs must do byte swap when it reads file system data.[63][64] These concerns are being addressed with the new Apple File System, which is used for file systems on SSDs in macOS High Sierra.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Darwin subsystem in macOS is in charge of managing the file system, which includes the Unix permissions layer. In 2003 and 2005, two Macworld editors expressed criticism of the permission scheme; Ted Landau called misconfigured permissions \\"the most common frustration\\" in macOS, while Rob Griffiths suggested that some users may even have to reset permissions every day, a process which can take up to 15 minutes.[65] More recently, another Macworld editor, Dan Frakes, called the procedure of repairing permissions vastly overused.[66] He argues that macOS typically handles permissions properly without user interference, and resetting permissions should only be tried when problems emerge.[67]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe architecture of macOS incorporates a layered design:[68]\\r\\nthe layered frameworks aid rapid development of applications by providing existing code for common tasks.[69] Apple provides its own software development tools, most prominently an integrated development environment called Xcode. Xcode provides interfaces to compilers that support several programming languages including C, C++, Objective-C, and Swift. For the AppleÿIntel transition, it was modified so that developers could build their applications as a universal binary, which provides compatibility with both the Intel-based and PowerPC-based Macintosh lines.[70] First and third-party applications can be controlled programatically using the AppleScript framework,[71] retained from the classic Mac OS,[72] or using the newer Automator application that offers pre-written tasks that do not require programming knowledge.[73]\\r\\n\\r\\nApple offered two main APIs to develop software natively for macOS: Cocoa and Carbon. Cocoa was a descendant of APIs inherited from OPENSTEP with no ancestry from the classic Mac OS, while Carbon was an adaptation of classic Mac OS APIs, allowing Mac software to be minimally rewritten in order to run natively on Mac OS X.[26]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Cocoa API was created as the result of a 1993 collaboration between NeXT Computer and Sun Microsystems. This heritage is highly visible for Cocoa developers, since the \\"NS\\" prefix is ubiquitous in the framework, standing variously for NeXTSTEP or NeXT/Sun. The official OPENSTEP API, published in September 1994, was the first to split the API between Foundation and ApplicationKit and the first to use the \\"NS\\" prefix.[60] Traditionally, Cocoa programs have been mostly written in Objective-C, with Java as an alternative. However, on July 11, 2005, Apple announced that \\"features added to Cocoa in Mac OS X versions later than 10.4 will not be added to the Cocoa-Java programming interface.\\"[83] macOS also used to support the Java Platform as a \\"preferred software package\\"in practice this means that applications written in Java fit as neatly into the operating system as possible while still being cross-platform compatible, and that graphical user interfaces written in Swing look almost exactly like native Cocoa interfaces. Since 2014, Apple has promoted its new programming language Swift as the preferred language for software development on Apple platforms.\\r\\n\\r\\nApple's original plan with macOS was to require all developers to rewrite their software into the Cocoa APIs. This caused much outcry among existing Mac developers, who threatened to abandon the platform rather than invest in a costly rewrite, and the idea was shelved.[26][84] To permit a smooth transition from Mac OS 9 to Mac OS X, the Carbon Application Programming Interface (API) was created.[26] Applications written with Carbon were initially able to run natively on both classic Mac OS and Mac OS X, although this ability was later dropped as Mac OS X developed. Carbon was not included in the first product sold as Mac OS X: the little-used original release of Mac OS X Server 1.0, which also did not include the Aqua interface.[85] Apple limited further development of Carbon from the release of Leopard onwards, announcing Carbon applications would not receive the ability to run at 64-bit.[84][26] A number of macOS applications continued to use Carbon for some time afterwards, especially ones with heritage dating back to the classic Mac OS and for which updates would be difficult, uneconomic or not necessary. This included Microsoft Office up to Office 2016, and Photoshop up to CS5.[86][84] Early versions of macOS could also run some classic Mac OS applications through the Classic Environment with performance limitations; this feature was removed from 10.5 onwards and all Macs using Intel processors.\\r\\n\\r\\nBecause macOS is POSIX compliant, many software packages written for the other Unix-like systems including Linux can be recompiled to run on it, including much scientific and technical software.[87] Third-party projects such as Homebrew, Fink, MacPorts and pkgsrc provide pre-compiled or pre-formatted packages. Apple and others have provided versions of the X Window System graphical interface which can allow these applications to run with an approximation of the macOS look-and-feel.[88][89][90] The current Apple-endorsed method is the open-source XQuartz project; earlier versions could use the X11 application provided by Apple, or before that the XDarwin project.[91]\\r\\n\\r\\nApplications can be distributed to Macs and installed by the user from any source and by any method such as downloading (with or without code signing, available via an Apple developer account) or through the Mac App Store, a marketplace of software maintained by Apple by way of a process requiring the company's approval. Apps installed through the Mac App Store run within a sandbox, restricting their ability to exchange information with other applications or modify the core operating system and its features. This has been cited as an advantage, by allowing users to install apps with confidence that they should not be able to damage their system, but also as a disadvantage due to blocking the Mac App Store's use for professional applications that require elevated privileges.[92][93] Applications without any code signature cannot be run by default except from a computer's administrator account.[94][95]\\r\\n\\r\\nApple produces macOS applications, some of which are included and some sold separately. This includes iWork, Final Cut Pro, Logic Pro, iLife, and the database application FileMaker. Numerous other developers also offer software for macOS.\\r\\n\\r\\nTools such as XPostFacto and patches applied to the installation media have been developed by third parties to enable installation of newer versions of macOS on systems not officially supported by Apple. This includes a number of pre-G3 Power Macintosh systems that can be made to run up to and including Mac OS X 10.2 Jaguar, all G3-based Macs which can run up to and including Tiger, and sub-867?MHz G4 Macs can run Leopard by removing the restriction from the installation DVD or entering a command in the Mac's Open Firmware interface to tell the Leopard Installer that it has a clock rate of 867?MHz or greater. Except for features requiring specific hardware such as graphics acceleration or DVD writing, the operating system offers the same functionality on all supported hardware.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs most Mac hardware components, or components similar to those, since the Intel transition are available for purchase,[99] some technology-capable groups have developed software to install macOS on non-Apple computers. These are referred to as Hackintoshes, a portmanteau of the words \\"hack\\" and \\"Macintosh\\". This violates Apple's EULA (and is therefore unsupported by Apple technical support, warranties etc.), but communities that cater to personal users, who do not install for resale and profit, have generally been ignored by Apple.[100][101][102] These self-made computers allow more flexibility and customization of hardware, but at a cost of leaving the user more responsible for their own machine, such as on matter of data integrity or security.[103] Psystar, a business that attempted to profit from selling macOS on non-Apple certified hardware, was sued by Apple in 2008.[104]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn April 2002, eWeek announced a rumor that Apple had a version of Mac OS X code-named Marklar, which ran on Intel x86 processors. The idea behind Marklar was to keep Mac OS X running on an alternative platform should Apple become dissatisfied with the progress of the PowerPC platform.[105] These rumors subsided until late in May 2005, when various media outlets, such as The Wall Street Journal[106] and CNET,[107] announced that Apple would unveil Marklar in the coming months.[108][109][110]\\r\\n\\r\\nOn June 6, 2005, Steve Jobs announced in his keynote address at the annual Apple Worldwide Developers Conference that Apple would be making the transition from PowerPC to Intel processors over the following two years, and that Mac OS X would support both platforms during the transition. Jobs also confirmed rumors that Apple had versions of Mac OS X running on Intel processors for most of its developmental life. Intel-based Macs would run a new recompiled version of OS X along with Rosetta, a binary translation layer which enables software compiled for PowerPC Mac OS X to run on Intel Mac OS X machines.[111] The system was included with Mac OS X versions up to version 10.6.8.[112] Apple dropped support for Classic mode on the new Intel Macs. Third party emulation software such as Mini vMac, Basilisk II and SheepShaver provided support for some early versions of Mac OS. A new version of Xcode and the underlying command-line compilers supported building universal binaries that would run on either architecture.[113]\\r\\n\\r\\nPowerPC-only software is supported with Apple's official emulation software, Rosetta, though applications eventually had to be rewritten to run properly on the newer versions released for Intel processors. Apple initially encouraged developers to produce universal binaries with support for both PowerPC and Intel.[114] There is a performance penalty when PowerPC binaries run on Intel Macs through Rosetta. Moreover, some PowerPC software, such as kernel extensions and System Preferences plugins, are not supported on Intel Macs at all. Some PowerPC applications would not run on macOS at all. Plugins for Safari need to be compiled for the same platform as Safari, so when Safari is running on Intel, it requires plug-ins that have been compiled as Intel-only or universal binaries, so PowerPC-only plug-ins will not work.[115] While Intel Macs are able to run PowerPC, Intel, and universal binaries; PowerPC Macs support only universal and PowerPC builds.\\r\\n\\r\\nSupport for the PowerPC platform was dropped following the transition. In 2009, Apple announced at its Worldwide Developers Conference that Mac OS X 10.6 Snow Leopard would drop support for PowerPC processors and be Intel-only.[116] Rosetta continued to be offered as an optional download or installation choice in Snow Leopard before it was discontinued with Mac OS X 10.7 Lion.[117][117] In addition, new versions of Mac OS X first- and third-party software increasingly required Intel processors, including new versions of iLife, iWork, Aperture and Logic Pro.\\r\\n\\r\\nOne of the major differences between the classic Mac OS and the current macOS was the addition of Aqua, a graphical user interface with water-like elements, in the first major release of Mac OS X. Every window element, text, graphic, or widget is drawn on-screen using spatial anti-aliasing technology.[118] ColorSync, a technology introduced many years before, was improved and built into the core drawing engine, to provide color matching for printing and multimedia professionals.[119] Also, drop shadows were added around windows and isolated text elements to provide a sense of depth. New interface elements were integrated, including sheets (dialog boxes attached to specific windows) and drawers, which would slide out and provide options.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe use of soft edges, translucent colors, and pinstripes, similar to the hardware design of the first iMacs, brought more texture and color to the user interface when compared to what Mac OS 9 and Mac OS X Server 1.0's \\"Platinum\\" appearance had offered. According to Siracusa, the introduction of Aqua and its departure from the then conventional look \\"hit like a ton of bricks.\\"[120]\\r\\nBruce Tognazzini (who founded the original Apple Human Interface Group) said that the Aqua interface in Mac OS X 10.0 represented a step backwards in usability compared with the original Mac OS interface.[121][122]\\r\\nThird-party developers started producing skins for customizable applications and other operating systems which mimicked the Aqua appearance. To some extent, Apple has used the successful transition to this new design as leverage, at various times threatening legal action against people who make or distribute software with an interface the company says is derived from its copyrighted design.[123]\\r\\n\\r\\nApple has continued to change aspects of the macOS appearance and design, particularly with tweaks to the appearance of windows and the menu bar. Since 2012, Apple has sold many of its Mac models with high-resolution Retina displays, and macOS and its APIs have extensive support for resolution-independent development on supporting high-resolution displays. Reviewers have described Apple's support for the technology as superior to that on Windows.[124][125][126]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe human interface guidelines published by Apple for macOS are followed by many applications, giving them consistent user interface and keyboard shortcuts.[127] In addition, new services for applications are included, which include spelling and grammar checkers, special characters palette, color picker, font chooser and dictionary; these global features are present in every Cocoa application, adding consistency. The graphics system OpenGL composites windows onto the screen to allow hardware-accelerated drawing. This technology, introduced in version 10.2, is called Quartz Extreme, a component of Quartz. Quartz's internal imaging model correlates well with the Portable Document Format (PDF) imaging model, making it easy to output PDF to multiple devices.[119] As a side result, PDF viewing and creating PDF documents from any application are built-in features.[128] Reflecting its popularity with design users, macOS also has system support for a variety of professional video and image formats and includes an extensive pre-installed font library, featuring many prominent brand-name designs.[129]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Finder is a file browser allowing quick access to all areas of the computer, which has been modified throughout subsequent releases of macOS.[130][131] Quick Look is part of the Finder since version 10.5. It allows for dynamic previews of files, including videos and multi-page documents without opening any other applications. Spotlight, a file searching technology which has been integrated into the Finder since version 10.4, allows rapid real-time searches of data files; mail messages; photos; and other information based on item properties (metadata) and/or content.[132][133] macOS makes use of a Dock, which holds file and folder shortcuts as well as minimized windows.\\r\\n\\r\\nApple added \\"Expos\\" in version 10.3 (called Mission Control since version 10.7), a feature which includes three functions to help accessibility between windows and desktop. Its functions are to instantly display all open windows as thumbnails for easy navigation to different tasks, display all open windows as thumbnails from the current application, and hide all windows to access the desktop.[134] Also, FileVault was introduced, which is an optional encryption of the user's files with the 128-bit Advanced Encryption Standard (AES-128).[135]\\r\\n\\r\\nFeatures introduced in version 10.4 include Automator, an application designed to create an automatic workflow for different tasks;[136] Dashboard, a full-screen group of small applications called desktop widgets that can be called up and dismissed in one keystroke;[137] and Front Row, a media viewer interface accessed by the Apple Remote.[138] Moreover, the Sync Services were included, which is a system that allows applications to access a centralized extensible database for various elements of user data, including calendar and contact items. The operating system then managed conflicting edits and data consistency.[139]\\r\\n\\r\\nAll system icons are scalable up to 512G512 pixels as of version 10.5 to accommodate various places where they appear in larger size, including for example the Cover Flow view, a three-dimensional graphical user interface included with iTunes, the Finder, and other Apple products for visually skimming through files and digital media libraries via cover artwork. That version also introduced Spaces, a virtual desktop implementation which enables the user to have more than one desktop and display them in an Expos-like interface;[140] an automatic backup technology called Time Machine, which provides the ability to view and restore previous versions of files and application data;[141] and Screen Sharing was built in for the first time.[142]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn more recent releases, Apple has developed support for emoji characters by including the proprietary Apple Color Emoji font.[143][144] Apple has also connected macOS with social networks such as Twitter and Facebook through the addition of share buttons for content such as pictures and text.[145]  Apple has brought several applications and features that originally debuted in iOS, its mobile operating system, to macOS in recent releases, notably the intelligent personal assistant Siri, which was introduced in version 10.12 of macOS.[146][147]\\r\\n\\r\\nThere are 34 system languages available in macOS for the user at the moment of installation; the system language is used throughout the entire operating system environment.[6] Input methods for typing in dozens of scripts can be chosen independently of the system language.[148] Recent updates have added increased support for Chinese characters and interconnections with popular social networks in China.[149][150][151][152]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nmacOS can be updated using the Mac App Store application[153] or the softwareupdate command line utility.  Until OS X 10.8 Mountain Lion, a separate Software Update application performed this functionality. In Mountain Lion and later, this was merged into the Mac App Store application, although the underlying update mechanism remains unchanged and is fundamentally different than the download mechanism used when purchasing an App Store application.\\r\\n\\r\\nWith the exception of Mac OS X Server 1.0 and the original public beta, OS X versions were named after big cats until OS X 10.9 Mavericks, when Apple switched to using California locations. Prior to its release, Mac OS X 10.0 was code named \\"Cheetah\\" internally at Apple, and Mac OS X 10.1 was code named internally as \\"Puma\\". After the immense buzz surrounding Mac OS X 10.2, codenamed \\"Jaguar\\", Apple's product marketing began openly using the code names to promote the operating system. Mac OS X 10.3 was marketed as \\"Panther\\", Mac OS X 10.4 as \\"Tiger\\", Mac OS X 10.5 as \\"Leopard\\", Mac OS X 10.6 as \\"Snow Leopard\\", Mac OS X 10.7 as \\"Lion\\", OS X 10.8 as \\"Mountain Lion\\", and OS X 10.9 as \\"Mavericks\\".\\r\\n\\r\\n\\"Panther\\", \\"Tiger\\" and \\"Leopard\\" are registered as trademarks of Apple,[174][175][176] but \\"Cheetah\\", \\"Puma\\" and \\"Jaguar\\" have never been registered. Apple has also registered \\"Lynx\\" and \\"Cougar\\" as trademarks, though these were allowed to lapse.[177][178] Computer retailer Tiger Direct sued Apple for its use of the name \\"Tiger\\". On May 16, 2005 a US federal court in the Southern District of Florida ruled that Apple's use did not infringe on Tiger Direct's trademark.[179]\\r\\n\\r\\nOn September 13, 2000, Apple released a $29.95[180] \\"preview\\" version of Mac OS X internally codenamed Kodiak in order to gain feedback from users.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe \\"PB\\", as it was known, marked the first public availability of the Aqua interface and Apple made many changes to the UI based on customer feedback. Mac OS X Public Beta expired and ceased to function in Spring 2001.[181]\\r\\n\\r\\nOn March 24, 2001, Apple released Mac OS X 10.0 (internally codenamed Cheetah).[182]\\r\\nThe initial version was slow,[183] incomplete,[184] and had very few applications available at the time of its launch, mostly from independent developers.[185] While many critics suggested that the operating system was not ready for mainstream adoption, they recognized the importance of its initial launch as a base on which to improve.[184] Simply releasing Mac OS X was received by the Macintosh community as a great accomplishment,[184] for attempts to completely overhaul the Mac OS had been underway since 1996, and delayed by countless setbacks. Following some bug fixes, kernel panics became much less frequent.[citation needed]\\r\\n\\r\\nLater that year on September 25, 2001, Mac OS X 10.1 (internally codenamed Puma) was released. It featured increased performance and provided missing features, such as DVD playback. Apple released 10.1 as a free upgrade CD for 10.0 users, in addition to the US$129 boxed version for people running Mac OS 9. It was discovered that the upgrade CDs were full install CDs that could be used with Mac OS 9 systems by removing a specific file; Apple later re-released the CDs in an actual stripped-down format that did not facilitate installation on such systems.[186] On January 7, 2002, Apple announced that Mac OS X was to be the default operating system for all Macintosh products by the end of that month.[187]\\r\\n\\r\\nOn August 23, 2002,[188] Apple followed up with Mac OS X 10.2 Jaguar, the first release to use its code name as part of the branding.[189]\\r\\nIt brought great raw performance improvements, a sleeker look, and many powerful user-interface enhancements (over 150, according to Apple[190]\\r\\n), including Quartz Extreme for compositing graphics directly on an ATI Radeon or Nvidia GeForce2 MX AGP-based video card with at least 16?MB of VRAM, a system-wide repository for contact information in the new Address Book, and an instant messaging client named iChat.[191] The Happy Mac which had appeared during the Mac OS startup sequence for almost 18 years was replaced with a large grey Apple logo with the introduction of Mac OS X v10.2.[192]\\r\\n\\r\\nMac OS X v10.3 Panther was released on October 24, 2003. In addition to providing much improved performance, it also incorporated the most extensive update yet to the user interface. Panther included as many or more new features as Jaguar had the year before, including an updated Finder, incorporating a brushed-metal interface, Fast user switching, Expos (Window manager), FileVault, Safari, iChat AV (which added videoconferencing features to iChat), improved Portable Document Format (PDF) rendering and much greater Microsoft Windows interoperability.[193] Support for some early G3 computers such as \\"beige\\" Power Macs and \\"WallStreet\\" PowerBooks was discontinued.[194]\\r\\n\\r\\nMac OS X 10.4 Tiger was released on April 29, 2005. Apple stated that Tiger contained more than 200 new features.[195] As with Panther, certain older machines were no longer supported; Tiger requires a Mac with 256?MB and a built-in FireWire port.[98] Among the new features, Tiger introduced Spotlight, Dashboard, Smart Folders, updated Mail program with Smart Mailboxes, QuickTime 7, Safari 2, Automator, VoiceOver, Core Image and Core Video. The initial release of the Apple TV used a modified version of Tiger with a different graphical interface and fewer applications and services. On January 10, 2006, Apple released the first Intel-based Macs along with the 10.4.4 update to Tiger. This operating system functioned identically on the PowerPC-based Macs and the new Intel-based machines, with the exception of the Intel release lacking support for the Classic environment.[196]\\r\\n\\r\\nMac OS X 10.5 Leopard was released on October 26, 2007. It was called by Apple \\"the largest update of Mac OS X\\". It brought more than 300 new features.[197] Leopard supports both PowerPC- and Intel x86-based Macintosh computers; support for the G3 processor was dropped and the G4 processor required a minimum clock rate of 867?MHz, and at least 512?MB of RAM to be installed. The single DVD works for all supported Macs (including 64-bit machines). New features include a new look, an updated Finder, Time Machine, Spaces, Boot Camp pre-installed,[198] full support for 64-bit applications (including graphical applications), new features in Mail and iChat, and a number of new security features. Leopard is an Open Brand UNIX 03 registered product on the Intel platform. It was also the first BSD-based OS to receive UNIX 03 certification.[12][199] Leopard dropped support for the Classic Environment and all Classic applications.[200] It was the final version of Mac OS X to support the PowerPC architecture.[201]\\r\\n\\r\\nMac OS X 10.6 Snow Leopard was released on August 28, 2009. Rather than delivering big changes to the appearance and end user functionality like the previous releases of Mac OS X, Snow Leopard focused on \\"under the hood\\" changes, increasing the performance, efficiency, and stability of the operating system. For most users, the most noticeable changes were: the disk space that the operating system frees up after a clean install compared to Mac OS X 10.5 Leopard, a more responsive Finder rewritten in Cocoa, faster Time Machine backups, more reliable and user-friendly disk ejects, a more powerful version of the Preview application, as well as a faster Safari web browser.  Snow Leopard only supported machines with Intel CPUs, required at least 1?GB of RAM, and dropped default support for applications built for the PowerPC architecture (Rosetta could be installed as an additional component to retain support for PowerPC-only applications).[202]\\r\\n\\r\\nSnow Leopard also featured new 64-bit technology capable of supporting greater amounts of RAM, improved support for multi-core processors through Grand Central Dispatch, and advanced GPU performance with OpenCL.[203]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe 10.6.6 update introduced support for the Mac App Store, Apple's digital distribution platform for macOS applications.[204]\\r\\n\\r\\nMac OS X 10.7 Lion was released on July 20, 2011. It brought developments made in Apple's iOS, such as an easily navigable display of installed applications called Launchpad and a greater use of multi-touch gestures, to the Mac. This release removed Rosetta, making it incompatible with PowerPC applications.[117]\\r\\n\\r\\nChanges made to the GUI include auto-hiding scrollbars that only appear when they are being used, and Mission Control which unifies Expos, Spaces, Dashboard, and full-screen applications within a single interface.[205] Apple also made changes to applications: they resume in the same state as they were before they were closed, similar to iOS. Documents auto-save by default.[206]\\r\\n\\r\\nOS X 10.8 Mountain Lion was released on July 25, 2012.[166] Following the release of Lion the previous year, it was the first of the annual rather than two-yearly updates to OS X (and later macOS), which also closely alined with the annual iOS operating system updates. It incorporates some features seen in iOS 5, which include Game Center, support for iMessage in the new Messages messaging application, and Reminders as a to-do list app separate from iCal (which is renamed as Calendar, like the iOS app). It also includes support for storing iWork documents in iCloud.[207] Notification Center, which makes its debut in Mountain Lion, is a desktop version similar to the one in iOS 5.0 and higher. Application pop-ups are now concentrated on the corner of the screen, and the Center itself is pulled from the right side of the screen. Mountain Lion also includes more Chinese features including support for Baidu as an option for Safari search engine, QQ, 163.com and 126.com services for Mail, Contacts  and Calendar, Youku, Tudou and Sina Weibo are integrated into share sheets.[152]\\r\\n\\r\\nStarting with Mountain Lion, Apple software updates (including the OS) are distributed via the App Store.[208] This updating mechanism replaced the Apple Software Update utility.[209]\\r\\n\\r\\nOS X 10.9 Mavericks was released on October 22, 2013. It was a free upgrade to all users running Snow Leopard or later with a 64-bit Intel processor.[210] Its changes include the addition of the previously iOS-only Maps and iBooks applications, improvements to the Notification Center, enhancements to several applications, and many under-the-hood improvements.[211]\\r\\n\\r\\nOS X 10.10 Yosemite was released on October 16, 2014. It features a redesigned user interface similar to that of iOS 7, intended to feature a more minimal, text-based 'flat' design, with use of translucency effects and intensely saturated colors.[212] Apple's showcase new feature in Yosemite is Handoff, which enables users with iPhones running iOS 8.1 or later to answer phone calls, receive and send SMS messages, and complete unfinished iPhone emails on their Mac. As of OS X 10.10.3, Photos replaced iPhoto and Aperture.[213]\\r\\n\\r\\nOS X 10.11 El Capitan was released on September 30, 2015. Similar to Mac OS X 10.6 Snow Leopard, Apple described this release as containing \\"refinements to the Mac experience\\" and \\"improvements to system performance\\" rather than new features. Refinements include public transport built into the Maps application, GUI improvements to the Notes application, adopting San Francisco as the system font for clearer legibility, and the introduction of System Integrity Protection. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe Metal API, first introduced in iOS 8, was also included in this operating system for \\"all Macs since 2012\\".[214] According to Apple, Metal accelerates system-level rendering by up to 50 percent, resulting in faster graphics performance for everyday apps. Metal also delivers up to 10 times faster draw call performance for more fluid experience in games and pro apps.[215]\\r\\n\\r\\nmacOS 10.12 Sierra was released to the public on September 20, 2016. New features include the addition of Siri, Optimized Storage, and updates to Photos, Messages, and iTunes.[216][217]\\r\\n\\r\\nmacOS 10.13 High Sierra was released to the public on September 25, 2017.[218] Like OS X El Capitan and OS X Mountain Lion, High Sierra is a refinement-based update having very few new features visible to a user, including updates to Safari, Photos, and Mail, among other changes.[219]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe major change under the hood is the switch to the Apple File System, which is optimized for solid-state storage used in most new Mac computers.[220]\\r\\n\\r\\nmacOS 10.14 Mojave was announced on June 4, 2018 at Apple's WWDC event. It is currently scheduled to be released in the fall of 2018.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs of July 2016, macOS is the second-most-active general-purpose desktop client operating system in use on the World Wide Web following Microsoft Windows, with a 4.90% usage share according to statistics compiled by the Wikimedia Foundation. It is the second most widely used desktop operating system (for web browsing), after Windows, and is estimated at approximately five times the usage of Linux (which has 1.01%). Usage share generally continues to shift away from the desktop and toward mobile operating systems such as iOS and Android.[221]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn its earlier years, Mac OS X enjoyed a near-absence of the types of malware and spyware that have affected Microsoft Windows users.[222][223][224] macOS has a smaller usage share compared to Windows,[225] but it also has traditionally more secure Unix roots. Worms, as well as potential vulnerabilities, were noted in 2006, which led some industry analysts and anti-virus companies to issue warnings that Apple's Mac OS X is not immune to malware.[226] Increasing market share coincided with additional reports of a variety of attacks.[227] In early 2011, Mac OS X experienced a large increase in malware attacks,[228] and malware such as Mac Defender, MacProtector, and MacGuard were seen as an increasing problem for Mac users. At first, the malware installer required the user to enter the administrative password, but later versions were able to install without user input.[229] Initially, Apple support staff were instructed not to assist in the removal of the malware or admit the existence of the malware issue, but as the malware spread, a support document was issued. Apple announced an OS X update to fix the problem. An estimated 100,000 users were affected.[230][231] Apple releases security updates for macOS on a regular basis,[232] as well as signature files for Xprotect, an anti-malware feature part of File Quarantine present since Mac OS X Snow Leopard.[233]\\r\\n\\r\\nAs a devices company, most large-scale Apple promotion for macOS has been part of the sale of Macs, with promotion of macOS updates generally focused on existing users, promotion at Apple Store and other retail partners, or through events for developers. In larger scale advertising campaigns, Apple specifically promoted macOS as better for handling media and other home-user applications, and comparing Mac OS X (especially versions Tiger and Leopard) with the heavy criticism Microsoft received for the long-awaited Windows Vista operating system.[234][235]","input":"What's the latest version of mac software?"},{"output":"sixteen","context":"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\"...Baby One More Time\\" is a song recorded by American singer Britney Spears from her debut studio album of the same title (1999). It was written by Max Martin and produced by Martin and Rami. After recording and sending a demo tape with an unused song from Toni Braxton, Spears signed a multi-album deal with Jive. \\"...Baby One More Time\\" is a pop song that refers to a girl's feelings after a break-up with her boyfriend.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\"...Baby One More Time\\" was released on October 23, 1998 through Jive Records. It reached number one in every country it charted in, including the United Kingdom, where it earned double-platinum certification from the British Phonographic Industry (BPI) and became the country's best-selling song of 1999. The song is one of the best-selling singles of all time, with over 7 million copies sold. An accompanying music video, directed by Nigel Dick, portrays Spears as a student from a Catholic high school, who starts to daydream that she is singing and dancing around the school, while watching her love interest from afar. The music video was later referenced in the music video of \\"If U Seek Amy\\" (2009), where Spears's fictional daughter is dressed with a similar schoolgirl outfit while wearing pink ribbons in her hair. In 2010, the music video for \\"...Baby One More Time\\" was voted the third most influential video in the history of pop music, in a poll held by Jam!. In 2011, \\"...Baby One More Time\\" was voted the best music video of the 1990s.[3] It has been featured on all of her greatest hits and other compilation albums.\\r\\n\\r\\nSpears has performed \\"...Baby One More Time\\" in a number of live appearances and during all of her concert tours. It was the encore of the ...Baby One More Time Tour (1999) and Dream Within a Dream Tour (2001ÿ02); Spears also performed remixed versions of the song during the Oops!... I Did It Again Tour (2000ÿ01), The Onyx Hotel Tour (2004), The M+M's Tour (2007), The Circus Starring Britney Spears (2009), the Femme Fatale Tour (2011), and her concert residency Britney: Piece of Me (2013ÿ17). \\"...Baby One More Time\\" was nominated for a Grammy Award for Best Pop Vocal Performance at the 42nd Annual Grammy Awards (2000), and has been included in lists by Blender, Rolling Stone and VH1. It has been noted for redefining the sound of late 1990s music. Spears has named \\"...Baby One More Time\\" as one of her favorite songs from her career. It was also the final song to be played on the BBC's music programme Top of the Pops in the 1990s. In 2018, readers of German teen magazine Bravo magazine voted \\"...Baby One More Time\\" to be the biggest hit since its first music compilation was released in 1992.\\r\\n\\r\\nI had been in studio for about six months listening and recording material, but I hadn't really heard a hit yet. When I started working with Max Martin in Sweden, he played the demo for 'Baby One More Time' for me, and I knew from the start it [was one] of those songs you want to hear again and again. It just felt really right. I went into the studio and did my own thing with it, trying to give it a little more attitude than the demo. In 10 days, I never even saw Sweden. We were so busy.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn June 1997, Spears was in talks with manager Lou Pearlman to join female pop group Innosense.[5] Lynne Spears asked family friend and entertainment lawyer Larry Rudolph for his opinion and submitted a tape of Spears singing over a Whitney Houston karaoke song along with some pictures.[5] Rudolph decided he wanted to pitch her to record labels, therefore she needed a professional demo.[5] He sent Spears an unused song from Toni Braxton; she rehearsed for a week and recorded her vocals in a studio with a sound engineer.[5] Spears traveled to New York with the demo and met with executives from four labels, returning to Kentwood the same day.[5] Three of the labels rejected her, arguing audiences wanted pop bands such as the Backstreet Boys and the Spice Girls, and \\"there wasn't going to be another Madonna, another Debbie Gibson, or another Tiffany.\\"[5] Two weeks later, executives from JIVE Records returned calls to Rudolph.[5] Senior vice president of A&R Jeff Fenster stated about Spears's audition that \\"It's very rare to hear someone that age who can deliver emotional content and commercial appeal. [...] For any artist, the motivationthe 'eye of the tiger' is extremely important. And Britney had that.\\"[6] They appointed her to work with producer Eric Foster White for a month, who reportedly shaped her voice from \\"lower and less poppy\\" delivery to \\"distinctively, unmistakably Britney.\\"[7] After hearing the recorded material, president Clive Calder ordered a full album.[7] Spears had originally envisioned \\"Sheryl Crow music, but younger more adult contemporary\\" but felt all right with her label's appointment of producers, since \\"It made more sense to go pop, because I can dance to itit's more me.\\" She flew to Cheiron Studios in Stockholm, Sweden, where half of the album was recorded from March to April 1998, with producers Max Martin, Denniz Pop and Rami Yacoub, among others.[6][8]\\r\\n\\r\\nMartin showed Spears and her management a track titled \\"Hit Me Baby One More Time\\", which was originally written for American group Backstreet Boys and R&B group TLC; however, when the song was submitted to them, they rejected it. Spears later claimed that she felt excited when she heard it and knew it was going to be a hit record.[1] \\"We at JIVE said, 'This is a ... smash',\\" revealed the label's A&R executive at the time Steven Lunt;[9] however, other executives were concerned that the line \\"Hit Me\\" would condone domestic violence, later being revised to \\"...Baby One More Time\\".[1]\\r\\n\\r\\nSpears recorded her vocals for the song in March 1998 at Cheiron Studios in Stockholm, Sweden.[10] Spears revealed that she \\"didnt do well at all the first day in the studio [recording the song], I was just too nervous. So I went out that night and had some fun. The next day I was completely relaxed and nailed it. You gotta be relaxed singing  Baby One More Time.\\"[11] The song was produced by Denniz Pop, Martin and Rami, and was also mixed by Martin at Cheiron Studios.[10] Thomas Lindberg played the guitar, while Johan Carlberg played the bass guitar.[10] Background vocals were provided by Spears, Martin and Nana Hedin.[10]  Spears also recorded a track called \\"Autumn Goodbye\\", written and produced by Eric Foster White, that was released as a b-side to \\"...Baby One More Time\\".[12] The track was recorded in 1998 at 4MW East Studios in New Jersey.[12]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\"...Baby One More Time\\" was released as Spears's debut single on October 23, 1998, by Jive Records, when she was only sixteen years old.[13] Spears has named \\"...Baby One More Time\\" as one of her favorite songs from her entire career,[14] naming \\"Toxic\\" and \\"He About to Lose Me\\" as the other two.[14] Like TLC and Backstreet Boys, British boy band Five were almost considered to record the song, according to their former manager Simon Cowell, who would work with Spears in the second season of the American version of The X Factor in 2012, in his autobiography Sweet Revenge.[15]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\"...Baby One More Time\\" is a pop song[2] that lasts for three minutes and thirty seconds. The song is composed in the key of C minor and is set in the time signature of 4/4 common time with a moderate tempo of ninety-three beats per minute (Andante moderato). Songwriting and production is largely based on previous Cheiron productions, most notably Robyn Carlsson's \\"Show Me Love\\" which shows similar song scheme, drum patterns, wah guitars and piano hits. Spears's vocal range spans over two octaves from E?3 to the high-tone of G5.[16][17] The song begins with a three-note motif in the bass range of the piano, an opening that has been compared to many other songs, such as \\"We Will Rock You\\" (1977), \\"Start Me Up\\" (1981), \\"These Words\\" (2004) and the theme song of the film Jaws due to the fact the track \\"makes its presence known in exactly one second\\".[11] According to magazine Blender, \\"...Baby One More Time\\" is composed by \\"wah-wah guitar lines and EKG-machine bass-slaps\\".[11]\\r\\n\\r\\nClaudia Mitchell and Jacqueline Reid-Walsh, authors of Girl Culture: Studying girl culture?: a readers' guide (2008), noted the lyrics of the song \\"gesture toward [Spears] longing for the return of an ex-boyfriend.\\"[18] Spears said \\"...Baby One More Time\\" is a song \\"every girl can relate to. She regrets it. She wants him back.\\"[19] The lyrics, however, caused controversy in the United States, because the line \\"Hit me baby one more time\\" supposedly has sadomasochistic connotations.[20] As a response, the singer said the line \\"doesn't mean physically hit me. [...] It means just give me a sign, basically. I think it's kind of funny that people would actually think that's what it meant.\\"[8]\\r\\n\\r\\nMarc Oxoby, author of The 1990s (2003), noted the song \\"was derided as vapid by some critics, yet tapped into the same kind of audience to whom the Spice Girls music appealed, young teens and pre-teens.\\"[21] Amanda Murray of Sputnikmusic commented, \\"[\\"...Baby One More Time\\" is] well-composed, tightly arranged, and even with Spears's vocal limitations it goes straight for the proverbial pop jugular.\\"[22] She also said that the song was a highlight in the pop music genre and added, \\"There is little doubt that '...Baby One More Time' will be long remembered as one of the cornerstones of pop music in general, and it is a strong front-runner as the prototype for the late 90s pop resurgence.\\"[22] Bill Lamb of About.com considered \\"...Baby One More Time\\" as Spears's best song, saying, \\"the song is full of hooks and a big mainstream pop sound. The accompanying schoolgirl video caused a sensation, and, when the single hit No. 1, Britney was assured of stardom.\\"[23] In a list compiled by Sara Anderson of AOL Radio, \\"...Baby One More Time\\" was ranked sixth in a list of Spears's best songs. She noted the singer \\"somehow made the school girl outfit and pink pom-pom hair-ties trendy again, worn by every tween in the succeeding years.\\"[24]\\r\\n\\r\\nBeth Johnson of Entertainment Weekly called \\"...Baby One More Time\\" a \\"candy-pop-with-a-funky-edge smash\\",[25] while Stephen Thomas Erlewine of Allmusic said the song was \\"ingenious\\",[26] Brian Raftery of Blender called it \\"a perfectly fine, slickly conceived pop tune. [..] At the time, teen-pop was still a boys club, but while the guys were crooning about crushes, Spears was already planning the sleep-over party\\".[11] Rolling Stone called it \\"some of the best radio pop of the past decade-plus\\".[27] NME considered \\"...Baby One More Time\\" \\"incredible\\",[2] commenting that \\"it's a symphony of teenage lust as fully realised as anything Brian Wilson ever wrote ÿ a truly grand pop song that overwhelms any lingering undercurrent of Lolita paedo-creepiness through the sheer fanatical earnestness of its delivery.\\"[2] \\"...Baby One More Time\\" won a Teen Choice Award for Single of the Year and an MTV Europe Music Award for Best Song.[28]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe song was officially sent to the American radio stations on October 23, 1998.[1] On November 21, 1998, \\"...Baby One More Time\\" debuted on the Billboard Hot 100 at number 17 and topped the chart two and a half months later for two consecutive weeks, replacing R&B-singer Brandy's \\"Have You Ever?\\".[29] Simultaneously, it climbed to number-one on the Canadian Singles Chart.[30] The song reached the top spot of the Hot 100 Singles Sales and stayed there for four consecutive weeks.[31][32] This eventually propelled the single to a platinum certification by the Recording Industry Association of America.[33] Though not as strong as its sales tallies, \\"...Baby One More Time\\" also experienced considerable airplay, becoming her first top ten hit on the Hot 100 Airplay, peaking at number eight.[34] The single also became an all-around hit on Top 40 radio, going top ten on both the Top 40 Tracks and Rhythmic Top 40, and to number one for five weeks on the Mainstream Top 40.[30] It spent 32 weeks on the Hot 100 and ended up at number five on Billboard magazine's year-end chart.[35][36] As of June 2012, \\"...Baby One More Time\\" has sold 1,412,000 physical singles, with 511,000 paid digital downloads in the United States.[37] It is Spears's best-selling physical single in the country.[37] \\"...Baby One More Time\\" debuted at number 20 on the Australian Singles Chart,[38] a month later reached number one and stayed there for nine consecutive weeks.[38] The song eventually became the second highest-selling single of the year,[39][40] only behind Lou Bega's \\"Mambo#5\\",[39][40] and was certified three-times platinum by the Australian Recording Industry Association for selling over 210,000 copies.[39][40] In New Zealand, the single spent four non-consecutive weeks at the top of the charts and after shipping over 15,000 units to retailers the Recording Industry Association of New Zealand certified it platinum.[41][42]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe track reached the top spot in every European country in which it charted.[43] \\"...Baby One More Time\\" spent two consecutive weeks at number-one on the French Singles Chart and was certified platinum by the Syndicat National de l'dition Phonographique after selling over 500,000 units in the country.[43][44] Additionally, the song topped the German Singles Chart for six consecutive weeks and sold over 750,000 copies, resulting in a three-times gold certification by the International Federation of the Phonographic Industry.[45] In the United Kingdom, according to Jive Records, \\"...Baby One More Time\\" sold more than 250,000 copies in a mere three days.[46] Spears broke a first-week sales record for a female act in the UK at the time when \\"...Baby One More Time\\" sold a total of 460,000 copies.[47] Eventually, the British Phonographic Industry certified it two-times platinum on March 26, 1999.[48] The single went on to sell over 1,445,000 units by the end of 1999,[49] making it the highest-selling single of that year and the 8th biggest song of the 1990s. As of 2018, it is the 32nd best-seller of all-time in the UK.[50] Additionally, \\"...Baby One More Time\\" is the fifth best-selling single by a female artist in the country, behind Cher's \\"Believe\\", Whitney Houston's \\"I Will Always Love You\\", Adele's \\"Someone like You\\" and Cline Dion's \\"My Heart Will Go On\\".[50] \\"...Baby One More Time\\" is one of the best-selling singles of all time, with over 10 million copies sold worldwide.[51]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe music video was directed by Nigel Dick.[52] After being chosen, Dick received criticism from his colleagues about wanting to work with Spears. He responded saying, \\"It's a great song. I don't know anything about Britney. I never watched The Mickey Mouse Club. She seems like a great kid and she's very enthusiastic, but I just love the song. It's just a great song\\".[19] The video's original setup was in high contrast to what eventually became the final product. The plan was to have the video in a cartoon-like environment, in a likely attempt to attract the audience of younger children.[52] Spears was unhappy with this, and argued that she wanted her video to reflect the lives of her fans and wanted to set the video in a school.[19][52] Spears pitched this idea to Dick, and further explained she wanted the video to have dance scenes. The original setting was scrapped and replaced with Spears's concept.[19] Dick's original idea for the wardrobe was jeans and a T-shirt, but during the wardrobe fitting Spears decided to change it for a schoolgirl outfit. Dick said that \\"Every piece of wardrobe in the video came from Kmart, and I was told at the time not one piece of clothing in the video cost more than $17. On that level, it's real. That probably, in retrospect, is a part of its charm.\\"[19] The knotted shirt design was Spears's idea, she recollects saying, \\"The outfits looked kind of dorky, so I was like, 'Let's tie up our shirts and be cute'\\".[53] About the experience of shooting her first music video, Spears said, \\"It was a wonderful experience. All these people there, working for you. I had my own trailer. It was an amazing experience\\".[19] The music video was shot at Venice High School, the same school used to film the movie Grease.[52] The video premiered on MTV and other video stations in November 1998.[54]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe video begins with Spears appearing bored in class at a Catholic high school.[52] Her assistant Felicia Culotta played the role of Spears's teacher.[52] When the bell rings, Spears runs out into the hall and begins a choreographed dance in the corridor. After this, Spears is outside, now adorned in an pink athletic outfit, and seen in a car. Along with a couple of other students, she performs a number of gymnastic moves before heading back inside. She is then sitting on the bleachers in the gymnasium watching a basketball game, and she dances in the gymnasium. Her love interest is revealed sitting close to her, played by her real-life cousin Chad.[52] After this short segment, Spears begins her final dance routine and the video ends shortly afterwards, and the bell rings and Spears leaves the gymnasium, revealing that the whole thing had actually just been Spears's daydream. During the very beginning, Spears is seen with her sleeves down. Some people who see the music video may not recognize this, but when the bell rings, the sleeves of exactly the same gray-and-white shirt she is wearing are rolled up, even when she gets into singing.[52]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe schoolgirl outfit is considered to be one of Spears's iconic looks and is on display[vague] at the Hard Rock Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas, Nevada.[55] The ensemble caused controversy among parents associations for showing the midriff of a sixteen-year-old.[19] Spears faced the criticism saying, \\"Me showing my belly? I'm from the South; you're stupid if you don't wear a sports bra [when you] go to dance class, you're going to be sweating your butt off.\\"[19] In 1999, \\"...Baby One More Time\\" earned Spears her first three MTV Video Music Award nominations,[56] in the categories of Best Pop Video,[56] Best Choreography,[56] and Best Female Video.[56] In a list compiled by VH1 in 2001, it was listed at number ninety in the best videos of all time.[57] The video was the first of fourteen of her videos to retire on MTV's television series TRL. On its final episode, a three-hour special aired on November 16, 2008,[58] \\"Baby One More Time\\" was number one in their final countdown as the most iconic music videos of all time and was the last video to be played on the show.[58] Wesley Yang in his essay \\"Inside the Box\\" in n+1, compared the music video to Britny Fox's \\"Girlschool\\" because it featured \\"a classroom full of Catholic schoolgirls gyrating to the beat in defiance of a stern teacher. [..] But that was a sexist video by a horrible hair metal band that exploited women. Britney Spears was something elsean inflection point in the culture\\".[59] The music video is also referenced in the music video of Spears's 2000 single, \\"Stronger\\" where Spears sings, \\"My loneliness ain't killing me no more\\" - a reference to \\"...Baby One More Time\\" where she sings, \\"My loneliness is killing me.\\" The music video is also referenced in the 2009 single, \\"If U Seek Amy\\".[60] After she comes out of the house dressed as a housewife,[60] her daughter is dressed with a similar schoolgirl outfit while wearing pink ribbons in her hair.[60] The video was ranked at number four on a list of the ten most controversial music videos in pop by AOL on September 29, 2011.[61] In April 2014, the music video for \\"...Baby One More Time\\" reached over 100 million views on VEVO becoming Spears' 5th music video to do so and making it the first '90s video by a female singer to receive a certification.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe first ever live performance of the song was at the \\"Singapore Jazz Festival\\" in Singapore, the May 16th 1998. At this show, she also performs for the first time ever, the song \\"Sometimes\\". Britney performed \\"...Baby One More Time\\" on several occasions. She performed the song on July 6, 1999, during her appearance at the Woodstock 99 festival.[62] Neil Strauss, from The New York Times, noted that \\"all the backing music was on tape, and most of the vocals were recorded, with Ms. Spears just reinforcing selected words in choruses and singing an occasional snippet of a verse\\".[62] It was also performed at the 1999 MTV Video Music Awards;[63] after a classroom roll call ended, Spears appeared on the stage and began performing the song. Halfway through, she was joined by Justin Timberlake and the members of NSYNC for a dance routine. Afterwards, the band performed their hit \\"Tearin' Up My Heart\\".[64] The song was also performed at the 1999 MTV Europe Music Awards, along with \\"(You Drive Me) Crazy\\", the 1999 Billboard Music Awards, the 1999 Smash Hits Poll Winners Party, the Christmas Day edition of Top of the Pops and the Greenwich Millennium concert on 31 December 1999, she also performed it with broadcasters David Dimbleby and Michael Buerk on 2000 Today. Spears performed the song in a medley with \\"From the Bottom of My Broken Heart\\" at the 42nd Grammy Awards. Spears was wearing a turtleneck and a full tulle skirt at the beginning of the performance, while dancers surrounded her with enormous hand fans. After singing a shortened version of the song, she then took a few moments to shuffle into a form-fitting red rhinestone outfit (with side cutouts) and emerged onto a stage to perform \\"...Baby One More Time.\\" Spears was also criticized of lipsynching the song during her performance.[65] Later, in 2003, Spears performed the song in a remixed form at Britney Spears: In the Zone, a concert special that aired in ABC on November 17, 2003.[66] \\"...Baby One More Time\\" was also performed at the 2003 NFL Kickoff Live on September 4, 2003, at the National Mall, in a medley with \\"I'm a Slave 4 U\\" (2001), which included pyrotechnics.[67][68][69] She sported shoulder-length blond hair and was dressed in black football pants, a black-and-white referee halter top and boots from Reebok.[70] Her outfit was later auctioned off to benefit the Britney Spears Foundation.[68]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\"...Baby One More Time\\" has been performed in seven of Spears's concert tours since its release.[71][72][73][74][75][76][77][78] On ...Baby One More Time Tour, the encore consisted of a performance of the song,[71] in which Spears wore a black bra under pink halter,[71] a pink sequined plaid mini-skirt,[71] and black thigh-high stockings.[71] On 2000s Oops!... I Did It Again World Tour, \\"...Baby One More Time\\" was performed after a dance interlude in which the dancers showed their individual moves while their names appeared on the screens.[72] Spears took the stage in a conservative schoolgirl outfit to perform the song.[72] She ripped it off halfway through the song to reveal a cheerleader ensemble.[72] The song was also the encore of 2001's Dream Within a Dream Tour.[73][74] It began with a giant projection of a hologram of Spears onto a water screen.[73][74] The projection gradually shrunk until Spears rose from the stage while wearing a plastic cowboy hat, blue hip-huggers, and a matching bra top.[73][74] She began performing \\"...Baby One More Time\\" in a ballad version until reaching the end of the runway.[73][74] Pyrotechnics surrounded the stage while the song changed to a more uptempo version with elements of techno.[73][74]\\r\\n\\r\\nOn The Onyx Hotel Tour, after performing \\"Showdown\\", a video interlude followed featuring Spears and her friends outside a club.[75] While she was leaving, she noticed a woman dressed in 1930s fashion.[75] She followed her and the woman asked Spears to enter the \\"Mystic Lounge\\".[75] Spears reappeared wearing a corset to perform \\"Baby One More Time\\" along with \\"Oops!...I Did It Again\\" and \\"(You Drive Me) Crazy\\".[75] All of the three were reworked for the show with elements of jazz and blues.[79] \\"...Baby One More Time\\" was also performed on the promotional tour made on some House of Blues locations, called The M+M's Tour.[76] The show started with Spears singing a short version of the song dressed in a white go-go boots,[76] a white miniskirt and a sparkling pink bikini top.[76] On The Circus Starring Britney Spears, the song made into the Electro Circ act.[77] It was the final song of the act,[78] performed after \\"Toxic\\".[78] The performance consisted on Spears and her dancers performing a remix of the song.[78] On 2011's Femme Fatale Tour, \\"...Baby One More Time\\" was performed in a medley with the remix of Rihanna's \\"S&M\\" (2010).[80] On Spears' current residency show Britney: Piece of Me in Las Vegas, the song was included on its setlist.[81]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\"Baby One More Time\\" has been covered on numerous occasions. One of the earliest live covers of the song was by the Scottish band Travis, recorded during one of their concerts at \\"The Bay Tavern\\" in Robin Hood's Bay, North Yorkshire, England.[82] The song was later included in the release of their 1999 single, \\"Turn\\". Lead singer Francis Healey said, \\"We did it for a laugh the first time. [..] And as we played it, the irony slipped from my smile. It's a very well-crafted song. It [has] that magic thing.\\"[11] The Guardian said this cover showed a new and more \\"dark\\" side of the band, commenting \\"slowed down to a mournful crawl, it was amazing how ominous the couplet \\"This loneliness is killing me / Hit me, baby, one more time\\" sounded\\".[82] PopWreckoning.com called it \\"perhaps the most well done cover of Britney's catalyst to eternal fame\\".[83] Spears heard their version while shopping in a mall and said, \\"It was so weird. I liked it though, I thought it was cool. It was a very different vibe from what I did\\".[84]\\r\\nIn July 2005, The Dresden Dolls performed a cover during their summer concerts while opening for Panic! at the Disco. On July 18, 2006, frontman Brendon Urie joined the band to perform the song in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. PopWreckoning.com said the cover was \\"a strange twist to this pop ditty. It's obviously darker and actually tortured as opposed to Britney's school girl despair\\".[83] The song was featured in a scene in Madonna's directorial debut Filth and Wisdom.[85]  On November 29, 2008, the same day Spears performed \\"Womanizer\\" on The X Factor, contestants JLS performed a cover of the song that was deemed \\"lame\\" by judge Simon Cowell.[86]\\r\\n\\r\\nOn July 13, 2009, Tori Amos covered the song live during her Sinful Attraction Tour at the Paramount Theatre in Oakland, California.[87] On October 15, 2009, Kris Allen covered the song for the first time at a concert in Seton High School in Cincinnati, Ohio. His rendition received positive reviews.[88] The song is heard, prominently but briefly, during the climactic fight-scene in the 2005 animated film Robots. Fender, while wearing a skirt, was busy fighting to the beat of the song. An excerpt was used in the comedy film, but was not included on the soundtrack album.[89] Swedish humorist heavy metal band Black Ingvars covered the song for their 2000 album Kids Superhits.[90] The same year, British death metal cover band Ten Masked Men included a rendition of the song on their Return of the Ten Masked Men album.[91] A cover by Ahmet and Dweezil Zappa was featured in the soundtrack of the 2000 film Ready to Rumble.[92] In 2003, the song was covered by American pop punk band Bowling for Soup for the soundtrack of the remake film Freaky Friday and commented that their version was \\"really, really, dark and really rock, [..] not the kind of 'pop'-py stuff that we usually do.\\"[93] In 2005, power pop band Fountains of Wayne covered the song for their compilation album Out-of-State Plates. Robert Christgau of The Village Voice highlighted their rendition saying the song is \\"as redolent and fetching as any of [Fountains of Wayne]'s peaks\\".[94] Japanese pop singer Shiori Takei covered the song of her 2005 album The Note of My Nineteen Years.[95]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 2006, a lounge music style cover of the song by Trombo Combo was included on their covers album Trombo Combo: Swedish Sound Deluxe.[96] A hi-NRG-eurodance cover by Jayne Montgomery was released through Almighty Records.[97] In the 2009 compilation Punk Goes Pop 2, a cover of the song by metalcore band August Burns Red was included along with a cover of \\"Toxic\\" by A Static Lullaby.[98][99] Music duo Doll Factory included a cover of the song as a bonus track on later printings of their album Weightless.[100]\\r\\nSinger-songwriter Christopher Dallman released an EP titled Sad Britney that includes a cover of the song along with covers of \\"Toxic\\", \\"Gimme More\\" and \\"Radar\\".[101] The song has also been covered by Brainshake, Intwine, Kevorkian, P.T. Grimm and the Dead Puppies, Jenny Owen Youngs, Neil Sahgal and Annie Bethancourt, among others.[83] In the 2010 Glee episode \\"Britney/Brittany\\", the character of Rachel Berry, played by Lea Michele, covered the song using similar outfits to the ones of the music video. Spears also made a cameo, taking the teacher's role, previously played by Cullota.[102] Darren Criss also of Glee performed a mash-up of \\"...Baby One More Time\\" with \\"Fr Elise\\" on Sing Out, Raise Hope for The Trevor Project and the Elizabeth Glaser Pediatric AIDS Foundation in December 2011.[103] In 2012, British singer Ed Sheeran performed an acoustic version of the song NOW 100.5 FM.[104] A year later he covered it on The Elvis Duran Z100 Morning Show and added a rap verse.[105] The song is sung by actresses Selena Gomez, Vanessa Hudgens, Ashley Benson and Rachel Korine in Harmony Korine's film Spring Breakers.[106] Swedish singer Tove Styrke released a cover of the song on July 24, 2015.[107] The song was also covered and used for a Frogz singing toy in 2005.[108] Song is covered for Just Dance 3\\r\\n\\r\\n\\"Baby One More Time\\" was listed at number twenty five in the greatest pop songs since 1963, in a list compiled by Rolling Stone and MTV in 2000.[109] Blender listed it at number nine in The 500 Greatest Songs Since You Were Born.[11] The song was also listed as the 2nd best song of the 1990s by VH1[110] and in a listing compiled in 2003, ranked at number one in 100 Best Songs of the Past 25 Years.[111] Bill Lamb of About.com ranked \\"...Baby One More Time\\" at number one on a compiled list with the Top 40 Pop Songs Of All Time.[112] The music video was voted the third most influential promo in the history of pop music on a poll held by Jam!.[113] \\"Baby One More Time\\" is also one of the best-selling singles of all time, with over 9 million copies sold,[114] and also earned Spears's first nomination for a Grammy Award for Best Female Pop Vocal Performance.[115] In April 2005, the British TV network ITV aired a short series called Hit Me, Baby, One More Time hosted by Vernon Kay.[116] The show pitted one-hit wonders who generally had their moments of fame in the 1980s against each other to play their own hits and a currently popular cover song.[116] The favorites were chosen by audience voting.[116] The American version of the show also aired on NBC later in the year, and it was also hosted by Kay.[117] In the 2012 poll created by The Official Chart Company and ITV to discover The Nation's Favourite Number 1 Single of all-time, \\"Baby One More Time\\" was listed as the seventh favorite song by the United Kingdom.[118] In 2018, readers of the iconic German teen magazine Bravo (magazine) voted \\"...Baby One More Time\\" to be the biggest hit since its first music compilation was released in 1992.\\r\\n\\r\\nSpears became an international pop culture icon immediately after launching her recording career. Rolling Stone magazine wrote: \\"One of the most controversial and successful female vocalists of the 21st century,\\" she \\"spearheaded the rise of post-millennial teen pop?... Spears early on cultivated a mixture of innocence and experience that broke the bank\\".[119] Barbara Ellen of The Observer has reported: \\"Spears is famously one of the 'oldest' teenagers pop has ever produced, almost middle aged in terms of focus and determination. Many 19-year-olds haven't even started working by that age, whereas Britney, a former Mouseketeer, was that most unusual and volatile of American phenomena? a child with a full-time career. While other little girls were putting posters on their walls, Britney was wanting to be the poster on the wall. Whereas other children develop at their own pace, Britney was developing at a pace set by the ferociously competitive American entertainment industry\\".[120]\\r\\n\\r\\nScott Plagenhoef of Pitchfork noted \\"songs like Nirvana's \\"Smells Like Teen Spirit\\", Dr. Dre's \\"Nothing But a G Thang\\", and Britney Spears's \\"...Baby One More Time\\" altered the landscape of pop culture so quickly in large part because they were delivered to all corners of the U.S. simultaneously by MTV. [...] MTV's ability to place a song and musician into the pop music conversation was unparalleled at the time, and by the end of the decade that meant absurd levels of both financial and creative commitment to music videos.\\"[121] PopMatters writer Evan Sawdey commented that Spears's concept for the music video of the song was the one responsible for her immediate success, saying that, as a result, the singer \\"scored a massive No. 1 single, inadvertently started the late '90s teen pop boom, and created a public persona for herself that was simultaneously kid-friendly and pure male fantasy. Her videos got played on both MTV and the Disney Channel at the same time, showing just how well Spears (and her armies of PR handlers) managed to walk that fine line between family-friendly pop idol and unabashed sex object.\\"[122]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCredits for \\"...Baby One More Time\\" and \\"Autumn Goodbye\\" are taken from the single's liner notes.[10]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n...Baby One More Time\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nAutumn Goodbye\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n*sales figures based on certification alone^shipments figures based on certification alone","input":"How old was britney spears hit me baby one more time?"},{"output":"4,793,700","context":"The demographics of New Zealand encompass the gender, ethnic, religious, geographic, and economic backgrounds of the 4.8 million people living in New Zealand. New Zealanders, informally known as \\"Kiwis\\", predominantly live in urban areas on the North Island. The five largest cities are Auckland (with one-third of the country's population), Christchurch (in the South Island, the largest island of the New Zealand archipelago), Wellington, Hamilton and Tauranga. Few New Zealanders live on New Zealand's smaller islands. Waiheke Island (near Auckland) is easily the most populated smaller island with 9,520 residents, while Great Barrier Island, the Chatham and Pitt Islands and Stewart Island each have populations below 1,000. New Zealand is part of a realm and most people born in the realm's external territories of Tokelau, the Ross Dependency, the Cook Islands and Niue are entitled to New Zealand passports. In 2006, more people who identified themselves with these islands lived in New Zealand than on the Islands themselves.\\r\\nThe majority of New Zealand's population is of European descent (74 percent identify as \\"New Zealand European\\"), with the indigenous Mori being the largest minority (14.9 percent), followed by Asians (11.8 percent) and non-Mori Pacific Islanders (7.4 percent).[n 1] This is reflected in immigration, with most new migrants coming from Britain and Ireland, although the numbers from Asia are increasing. The largest Mori tribe (iwi) is Ngpuhi with 125,601 people or 18.8 percent of the Mori population. Auckland is the most ethnically diverse region in New Zealand with 59.3 percent identifying as Europeans, 23.1 percent as Asian, 10.7 percent as Mori and 14.6 percent as Pacific Islanders. The ethnicity of the population aged under 18 years is considerably more diverse than the population aged 65 years or older. Recent increases in interracial marriages have resulted in more people identifying with more than one ethnic group.\\r\\nEnglish, Mori and New Zealand Sign Language are the official languages, with English predominant. New Zealand English is mostly non-rhotic and sounds similar to Australian English, with a common exception being the centralisation of the short i. The Mori language has undergone a process of revitalisation and is spoken by 3.7?percent of the population. New Zealand has an adult literacy rate of 99?percent and over half of the population aged 15 to 29 hold a tertiary qualification. In the adult population 14.2 percent have a bachelor's degree or higher, 30.4 percent have some form of secondary qualification as their highest qualification and 22.4 percent have no formal qualification. As of the 2013 census, just under half the population identify as Christians, with Hinduism and Buddhism being the most significant minority religions. New Zealand has no state religion and just over 40?percent of the population does not have a religion.\\r\\nFarming is a major occupation in New Zealand, although more people are employed as sales assistants. Most New Zealanders earn wage or salary income, with a median personal income in 2013 of NZ$28,500.[6]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nWhile the demonym for a New Zealand citizen is New Zealander, the informal \\"Kiwi\\" is commonly used both internationally[7] and by locals.[8] The name derives from the kiwi, a native flightless bird, which is the national symbol of New Zealand. The Mori loanword \\"Pkeh\\" usually refers to New Zealanders of European descent, although some reject this appellation,[9][10] and some Mori use it to refer to all non-Polynesian New Zealanders.[11] Most people born in New Zealand or one of the realm's external territories (Tokelau, the Ross Dependency, the Cook Islands and Niue) before 2006 are New Zealand citizens. Further conditions apply for those born from 2006 onwards.[12]\\r\\nIn June 2017, New Zealand has an estimated population of 4,793,700,[13] up from the 4,027,947 recorded in the 2006 census.[14] The median child birthing age was 30 and the total fertility rate is 2.1?births per woman in 2010. In Mori populations the median age is 26 and fertility rate 2.8.[15] In 2010 the age-standardised mortality rate was 3.8?deaths per 1000 (down from 4.8 in 2000) and the infant mortality rate for the total population was 5.1?deaths per 1000 live births.[15] The life expectancy of a New Zealand child born in 2014-16 was 83.4?years for females, and 79.9?years for males.[3] Life expectancy at birth is forecast to increase from 80?years to 85?years in 2050 and infant mortality is expected to decline.[16] In 2050 the population is forecast to reach 5.3?million, the median age to rise from 36?years to 43?years and the percentage of people 60?years of age and older rising from 18?percent to 29?percent.[16] (The number of people aged 65 and over increased by 22?percent between the 2006 and 2013 censuses.[17]) During early migration in 1858, New Zealand had 131 males for every 100 females, but following changes in migration patterns and the modern longevity advantage of women, females came to outnumber males in 1971.[18] As of 2012 there are 0.99 males per female, with males dominating under 15 years and females dominating in the 65 years and older range.[19]\\r\\nNew Zealand's population density is relatively low, at 17.9 per square kilometre (46.4 per square mile)  (June 2017 estimate).[13] The vast majority of the population live on the main North and South Islands, with New Zealand's major inhabited smaller islands being Waiheke Island (9,520), the Chatham and Pitt Islands (640), and Stewart Island (381).[13] Over three-quarters of the population live in the North Island (76.7 percent), with one-third of the total population living in the Auckland Region. This region is also the fastest growing, accounting for 46?percent of New Zealand's total population growth. Most Mori live in the North Island (86.0?percent), although less than a quarter (23.8?percent) live in Auckland.[21] New Zealand is a predominantly urban country, with 86.4?percent of the population living in an urban area. About 73.0?percent of the population live in the 17 main urban areas (population of 30,000 or more) and 53.8?percent live in the four largest cities of Auckland, Christchurch, Wellington, and Hamilton.[13]\\r\\nApproximately 14?percent of the population live in four different categories of rural areas as defined by Statistics New Zealand. About 18?percent of the rural population live in areas that have a high urban influence (roughly 12.9 people per square kilometre), many working in the main urban area. Rural areas with moderate urban influence and a population density of about 6.5?people per square kilometre account for 26?percent of the rural population. Areas with low urban influence where the majority of the residents work in the rural area house approximately 42?percent of the rural population. Remote rural areas with a density of less than 1 person per square kilometre account for about 14?percent of the rural population.[22]\\r\\nBefore local government reforms in the late 1980s, a borough council with more than 20,000 people could be proclaimed a city.[23][24] The boundaries of councils tended to follow the edge of the built-up area, so there was little difference between the urban area and the local government area. In 1989, all councils were consolidated into regional councils (top tier) and territorial authorities (second tier) which cover a much wider area and population than the old city councils.[25] Today a territorial authority must have a predominantly urban population of at least 50,000 before it can be officially recognised as a city.[26] The 20 largest urban areas are listed below:\\r\\nEast Polynesians were the first people to reach New Zealand about 1280, followed by the early European explorers, notably James Cook in 1769 who explored New Zealand three times and mapped the coastline. Following the Treaty of Waitangi in 1840 when the country became a British colony, immigrants were predominantly from Britain, Ireland and Australia. Due to restrictive policies, limitations were placed on non-European immigrants.[28] During the gold rush period (1858-1880s) large number of young men came from California and Victoria to New Zealand goldfields. Apart from British, there were Irish, North Germans, Scandinavians, Italian and many Chinese. The Chinese were sent special invitations by the Otago Chamber of Commerce in 1866. By 1873 they made up 40 percent of the diggers in Otago and 25 percent of the diggers in Westland.[29] From 1900 there was also significant Dutch, Dalmatian,[30] Italian, and German immigration together with indirect European immigration through Australia, North America, South America and South Africa.[31] Following the Great Depression policies were relaxed and migrant diversity increased. In 2008ÿ09, a target of 45,000 migrants was set by the New Zealand Immigration Service (plus a 5,000 tolerance).[32]\\r\\nJust over 25 percent of New Zealand's population at the 2013 census was born overseas, up from 23 percent in 2006 and 20 percent in 2001. Over half (51.6 percent) of New Zealand's overseas-born population lives in the Auckland Region, including 72 percent of the country's Pacific Island-born population, 64 percent of its Asian-born population, and 56 percent of its Middle Eastern and African- born population.[33] In the late 2000s, Asia overtook the British Isles as the largest source of overseas migrants; today around 32 percent of overseas-born New Zealand residents were born in Asia (mainly China, India, the Philippines and South Korea) compared to 26 percent born in the UK and Ireland.[34] The number of fee-paying international students increased sharply in the late 1990s, with more than 20,000 studying in public tertiary institutions in 2002.[35]\\r\\nTo be eligible for entry under the skilled migrant plan applicants are assessed by an approved doctor for good health, provide a police certificate to prove good character and speak sufficient English. Migrants working in some occupations (mainly health) must be registered with the appropriate profession body before they can work within that area.[36] Skilled migrants are assessed by Immigration New Zealand and applicants that they believe will contribute are issued with a residential visa, while those with potential are issued with a work to resident visa.[37] Under the work to residency process applicants are given a temporary work permit for two years and are then eligible to apply for residency.[38] Applicants with a job offer from an accredited New Zealand employer, cultural or sporting talent, looking for work where there has been a long-term skill shortage or to establish a business can apply for work to residency.[38][39]\\r\\nWhile most New Zealanders live in New Zealand, there is also a significant diaspora abroad, estimated as of 2001 at over 460,000 or 14?percent of the international total of New Zealand-born. Of these, 360,000, over three-quarters of the New Zealand-born population residing outside of New Zealand, live in Australia. Other communities of New Zealanders abroad are concentrated in other English-speaking countries, specifically the United Kingdom, the United States and Canada, with smaller numbers located elsewhere.[40] Nearly one quarter of New Zealand's highly skilled workers live overseas, mostly in Australia and Britain, more than any other developed nation.[41] However many educated professionals from Europe and lesser developed countries have recently migrated to New Zealand.[42][43] A common pathway for New Zealanders to move to the UK is through a job offer via the Tier 2 (General) visa, which grants a 3-year initial stay in the country and can later be extended with three more years. After 5 years the person can apply for permanent residency. Another popular option is the UK Working Holiday visa, also known as \\"Youth Mobility Scheme\\" (YMS), which grants New Zealanders 2-year rights to live and work in the UK.[44]\\r\\nNew Zealand is a multiethnic society, and home to people of many different national origins. Originally composed solely of the Mori who arrived in the thirteenth century, the ethnic makeup of the population later became dominated by New Zealanders of European descent.[45] In the nineteenth century, European settlers brought diseases for which the Mori had no immunity. By the 1890s, the Mori population was approximately 40 percent of its size pre-contact.[45] The Mori population increased during the twentieth century,[46] though it remains a minority.\\r\\nAt the latest census in 2013, 14.9?percent identified as Mori, 11.8?percent of the population were Asians (deriving from various nations in Asia), 7.4?percent were of Pacific Islander origin (including from the Cook Islands, Niue, and Tokelau, all of which are dependent states of New Zealand in the Pacific), and 1.2?percent were individuals of Middle-Eastern, Latin American, and African descent (MELAA).[n 2] Approximately three-quarters of the population were of European descent.[4] Most New Zealanders are of English,[47] Scottish[48] and Irish ancestry,[49] with smaller percentages of other European ancestries such as Dutch, Dalmatian, French, German and Scandinavian.[50] Auckland was the most diverse region with 59.3?percent identifying as Europeans, 23.1?percent as Asian, 10.7?percent as Mori, and 14.6?percent as Pacific Islanders.[51]\\r\\nAll major ethnic groups increased when compared with the 2006 census,[52] in which 67.6?percent identified as European, 14.6?percent as Mori, 9.2?percent as Asian, and 6.9?percent of Pacific Islander origin. An additional 11.1?percent identified themselves simply as a \\"New Zealander\\" (or similar), and 1.0?percent identified with other ethnicities.[53] There was significant public discussion about usage of the term \\"New Zealander\\" during the months leading up to the 2006 census.[54] The number of people identifying with this term increased from approximately 80,000 (2.4?percent) in 2001 to just under 430,000 people (11.1?percent) in 2006.[55] The European grouping significantly decreased from 80.0 percent of the population in 2001 to 67.6 percent in 2006, however, this is broadly proportional to the large increase in \\"New Zealanders\\".[55] The number of people identifying as a \\"New Zealander\\" dropped back to under 66,000 in 2013.[55]\\r\\nAs recorded in the 2013 census, the largest Mori iwi is Ngpuhi with 125,601 people (or 18.8 percent of people of Mori descent).[21] Since 2006, the number of people of Mori descent stating Ngpuhi as their iwi increased by 3,390 people (2.8?percent). The second-largest was Ngti Porou, with 71,049 people (down 1.2?percent from 2006). Ngi Tahu was the largest in the South Island and the third-largest overall, with a count of 54,819 people (an increase of 11.4?percent from 2006). A total of 110,928 people (or 18.5?percent) of Mori descent did not know their iwi (an increase of 8.4?percent compared with 2006).[21] A group of Mori migrated to Rkohu, now known as the Chatham Islands, where they developed their distinct Moriori culture.[56][57] The Moriori population was decimated, first, by disease brought by European sealers and whalers and, second, by Taranaki Mori, with only 101 surviving in 1862 and the last known full-blooded Moriori dying in 1933.[57] The number of people identifying as having Moriori descents increased from 105 in 1991 to 945 in 2006,[58] but decreased to 738 in 2013.[59]\\r\\nRecent increases in interracial marriages has resulted in the New Zealand population of Mori, Asian and Pacific Islander descent growing at a higher rate than those of European descent.[60] In 2013, 11.2?percent of people identified with more than one ethnic group,[55] compared with 10.4?percent in 2006.[61] The ethnic diversity of New Zealand is projected to increase. Europeans (including \\"New Zealanders\\") will remain the largest group, although it is predicted to fall to 70?percent in 2026. The Asian, Pacific and Mori groups are the fastest growing and will increase to 3.4?percent, 10?percent and 16?percent, respectively.[62] In 2013, the ethnicity of the population aged under 18 years was 71 percent European, 25 percent Mori, 13 percent Pacific, 12 percent Asian, and 1 percent MELAA.[4][63] The population aged 65?years or older consisted of 87.8 percent European, 5.6 percent Mori, 4.7 percent Asian and 2.4 percent Pacific.[17]\\r\\nThe maps below (taken from 2013 census data[4]) show the percentages of people in each census area unit identifying themselves as European, Mori, Asian, or Pacific Islander (as defined by Statistics New Zealand). As people could identify themselves with multiple groups, percentages are not cumulative.\\r\\nEnglish has long been entrenched as a de facto national language due to its widespread use.[64] In the 2013 census, 96.1?percent of respondents spoke English.[5] The New Zealand English dialect is mostly non-rhotic with an exception being the Southern Burr found principally in Southland and parts of Otago.[65] It is similar to Australian English and many speakers from the Northern Hemisphere are unable to tell the accents apart.[66] In New Zealand English the short i (as in kit) has become centralised, leading to the phrase fish and chips sounding like \\"fush and chups\\" to the Australian ear.[67] The words rarely and really, reel and real, doll and dole, pull and pool, witch and which, and full and fill can sometimes be pronounced as homophones.[68][69][65] Some New Zealanders pronounce the past participles grown, thrown and mown using two syllables, whereas groan, throne and moan are pronounced as one syllable.[70] New Zealanders often reply to a question or emphasise a point by adding a rising intonation at the end of the sentence.[71]\\r\\nInitially, the Mori language (te reo Mori) was permitted in native schools to facilitate English instruction, but as time went on official attitudes hardened against any use of the language. Mori were discouraged from speaking their own language in schools and work places and it existed as a community language only in a few remote areas.[72] The language underwent a revival beginning in the 1970s, and now more people speak Mori.[73][74] The future of the language was the subject of a claim before the Waitangi Tribunal in 1985. As a result, Mori was declared an official language in 1987.[75] In the 2013 census, 21.3?percent of Mori peopleand 3.7?percent of all respondents, including some non-Mori peoplereported conversational fluency in the language.[76][n 3] There are now Mori language immersion schools and two Mori Television channels, the only nationwide television channels to have the majority of their prime-time content delivered in Mori.[78] Many places have officially been given dual Mori and English names in recent years.\\r\\nIn the 2013 census, 20,235 people reported the ability to use New Zealand Sign Language. This is down 16?percent on the 2006 census.[5] NZSL was declared one of New Zealand's official languages in 2006.[79]\\r\\nSamoan is the most widely spoken non-official language (2.2?percent),[n 4] followed by Hindi (1.7?percent), \\"Northern Chinese\\" (including Mandarin, 1.3?percent) and French (1.2?percent).[5] A considerable proportion of first- and second-generation migrants are multilingual.\\r\\nEducation follows the three-tier model, which includes primary schools, followed by secondary schools (high schools) and tertiary education at universities or polytechnics. The Programme for International Student Assessment ranked New Zealand's education as the seventh highest in 2009.[80] The Education Index, published with the UN's 2014 Human Development Index and based on data from 2013, listed New Zealand at 0.917, ranked second after Australia.[81]\\r\\nPrimary and secondary schooling is compulsory for children aged 6 to 16[82] with most children starting at 5. Early leaving exemptions may be granted to 15-year-old students that have been experiencing some ongoing difficulties at school or are unlikely to benefit from continued attendance.[83] Parents and caregivers can home school their children if they obtain approval from the Ministry of Education and prove that their child will be taught \\"as regularly and as well as in a registered school\\".[84] There are 13 school years and attending state (public) schools is nominally free from a person's fifth birthday until the end of the calendar year following their 19th birthday.[84][85]\\r\\nThe academic year in New Zealand varies between institutions, but generally runs from late January until mid-December for primary and secondary schools and polytechnics, and from late February until mid-November for universities. New Zealand has an adult literacy rate of 99?percent,[86] and over half of the population aged 15 to 29 hold a tertiary qualification.[82][n 5] In the adult population 14.2?percent have a bachelor's degree or higher, 30.4?percent have some form of secondary qualification as their highest qualification and 22.4?percent have no formal qualification.[87]\\r\\nNew Zealand does not have a state religion,[89] but the principal religion is Christianity. As recorded in the 2013 census, about 49?percent of the population identified themselves as Christians,[n 7] although regular church attendance is estimated at 15?percent.[90] Another 41.9?percent indicated that they had no religion (up from 34.7?percent in 2006[91]) and around 6?percent affiliated with other religions.[88]\\r\\nThe indigenous religion of the Mori population was animistic, but with the arrival of missionaries from the early nineteenth century most of the Mori population converted to Christianity.[92] In the 2013 census, 2,595 Mori still identify themselves as adhering to traditional Mori beliefs.[88] The largest Christian denominations are Roman Catholicism, Anglicanism, Presbyterianism. There are also significant numbers of Christians who identify themselves with Methodist, Pentecostal, Baptist and Latter-day Saint churches, and the New Zealand-based Rtana church has adherents among Mori.[88] Immigration and associated demographic change in recent decades has contributed to the growth of minority religions,[93] especially Hinduism, Buddhism and Islam.[94][95]\\r\\nNew Zealand's early economy was based on sealing, whaling, flax, gold, kauri gum, and native timber.[96] During the 1880s agricultural products became the highest export earner and farming was a major occupation within New Zealand.[97] Farming is still a major employer, with 75 000 people indicating farming as their occupation during the 2006 census,[98] although dairy farming has recently taken over from sheep as the largest sector.[97] The largest occupation recorded during the census was sales assistant with 93,840 people.[98] Most people are on wages or salaries (59.9 percent), with the other sources of income being interest and investments (24.1 percent) and self-employment (16.6 percent).[99]\\r\\nIn 1982 New Zealand had the lowest per-capita income of all the developed nations surveyed by the World Bank.[100] In 2010 the estimated gross domestic product (GDP) at purchasing power parity (PPP) per capita was roughly US$28,250, between the thirty-first and fifty-first highest for all countries.[n 8] The median personal income in 2006 was $24,400. This was up from $15,600 in 1996, with the largest increases in the $50,000 to $70,000 bracket.[104] The median income for men was $31,500, $12,400 more than women.[105] The highest median personal income were for people identifying with the European or \\"other\\" ethnic group, while the lowest was from the Asian ethnic group. The median income for people identifying as Mori was $20,900.[106] In 2013, the median personal income had risen slightly to $28,500.[6]\\r\\nUnemployment peaked above 10?percent in 1991 and 1992,[107] before falling to a record low of 3.7?percent in 2007 (ranking third from twenty-seven comparable OECD nations).[108] Unemployment rose back to 7?percent in late 2009.[109] In the June 2017 quarter, unemployment had fallen to 4.8?percent. This is the lowest unemployment rate since December 2008, after the start of the global financial crisis, when it was 4.4 percent.[110] Most New Zealanders do some form of voluntary work, more women volunteer (92 percent) than males (86 percent).[111] Home ownership has declined since 1991, from 73.8?percent to 66.9?percent in 2006.[112]","input":"What is the approximate population of new zealand?"},{"output":"5% abv pure beer  (4% in Ireland)","context":"Molson Canadian is a brand of 5% abv pure beer  (4% in Ireland) brewed by Belliveau Brewing , the Canadian division of Molson Coors Brewing Company.

He is sometimes called the fastest pitcher in baseball history and had a fastball that probably exceeded 100?mph (160?km/h). Some experts believed it went as fast as 125?mph (201?km/h), others that his pitches traveled at 120?mph (190?km/h) or less.[3] As no radar gun or other device was available at games to measure the speed of his pitches precisely, the actual top speed of his pitches remains unknown. Regardless of its actual speed, his fastball earned him the nickname \\"White Lightning\\".[4] Such was his reputation that despite never reaching the major leagues, and finishing his minor league years in class-B ball, the 1966 Sporting News item about the end of his career was headlined \\"LIVING LEGEND RELEASED.\\"[5]\\r\\nDalkowski was also famous for his unpredictable performance and inability to control his pitches. His alcoholism and violent behavior off the field caused him problems during his career and after his retirement. After he retired from baseball, he spent many years as an alcoholic, making a meager living as a manual laborer. He recovered in the 1990s, but his alcoholism has left him with dementia and he has difficulty remembering his life after the mid-1960s.\\r\\nScreenwriter and film director Ron Shelton played in the Baltimore Orioles minor league organization soon after Dalkowski. His 1988 film Bull Durham features a character named \\"Nuke\\" LaLoosh (played by Tim Robbins) who is based loosely on the tales Shelton was told about Dalkowski.[6][7] Brendan Fraser's character in the film The Scout is loosely based on him.[8][unreliable source?] In 1970, Sports Illustrated's Pat Jordan wrote, \\"Inevitably, the stories outgrew the man, until it was no longer possible to distinguish fact from fiction. But, no matter how embellished, one fact always remained: Dalkowski struck out more batters and walked more batters per nine-inning game than any professional pitcher in baseball history.\\"[5]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nDalkowski began playing baseball in high school, and also played football as a quarterback for New Britain High School. During his time with the football team, they won the division championship twice, in 1955 and 1956. However, he excelled the most in baseball, and still holds a Connecticut state record for striking out 24 batters in a single game.[9]\\r\\nAfter graduating from high school in 1957, Dalkowski was immediately signed by the Baltimore Orioles for a $4,000 bonus, and initially played for their class-D minor league affiliate in Kingsport, Tennessee. He spent his entire career in the minor leagues, playing in nine different leagues during his nine-year career. His only appearance at the Orioles' Memorial Stadium was during an exhibition game in 1959, when he struck out the opposing side.[4]\\r\\nDalkowski's claim to fame was the high velocity of his fastball. Accurate measurements at the time were difficult to make, but the consensus is that Dalkowski regularly threw well above 100 miles per hour. Dalkowski's raw speed was aided by his highly flexible left (pitching) arm,[10] and by his unusual \\"buggy-whip\\" pitching motion, which ended in a cross-body arm swing. \\"I hit my left elbow on my right knee so often, they finally made me a pad to wear\\", recalled Dalkowski.[citation needed]\\r\\nBut Dalkowski also often had extreme difficulty controlling his pitches. He often walked more batters than he struck out, and many times his pitches would go wild  sometimes so wild that they ended up in the stands. Batters found the combination of extreme velocity and lack of control intimidating. Oriole Paul Blair stated that \\"He threw the hardest I ever saw. He was the wildest I ever saw\\".[11][12]\\r\\nDuring a typical season in 1960, while pitching in the California League, Dalkowski struck out 262 batters and walked 262 in 170 innings.[3] Dalkowski for 1960 thus figures at both 13.81 K/9IP and 13.81 BB/9IP (see lifetime statistics below). In comparison, Randy Johnson currently holds the major league record for strikeouts per nine innings in a season with 13.41.[13] In separate games, Dalkowski struck out 21 batters, and walked 21 batters.\\r\\nBecause a pitcher is generally considered wild if he averages four walks per nine innings, a pitcher of average repertoire who consistently walked as many as nine men per nine innings would not normally be considered a prospect. But such was the allure of Dalkowski's explosive arm that the Orioles gave him chance after chance to harness his \\"stuff\\", knowing that if he ever managed to control it, he would be a great weapon.\\r\\nPitching for the Kingsport (Tennessee) Orioles on August 31, 1957 in Bluefield, West Virginia, Dalkowski struck out 24 Bluefield hitters in a single minor league game, yet issued 18 walks, and threw six wild pitches.[14] Dalkowski pitched a total of 62 innings in 1957, struck out 121 (averaging 18 strikeouts per game), but won only once because he walked 129 and threw 39 wild pitches.[4] Moving to the Northern League in 1958ÿ59, he threw a one-hitter but lost 9ÿ8 on the strength of 17 walks. In 1957ÿ58, Dalkowski either struck out or walked almost three out of every four batters he faced.\\r\\nDuring the 1960s under Earl Weaver, then the manager for the Orioles' double-A affiliate in Elmira, New York, Dalkowski's game began to show improvement. Weaver had given all of the players an IQ test and discovered that Dalkowski had a lower than normal IQ.[15] Weaver believed that Dalkowski had had such difficulty keeping his game under control because he did not have the mental capacity. Weaver kept things simple for Dalkowski, telling him to only throw the fastball and a slider, and to just aim the fastball down the middle of the plate. This allowed Dalkowski to concentrate on just throwing the ball for strikes. Weaver knew that Dalkowski's fastball was practically unhittable no matter where it was in the strike zone, and if Dalkowski missed his target, he might end up throwing it on the corners for a strike anyway.[10] Under Weaver's stewardship, Dalkowski had his best season in 1962, posting personal bests in complete games and ERA, and walking less than a batter an inning for the first time in his career. In an extra-inning game, Dalkowski recorded 27 strikeouts (while walking 16 and throwing 283 pitches).\\r\\nDalkowski was invited to major league spring training in 1963, and the Orioles expected to call him up to the majors. On March 23, Dalkowski was used as a relief pitcher during a game against the New York Yankees. Most sources say that while throwing a slider to Phil Linz, he felt something pop in his left elbow, which turned out to be a severe muscle strain. Some uncertainty over the cause of his injury exists, however, with other sources contending that he damaged his elbow while throwing to first after fielding a bunt from Yankees pitcher Jim Bouton.[16] Either way, his arm never fully recovered.\\r\\nWhen he returned in 1964, Dalkowski's fastball had dropped to 90?mph (145?km/h), and midway through the season he was released by the Orioles.[17] He played for two more seasons with the Pittsburgh Pirates and Los Angeles Angels organizations before returning briefly to the Orioles farm system but was unable to regain his form before retiring in 1966.[17]\\r\\nDalkowski had a lifetime win-loss record of 46ÿ80 and an ERA of 5.57 in nine minor league seasons, striking out 1,396 and walking 1,354 in 995 innings.[17]\\r\\nDalkowski's wildness frightened even the bravest of hitters. Ted Williams faced Dalkowski once in a spring training game. \\"Fastest ever\\", said Williams. \\"I never want to face him again.\\"[18] Longtime umpire Doug Harvey also cited Dalkowski as the fastest pitcher he had seen: \\"Nobody could bring it like he could.\\"[19]\\r\\nEstimates of Dalkowski's top pitching speed abound. Cal Ripken Sr. guessed that he threw up to 115 miles per hour (185?km/h).[20] Most observers agree that he routinely threw well over 110?miles an hour (177?km/h), and sometimes reached 115?mph (180?km/h).[21] Radar guns, which were used for many years in professional baseball, did not exist when Dalkowski was playing, so the only evidence supporting this level of velocity is anecdotal. It is certain that with his high speed and penchant for throwing wild pitches, he would have been an intimidating opponent for any batter who faced him. Andy Etchebarren, a catcher for Dalkowski at Elmira, described his fastball as \\"light\\" and fairly easy to catch. According to Etchebarren his wilder pitches usually went high, sometimes low; \\"Dalkowski would throw a fastball that looked like it was coming in at knee level, only to see it sail past the batter's eyes\\".[19]\\r\\nDalkowski's greatest legacy may be the number of anecdotes (some more believable than others) surrounding his pitching ability. He was said to have thrown a pitch that tore off part of a batter's ear. Some observers believed that this incident made Dalkowski even more nervous and contributed further to his wildness. Another story says that in 1960 at Stockton, California, he threw a pitch that broke umpire Doug Harvey's mask in three places, knocking him 18 feet (5?m) back and sending him to a hospital for three days with a concussion. Dalkowski once won a $5 bet with teammate Herm Starrette who said that he could not throw a baseball through a wall. Dalkowski warmed up and then moved 15 feet (5?m) away from the wooden outfield fence. His first pitch went right through the boards.[4] On another bet, Dalkowski threw a ball over a fence 440 feet (134?m) away.\\r\\nThe only recorded evidence of his pitching speed stems from 1958, when Dalkowski was sent by the Orioles to Aberdeen Proving Ground, a military installation. Here, using a radar machine, he was clocked at 93.5 miles per hour (150.5?km/h), a fast but not outstanding speed for a professional pitcher. However, several factors worked against Dalkowski: he had pitched a game the day before, he was throwing from a flat surface instead of from a pitcher's mound, and he had to throw pitches for 40?minutes at a small target before the machine could capture an accurate measurement. Further, the device measured speed from a few feet away from the plate, instead of 10 feet from release as in modern times. This cost Dalkowski approximately 9 MPH, not even considering the other factors.[22]\\r\\nAccording to the Guinness Book of Records, the current record holder for fastest pitch is Nolan Ryan, with a pitch clocked at 100.9?mph (162.4?km/h) in 1974, though the record has not been updated in many years and several pitchers have recorded faster pitches since then. That seems to be because Ryan's speed was recorded 10' from the plate, unlike 10' from release as today, costing him up to 10 MPH. http://www.efastball.com/baseball/stats/fastest-pitch-speed-in-major-leagues/ Earl Weaver, who had years of exposure to both pitchers, said, \\"[Dalkowski] threw a lot faster than Ryan.\\"[23] The hardest thrower in baseball currently is recognized as Aroldis Chapman, who has been clocked with the fastest pitch on record at 105.1?mph (169?km/h).\\r\\nScientists contend that the theoretical maximum speed that a pitcher can throw is slightly above 100?mph (161?km/h). Beyond that the pitcher would cause himself a serious injury.[24] There is no doubt that a pitcher who can throw at 100?mph+ is rare, with only a small handful of pitchers every generation being capable of this feat.\\r\\nIn 1965 he married schoolteacher Linda Moore in Bakersfield, but they divorced two years later. Unable to find any gainful employment, he became a migrant worker. Dalkowski experienced problems with alcohol abuse.[25] He drank heavily as a player and his drinking escalated after the end of his career. He received help from the Association of Professional Ball Players of America (APBPA) periodically from 1974 to 1992 and went through rehabilitation. He was able to find a job and stay sober for several months but soon went back to drinking. The APBPA stopped providing financial assistance to him because he was using the funds to purchase alcohol.[26]\\r\\nPoor health in the 1980s prevented him from working altogether, and by the end of the decade he was living in a small apartment in California, penniless and suffering from alcohol-induced dementia. At some point during this time he married a motel clerk named Virginia, who moved him to Oklahoma City in 1993. She died of a brain aneurysm in 1994. Dalkowski has lived at a long-term care facility in New Britain for several years.[27] In a 2003 interview, Dalkowski said that he was unable to remember life events that occurred from 1964 to 1994.[26]\\r\\nFor his contributions to baseball lore, he was inducted into the Shrine of the Eternals on July 19, 2009.[28] Sports Illustrated's 1970 profile of Dalkowski concluded, \\"His failure was not one of deficiency, but rather of excess. He was too fast. His ball moved too much. His talent was too superhuman... It mattered only that once, just once, Steve Dalkowski threw a fastball so hard that Ted Williams never even saw it. No one else could claim that.\\"[29]","input":"Who is the hardest throwing pitcher in baseball?"},{"output":"Uruguay","context":"The 1930 FIFA World Cup was the inaugural FIFA World Cup, the world championship for men's national association football teams. It took place in Uruguay from 13 July to 30 July 1930. FIFA, football's international governing body, selected Uruguay as host nation, as the country would be celebrating the centenary of its first constitution, and the Uruguay national football team had successfully retained their football title at the 1928 Summer Olympics. All matches were played in the Uruguayan capital, Montevideo, the majority at the Estadio Centenario, which was built for the tournament.\\r\\nThirteen teams (seven from South America, four from Europe, and two from North America) entered the tournament. Few European teams chose to participate because of the difficulty of travelling to South America. The teams were divided into four groups, with the winner of each group progressing to the semi-finals. The first two World Cup matches took place simultaneously, and were won by France and the United States, who defeated Mexico 4ÿ1 and Belgium 3ÿ0, respectively. Lucien Laurent of France scored the first goal in World Cup history, while American goalkeeper Jimmy Douglas posted the first official \\"clean sheet\\" in the tournament.\\r\\nArgentina, Uruguay, the United States and Yugoslavia each won their respective groups to qualify for the semi-finals.

Every country affiliated with FIFA was invited to compete, and given a deadline of 28 February 1930 to accept. Plenty of interest was shown by nations in the Americas; Argentina, Brazil, Bolivia, Chile, Mexico, Paraguay, Peru and the United States all entered. A total of seven South American teams participated, more than in any subsequent World Cup Finals. However, because of the long and costly trip by ship across the Atlantic Ocean, and the length of absence required for players,[1] very few European teams were inclined to take part. Some refused to countenance travel to South America in any circumstances,[3] and no European entries were received before the February deadline. In an attempt to gain some European participation, the Uruguayan Football Association sent a letter of invitation to The Football Association, even though the British Home Nations (England, Northern Ireland, Scotland and Wales) had resigned from FIFA at the time. This was rejected by the FA Committee on 18 November 1929.[4] Two months before the start of the tournament, no team from Europe had officially entered.[5] FIFA president Jules Rimet intervened, and eventually four European teams made the trip by sea: Belgium, France, Romania, and Yugoslavia. The Romanians, managed by Constantin R?dulescu and coached by their captain Rudolf Wetzer and Octav Luchide, entered the competition following the intervention of newly crowned King Carol?II. He selected the squad personally, and negotiated with employers to ensure that the players would still have jobs upon their return.[6] The French entered at the personal intervention of Rimet, but neither France's star defender Manuel Anatol nor the team's regular coach Gaston Barreau could be persuaded to make the trip.[7] The Belgians participated at the instigation of German-Belgian FIFA vice-president Rodolphe Seeldrayers.[8]\\r\\nThe Romanians boarded the SS Conte Verde at Genoa, the French were picked up at Villefranche-sur-Mer on 21 June 1930;[10] and the Belgians embarked at Barcelona.[11] The Conte Verde carried Rimet, the trophy and the three designated European referees: the Belgians Jean Langenus and Henri Christophe, along with Thomas Balway, a Parisian who may have been English. The Brazilian team were picked up when the boat docked in Rio de Janeiro on 29 June before arriving in Uruguay on 4 July.[5] Yugoslavia travelled via the mail steamship Florida from Marseille.[11]\\r\\nIn the Kingdom of Yugoslavia there were doubts about their participation at first. Since the Croatians decided to boycott the national team, King Alexander I did not want to finance the whole idea, but in the end they found a solution. Belgrade football association officials decided to round up only domestic (Serbian) star players, mainly from two rival Belgrade clubs, BSK and SK Jugoslavija, with an additional three Serbs who played for French clubs (Ivan Bek among them). Therefore, the Yugoslavia team was exclusively made up of Serbian players; and with the two biggest stars of the team, Blagoje Marjanovi? (\\"Mo?a\\") and Aleksandar Tirnani? (\\"Tirke\\"), both from BSK, they were ready for a trip to South America to represent Yugoslavia in the World Cup. The Yugoslavians were the youngest team in the World Cup; with an average age of 21 years and 258 days. After their first match, against Brazil, they received a new nickname \\"The Ich-es\\" or \\"Ichachos\\" (in Spanish) by the Uruguayan press; referring to most of the player's surnames that ended up with the \\"-i?\\" or \\"-vi?\\" suffix, which is quite common for Serbian last names. They achieved the jointÿbiggest success in both Yugoslav and Serbian subsequent World Cup footballing history, by earning fourth place.[12]\\r\\nAll matches took place in Montevideo. Three stadiums were used: Estadio Centenario, Estadio Pocitos, and Estadio Parque Central. The Estadio Centenario was built both for the tournament and as a celebration of the centenary of Uruguayan independence. Designed by Juan Scasso,[13] it was the primary stadium for the tournament, referred to by Rimet as a \\"temple of football\\".[14] With a capacity of 90,000, it was the largest football stadium outside the British Isles.[8] The stadium hosted 10 of the 18?matches, including both semi-finals and the final. However, a rushed construction schedule and delays caused by the rainy season meant the Centenario was not ready for use until five days into the tournament.[15] Early matches were played at smaller stadiums usually used by Montevideo football clubs Nacional and Pe?arol, the 20,000 capacity Parque Central and the Pocitos.\\r\\nFor a list of all squads that appeared in the final tournament, see 1930 FIFA World Cup squads.\\r\\nFifteen referees participated in the tournament: four Europeans ÿ two Belgians (Henri Christophe and John Langenus), a Frenchman, and a Romanian (Constantin R?dulescu, also the Romanian team coach),[16] and eleven from the Americas ÿ among them six Uruguayans. In order to eliminate differences in the application of the Laws of the Game, the referees were invited to one short meeting to iron out the most conflicting issues arising from the game.[17]\\r\\nOf all the refereeing appointments, the two that attracted most attention were that of Gilberto de Almeida Rgo in the match between Argentina and France, in which the Brazilian referee blew for full-time six minutes early, and that of the Bolivian Ulises Saucedo's in the Argentina and Mexico encounter, which Argentina won 6ÿ3. During the game Saucedo, who was also the coach of Bolivia,[16] awarded three penalties.\\r\\nThe following is the list of officials to serve as referees and linesmen. Officials in italics were only employed as linesmen during the tournament.\\r\\nThe 13 teams were drawn into four groups, with Group 1 containing four teams, and the others containing only three. Each group played a round-robin format, with two points awarded for a win and one point for a draw. If two teams had tied on points to win a group, a play-off would have been used to decide the group winner; however, this was not necessary. The four group winners progressed to the knockout semi-final stage. Extra time was available in the knockout matches if the two teams were level after ninety minutes, but it was not required.\\r\\nUruguay, Argentina, Brazil, and the United States were seeded, and were kept apart in the draw,[18] which took place in Montevideo once all the teams arrived.[19]\\r\\nSince there were no qualifying games, the opening two matches of the tournament were the first World Cup games ever played, taking place simultaneously on 13 July 1930; France beat Mexico 4ÿ1 at the Estadio Pocitos, while the United States defeated Belgium 3ÿ0 at the same time at the Estadio Gran Parque Central. France's Lucien Laurent was the scorer of the first World Cup goal.[20]\\r\\nThe first group was the only one to contain four teams: Argentina, Chile, France and Mexico. Two days after France's victory over Mexico, they faced group favourites Argentina. Injuries hindered France; goalkeeper Alex Thpot had to leave the field after 20?minutes, and Laurent, after a fierce tackle by Luis Monti, spent most of the match limping. However, they held out for most of the match, only succumbing to an 81st-minute goal scored from a Monti free kick.[21] The game featured an officiating controversy when referee Almeida Rgo erroneously blew the final whistle six minutes early, with Frenchman Marcel Langiller clear on goal; play only resumed after protests from the French players.[22] Though France had played twice in 48 hours, Chile had yet to play their first match. They faced Mexico the following day, gaining a comfortable 3ÿ0 win.[23]\\r\\nFrance's final match, against Chile, featured the first penalty kick of the tournament and World Cup history. The first goalkeeper to save a penalty was Alex Thpot of France on 19 July 1930, saving from Chile's Carlos Vidal in the 30th minute of the match.[24] In Argentina's second match, against Mexico, three penalty kicks were awarded. During the same match on 19 July 1930 Mexico's Oscar Bonfiglio Martnez saved another penalty at the 23rd minute of the match against Argentina's Fernando Paternoster.[24] Guillermo Stbile scored a hat-trick in his international debut[25] as Argentina won 6ÿ3, despite the absence of their captain Manuel Ferreira, who had returned to Buenos Aires to take a law exam.[26] Qualification was decided by the group's final match, contested by Argentina and Chile, who had beaten France and Mexico, respectively. The game was marred by a brawl sparked by a foul on Arturo Torres by Monti.[22] Argentina won 3ÿ1 against their neighbours and advanced to the semi-finals.\\r\\nThe second group contained Brazil, Bolivia and Yugoslavia. Brazil, the group seeds, were expected to progress, but in the group's opening match, unexpectedly lost 2ÿ1 to Yugoslavia.[27] Going into the tournament Bolivia had never previously won an international match. For their opener they paid tribute to the hosts by wearing shirts each emblazoned with a single letter, spelling \\"Viva Uruguay\\" as the team lined up.[28] Both of Bolivia's matches followed a similar pattern, a promising start gradually transforming into heavy defeat. Against Yugoslavia, they held out for an hour before conceding, but were four goals down by the final whistle.[23] Misfortune played its part; several Bolivian goals were disallowed.[28] Against Brazil, when both teams had only pride to play for, the score was 1ÿ0 to Brazil at half-time. Brazil added three more in the second half, two of them scored by the multi-sportsman Preguinho.[29] Yugoslavia qualified for the semi-finals.\\r\\nHosts Uruguay were in a group with Peru and Romania. The opening match in this group saw the first player expulsion in the competition, when Plcido Galindo of Peru was dismissed against Romania. The Romanians made their man advantage pay; their 3ÿ1 win included two late goals. This match had the smallest crowd of any in World Cup history. The official attendance was 2,459, but the actual figure is generally accepted to be around 300.[30]\\r\\nBecause of construction delays at Estadio Centenario, Uruguay's first match was not played until five days into the tournament. The first to be held at the Centenario, it was preceded by a ceremony in honour of the Uruguayan centenary celebrations. The Uruguayan team spent the four weeks preceding the match in a training camp, at which strict discipline was exercised. Goalkeeper Andrs Mazali was dropped from the squad for breaking a curfew to visit his wife.[31] One hundred years to the day of the creation of Uruguay's first constitution, the hosts won a tight match against Peru 1ÿ0.[32] Spectators praised Peru's defense, and this turned out to be the only tournament match in which Uruguay scored only one goal.[33] The result was viewed as a poor performance by the Uruguayan press, but lauded in Peru.[32] Uruguay subsequently defeated Romania with ease, scoring four first half goals to win 4ÿ0.\\r\\nThe United States dominated the fourth group. The American team, which contained a significant number of new caps, were reputedly nicknamed \\"the shot-putters\\" by an unnamed source in the French contingent.[2] They beat their first opponents, Belgium, 3ÿ0. The ease of the victory was unexpected; Uruguayan newspaper Imparcial wrote that \\"the large score of the American victory has really surprised the experts\\".[34] Belgian reports bemoaned the state of the pitch and refereeing decisions, claiming that the second goal was offside.[34] The group's second match, played in windy conditions,[35] witnessed the first tournament hat-trick, scored by Bert Patenaude of the United States against Paraguay. Until 10 November 2006, the first hat-trick that FIFA acknowledged had been scored by Guillermo Stbile of Argentina, two days after Patenaude; however, in 2006 FIFA announced that Patenaude's claim to being the first hat-trick scorer was valid, as a goal previously assigned to teammate Tom Florie was reattributed to Patenaude.[36][37] With the United States having secured qualification, the final match in the group was a dead rubber. Paraguay beat Belgium by a 1ÿ0 margin.[23]\\r\\nThe four group winners, Argentina, Yugoslavia, Uruguay and the United States, moved to the semi-finals. The two semi-final matches saw identical scores. The first semi-final was played between the USA and Argentina on a rain-drenched pitch. The United States team, which featured six British-born players, lost midfielder Raphael Tracy after ten minutes to a broken leg as the match became violent.[38] A Monti goal halfway through the first half gave Argentina a 1ÿ0 half-time lead. In the second half, the strength of the United States team was overwhelmed by the pace of the Argentinian attacks, the match finishing 6ÿ1 to Argentina.[39]\\r\\nIn the second semi-final there were shades of the 1924 Summer Olympics match between Yugoslavia and Uruguay. Here, though, Yugoslavia took a surprise lead through Vujadinovi?. Uruguay then took a 2ÿ1 lead. Then shortly before half-time Yugoslavia had a goal disallowed by a controversial offside decision.[27] The hosts scored three more in the second half to win 6ÿ1, Pedro Cea completing a hat-trick.[39]\\r\\nThe now-traditional third place play-off was not established until 1934, so the format of the 1930 World Cup is unique in not distinguishing between the third and fourth placed teams. Occasional sources, notably a FIFA Bulletin from 1984, incorrectly imply that a third-place match occurred and was won 3ÿ1 by Yugoslavia.[40] Accounts differ as to whether a third-place match was originally scheduled. According to a 2009 book by Hyder Jawad, Yugoslavia refused to play a third-place match because they were upset with the refereeing in their semi-final against Uruguay.[41]\\r\\nAt the end of the championship, the captains of the United States team (Tom Florie)[42] and Yugoslavia (Milutin Ivkovi?)[43] both received bronze medals. Yet a FIFA technical committee report on the 1986 World Cup included full retrospective rankings of all teams at all previous World Cup finals; this report ranked the United States third and Yugoslavia fourth,[44] a practice since continued by FIFA.[45] In 2010, the son of Kosta Had?i, the chief of Yugoslav delegation at the 1930 World Cup and the vice-president of the Football Association of Yugoslavia at the time, claimed that Yugoslavia, as a team, has been awarded one bronze medal, which has been kept by Had?i himself and his family for the following 80 years. According to this source, Yugoslavia was placed third because of the semi-finals loss to the eventual champions, Uruguay.[46][47]\\r\\nThe resounding wins for Uruguay and Argentina in the semi-finals meant the final was a repeat of the matchup in the 1928 Olympic final, which Uruguay had won 2ÿ1 after a replay.\\r\\nThe final was played at the Estadio Centenario on 30 July. Feelings ran high around the La Plata Basin as the Argentine supporters crossed the river with the war cry Victoria o muerte (\\"victory or death\\"), dispelling any uncertainty as to whether the tournament had captured the imagination of the public. The ten boats earmarked to carry Argentine fans from Buenos Aires to Montevideo proved inadequate,[27] and any number of assorted craft attempted the crossing. An estimated 10ÿ15,000 Argentinians made the trip, but the port at Montevideo was so overwhelmed that many did not even make landfall before kick-off, let alone reach the stadium.[48] At the stadium, supporters were searched for weapons.[49] The gates were opened at eight o'clock, six hours before kick-off, and at noon the ground was full,[27] the official attendance 93,000.[50] A disagreement overshadowed the build-up to the match as the teams failed to agree on who should provide the match ball, forcing FIFA to intervene and decree that the Argentine team would provide the ball for the first half and the Uruguayans would provide their own for the second.[2] Uruguay made one change from their semi-final line-up. Castro replaced Anselmo, who missed out due to illness.[39] Monti played for Argentina despite receiving death threats on the eve of the match. The referee was Belgian John Langenus, who only agreed to officiate a few hours before the game, having sought assurances for his safety.[51] One of his requests was for a boat to be ready at the harbour within one hour of the final whistle, in case he needed to make a quick escape.[52]\\r\\nThe hosts scored the opening goal through Pablo Dorado, a low shot from a position on the right.[53] Argentina, displaying superior passing ability, responded strongly. Within eight minutes they were back on level terms; Carlos Peucelle received a Ferreira through-ball, beat his marker and equalised.[53] Shortly before half-time leading tournament goalscorer Guillermo Stbile gave Argentina a 2ÿ1 lead. Uruguay captain Nasazzi protested, maintaining that Stbile was offside, but to no avail.[51] In the second half Uruguay gradually became ascendant. Shortly after Monti missed a chance to make the score 3ÿ1, Uruguay attacked in numbers, and Pedro Cea scored an equaliser.[53] Ten minutes later a goal by Santos Iriarte gave Uruguay the lead, and just before full-time Castro made it 4ÿ2 to seal the win.[51] Langenus ended the match a minute later, and Uruguay thus added the title World Cup winners to their mantle of Olympic champions. Jules Rimet presented the World Cup Trophy, which was later named for him, to the head of the Uruguayan Football Association, Ra~l Jude.[54] The following day was declared a national holiday in Uruguay;[50] in the Argentinian capital, Buenos Aires, a mob threw stones at the Uruguayan consulate.[55] Francisco Varallo (who played as a forward for Argentina) was the last player of the final to die, on 30 August 2010.[56]\\r\\nFrance, Yugoslavia and the United States all played friendlies in South America following the competition. Brazil played France on 1 August, Yugoslavia on 10 August and the United States on 17 August,[57] while Argentina hosted Yugoslavia on 3 August.[58]\\r\\nUruguay's aggregate goal difference of +12 over four games, at an average of +3 per match, remains the highest average goal difference per match of any World Cup champion, and the second highest of any World Cup Finals participant, after Hungary in 1954.\\r\\nArgentina? v ?United States\\r\\nUruguay? v  Yugoslavia\\r\\nUruguay? v ?Argentina\\r\\nWith eight goals, Guillermo Stbile was the top scorer in the tournament. In total, 70 goals were scored by 37 different players, with only one of them credited as an own goal.\\r\\nIn 1986, FIFA published a report that ranked all teams in each World Cup up to and including 1986, based on progress in the competition, overall results and quality of the opposition.[60][61] The rankings for the 1930 tournament were as follows:\\r\\nThe last surviving player from Uruguay's World Cup-winning side was Ernesto Mascheroni, who died on 3 July 1984 at the age of 76. He was outlived by reserve defender Emilio Recoba who died on 12 September 1992 (aged 87), but did not play any matches in the tournament. However, many other players who participated in the tournament were still alive by this stage and the last surviving player from the tournament was Argentina's Francisco Varallo, who died on 30 August 2010 at the age of 100 ÿ eighty years after the tournament.[62]\\r\\nA recreation of the tournament from the point of view of the Yugoslavian team can be seen in the 2014 Serbian film See You in Montevideo.","input":"Where was the first world cup football held?"},{"output":"Shawna Rochelle Kimbrell","context":"Shawna Rochelle Kimbrell is a Lieutenant Colonel in the United States Air Force, and the first female African-American fighter pilot in the history of that service.

It is a 174 mph road-legal racing car and one of only 36 built between 1962 and 1964. It was purchased by an American businessman.\\r\\n\\r\\nA 1962 Ferrari 250 GTO, serial number 3413GT, sold at RM Sotheby's Auction on August 25, 2018 for US $48,405,000 (including buyer's premium). This broke the record previously held by another 1962 Ferrari 250 GTO, serial number 3851GT, which sold for a then-record $38,115,000 (including buyer's premium) at Bonham's Quail Auction on August 14, 2014. While collectible cars have been sold privately for more, this is the highest price ever paid for a car at a public auction. [1]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe 1904 Rolls-Royce 10 hp Two-Seater is currently listed on the Guinness World Records as the most expensive veteran car to be sold, at the price of US$7,254,290 (equivalent to $8,562,000 in 2017), on a Bonhams auction held at Olympia in London on December 3, 2007.[2]\\r\\n\\r\\nThis list only consists of those that have been sold for at least $4 million in auction sales during a traditional bidding process, inclusive of the mandatory buyers premium and does not include private, unsuccessful (failing to reach its reserve price, incomplete) and out of auction sales.\\r\\n\\r\\nCommon contributing factors affecting the value of auctioned automobiles include:\\r\\n\\r\\nAside those mentioned above, the world economy is the other main factor to the value of collectible cars as classic cars are frequently regarded as an alternative investment.[17][29]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe market began in the 1970s when used Ferraris were exported to Italian exotic car dealers in the United States who were willing to buy every vehicle which they were offered. During the 1973 oil crisis (when prices of exotic cars plummeted rapidly), almost new and top-of-range models frequented in used car lots, a Lamborghini Miura could be bought for $15,000 at the time.[30] A 1960 Ferrari 250 GT SWB California Spider that went on to sell for $4,950,000 in 2009 was offered for sale in the June 1964 issue of Road & Track for US$10,500 (equivalent to $83,000 in 2017), in the April 1976 issue of Hemmings Motor News, the same car was offered at US$16,750 (equivalent to $72,000 in 2017).[31] After a period of ups and downs in the 1970s and early 1980s, interest rates eased, meaning highly desirable exotic cars whose decals once frequented bedroom walls of collectible car fans suddenly became affordable.[30]\\r\\n\\r\\nDuring the 1980s boom, investors frequented auctions, causing prices to skyrocket. When cars were sold, they were commonly shifted to storage for investors intending to eventually profit on their accrued collectors value. The high prices drove enthusiasts away from the market, and cars passed from investor to investor with little or no profit gained.[17] The 1980s boom was followed by 1990s bust, and the values of classic cars plummeted, causing most owners to lose considerable portions of their investment portfolio values.[32]\\r\\n\\r\\nAccording to the November 1997 issue of Car Magazine, the Ferrari F40 was credited for sparking the price speculation craze.[33]\\r\\n\\r\\nDuring the height of the Japanese asset price bubble in the late 1980s, when the yen had strengthened from an exchange rate of about 300 yen per one U.S. dollar in 1985 to about 150 yen per U.S. dollar in 1989, wealthy Japanese buyers began to buy classic cars for effectively half the previous cost in yen. One example of this occurred in 1989, a Ferrari 250 GTO (3909GT) was privately sold to Takeo Kato for $13,837,500.[30] When the bubble burst, it was resold to Talacrest, an Egham (in Surrey) based Ferrari dealer for $2.7m in 1994,[34] and was eventually sold again to David Morrison (a London-based American) for an estimated $3.5 million. It was most recently passed on in 2001 to John Mozart, via private sale in exchange for a Ferrari 250 TR, who acquired it for an estimated price of $7,000,000.[30]\\r\\n\\r\\nAlthough in general, prices of collectible cars have slightly recessed as a result of the recent recession,[35] prices for most high-end collector cars have held their value or continued to rise.[3] Since the 1990s recession, values of the most desirable cars have risen by at least 200%.[32] This changing trend in value fluctuation can be attributed to most investors thoroughly researching the cars they are interested prior to purchase, in contrast to the short-sighted, spontaneous purchases which destabilized the collectible car market during the 1980s.[36]\\r\\n\\r\\nBetween 2005 and 2010, the value of vintage cars have increased by an average of 21%, according to Dietrich Hatlapa of the HAGI Index (Historic Automobile Group International).[35]\\r\\n\\r\\nOne of the largest challenges faced by those who invest in collectible cars is the risk of immediate devaluation following an automobile accident which causes physical damage to the vehicle. The most expensive car crash in recorded motoring history was caused by Christopher Cox, who crashed while driving his Ferrari 250 GTO and completely destroyed its front end. The car itself has an estimated value of approximately $30 million (USD) prior to the incident.[37]\\r\\n\\r\\nInfo: Click and drag to zoom. Click to zoom out. Select legend elements to filter.

The species are evergreen or deciduous trees, shrubs, and climbers from tropics to temperate zones worldwide.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe genus Ilex is widespread throughout the temperate and subtropical regions of the world. It includes species of trees, shrubs, and climbers, with evergreen or deciduous foliage and inconspicuous flowers. Its range was more extended in the Tertiary period and many species are adapted to laurel forest habitat. It occurs from sea level to more than 2,000 metres (6,600?ft) with high mountain species. It is a genus of small, evergreen trees with smooth, glabrous, or pubescent branchlets. The plants are generally slow-growing with some species growing to 25?m (82?ft) tall. The type species is the European holly Ilex aquifolium described by Linnaeus.[2]\\r\\nPlants in this genus have simple, alternate glossy leaves, frequently with a spiny leaf margin. The inconspicuous flower is greenish white, with four petals. They are generally dioecious, with male and female flowers on different plants.\\r\\nThe small fruits of Ilex, although often referred to as berries, are technically drupes.[3] They range in color from red to brown to black, and rarely green or yellow. The \\"bones\\" contain up to ten seeds each. Some species produce fruits parthenogenetically, such as the cultivar 'Nellie R. Stevens'. The fruits ripen in winter and thus provide winter colour contrast between the bright red of the fruits and the glossy green evergreen leaves. Hence the cut branches, especially of I. aquifolium, are widely used in Christmas decoration. The fruits are generally slightly toxic to humans, and can cause vomiting and diarrhea when ingested. However, they are an important food source for birds and other animals, which help disperse the seeds. Unfortunately this can have negative impacts as well. Along the west coast of North America, from California to British Columbia, English Holly (Ilex aquifolium), which is grown commercially, is quickly spreading into native forest habitat, where it thrives in shade and crowds out native species. It has been placed on the Washington State Noxious Weed Control Board's monitor list, and is a Class C invasive plant in Portland.[4][5][6][7]\\r\\nIlex in Latin means the holm-oak or evergreen oak (Quercus ilex). Despite the Linnaean classification of Ilex as holly, as late as the 19th century in Britain, the term Ilex was still being applied to the oak as well as the holly ÿ possibly due to the superficial similarity of the leaves.[8][9] The name \\"holly\\" in common speech refers to Ilex aquifolium, specifically stems with berries used in Christmas decoration. By extension, \\"holly\\" is also applied to the whole genus. The origin of the word \\"holly\\" is considered a reduced form of Old English hole(?)n,[10] Middle English Holin, later Hollen.[11] [12] The French word for holly, houx, derives from the Old Low Franconian *hulis (Middle Dutch huls).[13] Both are related to Old High German hulis, huls,[14] as are Low German/Low Franconian terms like Hlse or hulst. These Germanic words appear to be related to words for holly in Celtic languages, such as Welsh celyn, Breton kelen(n) and Irish cuileann. [15]\\r\\nSeveral Romance languages use the Latin word acrifolium (turned into aquifolium in modern time), so Italian agrifoglio, Occitan grefulh, etc. [16]\\r\\nThe phylogeography of this group provides examples of various speciation mechanisms at work. In this scenario ancestors of this group became isolated from the remaining Ilex when the Earth mass broke away into Gondwana and Laurasia about 82?million years ago, resulting in a physical separation of the groups and beginning a process of change to adapt to new conditions. This mechanism is called allopatric speciation. Over time, survivor species of the holly genus adapted to different ecological niches. This led to reproductive isolation, an example of ecological speciation. In the Pliocene, around five million years ago, mountain formation diversified the landscape and provided new opportunities for speciation within the genus.\\r\\nThe fossil record indicates that the Ilex lineage was already widespread prior to the end of the Cretaceous period. Based on the molecular clock, the common ancestor of most of the extant species probably appeared during the Eocene, about 50?million years ago, suggesting that older representatives of the genus belong to now extinct branches.[17] The laurel forest covered great areas of the Earth during the Paleogene, when the genus was more prosperous. This type of forest extended during the Neogene, more than 20?million years ago. Most of the last remaining temperate evergreen forests are believed to have disappeared about 10,000 years ago at the end of the Pleistocene. Many of the then-existing species with the strictest ecological requirements became extinct because they could not cross the barriers imposed by the geography, but others found refuge as a species relict in coastal enclaves, archipelagos, and coastal mountains sufficiently far from areas of extreme cold and aridity and protected by the oceanic influence.\\r\\nThe genus includes about 400 to 600 species, divided into three subgenera:\\r\\nThe genus is distributed throughout the world's different climates. Most species make their home in the tropics and subtropics, with a worldwide distribution in temperate zones. The greatest diversity of species is found in the Americas and in Southeast Asia.\\r\\nIlex mucronata, formerly the type species of Nemopanthus, is native to eastern North America.[18] Nemopanthus was treated as a separate genus with eight species.[19] of the family Aquifoliaceae, now transferred to Ilex on molecular data;[20] it is closely related to Ilex amelanchier.[21]\\r\\nIn Europe the genus is represented by a single species, the classically named holly Ilex aquifolium, and in continental Africa by this species and (Ilex mitis). Ilex canariensis, from Macaronesia, and Ilex aquifolium arose from a common ancestor in the laurel forests of the Mediterranean. Australia, isolated at an early period, has (Ilex arnhemensis). Of 204 species growing in China, 149 species are endemic. A species which stands out for its economic importance in Spanish-speaking countries is Ilex paraguariensis or Yerba mate. Having evolved numerous species that are endemic to islands and small mountain ranges, and being highly useful plants, many hollies are now becoming rare.\\r\\nOften the tropical species are especially threatened by habitat destruction and overexploitation. At least two species of Ilex have become extinct recently, and many others are barely surviving.[22]\\r\\nThey are extremely important food for numerous species of birds, and also are eaten by other wild animals. In the autumn and early winter the fruits are hard and apparently unpalatable. After being frozen or frosted several times, the fruits soften, and become milder in taste. During winter storms, birds often take refuge in hollies, which provide shelter, protection from predators (by the spiny leaves), and food. The flowers are sometimes eaten by the larva of the double-striped pug moth (Gymnoscelis rufifasciata). Other Lepidoptera whose larvae feed on holly include Bucculatrix ilecella, which feeds exclusively on hollies, and the engrailed (Ectropis crepuscularia).\\r\\nHolly can contain caffeic acid, caffeoyl derivatives, caffeoylshikimic acid, chlorogenic acid, feruloylquinic acid, quercetin, quinic acid, kaempferol, tannins, rutin, caffeine, and theobromine.[23][24]\\r\\nHolly berries can cause vomiting and diarrhoea. They are especially dangerous in cases involving accidental consumption by children attracted to the bright red berries.[25] Ingestion of over 20 berries may be fatal to children.[24][25]\\r\\nHolly leaves, if eaten, might cause diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, and stomach and intestinal problems.[25]\\r\\nHolly plants might be toxic to pets and livestock.[26]\\r\\nLeaves of some holly species are used by some cultures to make daily tea. These species are Yerba mate (I. paraguariensis), Ilex guayusa, Kuding (Ilex kaushue), Yaupon (I. vomitoria) and others. Leaves of other species, such as gallberry (I. glabra) are bitter and emetic.[27] In general little is known about inter-species variation in constituents or toxicity of hollies.\\r\\nMany of the holly species are widely used as ornamental plants in temperate/European gardens and parks, notably:\\r\\nMoreover, many hundreds of hybrids and cultivars have been developed for garden use, among them the very popular \\"Highclere holly\\", Ilex G altaclerensis (I. aquifolium G I. perado) and the \\"blue holly\\", Ilex G meserveae (I. aquifolium G I. rugosa).[29] The cultivar I. G meserveae Blue Prince = Conablu has gained the Royal Horticultural Societys Award of Garden Merit.[30][31] Hollies are often used for hedges; the spiny leaves make them difficult to penetrate, and they take well to pruning and shaping.[32]\\r\\nHolly ÿ more specifically the European holly, Ilex aquifolium ÿ is commonly referenced at Christmas time, and is often referred to by the name Christ's thorn.[33][34] In many Western Christian cultures, holly is a traditional Christmas decoration,[35] used especially in wreaths and illustrations, for instance on Christmas cards. Since medieval times the plant has carried a Christian symbolism,[36] as expressed in the well-known Christian Christmas carol \\"The Holly and the Ivy\\", in which the holly represents Jesus and the ivy represents the Virgin Mary.[34] Angie Mostellar discusses the Christian use of holly at Christmas, stating that:[34]\\r\\nChristians have identified a wealth of symbolism in its form. The sharpness of the leaves help to recall the crown of thorns worn by Jesus; the red berries serve as a reminder of the drops of blood that were shed for salvation; and the shape of the leaves, which resemble flames, can serve to reveal God's burning love for His people. Combined with the fact that holly maintains its bright colors during the Christmas season, it naturally came to be associated with the Christian holiday.[34]\\r\\nIn heraldry, holly is used to symbolize truth. The Norwegian municipality of Stord has a yellow twig of holly in its Coat-of-arms.\\r\\nThe Druids held that \\"leaves of holly offered protection against evil spirits\\" and thus \\"wore holly in their hair\\".[34]\\r\\nIn the Harry Potter novels, holly is used as the wood in Harry's wand.\\r\\nIn some Traditions of Wicca, the Holly King is one of the faces of the Sun God. He is born at Midsummer and rules from Mabon to Ostara.[citation needed]\\r\\nIlex anomala\\r\\nA contorted hedgehog holly Ilex aquifolium 'Ferox'\\r\\nIlex chinensis\\r\\nIlex pedunculosa\\r\\nIlex rotunda\\r\\nIlex yunnanensis\\r\\nIlex G meserveae\\r\\nIlex pernyi from west China.","input":"How many types of holly bushes are there?"},{"output":"Fenway Park in Boston","context":"The following is a list of Major League Baseball stadiums, their locations, their first year of usage and home teams.\\r\\nThe newest Major League Baseball (MLB) ballpark is SunTrust Park in Cumberland, Georgia, home of the Atlanta Braves, which opened for the 2017 season.

The shop stocked hosiery, misses' wear, and cashmere shawls.[3] His cousin, George Washington Taylor, joined in 1834, and the store was named Lord Taylor. Sames S. Taylor, Lord's brother-in-law, replaced George Taylor in 1845. The store moved to Grand Street and Chrystie Street in 1854.[4]\\r\\nIn 1860, they opened a second store on Broadway at Grand Street, keeping the older store open.[3][4] Lord retired in 1862. In 1870 the Broadway store moved a mile uptown, to a new cast-iron building at Broadway and 20th Street, in the area known as the \\"Ladies' Mile\\".[3] The new store was expanded around 1890 by annexing a building to east.[5] The downtown store continued to function, expanded through to Forsyth St, and advertised until at least 1887 as a new building. The Grand Street store was sold by Samuel Lord's estate in 1901.[6][7][8][9][10][11]\\r\\nThe Starrett & van Vleck-designed Fifth Avenue store and headquarters opened between 38th and 39th streets on February 24, 1914.[12][13] The Broadway store was quickly sold, on March 26.[14] The Fifth Avenue store became a New York City Landmark on October 30, 2007.[15]\\r\\nA founding unit of Associated Dry Goods, Lord & Taylor was considered to be their \\"crown jewel\\". When the May Company acquired ADG in 1986, it was assumed that May bought them just for their luxury division.[citation needed] Today Lord & Taylor has grown to 50 locations across the United States, each store has a distinctive contrast of classical and contemporary elements and are designed one of a kind. In March 2017,Lord & Taylor partnered with Brideside to launch in-store bridal shop. [16][17]\\r\\nIn 1945, Dorothy Shaver became the first woman to head a major retail establishment in the United States as president of Lord & Taylor.[18] As vice president working with the well-known design firm of Raymond Loewy Associates, she opened what is credited as the first ever branch store, in Manhasset, New York. Unlike earlier forays into the suburbs that consisted of smaller boutique-style shops, this was a merchandising effort that became the model for modern suburban shopping. The store consisted of 66 individual shops. Lord & Taylor's relationship with Raymond Loewy Associates continued until 1969, following the construction of the Stamford, Connecticut, store (designed by Loewy Vice President Andrew Geller).\\r\\nMany of Lord & Taylor's special services, including personal shoppers, were introduced while Shaver presided. During this period she introduced the Andrew Geller hand written logo and the American Beauty Rose as icons of the store.[citation needed] Shaver died in 1959.[18]\\r\\nWilliam J. Lippincott was elected chairman and chief executive in 1972. His obituary in The New York Times read: \\"In his years as president and chairman, Lord & Taylor moved beyond its traditional territory in the northeast to open stores in Atlanta, Houston and Dallas and four stores in Illinois.\\"[19] A management shakeup ousted him in 1976.\\r\\nUnder the leadership of CEO Joseph E. Brooks during the 1970s, the company aggressively expanded into Texas, Illinois and Michigan; in the early 1980s, South Florida saw 11 stores opened in quick succession. The chain partially withdrew from the oil-shocked Texas and southern Florida markets in 1989ÿ1990 after its 1986 acquisition by May. Under May, the majority of the upscale Hahne & Co., Wanamaker's, and Woodward & Lothrop chains were converted to Lord & Taylor.\\r\\nStarting in June 2000, Jane Elfers served as Lord & Taylor's second female president. She was replaced in October 2008 by former Neiman Marcus executive, Brendan Hoffman. According to HBC executive chairman, Richard Baker, her contract had expired.[20] A third female president, Bonnie Brooks, took over in 2011, and a fourth female president, Liz Rodbell, took over in 2013.\\r\\nOwner May Department Stores was acquired by Federated Department Stores, now Macy's Inc, on August 30, 2005. On January 12, 2006, Federated chairman, president, and CEO Terry Lundgren announced that Lord & Taylor would be sold by the end of the year. In a move that took advantage of valuable real estate, Federated announced on March 10, 2006 that seven conflicting Lord & Taylor locations would either close or downscale into Macy's. (Christiana Mall, Delaware; Water Tower Place, Illinois; Northshore Mall, Massachusetts; Fairlane Town Center, Michigan; West County Center and St. Louis Galleria, Missouri; and Center City, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.)[21] The legendary Center City, Philadelphia store, former flagship of the John Wanamaker chain, opened after a one-month renovation as Macy's City Center on August 1, 2006. On June 22, 2006, it was announced that NRDC Equity Partners, LLC would purchase Lord & Taylor for $1.2 billion after Federated converted and closed the seven locations that they had previously announced,[22] the sale was completed in October 2006. Federated continued to service Lord & Taylor consumer credit accounts in an agreement with NRDC under the terms of its sale until mid-2007.\\r\\nIn addition to continuing the campaign announced by May in 2003, NRDC committed to spend an additional $250 million upgrading stores. Lord & Taylor reported a jump in sales after most of May's stores took on the Macy's and Bloomingdale's nameplates in 2006. The Fifth Avenue flagship store received a $150 million update in 2010.[23]In April 2017, Lord & Taylor completed a $12 million renovation plan at the Fifth Avenue store.[24]\\r\\nOn July 16, 2008, NRDC Equity Partners announced that it had purchased the 338-year-old commercial corporation The Hudson's Bay Company for an undisclosed price, with the intention of expanding internationally. HBC operates nearly 600 stores under four banners from coast to coast. The Hudson's Bay store in Toronto is the largest store in Canada at nearly 1,000,000 square feet (93,000?m2) making it also one of the largest stores in the world. The combined company today consists of Hudson's Bay and Home Outfitters in Canada, Galeria Kaufhof in Germany, and luxury banners Lord & Taylor and Saks Fifth Avenue in the United States.\\r\\nWomen's Wear Daily reported in September 2010 that sources within the company were searching for additional space in Westchester County. The Scarsdale location is a moderately high performer but does not allow space for significant expansion.[25] In December 2010, Lord & Taylor announced it would open a second \\"destination\\" store in Westchester County at Westchester's Ridge Hill. The Ridge Hill store was designed by architect Giorgio Borruso. It opened on April 13, 2012, bringing the total number of full-line locations to 48.[26] Another store was announced for the Boston Metropolitan area, to be located at the Mall at Rockingham Park. That location opened in March 2012 and brought the total number of full-line locations to 47. In October 2011 a store was announced for Mizner Park in Boca Raton, Florida.[27] The store opened in the fall of 2013 and brought the total number of full-line locations to 49. In August 2013, a new store for New York's Capital District was announced to be located at Crossgates Mall. The store opened in September 2014 and is the 50th full-line location.

These sins are often thought to be abuses or excessive versions of one's natural faculties or passions (for example, gluttony abuses one's desire to eat).\\r\\n\\r\\nThis classification originated with the desert fathers, especially Evagrius Ponticus, who identified seven or eight evil thoughts or spirits that one needed to overcome.[3]  Evagrius' pupil John Cassian, with his book The Institutes, brought the classification to Europe,[4]  where it became fundamental to Catholic confessional practices as evident in penitential manuals, sermons like \\"The Parson's Tale\\" from Chaucer's Canterbury Tales, and artworks like Dante's Purgatory (where the penitents of Mount Purgatory are depicted as being grouped and penanced according to the worst capital sin they committed). The Catholic Church used the concept of the deadly sins in order to help people curb their inclination towards evil before dire consequences and misdeeds could occur; the leader-teachers especially focused on pride (which is thought to be the sin that severs the soul from Grace,[5] and the one that is representative and the very essence of all evil) and greed, both of which are seen as inherently sinful and as underlying all other sins to be prevented. To inspire people to focus on the seven deadly sins, the vices are discussed in treatises and depicted in paintings and sculpture decorations on Catholic churches as well as older textbooks.[1]\\r\\n\\r\\nWhile the seven deadly sins as we know them did not originate with the Greeks or Romans, there were ancient precedents for them. Aristotle's Nicomachean Ethics lists several positive, healthy human qualities, excellences, or virtues. Aristotle argues that for each positive quality there are two negative vices that are found on each extreme of the virtue. Courage, for example, is the human excellence or virtue in facing fear and risk. Excessive courage makes one rash, while a deficiency of courage makes one cowardly. This principle of virtue found in the middle or \\"mean\\" between excess and deficiency is Aristotle's notion of the golden mean. Aristotle lists virtues like courage, temperance or self-control, generosity, \\"greatness of soul,\\" proper response to anger, friendliness, and wit or charm.\\r\\n\\r\\nRoman writers like Horace extolled the value of virtue while listing and warning against vices. His first epistles says that \\"to flee vice is the beginning of virtue, and to have got rid of folly is the beginning of wisdom.\\"[6]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe modern concept of the seven deadly sins is linked to the works of the fourth-century monk Evagrius Ponticus, who listed eight evil thoughts in Greek as follows:[7][8]\\r\\n\\r\\nThey were translated into the Latin of Western Christianity (largely due to the writings of John Cassian),[10][11] thus becoming part of the Western tradition's spiritual pietas (or Catholic devotions), as follows:[12]\\r\\n\\r\\nThese \\"evil thoughts\\" can be categorized into three types:[12]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn AD 590 Pope Gregory I revised this list to form the more common list. Gregory combined tristitia with acedia, and vanagloria with superbia, and added envy, in Latin, invidia.[13][14] Gregory's list became the standard list of sins. Thomas Aquinas uses and defends Gregory's list in his Summa Theologica although he calls them the \\"capital sins\\" because they are the head and form of all the others.[15] The Anglican Communion,[16] Lutheran Church,[17] and Methodist Church,[18][19] among other Christian denominations, continue to retain this list. Moreover, modern day evangelists, such as Billy Graham have explicated the seven deadly sins.[20]\\r\\n\\r\\nMost of the capital sins, with the sole exception of sloth, are defined by Dante Alighieri as perverse or corrupt versions of love for something or another: lust, gluttony, and greed are all excessive or disordered love of good things; sloth is a deficiency of love; wrath, envy, and pride are perverted love directed toward other's harm.[21] In the seven capital sins are seven ways of eternal death.[5] The capital sins from lust to envy are generally associated with pride, which has been labeled as the father of all sins, etc.\\r\\n\\r\\nLust, or lechery (Latin, \\"luxuria\\"  (carnal)), is intense longing. It is usually thought of as intense or unbridled sexual desire,[22] which leads to fornication, adultery, rape, bestiality, un-natural sexual practices and other immoral sexual acts. However, lust could also mean simply desire in general; thus, lust for money, power, and other things are sinful. In accordance with the words of Henry Edward Manning, the impurity of lust transforms one into \\"a slave of the devil\\".[5]\\r\\n\\r\\nLust, if not managed properly, can subvert propriety.[23]\\r\\n\\r\\nGerman philosopher Schopenhauer wrote as follows:[23]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\"Lust is the ultimate goal of almost all human endeavour, exerts an adverse influence on the most important affairs, interrupts the most serious business, sometimes for a while confuses even the greatest minds, does not hesitate with its trumpery to disrupt the negotiations of statesmen and the research of scholars, has the knack of slipping its love-letters and ringlets even into ministerial portfolios and philosophical manuscripts\\".\\r\\n\\r\\nDante defined lust as the disordered love for individuals, thus possessing at least the redeeming feature of mutuality, unlike the graver sins, which constitute an increasingly  agonised focusing upon the solitary self (a process begun with the more serious sin of gluttony).[24] It is generally thought to be the least serious capital sin[21][25] as it is an abuse of a faculty that humans share with animals, and sins of the flesh are less grievous than spiritual sins (love excessive, not love turning ever further awry toward hatred of man and God). [26]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn Dante's Purgatorio, the penitents walk deliberately through the purifying flames of the uppermost of the terraces of Mount Purgatory so as to purge themselves of lustful thoughts and feelings and finally win the right to reach the Earthly Paradise at the summit. In Dante's Inferno, unforgiven souls guilty of the sin of lust are whirled around for all eternity in a perpetual tempest, symbolic of the passions by which, through lack of self-control, they were buffeted helplessly about in their earthly lives.\\r\\n\\r\\nGluttony (Latin, gula) is the overindulgence and overconsumption of anything to the point of waste.  The word derives from the Latin gluttire, meaning to gulp down or swallow.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn Christianity, it is considered a sin if the excessive desire for food causes it to be withheld from the needy.[27]\\r\\n\\r\\nBecause of these scripts, gluttony can be interpreted as selfishness; essentially placing concern with one's own impulses or interests above the well-being or interests of others.[original research?]\\r\\n\\r\\nDuring times of famine, war, and similar periods when food is scarce, it is possible for one to indirectly kill other people through starvation just by eating too much or even too soon.\\r\\n\\r\\nMedieval church leaders (e.g., Thomas Aquinas) took a more expansive view of gluttony,[27] arguing that it could also include an obsessive anticipation of meals, and the constant eating of delicacies and excessively costly foods.[28] Aquinas went so far as to prepare a list of five ways to commit gluttony, comprising:\\r\\n\\r\\nOf these, ardenter is often considered the most serious, since it is extreme attachment to the pleasure of mere eating, which can make the committer eat impulsively; absolutely and without qualification live merely to eat and drink; lose attachment to health-related, social, intellectual, and spiritual pleasures; and lose proper judgement[original research?]: an example is Esau selling his birthright for ordinary food of bread and pottage of lentils. His punishment was that of the \\"profane person . . . who, for a morsel of meat sold his birthright.\\" We learn that \\"he found no place for repentance, though he sought it carefully, with tears.\\" [Gen 25:30]\\r\\n\\r\\nGreed (Latin, avaritia), also known as avarice, cupidity, or covetousness, is, like lust and gluttony, a sin of desire. However, greed (as seen by the Church) is applied to an artificial, rapacious desire and pursuit of material possessions. Thomas Aquinas wrote, \\"Greed is a sin against God, just as all mortal sins, in as much as man condemns things eternal for the sake of temporal things.\\" In Dante's Purgatory, the penitents were bound and laid face down on the ground for having concentrated excessively on earthly thoughts[citation needed]. Hoarding of materials or objects, theft and robbery, especially by means of violence, trickery, or manipulation of authority are all actions that may be inspired by Greed. Such misdeeds can include simony, where one attempts to purchase or sell sacraments, including Holy Orders and, therefore, positions of authority in the Church hierarchy.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the words of Henry Edward, avarice \\"plunges a man deep into the mire of this world, so that he makes it to be his god.\\"[5]\\r\\n\\r\\nAs defined outside Christian writings, greed is an inordinate desire to acquire or possess more than one needs, especially with respect to material wealth.[29] Like pride, it can lead to not just some, but all evil.[2]\\r\\n\\r\\nSloth (Latin, tristitia or acedia (\\"without care\\")) refers to a peculiar jumble of notions, dating from antiquity and including mental, spiritual, pathological, and physical states.[30] It may be defined as absence of interest or habitual disinclination to exertion.[31]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn his Summa Theologica, Saint Thomas Aquinas defined sloth as \\"sorrow about spiritual good\\".[2]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe scope of sloth is wide.[30] Spiritually, acedia first referred to an affliction attending religious persons, especially monks, wherein they became indifferent to their duties and obligations to God. Mentally, acedia has a number of distinctive components of which the most important is affectlessness, a lack of any feeling about self or other, a mind-state that gives rise to boredom, rancor, apathy, and a passive inert or sluggish mentation. Physically, acedia is fundamentally associated with a cessation of motion and an indifference to work; it finds expression in laziness, idleness, and indolence.[30]\\r\\n\\r\\nSloth includes ceasing to utilize the seven gifts of grace given by the Holy Spirit (Wisdom, Understanding, Counsel, Knowledge, Piety, Fortitude, and Fear of the Lord);  such disregard may lead to the slowing of one's spiritual progress towards eternal life, to the neglect of manifold duties of charity towards the neighbor, and to animosity towards those who love God.[5]\\r\\n\\r\\nSloth has also been defined as a failure to do things that one should do.  By this definition, evil exists when \\"good\\" people fail to act.\\r\\n\\r\\nEdmund Burke (1729ÿ1797) wrote in Present Discontents (II. 78) \\"No man, who is not inflamed by vain-glory into enthusiasm, can flatter himself that his single, unsupported, desultory, unsystematic endeavours are of power to defeat the subtle designs and united Cabals of ambitious citizens. When bad men combine, the good must associate; else they will fall, one by one, an unpitied sacrifice in a contemptible struggle.\\"\\r\\n\\r\\nUnlike the other capital sins, which are sins of committing immorality, sloth is a sin of omitting responsibilities. It may arise from any of the other capital vices; for example, a son may omit his duty to his father through anger. While the state and habit of sloth is a mortal sin, the habit of the soul tending towards the last mortal state of sloth is not mortal in and of itself except under certain circumstances.[5]\\r\\n\\r\\nEmotionally and cognitively, the evil of acedia finds expression in a lack of any feeling for the world, for the people in it, or for the self. Acedia takes form as an alienation of the sentient self first from the world and then from itself. Although the most profound versions of this condition are found in a withdrawal from all forms of participation in or care for others or oneself, a lesser but more noisome element was also noted by theologians. From tristitia, asserted Gregory the Great, \\"there arise malice, rancour, cowardice, [and] despair...\\" Chaucer, too, dealt with this attribute of acedia, counting the characteristics of the sin to include despair, somnolence, idleness, tardiness, negligence, indolence, and wrawnesse, the last variously translated as \\"anger\\" or better as \\"peevishness\\". For Chaucer, human's sin consists of languishing and holding back, refusing to undertake works of goodness because, he/she tells him/her self, the circumstances surrounding the establishment of good are too grievous and too difficult to suffer. Acedia  in Chaucer's view is thus the enemy of every source and motive for work.[32]\\r\\n\\r\\nSloth not only subverts the livelihood of the body, taking no care for its day-to-day provisions, but also slows down the mind, halting its attention to matters of great importance. Sloth hinders the man in his righteous undertakings and thus becomes a terrible source of human's undoing.[32]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn his Purgatorio Dante portrayed the penance for acedia as running continuously at top speed.\\r\\n\\r\\nDante describes acedia as the failure to love God with all one's heart, all one's mind and all one's soul; to him it was the middle sin, the only one characterised by an absence or insufficiency of love. Some scholars[who?] have said that the ultimate form of acedia was despair which leads to suicide.\\r\\n\\r\\nWrath (Latin, ira) can be defined as uncontrolled feelings of anger, rage, and even hatred. Wrath often reveals itself in the wish to seek vengeance.[33] In its purest form, wrath presents with injury, violence, and hate that may provoke feuds that can go on for centuries. Wrath may persist long after the person who did another a grievous wrong is dead. Feelings of wrath can manifest in different ways, including impatience, hateful misanthropy, revenge, and self-destructive behavior, such as drug abuse or suicide.[original research?]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\"People who fly into a rage always make a bad landing.\\"\\r\\nAccording to the Catechism of the Catholic Church, the neutral act of anger becomes the sin of wrath when it's directed against an innocent person, when it's unduly strong or long-lasting, or when it desires excessive punishment. \\"If anger reaches the point of a deliberate desire to kill or seriously wound a neighbor, it is gravely against charity; it is a mortal sin.\\" (CCC 2302) Hatred is the sin of desiring that someone else may suffer misfortune or evil, and is a mortal sin when one desires grave harm. (CCC 2302-03)\\r\\n\\r\\nPeople feel angry when they sense that they or someone they care about has been offended, when they are certain about the nature and cause of the angering event, when they are certain someone else is responsible, and when they feel they can still influence the situation or cope with it.[34]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn her introduction to Purgatory, Dorothy L. Sayers describes wrath as \\"love of justice perverted to revenge and spite\\".[33]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn accordance with Henry Edward, angry people are \\"slaves to themselves\\".[5]\\r\\n\\r\\nEnvy (Latin, invidia), like greed and lust, is characterized by an insatiable desire. It can be described as a sad or resentful covetousness towards the traits or possessions of someone else. It arises from vainglory,[35] and severs a man from his neighbor.[5]\\r\\n\\r\\nMalicious envy is similar to jealousy in that they both feel discontent towards someone's traits, status, abilities, or rewards. A difference is that the envious also desire the entity and covet it. Envy can be directly related to the Ten Commandments, specifically, \\"Neither shall you covet... anything that belongs to your neighbour\\" - a statement that may also be related to greed. Dante defined envy as \\"a desire to deprive other men of theirs\\". In Dante's Purgatory, the punishment for the envious is to have their eyes sewn shut with wire because they gained sinful pleasure from seeing others brought low. According to St. Thomas Aquinas, the struggle aroused by envy has three stages: during the first stage, the envious person attempts to lower another's reputation; in the middle stage, the envious person receives either \\"joy at another's misfortune\\" (if he succeeds in defaming the other person) or \\"grief at another's prosperity\\" (if he fails); the third stage is hatred because \\"sorrow causes hatred\\" .[36]\\r\\n\\r\\nEnvy is said to be the motivation behind Cain murdering his brother, Abel, as Cain envied Abel because God favored Abel's sacrifice over Cain's.\\r\\n\\r\\nBertrand Russell said that envy was one of the most potent causes of unhappiness,[37][page?needed] bringing sorrow to committers of envy whilst giving them the urge to inflict pain upon others.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nIn accordance with the most widely accepted views, only pride weighs down the soul more than envy among the capital sins. Just like pride, envy has been associated directly with the devil, for Wisdom 2:24 states:\\" the envy of the devil brought death to the world,\\".[35]\\r\\nPride (Latin, superbia) is considered, on almost every list, the original and most serious of the seven deadly sins: the perversion of the faculties that make humans more like Goddignity and holiness. It is also thought to be the source of the other capital sins. Also known as hubris (from ancient Greek ??), or futility, it is identified as dangerously corrupt selfishness, the putting of one's own desires, urges, wants, and whims before the welfare of people.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn even more destructive cases, it is irrationally believing that one is essentially and necessarily better, superior, or more important than others, failing to acknowledge the accomplishments of others, and excessive admiration of the personal image or self (especially forgetting one's own lack of divinity, and refusing to acknowledge one's own limits, faults, or wrongs as a human being).\\r\\n\\r\\nWhat the weak head with strongest bias rules, Is pride, the never-failing vice of fools.\\r\\nAs pride has been labelled the father of all sins, it has been deemed the devil's most prominent trait. C.S. Lewis writes, in Mere Christianity, that pride is the \\"anti-God\\" state, the position in which the ego and the self are directly opposed to God: \\"Unchastity, anger, greed, drunkenness, and all that, are mere fleabites in comparison: it was through Pride that the devil became the devil: Pride leads to every other vice: it is the complete anti-God state of mind.\\"[38] Pride is understood to sever the spirit from God, as well as His life-and-grace-giving Presence.[5]\\r\\n\\r\\nOne can be prideful for different reasons. Author Ichabod Spencer states that \\"[s]piritual pride is the worst kind of pride, if not worst snare of the devil. The heart is particularly deceitful on this one thing.\\"[39] Jonathan Edwards said \\"[r]emember that pride is the worst viper that is in the heart, the greatest disturber of the soul's peace and sweet communion with Christ; it was the first sin that ever was, and lies lowest in the foundation of Satan's whole building, and is the most difficultly rooted out, and is the most hidden, secret and deceitful of all lusts, and often creeps in, insensibly, into the midst of religion and sometimes under the disguise of humility.\\"[40]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn Ancient Athens, hubris was considered one of the greatest crimes and was used to refer to insolent contempt that can cause one to use violence to shame the victim. This sense of hubris could also characterize rape.[41] Aristotle defined hubris as shaming the victim, not because of anything that happened to the committer or might happen to the committer, but merely for the committer's own gratification.[42][43][44] The word's connotation changed somewhat over time, with some additional emphasis towards a gross over-estimation of one's abilities.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe term has been used to analyse and make sense of the actions of contemporary heads of government by Ian Kershaw (1998), Peter Beinart (2010) and in a much more physiological manner by David Owen (2012). In this context the term has been used to describe how certain leaders, when put to positions of immense power, seem to become irrationally self-confident in their own abilities, increasingly reluctant to listen to the advice of others and progressively more impulsive in their actions.[45]\\r\\n\\r\\nDante's definition of pride was \\"love of self perverted to hatred and contempt for one's neighbour\\".\\r\\n\\r\\nPride is associated with more intra-individual negative outcomes and is commonly related to expressions of aggression and hostility (Tangney, 1999).\\r\\nAs one might expect, pride is not always associated with high self-esteem but with highly fluctuating or variable self-esteem. Excessive feelings of pride have a tendency to create conflict and sometimes terminating close relationships, which has led it to be understood as one of the few emotions with no clear positive or adaptive functions (Rhodwalt, et al.).[citation needed]\\r\\n\\r\\nPride is generally associated with an absence of humility[46].[47][citation needed] It may also be associated with a lack of knowledge. John Gay states that \\"By ignorance is pride increased; They most assume who know the least.\\"[39]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn accordance with the Sirach's author's wording, the heart of a proud man is \\"like a partridge in its cage acting as a decoy; like a spy he watches for your weaknesses. He changes good things into evil, he lays his traps. Just as a spark sets coals on fire, the wicked man prepares his snares in order to draw blood. Beware of the wicked man for he is planning evil. He might dishonor you forever.\\" In another chapter, he says that \\"the acquisitive man is not content with what he has, wicked injustice shrivels the heart.\\"\\r\\n\\r\\nBenjamin Franklin said \\"In reality there is, perhaps no one of our natural passions so hard to subdue as pride. Disguise it, struggle with it, stifle it, mortify it as much as one pleases, it is still alive and will every now and then peep out and show itself; you will see it, perhaps, often in this history. For even if I could conceive that I had completely overcome it, I should probably be proud of my humility.\\"[48] Joseph Addison states that \\"There is no passion that steals into the heart more imperceptibly and covers itself under more disguises than pride.\\"[49]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe proverb \\"pride goeth (goes) before destruction, a haughty spirit before a fall\\" (from the biblical Book of Proverbs, 16:18)(or pride goeth before the fall) is thought to sum up the modern use of pride. Pride is also referred to as \\"pride that blinds,\\" as it often causes a committer of pride to act in foolish ways that belie common sense.[45] In other words, the modern definition may be thought of as, \\"that pride that goes just before the fall.\\" In his two-volume biography of Adolf Hitler, historian Ian Kershaw uses both 'hubris' and 'nemesis' as titles. The first volume, Hubris,[50] describes Hitler's early life and rise to political power. The second, Nemesis,[51] gives details of Hitler's role in the Second World War, and concludes with his fall and suicide in 1945.\\r\\n\\r\\nMuch of the 10th and part of 11th chapter of the Book of Sirach discusses and advises about pride, hubris, and who is rationally worthy of honor. It goes:\\r\\n\\r\\n\\"Do not store up resentment against your neighbor, no matter what his offence; do nothing in a fit of anger. Pride is odious to both God and man; injustice is abhorrent to both of them. Sovereignty is forced from one nation to another because of injustice, violence, and wealth. How can there be such pride in someone who is nothing but dust and ashes? Even while he is living, man's bowels are full of rottenness. Look: the illness lasts while the doctor makes light of it; and one who is king today will die tomorrow. Once a man is dead, grubs, insects, and worms are his lot.The beginning of man's pride is to separate himself from the Lord and to rebel against his Creator. The beginning of pride is sin. Whoever perseveres in sinning opens the floodgates to everything that is evil.  For this the Lord has inflicted dire punishment on sinners; he has reduced them to nothing. The Lord has overturned the thrones of princes and set up the meek in their place. The Lord has torn up the proud by their roots and has planted the humble in their place. The Lord has overturned the land of pagans and totally destroyed them. He has devastated several of them, destroyed them and removed all remembrance of them from the face of the earth. Pride was not created for man, nor violent anger for those born of woman. Which race is worthy of honor? The human race. Which race is worthy of honor? Those who are good. Which race is despicable? The human race. Which race is despicable? Those who break the commandments. The leader is worthy of respect in the midst of his brethren, but he has respect for those who are good. Whether, they be rich, honored or poor, their pride should be in being good. It is not right to despise the poor man who keeps the law; it is not fitting to honor the sinful man. The leader, the judge, and the powerful man are worthy of honor, but no one is greater than the man who is good. A prudent slave will have free men as servants, and the sensible man will not complain. Do not feel proud when you accomplished your work; do not put on airs when times are difficult for you. Of greater worth is the man who works and lives in abundance than the one who shows off and yet has nothing to live on. My son, have a modest appreciation of yourself, estimate yourself at your true value. Who will defend the man who takes his own life? Who will respect the man who despises himself? The poor man will be honored for his wisdom and the rich man, for his riches. Honored when poor-how much more honored when rich! Dishonored when rich-how much more dishonored when poor! The poor man who is intelligent carries his head high and sits among the great. Do not praise a man because he is handsome and do not hold a man in contempt because of his appearance. The bee is one of the smallest winged insects but she excels in the exquisite sweetness of her honey. Do not be irrationally proud just because of the clothes you wear; do not be proud when people honor you.  Do you know what the Lord is planning in a mysterious way? Many tyrants have been overthrown and someone unknown has received the crown. Many powerful men have been disgraced and famous men handed over to the power of others. Do not reprehend anyone unless you have been first fully informed, consider the case first and thereafter make your reproach. Do not reply before you have listened; do not meddle in the disputes of sinners. My child, do not undertake too many activities. If you keep adding to them, you will not be without reproach; if you run after them, you will not succeed nor will you ever be free, although you try to escape.\\"\\r\\nJacob Bidermann's medieval miracle play, Cenodoxus, pride is the deadliest of all the sins and leads directly to the damnation of the titulary famed Parisian doctor. In Dante's Divine Comedy, the penitents are burdened with stone slabs on their necks to keep their heads bowed.\\r\\n\\r\\nAcedia (Latin, acedia \\"without care\\"[30]) (from Greek ?ٻѴ?ϫ) is the neglect to take care of something that one should do. It is translated to apathetic listlessness; depression without joy. It is related to melancholy: acedia describes the behaviour and melancholy suggests the emotion producing it. In early Christian thought, the lack of joy was regarded as a willful refusal to enjoy the goodness of God; by contrast, apathy was considered a refusal to help others in time of need.\\r\\n\\r\\nAcdia is negative form of the Greek term ٻѴ?ϫ, which has a more restricted usage. 'Kdeia' refers specifically to spousal love and respect for the dead.[52] The positive term 'kdeia' thus indicates love for one's family, even through death. It also indicates love for those outside one's immediate family, specifically forming a new family with one's \\"beloved.\\" Seen in this way, 'acdia' indicates a rejection of familial love. Nonetheless, the meaning of 'acdia' is far more broad, signifying indifference to everything one experiences.\\r\\n\\r\\nPope Gregory combined this with tristitia into sloth for his list. When Thomas Aquinas described acedia in his interpretation of the list, he described it as an uneasiness of the mind, being a progenitor for lesser sins such as restlessness and instability. Dante refined this definition further, describing acedia as the failure to love God with all one's heart, all one's mind and all one's soul; to him it was the middle sin, the only one characterised by an absence or insufficiency of love. Some scholars[who?] have said that the ultimate form of acedia was despair which leads to suicide.\\r\\n\\r\\nAcedia is currently defined in the Catechism of the Catholic Church as spiritual sloth, which would be believing spiritual tasks to be too difficult. In the fourth century, Christian monks believed acedia was not primarily caused by laziness, but by a state of depression that caused spiritual detachment.[53]\\r\\n\\r\\nVainglory (Latin, vanagloria) is unjustified boasting. Pope Gregory viewed it as a form of pride, so he folded vainglory into pride for his listing of sins.[13] According to Thomas Aquinas, it is the progenitor of envy.[35]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Latin term gloria roughly means boasting, although its English cognate ÿ glory ÿ has come to have an exclusively positive meaning; historically, the term vain roughly meant futile (a meaning retained in the modern expression \\"in vain\\"), but by the 14th century had come to have the strong narcissistic undertones, that it still retains today.[54] As a result of these semantic changes, vainglory has become a rarely used word in itself, and is now commonly interpreted as referring to vanity (in its modern narcissistic sense).[citation needed]\\r\\nWith Christianity, historic Christian denominations such as the Catholic Church and Protestant Churches,[55] including the Lutheran Church,[56] recognize seven virtues, which correspond inversely to each of the seven deadly sins. \\r\\n\\r\\nConfession is the act of admitting the commission of a sin to a priest, who in turn will forgive the person in the name (in the person) of Christ, give a penance to (partially) make up for the offense, and advise the person on what he or she should do afterwards.\\r\\n\\r\\nAccording to a 2009 study by Fr Roberto Busa, a Jesuit scholar[who?], the most common deadly sin confessed by men is supposedly lust, and by women, pride.[57] It was unclear whether these differences were due to the actual number of transgressions committed by each sex,  or whether differing views on what \\"counts\\" or should be confessed caused the observed pattern.[58]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe second book of Dante's epic poem The Divine Comedy is structured around the seven deadly sins. The most serious sins, found at the lowest level, are the abuses of the most divine faculty. For Dante and other thinkers, a human's rational faculty makes humans more like God. Abusing that faculty with pride or envy weighs down the soul the most. Abusing one's passions with wrath or a lack of passion as with sloth also weighs down the soul but not as much as the abuse of one's rational faculty. Finally, abusing one's desires to have one's physical needs met via greed, gluttony, or lust abuses a faculty that humans share with animals. This is still an abuse that weighs down the soul, but it does not weigh it down like other abuses. Thus, the top levels of the Mountain of Purgatory have the top listed sins, while the lowest levels have the more serious sins of wrath, envy, and pride.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe last tale of the Canterbury Tales, the \\"Parson's Tale\\" is not a tale but a sermon that the parson gives against the seven deadly sins. This sermon brings together many common ideas and images about the seven deadly sins. This tale and Dante's work both show how the seven deadly sins were used for confessional purposes or as a way to identify, repent of, and find forgiveness for one's sins.[62][63]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Dutch artist created a series of prints showing each of the seven deadly sins. Each print features a central, labeled image that represents the sin. Around the figure are images that show the distortions, degenerations, and destructions caused by the sin.[64] Many of these images come from contemporary Dutch aphorisms.[65]\\r\\n\\r\\nSpenser's work, which was meant to educate young people to embrace virtue and avoid vice, includes a colourful depiction of the House of Pride. Lucifera, the lady of the house, is accompanied by advisers who represent the other seven deadly sins.[citation needed]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe seven sins are personified and they give a confession to the personification of Repentance. Only pride is represented by a woman, the others all represented by male characters.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis work satirized capitalism and its painful abuses as its central character, the victim of a split personality, travels to seven different cities in search of money for her family. In each city she encounters one of the seven deadly sins, but those sins ironically reverse one's expectations. When the character goes to Los Angeles, for example, she is outraged by injustice, but is told that wrath against capitalism is a sin that she must avoid.[citation needed]\\r\\n\\r\\nBetween 1945 and 1949, the American painter Paul Cadmus created a series of vivid, powerful, and gruesome paintings of each of the seven deadly sins.[66]\\r\\n\\r\\nFerdinand Mount maintains that liquid currentness, especially through tabloids, has surprisingly given valor to vices, causing society to regress into that of primitive pagans: \\"covetousness has been rebranded as retail therapy, sloth is downtime, lust is exploring your sexuality, anger is opening up your feelings, vanity is looking good because you're worth it and gluttony is the religion of foodies\\".[67]","input":"What is the first of the seven deadly sins?"},{"output":"July 4, 1776","context":"Independence Day, also referred to as the Fourth of July or July Fourth, is a federal holiday in the United States commemorating the adoption of the Declaration of Independence on July 4, 1776. The Continental Congress declared that the thirteen American colonies regarded themselves as a new nation, the United States of America, and were no longer part of the British Empire.[1] The Congress actually voted to declare independence two days earlier, on July 2.[1]\\r\\nIndependence Day is commonly associated with fireworks, parades, barbecues, carnivals, fairs, picnics, concerts, baseball games, family reunions, and political speeches and ceremonies, in addition to various other public and private events celebrating the history, government, and traditions of the United States. Independence Day is the National Day of the United States.[2][3][4]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nDuring the American Revolution, the legal separation of the Thirteen Colonies from Great Britain in 1776 actually occurred on July 2, when the Second Continental Congress voted to approve a resolution of independence that had been proposed in June by Richard Henry Lee of Virginia declaring the United States independent from Great Britain rule.[5][6] After voting for independence, Congress turned its attention to the Declaration of Independence, a statement explaining this decision, which had been prepared by a Committee of Five, with Thomas Jefferson as its principal author. Congress debated and revised the wording of the Declaration, finally approving it two days later on July 4. A day earlier, John Adams had written to his wife Abigail:\\r\\nThe second day of July, 1776, will be the most memorable epoch in the history of America. I am apt to believe that it will be celebrated by succeeding generations as the great anniversary festival. It ought to be commemorated as the day of deliverance, by solemn acts of devotion to God Almighty. It ought to be solemnized with pomp and parade, with shows, games, sports, guns, bells, bonfires, and illuminations, from one end of this continent to the other, from this time forward forever more.[7]\\r\\nAdams's prediction was off by two days. From the outset, Americans celebrated independence on July 4, the date shown on the much-publicized Declaration of Independence, rather than on July 2, the date the resolution of independence was approved in a closed session of Congress.[8]\\r\\nHistorians have long disputed whether members of Congress signed the Declaration of Independence on July 4, even though Thomas Jefferson, John Adams, and Benjamin Franklin all later wrote that they had signed it on that day. Most historians have concluded that the Declaration was signed nearly a month after its adoption, on August 2, 1776, and not on July 4 as is commonly believed.[9][10][11][12][13]\\r\\nCoincidentally, both John Adams and Thomas Jefferson, the only signers of the Declaration of Independence later to serve as Presidents of the United States, died on the same day: July 4, 1826, which was the 50th anniversary of the Declaration. Although not a signer of the Declaration of Independence, James Monroe, another Founding Father who was elected as President, also died on July 4, 1831. He was the third President in a row who died on the anniversary of independence. Calvin Coolidge, the 30th President, was born on July 4, 1872; so far he is the only U.S. President to have been born on Independence Day.\\r\\nIndependence Day is a national holiday marked by patriotic displays. Similar to other summer-themed events, Independence Day celebrations often take place outdoors. Independence Day is a federal holiday, so all non-essential federal institutions (such as the postal service and federal courts) are closed on that day. Many politicians make it a point on this day to appear at a public event to praise the nation's heritage, laws, history, society, and people.\\r\\nFamilies often celebrate Independence Day by hosting or attending a picnic or barbecue; many take advantage of the day off and, in some years, a long weekend to gather with relatives or friends. Decorations (e.g., streamers, balloons, and clothing) are generally colored red, white, and blue, the colors of the American flag. Parades are often held in the morning, before family get-togethers, while fireworks displays occur in the evening after dark at such places as parks, fairgrounds, or town squares.\\r\\nThe night before the Fourth was once the focal point of celebrations, marked by raucous gatherings often incorporating bonfires as their centerpiece. In New England, towns competed to build towering pyramids, assembled from barrels and casks. They were lit at nightfall, to usher in the celebration. The highest were in Salem, Massachusetts (on Gallows Hill, the famous site of the execution of 13 women and 6 men for witchcraft in 1692 during the Salem witch trials), where the tradition of celebratory bonfires had persisted, with pyramids composed of as many as forty tiers of barrels. These made the tallest bonfires ever recorded. The custom flourished in the 19th and 20th centuries, and is still practiced in some New England towns.[19]\\r\\nIndependence Day fireworks are often accompanied by patriotic songs such as the national anthem \\"The Star-Spangled Banner\\", \\"God Bless America\\", \\"America the Beautiful,\\" \\"My Country, 'Tis of Thee,\\" \\"This Land Is Your Land,\\" \\"Stars and Stripes Forever,\\" and, regionally, \\"Yankee Doodle\\" in northeastern states and \\"Dixie\\" in southern states. Some of the lyrics recall images of the Revolutionary War or the War of 1812.\\r\\nFirework shows are held in many states, and many fireworks are sold for personal use or as an alternative to a public show. Safety concerns have led some states to ban fireworks or limit the sizes and types allowed. In addition, local and regional weather conditions may dictate whether the sale or use of fireworks in an area will be allowed. Some local or regional firework sales are limited or prohibited because of dry weather or other specific concerns. On these occasions the public may be prohibited from purchasing or discharging fireworks, but professional displays (such as those at sports events) may still take place, if certain safety precautions have been taken.\\r\\nA salute of one gun for each state in the United States, called a \\"salute to the union,\\" is fired on Independence Day at noon by any capable military base.[20]\\r\\nIn 2009, New York City had the largest fireworks display in the country, with more than 22 tons of pyrotechnics exploded.[21] It generally holds displays in the East River.

Union American firefighters are represented and united in the International Association of Fire Fighters with headquarters in Washington, D.C.[dubious ÿ discuss] However, many municipalities still rely on volunteer, paid on call, or part-time firefighters. These non full-time firefighters are rarely union, and their interests are represented by the National Volunteer Fire Council.\\r\\nThe United States Fire Administration provides national leadership to local fire services. The fire departments report fires and other incidents according to the National Fire Incident Reporting System, which maintains records of the incidents in a uniform manner. The National Fire Protection Association sets and maintains minimum standards and requirements for firefighting duties and equipment. The suppression of wildfires is regulated by the United States Department of Agriculture, US Forest Service, Bureau of Land Management and the Bureau of Indian Affairs. This is done through the National Wildland Coordination Center.\\r\\nThe two million fire calls that American fire departments respond to each year represent the highest figures in the industrialized world. Each year thousands of people die, tens of thousands of people are injured, and property damage reaches billions of dollars. Indirect costs, such as temporary lodging expenses, lost time at work, medical expenses, and psychological damages are equally alarming (The United States Fire Administration 1996). According to American Red Cross statistics, the annual losses from floods, hurricanes, tornadoes, earthquakes, and other natural disasters combined in the United States average just a fraction of those from fires. House fires in particular are one of the most common tragedies facing emergency disaster workers in recent history. According to the US Fire Administration, the United States has a more severe fire problem than generally perceived. In inner city Pennsylvania neighborhoods, house fires have greatly increased, especially in socially and economically disadvantaged neighborhoods. An alarming trend in these specific house fires is that sixty percent of these houses do not have working smoke detectors. Additionally, these households are prone to using supplemental heating devices and substandard extension cords that are not Underwriters Laboratories (UL) compliant. UL compliant extension cords are labeled with valuable information as to the use, size, and rating of the cord (Dunston, 2008, p.?2).\\r\\nFirefighting in the United States can be traced back to the 17th century when, after a great conflagration in Boston in 1631, the Massachusetts Bay Colony passed a law banning smoking in public places.[citation needed]\\r\\nNew Amsterdam established the colonies' first firefighting system in 1647.[8] Fire wardens inspected the houses and chimneys, fining for potential hazard. An eight-man team called a rattle watch patrolled the streets at night. When a fire was detected, they shook wooden rattles to alert townspeople. In 1711 the concerned Americans formed the so-called mutual fire societies of approximately twenty members each. When fire struck a society member, other members rushed for assistance. The first water-pumping engines were imported to New York in the 1730s. In 1736 Benjamin Franklin founded the first American volunteer fire company in Philadelphia. Such companies were soon organized in other colonies. Among those who served as volunteer firefighters were George Washington, Alexander Hamilton, John Hancock, Samuel Adams and Paul Revere.[9] Volunteer firefighters were honored with frequent stanzas in urban newspapers and made the subject of heroizing prints by the popular American printmaking firm Currier & Ives. Nathaniel Currier, of Currier & Ives, also surviving as a volunteer firefighter in New York City during the 1850s. In 1818 the first known female firefighter Molly Williams rose to prominence in New York, when she took her place with the men on the drag ropes and pulled the pumper to the fire through the deep snow.\\r\\nIn 1853 the first practical, steam powered, fire engine was tested in Cincinnati (OH).[10] It was created by Abel Shawk, Alexander Bonner Latta, and Miles Greenwood. The engine was then named \\"Uncle Joe Ross\\" after a city council member.[11]\\r\\nIn the early days of the fire service, fire departments were, more or less, social organizations in the community. And, being an accepted member meant a certain social status in the community. Remnants of that social status can still be found today in the traditional style firefighter's helmets that resemble top hats worn by the early firefighters. Monies that were used to help fund the organization were obtained by insurance company payouts from fighting fires. Firefighters could easily tell just who had fire insurance and who didn't by fire insurance marks located on the front of the home. Often it was a problem for homeowners who did not have insurance to have the fire department respond to a fire in their home and effectively remove belongings and such because the firefighters knew that there wouldn't be any money in it for them.\\r\\nBefore the 1850s, there were only volunteer fire departments. The first paid, fire department was the Cincinnati fire department in Ohio. Volunteer fire departments still protect property and play an important role, as they do even today.\\r\\nAmerican firefighters built, designed or assigned specifications for their equipment. Particularly, they dedicated themselves to the engines and viewed them as integral to the fire company identity.[12] The first fire companies - the Union Fire Company, the Columbia Fire Company and the Anacostia Fire Company were organized in 1804 to serve the White House, the Capitol and the neighborhood of Anacostia in Washington, D.C. respectively. By the 1840s and 1850s the differences between companies within the same city had become quite significant. In 1853 Cincinnati, Ohio became the first city with a fully paid fire department.[13] In 1855 the Metropolitan Hook and Ladder Company Number 1 Firehouse, Washington's oldest extant firehouse, was built at Massachusetts Avenue.\\r\\nWith few exceptions, firefighters denied African Americans the opportunity to join the companies or form their own ones.[citation needed] As early as 1818 in Philadelphia the local free black community attempted to form the African Fire Association. Meanwhile, some southern cities like Charleston and Savannah relied on African American labor.\\r\\nLater the specialized life-saving units in American fire departments - the pompier corps - were formed.\\r\\nIn the 20th century, the nature of an American firefighter's job began to change. Not only was structural firefighting still the main purpose of the department, but more specialized training and education, such as for high-rise structure fires, confined space environments and building construction education have been included and emphasized. Other disciplines had been taken on as responsibilities in lifesaving. An example of such is the practice of Paramedicine which debuted in the late 1960s and early 1970s. Presently, most all fire departments across the United States have been trained in and perform technical rescue, vehicle rescue, high-angle rescue, wildland firefighting and hazardous materials incidents. Additionally, most all career departments as well as many volunteer departments have emergency medical assets at their immediate disposal.\\r\\nSeveral notable events have killed many firefighters. 343 New York City Fire Department (FDNY) firefighters were killed when the World Trade Center collapsed during the attacks of September 11, 2001. In 2007, the Sofa Super Store fire in Charleston, South Carolina, killed nine firefighters.\\r\\nIn 2011, there were about 1.1 million firefighters in the country. 31% were paid, the remainder volunteer. The nation has seen an increase in paid positions; 8.6% decrease in volunteers from 2008 to 2011.[14]\\r\\nFire companies come in several types. Note that the names below are not standard and have numerous local variations.\\r\\nEngine or Pumper\\r\\nTruck or Ladder\\r\\nRescue\\r\\nSquad\\r\\nMedic/Rescue Ambulance\\r\\nQuint\\r\\nTanker or Tender\\r\\nBrush Patrol\\r\\nHelicopter or air ambulance\\r\\nBattalion chief sedan\\r\\nEMS Supervisor or EMS captain sedan\\r\\nConsists of, but not limited to:\\r\\nU.S. firefighters work under the auspices of fire departments (also commonly called fire protection districts, fire divisions, fire companies, fire bureaus, and fire-rescue). These departments are generally organized as local or county government subsidiaries, special-purpose district entities or not-for-profit corporations. They may be funded by the parent government, through millage, fees for services, fundraising or charitable contributions. Some state governments and the federal government operate fire departments to protect their wildlands, e.g., California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection (CAL FIRE),[15] New Jersey Forest Fire Service,[16] USDA Forest Service ÿ Fire and Aviation Management[17] (see also Smokejumper). Many military installations, major airports and large industrial facilities also operate their own fire departments.\\r\\nA small number of U.S. fire departments are privatized, that is, operated by for-profit corporations on behalf of public entities. Knox County, Tennessee is among the largest public entities protected by privatized fire departments.[18]\\r\\nMost larger urban areas have career firefighters. Most rural areas have volunteer or paid on-call firefighters. Smaller towns and suburban areas may have either. 74% of career firefighters are in departments that protect 25,000 or more people. 95% of volunteer firefighters are in departments that protect fewer than 25,000 people and more than half of these and are in small, rural departments protecting fewer than 2,500 people. Departments range in size from a handful of firefighters to over 11,400 sworn firefighters and 4,600 additional personnel in the New York City Fire Department. These additional personnel include uniformed emergency medical technicians (EMTs) and paramedics. Many U.S. fire departments have emergency medical service corps (EMS), which may be structurally separate from or combined with their firefighting operations, including firefighters cross-trained as EMTs and paramedics.\\r\\nAs of 2014, there were 1,134,400 firefighters in the United States (not including firefighters who work for the state or federal governments or in private fire departments). Of these, 346,150 (31%) are career and 788,250 (69%) are volunteer. These firefighters operate out of 27,198[19] fire departments. Career firefighters represent 15% of all departments but protect approximately two thirds of the U.S. population. Meanwhile, 85% of fire departments are volunteer or mostly volunteer and protect approximately one third of the population.[20] The Firemen's Association of the State of New York (FASNY) provides information, education and training for the volunteer fire and emergency medical services throughout New York State.\\r\\nLike U.S. police departments, U.S. fire departments are usually structured in a paramilitary manner. Firefighters are sworn, uniformed members of their departments. Rank-and-file firefighters are equivalent to enlisted personnel; supervisory firefighters are command officers with ranks such as lieutenant, captain, battalion chief, deputy chief and chief. Fire departments, especially larger ones, may also be organized into military-style echelons, such as companies, battalions and divisions. Fire departments may also have unsworn or non-uniformed members in non-firefighting capacities such as administration and civilian oversight, e.g., a board of commissioners. While adhering to a paramilitary command structure, most fire departments operate on a much less formal basis than the military.\\r\\nFirefighting in the United States is becoming more of a profession than it once was. Historically, especially in smaller departments, little formal training of firefighters was required. Now, most states require both career and volunteer firefighters to complete a certificate program at a fire academy. Associate's, bachelor's and master's degree programs in firefighting disciplines are available at colleges and universities. Such advanced training is becoming a de facto prerequisite for command in larger departments. The U.S. Fire Administration operates the National Fire Academy, which also provides specialized firefighter training.\\r\\nThere is no single standard system of rank insignia in use, but certain ranks are common. Many variations in insignia systems make use of the voice trumpet, a type of megaphone, and frequently referred to as a \\"bugle.\\"\\r\\nAdditional ranks outside the normal chain may exist; sergeants, majors, and inspectors are other ranks used by some departments. According to the 1986 Anchorage Fire Department Explorer Handbook, Anchorage Fire Department used a single gold bugle for inspectors, and both single silver bugle and single gold bar for lieutenants, depending upon assignment.\\r\\nMany fire departments use cuff stripes as well as bugles or military style insignia on their dress uniforms. Typically, they are the same in number and color as the bugles / stars worn, but variations exist.\\r\\nMany departments also frequently display seniority Service stripes (hash marks) on the lower left sleeve of a dress uniform jacket, or sometimes long-sleeved uniform shirts, with years of service varying greatly between individual departments (each stripe typically represents anywhere from 2ÿ5 years of service).","input":"How many fire departments in the united states?"},{"output":"Instant film","context":"Instant film is a type of photographic film introduced by Polaroid to be used in an instant camera (and, with accessory hardware, many other professional film cameras). The film contains the chemicals needed for developing and fixing the photograph, and the instant camera exposes and initiates the developing process after a photo has been taken.\\r\\nIn earlier Polaroid instant cameras the film is pulled through rollers which breaks open a pod containing a reagent that is spread between the exposed negative and receiving positive sheet. This film sandwich develops for some time after which the positive sheet is peeled away from the negative to reveal the developed photo. In 1972, Polaroid introduced integral film, which incorporated timing and receiving layers to automatically develop and fix the photo without any intervention from the photographer.\\r\\nInstant film is available in sizes from 24?mm G?36?mm (0.94?in G?1.42?in) (similar to 135 film) up to 50.8?cm G?61?cm (20?in G?24?in) size, with the most popular film sizes for consumer snapshots being approximately 83?mm G?108?mm (3.3?in G?4.3?in) (the image itself is smaller as it is surrounded by a border). Early instant film was distributed on rolls, but later and current films are supplied in packs of 8 or 10 sheets, and single sheet films for use in large format cameras with a compatible back.\\r\\nThough the quality of integral instant film is not as good as conventional film, peel apart black and white film, and to a lesser extent color film approached the quality of traditional film types. Instant film was used where it was undesirable to have to wait for a roll of conventional film to be finished and processed, e.g., documenting evidence in law enforcement, in health care and scientific applications, and producing photographs for passports and other identity documents, or simply for snapshots to be seen immediately. Some photographers use instant film for test shots, to see how a subject or setup looks before using conventional film for the final exposure. Instant film is also used by artists to achieve effects that are impossible to accomplish with traditional photography, by manipulating the emulsion during the developing process, or separating the image emulsion from the film base. Instant film has been supplanted for most purposes by digital photography, which allows the result to be viewed immediately on a display screen or printed with dye sublimation, inkjet, or laser home or professional printers.\\r\\nInstant film is notable for having had a wider range of film speeds available than other negative films of the same era, having been produced in ISO 4 to ISO 20,000.[citation needed] Current instant film formats typically have an ISO between 100 and 1000.[citation needed]\\r\\nTwo companies manufacture instant film: Fujifilm (Instax integral film for its Instax cameras), and Polaroid Originals (previously named The Impossible Project) for older Polaroid cameras (600, SX-70, Spectra and 8G10) and its I-Type cameras.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nInstant positive film (which produced a print) uses diffusion transfer to move the dyes from the negative to the positive via a reagent. The process varies according to the film type.\\r\\nIn 1947 Edward H. Land introduced the Polaroid-Land process.[1] The first instant films produced sepia tone photos.[2] A negative sheet is exposed inside the camera, then lined up with a positive sheet and squeezed through a set of rollers which spread a reagent between the two layers, creating a developing film \\"sandwich\\". The negative develops quickly, after which some of the unexposed silver halide grains (and the latent image it contains) are solubilized by the reagent and transferred by diffusion from the negative to the positive. After a minute, depending on film type and ambient temperature, the negative is peeled away to reveal the photo which was transferred to the positive receiving sheet.[3] True black and white films were released in 1950 after problems with chemistry stabilization were overcome.[2]\\r\\nColor film is much more complex due to multiple layers of emulsion and dye. The negative consists of three emulsion layers sensitive to the primary colors (red, green, and blue) each with a layer of developing dye beneath it of the complementary color (cyan, magenta, and yellow). Once light exposed the negative, the reagent is spread between the negative and positive and the developing dye layer migrates to the positive surface where it forms the photo. Emulsion layers exposed to their respective color block the complementary dye below it, reproducing the original color. For example, a photo of a blue sky would expose the blue emulsion, blocking all the yellow dye beneath it and allowing the magenta and cyan dye layers to migrate to the positive to form blue.[3]\\r\\nThis process is similar to subtractive color instant film with added timing and receiving layers. Land's solution was to incorporate an opacifier, which would darken when ejected from the camera, and then become clear to reveal the photograph.[2] The film itself integrates all the layers to expose, develop, and fix the photo into a plastic envelope and frame commonly associated with a Polaroid photo.\\r\\nAdditive film (such as Polavision and Polachrome slide film) uses a color mask of microscopically thin transparent red, green, and blue lines (3000 lines per inch) and a black and white emulsion layer to reproduce color images in transparency film. The resulting dye developers (unexposed emulsion) block the colors not needed and project the color or combination of colors which form in the resulting image. Since the lines are so close to each other, the human eye easily blended the primary colors together to form the correct color, much like an LCD display or television. For instance, a photo of a yellow flower would expose the emulsion beneath the red and green masks and not the blue mask. The developing process removed the exposed emulsion (under the red and green masks) and diffused the unexposed dye developer (under the blue mask) to its receiving layer, blocking light from coming through. This resulted in the projected light shining through the red and green masks but not the blue mask, creating the color yellow. Because of the film density, film speeds were necessarily slow. High precision was required for the production of this film .\\r\\nPolaroid Corporation invented and produced the widest range of instant film. Roll film was distributed in two separate negative and positive rolls and developed inside the camera. It was introduced in 1948 and was manufactured until 1992. Sheet film was introduced in 1958 for 4x5\\" film holder #500. Each sheet contains a reagent pod, negative and receiving positive, and was loaded separately and developed outside the film holder. In 1973 Polaroid introduced 8x10\\" Instant film. Pack film was distributed in a film pack which contained both negative and positive sheets and was developed outside the camera. It was introduced in 1963. Integral film is also distributed in a film pack, but each film envelope contains all the chemical layers to expose, develop, and fix the photo. It was introduced in 1972.\\r\\nPolavision was an instant motion picture film. Polavision was introduced by Polaroid in 1978, with an image format similar to Super 8 mm film, and based on an additive color process. Polavision required a specific camera and tabletop viewer, and was not a commercial success, but did lead to the development of an instant 35?mm color slide film. Polavision film has been taken off the market. Polachrome was an easy to develop 35?mm film, available in color, monochrome and 'blue' formats (the latter intended for making title cards). Each roll of film came with a cartridge containing developing chemicals which were pressed between the film and a developing strip by a hand-cranked machine called the AutoProcessor. The AutoProcessor was very cheap and did not require a darkroom; the results were somewhat variable, the resolution was not as good as conventional film due to the matrix of tiny red, green and blue filters required to make the monochrome emulsion work in color, and the sensitivity was low, even for slide film; in tungsten light, Polachrome CS is rated at ISO 40. It was introduced in 1983.\\r\\nPolaroid integral film packs usually contain a flat \\"Polapulse\\" electrical battery, which powers systems in the camera, including exposure and focusing mechanisms, electronic flash, and a film ejection motor. The inclusion of the battery within the film pack ensures that a fresh battery is available with each new pack of film.\\r\\nPolaroid no longer produces instant film. It has become an organization which licenses its brand name to other manufacturers. An example of this is the Polaroid 300 camera, which is a Polaroid branded Fuji Instax. Polaroid PIF-300 film is essentially rebranded Fuji Instax mini film.\\r\\nPolaroids have the same storage standards under ISO 18920:2000 as any other photograph.[4] Regular storage conditions should be less than 70 degrees Fahrenheit and between 50% and 30% relative humidity (RH). Cold storage (0 degrees Fahrenheit optimum) is not helpful unless RH can be controlled and cold storage RH is generally drier than required. RH below 30% will create an environment that is too dry and may cause the photograph to curl. A Polaroid transfer removes the emulsion from the plastic backing and residual chemicals, offering an alternate form of preservation.\\r\\nIn February 2008, Polaroid (by then under the control of Thomas J. Petters of Petters Group Worldwide) announced it would cease production of all instant film; the company shut down three factories and laid off 450 workers.[5] Sales of chemical film by all makers have dropped by at least 25% per year since 2000,[citation needed] but a new birth of interest around Fujifilm and, in particular, The Impossible Project films fulfilled demand in the market.\\r\\nPolaBlue, PolaChrome CS, PolaChrome HCP, PolaGraph HC, and PolaPan CT were 35?mm instant slide films.[citation needed]\\r\\n20x24 P3 PolaColor, 20x24 P7 PolaColor, and 20x24 PolaPan.[citation needed]\\r\\nKodak manufactured the negative component of Polaroid's instant film from 1963 to 1969, when Polaroid decided to manufacture its own. Kodak's original plan was to create packfilm type instant products. There were many prototypes and test runs of the film with many private demonstrations to their board. Plans changed when Polaroid in 1972 released the integral type film with the introduction of the SX-70 system. Kodak decided to scrap the plans for packfilm release and focus on an integral type process. A few years later Kodak introduced its own instant film products in 1976, which was different from Polaroid's in several ways:[6]\\r\\nKodak instant film was exposed from the back without a mirror, the opposite of Polaroid's film which was exposed from the front with a mirror to reverse the image. Kodak used a matte finish on the front, made possible by exposing the film through the back. The negative and empty pod could be removed by peeling it off of the back of the print. Unlike Polaroid's integral film packs, Kodak's did not contain a battery, and used conventional batteries. Kodaks PR 10 film was found to have light fading stability issues.[7]\\r\\nPolaroid filed suit against Eastman Kodak in April 1976 for the infringement of ten patents held by Edwin Land and others on his development team relating to instant photography. In September 1985, the United States District Court of Massachusetts ruled that seven patents were valid and infringed, two were invalid but infringed, and one was valid but not infringed by Kodak. Kodak appealed but was denied and an injunction prohibiting production of their instant film and cameras was put into effect. Kodak's appeal to the Supreme Court was denied a few months later, and in January 1986, Kodak announced it would no longer be producing their instant line of products. In 1991, Polaroid was awarded $925 million in damages from Kodak.[8]\\r\\nWhile Kodak instant films have been discontinued, Fuji's instant film available in Japan since the 1980s is very similar to Kodak's. The pictures are the same size, the cartridge is almost the same, with some easy plastic modifications; the Fuji Fotorama series film can be made to fit. It was closest to the Kodak with the ISO at 160, many of the camera's brightness controls can be adjusted to work with the different ISO; However, the FI-10 series was discontinued in the 1990s. The faster ISO 800 instant films will work as well but would require the use of a filter either on the film cartridge or lens.\\r\\nIn Japan, Fujifilm introduced their own line of instant photographic products in 1981 starting with the Fotorama line of cameras. The name Fotorama came from photograph and panorama, as the film was a wide format compared to the square Polaroid SX-70/600 films. These Integral films developed similar to Kodak's with the back layer first. This presented a major problem for Fujifilm because of the ongoing litigation between Kodak and Polaroid. Polaroid also has a separate suit with Fujifilm and their instant film patents in Japan. When Kodak lost, Fujifilm was able to work with Polaroid to allow their cameras and films to remain in the market,[9] provided that they have a technology sharing agreement. Polaroid was interested in branching out to magnetic media in the boom of the videotape era and had acquired a company called MagMedia Ltd. Fujifilm has a long history in magnetic media dating to the mid-1950s. This led to Polaroid having access to Fujifilm's extensive electronic, video tape and floppy disc magnetic products. This allowed Fujifilm access to Polaroid's film technology.\\r\\nBy the mid-1980s Fujifilm introduced the higher ISO System 800 series, followed by the ACE series in the mid-1990s. Instant ACE is nearly identical to System 800, the only difference is the design of the plastic cartridge in the ACE do not contain the spring mechanism (the spring is in the camera). Most of these products were available only in the Japanese market, until the release of Instax series of cameras was released in 1998. Fujifilm originally wanted to release the Instax series worldwide including North America and Europe simultaneously,[10] but decided to work with Polaroid on the mio camera based on the Instax mini 10 for the US market; while Canada did get the Instax Wide 100. Another product was Fujifilm's Digital Instax Pivi film for their battery powered portable printer which was made available for those who wanted to print from their mobile phone via infrared, USB and Bluetooth.\\r\\nFujifilm makes pack film for their passport camera systems, and had been available outside Japan since the mid-1980s. No legal issues arose with Fuji's peel apart instant films as Polaroid's patents had expired. While very popular in Australia as a cheaper alternative to Polaroid,[citation needed] it was generally not too well known elsewhere due to Polaroid's dominance in most countries. In 2000, Fuji decided to change the way they manufacture pack film, making the entire pack out of plastic instead of a metal and plastic combination. Fujifilm announced at PMA 2003[vague] that pack film would be made available to the North American market.\\r\\nWith the discontinuation of Polaroid instant film in 2008, Fuji started to export more of their instant film products to overseas markets, starting with making an increased variety of pack films available. In November 2008 the Instax Wide format was available in the US with the Instax 200 camera.[11] Instax mini series of cameras and films became available in the US during the second half of 2009, with the mini 7s,[12] also an updated Instax 210 replaced the Instax 200. Fujifilm's FP-100b45 was announced in Sept of 2009 for the US market.[13] The FP-3000b45 arrived in the North American market in Jan 2011, after Fujifilm Japan stopped manufacturing FP-100b, but was discontinued in 2012.[14] In late 2012 Fujifilm discontinued FP-3000B,[15] followed by the discontinuation of FP-100C in spring 2016.[16][17] In April 2017 Fujifilm announced the Instax SQUARE 1:1 format and compatible Instax SQ10 camera.[18][19]\\r\\nFujifilm instant films include:\\r\\nA group called the Impossible Project acquired Polaroid's old equipment and factory in Enschede, in the Netherlands.[21][22] On their website[23] they state:\\r\\nWe aim to re-start production of analog instant film for vintage Polaroid cameras in 2010.\\r\\nand\\r\\n\\"The Impossible mission is not to re-build Polaroid Integral film but (with the help of strategic partners) to develop a new product with new characteristics, consisting of new optimised components, produced with a streamlined modern setup. An innovative and fresh analog material, sold under a new brand name that perfectly will match the global re-positioning of Integral Films.\\"\\r\\nOn March 22, 2010, it was announced they were successful in manufacturing instant film compatible with Polaroid SX-70/600 instant cameras. Two new products were announced  PX100 and PX600. Their PX100 Silver Shade instant film is a manipulable, monochromatic replacement of old Polaroid brand instant film compatible with SX-70 cameras while the PX600 Silver Shade instant film is compatible with 600 cameras.[citation needed] That formulation has since been supplanted by improved films.\\r\\nThe company, renamed Polaroid Originals in 2017, produces 600, SX-70, Spectra and 8G10 color and monochrome film packs with a variety of colored borders. It also produces I-Type film packs that differ from traditional 600 packs in their omission of the battery (thus lowering costs), for use in its Impossible I-1 camera (released in 2016) and its Polaroid OneStep 2 camera (announced in 2017).[24][25][26]\\r\\nSummit Global Group, using the Polaroid brand, produced an instant photography camera and film starting with the Polaroid PIC 300, based on Fujifilm's Instax Mini 7.\\r\\nA company called New55Film is bringing to market a 4x5 P/N material that is exposed and processed in a Polaroid 545 holder, and other instant and film-related products. New55 PN provides a positive print and a 4x5 negative that can be scanned, contact printed, or enlarged.\\r\\nThe liquid chemicals for the developing process contained in the more common instant photo sheets are caustic and can cause chemical burns. For such liquid the manufacture recommendation can be to avoid contact with skin and when contact with skin is made wash immediately with much water.[27][28] Some instant films have used less common reagents and have had differing suggested responses.","input":"What type of film do polaroid cameras use?"},{"output":"Kelvin Dale Sampson","context":"Kelvin Dale Sampson (born October 5, 1955) is an American basketball coach who is currently the head coach of the Houston Cougars men's basketball team. He was the head coach at Montana Tech from 1981 to 1985, Washington State University from 1987 to 1994, the University of Oklahoma from 1994 to 2006, and Indiana University 2006 to 2008. He has also been an assistant coach for NBA teams including the Milwaukee Bucks and Houston Rockets.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nSampson was born in the Lumbee Indian community of Deep Branch in Robeson County, North Carolina, where he excelled in the classroom and the athletic arena during his prep days at Pembroke High School, in Pembroke, North Carolina. Sampson was captain of his high school basketball team for two years, and played for his father John W. \\"Ned\\" Sampson. His father was also one of the 500 Lumbee Native Americans who made national news by driving the Ku Klux Klan out of Maxton, North Carolina in what is annually celebrated by the Lumbee as the Battle of Hayes Pond. Later he played at Pembroke State University (now UNC Pembroke), concentrating on basketball and baseball. The point guard was team captain for the Braves as a senior and earned four letters in basketball and three in baseball. He earned Dean's List recognition throughout his collegiate career and received the Gregory Lowe Memorial Award as the school's outstanding physical education major his senior year.\\r\\nAfter earning degrees from Pembroke State in both health and physical education and political science, Sampson pursued his master's degree in coaching and administration at Michigan State University. He left with his degree and a year's experience as a graduate assistant under Jud Heathcote.\\r\\nSampson is married to Karen Lowery. They have one daughter, Lauren, and one son, Kellen. Lauren is the Director of Sports Marketing at College of Charleston, and Kellen was a walk-on for the University of Oklahoma basketball team.\\r\\nSampson then moved to Montana Tech (of the NAIA) where he became assistant coach. After serving as an interim coach for one season, Sampson guided the Orediggers to a 73ÿ45 record in his final four seasons. Montana Tech had won just 17 games combined in the three years before his arrival. Sampson turned in three consecutive 22-win seasons and claimed three Frontier Conference championships at Montana Tech. He led his teams to two NAIA District 12 title games and was named the league's coach of the year in 1983 and 1985.\\r\\nAfter five years at Montana Tech Sampson joined the staff at Washington State University as an assistant to Len Stevens. After two years under Stevens, Sampson was named the head coach of the Washington State Cougars in 1988. When Sampson led the team to the NIT in 1992, it marked the first time Washington State had participated in postseason play since 1983. He was named Kodak District 14 Coach of the Year by the NABC for the second time in three years. He first won the award in 1991 when his Cougar squad produced the school's first winning season since 1983. Sampson was also named Pac-10 Coach of the Year in 1992. In his final year at the school in 1994 he led the Cougars to their first NCAA Tournament berth in 11 years. With records of 22ÿ11 in 1992 and 20ÿ11 in 1994, Sampson became one of only four men to win 20 or more games in a single season in Washington State history.\\r\\nSampson became the 11th head coach at the University of Oklahoma on April 25, 1994.[1] Sampson was named national coach of the year in 1995 (his first year at OU) by the Associated Press, United States Basketball Writers Association and Basketball Weekly after guiding the Sooners to 23ÿ9 overall and 15ÿ0 home marks. It was the second-best overall record posted by a first-year coach in Big 8 history.\\r\\nSampson possesses the highest winning percentage in Oklahoma history (.719). He guided OU to nine consecutive 20-win seasons. He averaged 24.4 wins over those nine campaigns. He directed the Sooners to postseason tournament berths in each of his 12 seasons (11 NCAA Tournaments), with a Sweet 16 showing in 1999, a Final Four appearance in 2002 and an Elite Eight appearance in 2003. His teams also played in the Big 12 Tournament title game on five occasions during the 10 seasons he coached in the Big 12. In 2001, 2002, and 2003, the Sooners won that tournament. Sampson finished with a Big 12 Tournament record of 17-7.\\r\\nThe University of Oklahoma is where Sampson earned his nickname \\"Mr. Blue Shirt\\" as he only wears blue dress shirts when he coaches.\\r\\nOn March 29, 2006 Sampson was named the head coach at Indiana University following the resignation of Mike Davis.[2] Sampson was the second minority coach in the history of the Hoosier basketball program behind Mike Davis. Upon taking the reins of the Indiana Hoosiers he noted, \\"I love my job at Oklahoma and I would not leave OU for any job unless it was a job like Indiana. My family and I have had 12 great years at Oklahoma, the best years of our life, but Indiana is one of the great programs in college basketball and if they call and offer, it is a job as a coach that you have to take.\\"[3]\\r\\nIn his first season at Indiana, Sampson led the Hoosiers to a 21ÿ11 record overall and a 34th appearance in the NCAA tournament as a 7th seed in the West. Indiana beat first round opponent Gonzaga, losing in the second round to eventual Regional Champion UCLA, 54ÿ49.\\r\\nOn February 22, 2008, Sampson was forced to resign due to allegations of serious NCAA violations.[4] As a result of these allegations, Sampson received a five year show cause penalty.[5] See NCAA violations section below.\\r\\nFollowing his resignation and penalties from the NCAA, spent three years as an assistant coach for the Milwaukee Bucks followed by three years as an assistant for the Houston Rockets.\\r\\nFollowing the expiration of the five year show cause penalty, the Houston Cougars hired Sampson to coach the men's basketball team on April 2, 2014.[6]\\r\\nSampson played a role in the controversial recruitment of star player Eric Gordon, who signed with Indiana after reneging on an early verbal commitment to the University of Illinois. Sampson was criticized by fellow coaches for failing to communicate with Illinois coach Bruce Weber about the recruitment,[7] and some observers said that Sampson's recruitment of the verbally-committed Gordon was unethical.[8]\\r\\nIn addition to the Gordon incident, Sampson has been in the middle of a number of other controversies. Under Sampson's watch, Oklahoma was placed under a three-year investigation by the NCAA for recruiting violations. At the end of their investigation, the NCAA issued a report citing more than 550 impermissible calls made by Sampson and his staff to 17 different recruits. The NCAA barred Sampson from recruiting off campus and making phone calls for one year, ending May 24, 2007.[9]\\r\\nPrior to the findings by the NCAA, Kelvin Sampson was the President of the National Association of Basketball Coaches (NABC), an organization that supports basketball coaches across the country. During his tenure the Ethics Committee of the NABC was formed to address the many problems with violations that college basketball faced going into the 2003 season. That very same Ethics Committee would later reprimand Kelvin Sampson as a result of the NCAA findings, placing him on probation for three years during which he would not be eligible to serve in any official capacity for the NABC, be considered for Coach of the Year honors or receive Final Four ticket privileges.[10]\\r\\nAs coach at Indiana in October 2007, Sampson again came under scrutiny for making impermissible phone calls. Despite being restricted from making any outbound recruiting phone calls, Sampson participated in approximately 10 conference calls with recruits that violate the terms of the sanctions levied against him by the NCAA. IU assistant Rob Senderoff (who has since announced his resignation) also made some 35 impermissible phone calls to recruits from his home. On February 8, 2008, the NCAA informed Indiana that Sampson had committed five \\"major\\" rules violations. The NCAA alleged that Sampson knowingly violated telephone recruiting restrictions imposed on him. More seriously, the NCAA also alleged that Sampson lied to IU and NCAA officials regarding his involvement in the impermissible calls.[11]\\r\\nIndiana launched an internal investigation that school president Michael McRobbie said would take seven days. On February 14, 2008, ESPN reported that Sampson's status as coach of the Hoosiers would be decided on a \\"game-by-game basis.\\".[12] Fox Sports reported that Sampson was to be fired on February 22, 2008,[13] but later reports indicated that Sampson would be suspended without pay. Eventually it was announced that Sampson would resign, reaching a $750,000 settlement with Indiana. In return, Sampson agreed not to sue Indiana for wrongful termination. Assistant Dan Dakich was named as interim head coach for the rest of the season.[14]\\r\\nAccording to many college basketball pundits, however, Sampson had virtually no chance of keeping his job once the allegations broke. Sports Illustrated college basketball columnist Seth Davis implied that Indiana officials had already decided Sampson was guilty, based on the fact that its internal investigation would only last a week. The NCAA had given Indiana 90 days to respond to the notice.[15] ESPN's Mark Schlabach suggested that Indiana wanted to look for a reason not to pay the remaining money he was owed on his contract, and also wanted to eliminate any chance of being sued. He also said that the only reason Sampson was allowed to continue coaching was because his contract didn't allow the school to suspend him immediately.[16] ESPN's Pat Forde said that Sampson's departure was \\"preordained\\" the moment the NCAA sent out its notice of allegations, and suggested that Sampson might never coach in Division I again.[17]\\r\\nDuring a private meeting with the NCAA infractions committee on June 30, McRobbie apologized for hiring Sampson and called that decision a mistake. McRobbie said that Sampson betrayed his trust as Indiana's coach, and demonstrated that his hiring had been \\"a risk that should not have been taken.\\"[18]\\r\\nOn November 25, 2008, the NCAA slapped Indiana with three years' probation for violations largely tied to Sampson's watch. It also imposed a five-year show-cause order on Sampson, meaning that any NCAA member school who wanted to hire Sampson while the order was in effect would have to impose sanctions on him unless it can \\"show cause\\" that Sampson has served his punishment. However, most NCAA members will not even consider hiring a coach with an outstanding show-cause order, so the show-cause effectively blackballed Sampson from coaching at the major-college level until 2013. A similar incident happened to Todd Bozeman, who was slapped with an eight-year show-cause order in 1996 and was unable to find work in the college ranks again until 2006. Senderoff, now head coach at Kent State, was hit with a three-year show-cause order.[19] When he was hired at Houston, Sampson became only the fourth coach to get a head coaching job at another school after receiving a show-cause (after Bozeman, Senderoff and Bruce Pearl).\\r\\nIn December 2008, Eric Gordon raised issues of drug use on the Indiana team, stating that some players were abusing drugs and that this led to the disintegration of the team, and that Sampson tried to stop it, but did not as he was focused on winning.[20]\\r\\nOn March 8, 2008 Sampson was hired in an advisory role by the San Antonio Spurs.[21]\\r\\nOn May 14, 2008 Sampson was hired as assistant coach of the Bucks under Scott Skiles.\\r\\nUntil 2014, he had been an assistant coach with the Houston Rockets.\\r\\nSampson coached the 2004 Under-21 USA national team to a gold medal in Under-21 Tournament of the Americas in Halifax, Nova Scotia, after it posted a 5ÿ0 record. He was an assistant coach under George Karl for the US national team in the 2002 FIBA World Championship.[22] Sampson was also the head coach of the United States Junior National Team that participated in the Junior World Games in Athens, Greece, in the summer of 1995.\\r\\nIn the summer of 1994, Sampson was selected to coach at the Goodwill Games in St. Petersburg, Russia. He served as an assistant to former Southern California head coach George Raveling. The team earned a bronze medal and competed against USA Basketball's Dream Team II following the games. In 1993, Sampson was selected head coach of the West team at the U.S. Olympic Festival in San Antonio, Texas. His squad won the silver medal.\\r\\nIn the summer of 2012, Sampson was assistant coach of the Canadian national men's basketball team.

The conference name is also commonly used to refer to those eight schools as a group beyond the sports context.[2] The eight institutions are Brown University, Columbia University, Cornell University, Dartmouth College, Harvard University, the University of Pennsylvania, Princeton University, and Yale University. The term Ivy League has connotations of academic excellence, selectivity in admissions, and social elitism.\\r\\nWhile the term was in use as early as 1933, it became official only after the formation of the NCAA Division?I athletic conference in 1954.[3] Seven of the eight schools were founded during the United States colonial period; Cornell was founded in 1865. Ivy League institutions account for seven of the nine Colonial Colleges chartered before the American Revolution; the other two are Rutgers University and the College of William & Mary.\\r\\nIvy League schools are generally viewed as some of the most prestigious, and are ranked among the best universities worldwide by U.S. News & World Report.[4] All eight universities place in the top fifteen of the U.S. News & World Report 2017 nation university rankings, including the top four schools and five of the top eight.[5] U.S. News has named a member of the Ivy League as the best national university in each of the past seventeen years ending with the 2017 rankings: Princeton ten times, Harvard twice, and the two schools tied for first five times.\\r\\nUndergraduate enrollments range from about 4,000 to 14,000,[6] making them larger than those of a typical private liberal arts college and smaller than a typical public state university. Total enrollments, including graduate students, range from approximately 6,400 at Dartmouth to over 20,000 at Columbia, Cornell, Harvard, and Penn. Ivy League financial endowments range from Brown's $3.2 billion to Harvard's $36.4 billion,[7] the largest financial endowment of any academic institution in the world.[8]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nIvy League universities have some of the largest university financial endowments in the world, which allows the universities to provide many resources for their academic programs and research endeavors. As of 2014, Harvard University has an endowment of $36.4 billion.[9] Additionally, each university receives millions of dollars in research grants and other subsidies from federal and state governments.\\r\\nStudents have long revered the ivied walls of older colleges. \\"Planting the ivy\\" was a customary class day ceremony at many colleges in the 1800s. In 1893 an alumnus told The Harvard Crimson, \\"In 1850, class day was placed upon the University Calendar.... the custom of planting the ivy, while the ivy oration was delivered, arose about this time.\\"[30] At Penn, graduating seniors started the custom of planting ivy at a university building each spring in 1873 and that practice was formally designated as \\"Ivy Day\\" in 1874.[31] Ivy planting ceremonies are reported for Yale,[32] Simmons,[33] Bryn Mawr[34] and many others. Princeton's \\"Ivy Club\\" was founded in 1879.[35]\\r\\nThe first usage of Ivy in reference to a group of colleges is from sportswriter Stanley Woodward (1895ÿ1965).\\r\\nA proportion of our eastern ivy colleges are meeting little fellows another Saturday before plunging into the strife and the turmoil.\\r\\nThe first known instance of the term Ivy League being used appeared in The Christian Science Monitor on February 7, 1935.[3][37][38] Several sportswriters and other journalists used the term shortly later to refer to the older colleges, those along the northeastern seaboard of the United States, chiefly the nine institutions with origins dating from the colonial era, together with the United States Military Academy (West Point), the United States Naval Academy, and a few others. These schools were known for their long-standing traditions in intercollegiate athletics, often being the first schools to participate in such activities. However, at this time, none of these institutions made efforts to form an athletic league.\\r\\nA common folk etymology attributes the name to the Roman numeral for four (IV), asserting that there was such a sports league originally with four members. The Morris Dictionary of Word and Phrase Origins helped to perpetuate this belief. The supposed \\"IV League\\" was formed over a century ago and consisted of Harvard, Yale, Princeton, and a fourth school that varies depending on who is telling the story.[39][40][41] However, it is clear that Harvard, Princeton, Yale and Columbia met on November 23, 1876 at the so-called Massasoit Convention to decide on uniform rules for the emerging game of American football, which rapidly spread.[42]\\r\\nSeven out of the eight Ivy League schools were founded before the American Revolution; Cornell was founded just after the American Civil War. These seven were the primary colleges in the Northern and Middle Colonies, and their early faculties and founding boards were largely, therefore, drawn from other Ivy League institutions. There were also some British graduates from the University of Cambridge, the University of Oxford, the University of St. Andrews, the University of Edinburgh, and elsewhere on their boards. Similarly, the founder of The College of William & Mary, in 1693, was a British graduate of the University of Edinburgh. Cornell provided Stanford University with its first president.\\r\\nThe influence of these institutions on the founding of other colleges and universities is notable. This included the Southern public college movement which blossomed in the decades surrounding the turn of the 19th century when Georgia, South Carolina, North Carolina and Virginia established what became the flagship universities for each of these states. In 1801, a majority of the first board of trustees for what became the University of South Carolina were Princeton alumni. They appointed Jonathan Maxcy, a Brown graduate, as the university's first president. Thomas Cooper, an Oxford alumnus and University of Pennsylvania faculty member, became the second president of the South Carolina college. The founders of the University of California came from Yale, hence the school colors of University of California are Yale Blue and California Gold.[43]\\r\\nSome of the Ivy League schools have identifiable Protestant roots, while others were founded as non-sectarian schools. Church of England King's College broke up during the Revolution and was reformed as public nonsectarian Columbia College. In the early nineteenth century, the specific purpose of training Calvinist ministers was handed off to theological seminaries, but a denominational tone and such relics as compulsory chapel often lasted well into the twentieth century. Penn and Brown were officially founded as nonsectarian schools. Brown's charter promised no religious tests and \\"full liberty of conscience\\", but placed control in the hands of a board of twenty-two Baptists, five Quakers, four Congregationalists, and five Episcopalians. Cornell has been strongly nonsectarian from its founding.\\r\\n\\"Ivy League\\" is sometimes used as a way of referring to an elite class, even though institutions such as Cornell University were among the first in the United States to reject racial and gender discrimination in their admissions policies. This dates back to at least 1935.[44] Novels[45] and memoirs[46] attest this sense, as a social elite; to some degree independent of the actual schools.\\r\\nAfter the Second World War, the present Ivy League institutions slowly widened their selection of their students. They had always had distinguished faculties; some of the first Americans with doctorates had taught for them; but they now decided that they could not both be world-class research institutions and be competitive in the highest ranks of American college sport; in addition, the schools experienced the scandals of any other big-time football programs, although more quietly.[47]\\r\\nThe first formal athletic league involving eventual Ivy League schools (or any US colleges, for that matter) was created in 1870 with the formation of the Rowing Association of American Colleges. The RAAC hosted a de facto national championship in rowing during the period 1870ÿ1894. In 1895, Cornell, Columbia, and Penn founded the Intercollegiate Rowing Association, which remains the oldest collegiate athletic organizing body in the US. To this day, the IRA Championship Regatta determines the national champion in rowing and all of the Ivies are regularly invited to compete.\\r\\nA basketball league was later created in 1902, when Columbia, Cornell, Harvard, Yale and Princeton formed the Eastern Intercollegiate Basketball League; they were later joined by Penn and Dartmouth.\\r\\nIn 1906, the organization that eventually became the National Collegiate Athletic Association was formed, primarily to formalize rules for the emerging sport of football. But of the 39 original member colleges in the NCAA, only two of them (Dartmouth and Penn) later became Ivies.\\r\\nIn February 1903, intercollegiate wrestling began when Yale accepted a challenge from Columbia, published in the Yale News. The dual meet took place prior to a basketball game hosted by Columbia and resulted in a tie. Two years later, Penn and Princeton also added wrestling teams, leading to the formation of the student-run Intercollegiate Wrestling Association, now the Eastern Intercollegiate Wrestling Association (EIWA), the first and oldest collegiate wrestling league in the US.[49]\\r\\nIn 1930, Columbia, Cornell, Dartmouth, Penn, Princeton and Yale formed the Eastern Intercollegiate Baseball League; they were later joined by Harvard, Brown, Army and Navy.\\r\\nBefore the formal establishment of the Ivy League, there was an \\"unwritten and unspoken agreement among certain Eastern colleges on athletic relations\\". The earliest reference to the \\"Ivy colleges\\" came in 1933, when Stanley Woodward of the New York Herald Tribune used it to refer to the eight current members plus Army.[3] In 1935, the Associated Press reported on an example of collaboration between the schools:\\r\\nThe athletic authorities of the so-called \\"Ivy League\\" are considering drastic measures to curb the increasing tendency toward riotous attacks on goal posts and other encroachments by spectators on playing fields.\\r\\nDespite such collaboration, the universities did not seem to consider the formation of the league as imminent. Romeyn Berry, Cornell's manager of athletics, reported the situation in January 1936 as follows:\\r\\nI can say with certainty that in the last five yearsand markedly in the last three monthsthere has been a strong drift among the eight or ten universities of the East which see a good deal of one another in sport toward a closer bond of confidence and cooperation and toward the formation of a common front against the threat of a breakdown in the ideals of amateur sport in the interests of supposed expediency.\\r\\nPlease do not regard that statement as implying the organization of an Eastern conference or even a poetic \\"Ivy League\\". That sort of thing does not seem to be in the cards at the moment.[51]\\r\\nWithin a year of this statement and having held month-long discussions about the proposal, on December 3, 1936, the idea of \\"the formation of an Ivy League\\" gained enough traction among the undergraduate bodies of the universities that the Columbia Daily Spectator, The Cornell Daily Sun, The Dartmouth, The Harvard Crimson, The Daily Pennsylvanian, The Daily Princetonian and the Yale Daily News would simultaneously run an editorial entitled \\"Now Is the Time\\", encouraging the seven universities to form the league in an effort to preserve the ideals of athletics.[52] Part of the editorial read as follows:\\r\\nThe Ivy League exists already in the minds of a good many of those connected with football, and we fail to see why the seven schools concerned should be satisfied to let it exist as a purely nebulous entity where there are so many practical benefits which would be possible under definite organized association. The seven colleges involved fall naturally together by reason of their common interests and similar general standards and by dint of their established national reputation they are in a particularly advantageous position to assume leadership for the preservation of the ideals of intercollegiate athletics.[53]\\r\\nThe Ivies have been competing in sports as long as intercollegiate sports have existed in the United States. Rowing teams from Harvard and Yale met in the first sporting event held between students of two U.S. colleges on Lake Winnipesaukee, New Hampshire, on August 3, 1852. Harvard's team, \\"The Oneida\\", won the race and was presented with trophy black walnut oars from then presidential nominee General Franklin Pierce. The proposal did not succeedon January 11, 1937, the athletic authorities at the schools rejected the \\"possibility of a heptagonal league in football such as these institutions maintain in basketball, baseball and track.\\" However, they noted that the league \\"has such promising possibilities that it may not be dismissed and must be the subject of further consideration.\\"[54]\\r\\nIn 1945 the presidents of the eight schools signed the first Ivy Group Agreement, which set academic, financial, and athletic standards for the football teams. The principles established reiterated those put forward in the Harvard-Yale-Princeton Presidents' Agreement of 1916. The Ivy Group Agreement established the core tenet that an applicant's ability to play on a team would not influence admissions decisions:\\r\\nThe members of the Group reaffirm their prohibition of athletic scholarships. Athletes shall be admitted as students and awarded financial aid only on the basis of the same academic standards and economic need as are applied to all other students.[55]\\r\\nIn 1954, the presidents extended the Ivy Group Agreement to all intercollegiate sports, effective with the 1955ÿ56 basketball season. This is generally reckoned as the formal formation of the Ivy League. As part of the transition, Brown, the only Ivy that hadn't joined the EIBL, did so for the 1954ÿ55 season. A year later, the Ivy League absorbed the EIBL. The Ivy League claims the EIBL's history as its own. Through the EIBL, it is the oldest basketball conference in Division I.[56][57]\\r\\nAs late as the 1960s many of the Ivy League universities' undergraduate programs remained open only to men, with Cornell the only one to have been coeducational from its founding (1865) and Columbia being the last (1983) to become coeducational. Before they became coeducational, many of the Ivy schools maintained extensive social ties with nearby Seven Sisters women's colleges, including weekend visits, dances and parties inviting Ivy and Seven Sisters students to mingle. This was the case not only at Barnard College and Radcliffe College, which are adjacent to Columbia and Harvard, but at more distant institutions as well. The movie Animal House includes a satiric version of the formerly common visits by Dartmouth men to Massachusetts to meet Smith and Mount Holyoke women, a drive of more than two hours. As noted by Irene Harwarth, Mindi Maline, and Elizabeth DeBra, \\"The 'Seven Sisters' was the name given to Barnard, Smith, Mount Holyoke, Vassar, Bryn Mawr, Wellesley, and Radcliffe, because of their parallel to the Ivy League mens colleges.\\"[58]\\r\\nIn 1982 the Ivy League considered adding two members, with Army, Navy, and Northwestern as the most likely candidates; if it had done so, the league could probably have avoided being moved into the recently created Division I-AA (now Division I FCS) for football.[59] In 1983, following the admission of women to Columbia College, Columbia University and Barnard College entered into an athletic consortium agreement by which students from both schools compete together on Columbia University women's athletic teams, which replaced the women's teams previously sponsored by Barnard.\\r\\nWhen Army and Navy departed the Eastern Intercollegiate Baseball League in 1992, all intercollegiate competition involving the eight schools became united under the Ivy League banner.\\r\\nThe Ivy League schools are highly selective, with acceptance rates since 2000 ranging from 6 to 16 percent at each of the universities. Admitted students come from around the world, although students from New England and the Northeastern United States make up a significant proportion of students.[69][70][71]\\r\\nMembers of the League have been highly ranked by various university rankings.\\r\\nFurther, Ivy League members have produced many Nobel laureates, winners of the Nobel Prize and the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences. According to the Nobel Foundation's website, as of 2016 the number of prize-winners affiliated with each Ivy League university at the time of their awards is: Brown, 2; Columbia, 17; Cornell, 8; Dartmouth, 0; Harvard, 36; Penn, 4; Princeton, 14; and Yale, 8.[76] In addition, each university self-reports their number of affiliated Nobel laureates, but they use varying definitions for which Nobel winners they claim (for example, alumni, active faculty, former faculty, visiting faculty, adjunct faculty, etc.)\\r\\nCollaboration between the member schools is illustrated by the student-led Ivy Council that meets in the fall and spring of each year, with representatives from every Ivy League school. The governing body of the Ivy League is the Council of Ivy Group Presidents, composed of each university president. During meetings, the presidents often discuss common procedures and initiatives for the universities.\\r\\nDifferent fashion trends and styles have emerged from Ivy League campuses over time, and fashion trends such as Ivy League and Preppy are styles often associated with the Ivy League and its culture.\\r\\nIvy League style is a style of men's dress, popular during the late 1950s, believed to have originated on Ivy League campuses. The clothing stores J. Press and Brooks Brothers represent perhaps the quintessential Ivy League dress manner. The Ivy League style is said to be the predecessor to the preppy style of dress.\\r\\nPreppy fashion started around 1912 to the late 1940s and 1950s as the Ivy League style of dress.[77] J. Press represents the quintessential preppy clothing brand, stemming from the collegiate traditions that shaped the preppy subculture. In the mid-twentieth century J. Press and Brooks Brothers, both being pioneers in preppy fashion, had stores on Ivy League school campuses, including Harvard, Princeton, and Yale.\\r\\nSome typical preppy styles also reflect traditional upper class New England leisure activities, such as equestrian, sailing or yachting, hunting, fencing, rowing, lacrosse, tennis, golf, and rugby. Longtime New England outdoor outfitters, such as L.L. Bean,[78] became part of conventional preppy style. This can be seen in sport stripes and colours, equestrian clothing, plaid shirts, field jackets and nautical-themed accessories. Vacationing in Palm Beach, Florida, long popular with the East Coast upper class, led to the emergence of bright colour combinations in leisure wear seen in some brands such as Lilly Pulitzer.[78] By the 1980s, other brands such as Lacoste, Izod[79] and Dooney & Bourke became associated with preppy style.'\\r\\nToday, these styles continue to be popular on Ivy League campuses, throughout the U.S., and abroad, and are oftentimes labeled as \\"Classic American style\\" or \\"Traditional American style\\".[80][81]\\r\\nThe Ivy League is often associated with the upper class White Anglo-Saxon Protestant community of the Northeast, Old Money, or more generally, the American upper middle and upper classes.[82][83][84][85] Although most Ivy League students come from upper middle- and upper-class families, the student body has become increasingly more economically and ethnically diverse. The universities provide significant financial aid to help increase the enrollment of lower income and middle class students.[86] Several reports suggest, however, that the proportion of students from less-affluent families remains low.[87][88]\\r\\nPhrases such as \\"Ivy League snobbery\\"[89] are ubiquitous in nonfiction and fiction writing of the early and mid-twentieth century. A Louis Auchincloss character dreads \\"the aridity of snobbery which he knew infected the Ivy League colleges\\".[45] A business writer, warning in 2001 against discriminatory hiring, presented a cautionary example of an attitude to avoid (the bracketed phrase is his):\\r\\nWe Ivy Leaguers [read: mostly white and Anglo] know that an Ivy League degree is a mark of the kind of person who is likely to succeed in this organization.[90]\\r\\nThe phrase Ivy League historically has been perceived as connected not only with academic excellence, but also with social elitism. In 1936, sportswriter John Kieran noted that student editors at Harvard, Yale, Princeton, Cornell, Columbia, Dartmouth, and Penn were advocating the formation of an athletic association. In urging them to consider \\"Army and Navy and Georgetown and Fordham and Syracuse and Brown and Pitt\\" as candidates for membership, he exhorted:\\r\\nIt would be well for the proponents of the Ivy League to make it clear (to themselves especially) that the proposed group would be inclusive but not \\"exclusive\\" as this term is used with a slight up-tilting of the tip of the nose.[91]\\r\\nAspects of Ivy stereotyping were illustrated during the 1988 presidential election, when George H. W. Bush (Yale '48) derided Michael Dukakis (graduate of Harvard Law School) for having \\"foreign-policy views born in Harvard Yard's boutique.\\"[92] New York Times columnist Maureen Dowd asked \\"Wasn't this a case of the pot calling the kettle elite?\\" Bush explained, however, that, unlike Harvard, Yale's reputation was \\"so diffuse, there isn't a symbol, I don't think, in the Yale situation, any symbolism in it.... Harvard boutique to me has the connotation of liberalism and elitism\\" and said Harvard in his remark was intended to represent \\"a philosophical enclave\\" and not a statement about class.[93] Columnist Russell Baker opined that \\"Voters inclined to loathe and fear elite Ivy League schools rarely make fine distinctions between Yale and Harvard. All they know is that both are full of rich, fancy, stuck-up and possibly dangerous intellectuals who never sit down to supper in their undershirt no matter how hot the weather gets.\\"[94] Still, the last five presidents have all attended Ivy League schools for at least part of their education George H. W. Bush (Yale undergrad), Bill Clinton (Yale Law School), George W. Bush (Yale undergrad, Harvard Business School), Barack Obama (Columbia undergrad, Harvard Law School), and Donald Trump (Penn undergrad).\\r\\nOf the forty-four men who have served as President of the United States, fifteen have graduated from an Ivy League university. Of them, eight have degrees from Harvard, five from Yale, three from Columbia, two from Princeton and one from Penn. Twelve presidents have earned Ivy undergraduate degrees. Three of these were transfer students: Donald Trump transferred from Fordham University, Barack Obama transferred from Occidental College and John F. Kennedy transferred from another Ivy, Princeton, where he had been class of 1939. John Adams was the first president to graduate from college, graduating from Harvard in 1755.\\r\\nStudents of the Ivy League largely hail from the Northeast, largely from the New York City, Boston, and Philadelphia areas. As all eight Ivy League universities are within the Northeast, it is no surprise that most graduates end up working and residing in the Northeast after graduation. An unscientific survey of Harvard seniors from the Class of 2013 found that 42% hailed from the Northeast and 55% overall were planning on working and residing in the Northeast.[99] Boston and New York City are traditionally where many Ivy League graduates end up living.[100][101][102][103]\\r\\nStudents of the Ivy League, both graduate and undergraduate, come primarily from upper middle and upper class families. In recent years, however, the universities have looked towards increasing socioeconomic and class diversity, by providing greater financial aid packages to applicants from lower, working, and middle class American families.[86][104]\\r\\nIn 2013, 46% of Harvard undergraduate students came from families in the top 3.8% of all American households (i.e., over $200,000 annual income).[104] In 2012, the bottom 25% of the American income distribution accounted for only 3ÿ4% of students at Brown, a figure that had remained unchanged since 1992.[105] In 2014, 69% of incoming freshmen students at Yale College came from families with annual incomes of over $120,000, putting most Yale College students in the upper middle and/or upper class. (The median household income in the U.S. in 2013 was $52,700.)[106]\\r\\nIn the 2011ÿ2012 academic year, students qualifying for Pell Grants (federally funded scholarships on the basis of need) comprised 20% at Harvard, 18% at Cornell, 17% at Penn, 16% at Columbia, 15% at Dartmouth and Brown, 14% at Yale, and 12% at Princeton. Nationally, 35% of American university students qualify for a Pell Grant.[107]\\r\\nIvy champions are recognized in sixteen men's and sixteen women's sports. In some sports, Ivy teams actually compete as members of another league, the Ivy championship being decided by isolating the members' records in play against each other; for example, the six league members who participate in ice hockey do so as members of ECAC Hockey, but an Ivy champion is extrapolated each year. The Ivy League was the last Division I basketball conference to institute a conference postseason tournament; the first tournaments for men and women will be held at the end of the 2016ÿ17 season. The tournaments will only award the Ivy League automatic bids for the NCAA Division?I Men's and Women's Basketball Tournaments; the official conference championships will continue to be awarded based solely on regular-season results.[108] Before the 2016ÿ17 season, the automatic bids were based solely on regular-season record, with a one-game playoff (or series of one-game playoffs if more than two teams were tied) held to determine the automatic bid.[109] The Ivy League is one of only two Division I conferences which award their official basketball championships solely on regular-season results; the other is the Southeastern Conference.[110][111] Since its inception, an Ivy League school has yet to win either the men's or women's Division I NCAA Basketball Tournament.\\r\\nOn average, each Ivy school has more than 35 varsity teams. All eight are in the top 20 for number of sports offered for both men and women among Division I schools. Unlike most Division I athletic conferences, the Ivy League prohibits the granting of athletic scholarships; all scholarships awarded are need-based (financial aid).[112] In addition, the Ivies have a rigid policy against redshirting, even for medical reasons; an athlete loses a year of eligibility for every year enrolled at an Ivy institution.[113] Ivy League teams' non-league games are often against the members of the Patriot League, which have similar academic standards and athletic scholarship policies (although unlike the Ivies, the Patriot League allows redshirting).\\r\\nIn the time before recruiting for college sports became dominated by those offering athletic scholarships and lowered academic standards for athletes, the Ivy League was successful in many sports relative to other universities in the country. In particular, Princeton won 26 recognized national championships in college football (last in 1935), and Yale won 18 (last in 1927).[114] Both of these totals are considerably higher than those of other historically strong programs such as Alabama, which has won 15, Notre Dame, which claims 11 but is credited by many sources with 13, and USC, which has won 11. Yale, whose coach Walter Camp was the \\"Father of American Football,\\" held on to its place as the all-time wins leader in college football throughout the entire 20th century, but was finally passed by Michigan on November 10, 2001. Harvard, Yale, Princeton and Penn each have over a dozen former scholar-athletes enshrined in the College Football Hall of Fame. Currently Dartmouth holds the record for most Ivy League football titles, with 18, followed closely by Harvard and Penn, each with 17 titles. In addition, the Ivy League has produced Super Bowl winners Kevin Boothe (Cornell), two-time Pro Bowler Zak DeOssie (Brown), Sean Morey (Brown), All-Pro selection Matt Birk (Harvard), Calvin Hill (Yale), Derrick Harmon (Cornell) and 1999 \\"Mr. Irrelevant\\" Jim Finn (Penn).\\r\\nBeginning with the 1982 football season, the Ivy League has competed in Division I-AA (renamed FCS in 2006).[115] The Ivy League teams are eligible for the FCS tournament held to determine the national champion, and the league champion is eligible for an automatic bid (and any other team may qualify for an at-large selection) from the NCAA. However, the Ivy League has not played any postseason games at all since 1956 due to the league's concerns about the extended December schedule's effects on academics. For this reason, any Ivy League team invited to the FCS playoffs turns down the bid. The Ivy League plays a strict 10-game schedule, compared to other FCS members' schedules of 11 (or, in some seasons, 12) regular season games, plus post-season, which was most recently expanded in 2013 to five rounds with 24 teams, with a bye week for the top eight teams. Football is the only sport in which the Ivy League declines to compete for a national title.\\r\\nIn addition to varsity football, Penn, Princeton and Cornell also field teams in the eight-team Collegiate Sprint Football League, in which all players must weigh 172 pounds or less. Penn and Princeton are the last remaining founding members of the league from its 1934 debut, and Cornell is the next-oldest, joining in 1937. Yale and Columbia previously fielded teams in the league but no longer do so.\\r\\nThe Ivy League is home to some of the oldest college rugby teams in the United States. Although these teams are not \\"varsity\\" sports, they compete annually in the Ivy Rugby Conference.\\r\\nThe table above includes the number of team championships won from the beginning of official Ivy League competition (1956ÿ57 academic year) through 2011ÿ12. Princeton and Harvard have on occasion won ten or more Ivy League titles in a year, an achievement accomplished six times by Harvard and 21 times by Princeton, including a conference-record 15 championships in 2010ÿ11. Only once has one of the other six schools earned more than eight titles in a single academic year (Cornell with nine in 2005ÿ06). In the 33 academic years beginning 1979ÿ80, Princeton has averaged 11 championships per year, one-third of the conference total of 33 sponsored sports.[117]\\r\\nIn the seven academic years beginning 2005ÿ06, Harvard has won Ivy titles in 22 different sports, two-thirds of the league total, and Princeton has won championships in 31 different sports, all except wrestling and men's tennis.[118]\\r\\nRivalries run deep in the Ivy League. For instance, Princeton and Penn are longstanding men's basketball rivals;[119] \\"Puck Frinceton\\", and \\"Pennetrate the Puss\\" T-shirts are worn by Quaker fans at games.[120] In only 11 instances in the history of Ivy League basketball, and in only seven seasons since Yale's 1962 title, has neither Penn nor Princeton won at least a share of the Ivy League title in basketball,[121] with Princeton champion or co-champion 26 times and Penn 25 times. Penn has won 21 outright, Princeton 19 outright. Princeton has been a co-champion 7 times, sharing 4 of those titles with Penn (these 4 seasons represent the only times Penn has been co-champion). Harvard won its first title of either variety in 2011, losing a dramatic play-off game to Princeton for the NCAA tournament bid, then rebounded to win outright championships in 2012, 2013, and 2014.\\r\\nRivalries exist between other Ivy league teams in other sports, including Cornell and Harvard in hockey, Harvard and Princeton in swimming, and Harvard and Penn in football (Penn and Harvard have won 28 Ivy League Football Championships since 1982, Penn-16; Harvard-12). During that time Penn has had 8 undefeated Ivy League Football Championships and Harvard has had 6 undefeated Ivy League Football Championships.[122] In men's lacrosse, Cornell and Princeton are perennial rivals, and they are the only two Ivy League teams to have won the NCAA tournament. In 2009, the Big Red and Tigers met for their 70th game in the NCAA tournament.[123] No team other than Harvard or Princeton has won the men's swimming conference title outright since 1972, although Yale, Columbia, and Cornell have shared the title with Harvard and Princeton during this time. Similarly, no program other than Princeton and Harvard has won the women's swimming championship since Brown's 1999 title. Princeton or Cornell has won every indoor and outdoor track and field championship, both men's and women's, every year since 2002ÿ03, with one exception (Columbia women won indoor championship in 2012). Harvard and Yale are football and crew rivals although the competition has become unbalanced; Harvard has won all but one of the last 15 football games and all but one of the last 13 crew races.\\r\\nThe Yale-Princeton series is the nation's second longest, exceeded only by \\"The Rivalry\\" between Lehigh and Lafayette, which began later in 1884 but included two or three games in each of 17 early seasons.[124] For the first three decades of the Yale-Princeton rivalry, the two played their season-ending game at a neutral site, usually New York City, and with one exception (1890: Harvard), the winner of the game also won at least a share of the national championship that year, covering the period 1869 through 1903.[125][126] This phenomenon of a finale contest at a neutral site for the national title created a social occasion for the society elite of the metropolitan area akin to a Super Bowl in the era prior to the establishment of the NFL in 1920.[127][128] These football games were also financially profitable for the two universities, so much that they began to play baseball games in New York City as well, drawing record crowds for that sport also, largely from the same social demographic.[129] In a period when the only professional sports were fledgling baseball leagues, these high profile early contests between Princeton and Yale played a role in popularizing spectator sports, demonstrating their financial potential and raising public awareness of Ivy universities at a time when few people attended college.\\r\\nThis list, which is current through July 1, 2015,[130] includes NCAA championships and women's AIAW championships (one each for Yale and Dartmouth). Excluded from this list are all other national championships earned outside the scope of NCAA competition, including football titles and retroactive Helms Foundation titles.\\r\\nThe term Ivy is often used to connote a positive comparison to or association with the Ivy League, often along academic lines. The term has been used to describe the Little Ivies, a grouping of small liberal arts colleges in the Northeastern United States.[133] Other uses include the Southern Ivies and the Public Ivies. The 2007 edition of Newsweek's How to Get Into College Now, the editors designated 25 schools as \\"New Ivies\\".[134]\\r\\nThe term Ivy Plus is sometimes used to refer to the Ancient Eight plus several other schools for purposes of alumni associations,[135][136] university affiliations,[136][137][138][139] or endowment comparisons.[140][141][142][143] In his book Untangling the Ivy League, Zawel writes, \\"The inclusion of nonÿIvy League schools under this term is commonplace for some schools and extremely rare for others. Among these other schools, Massachusetts Institute of Technology and Stanford University are almost always included. The University of Chicago and Duke University are often included as well.\\"[136] In their 2015 book Acing Admissions, Mehta and Dixit write, \\"The [Ivy Plus schools] include, but are not limited to: Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), Stanford University and Northwestern University. Besides selectivity, these Ivy Plus colleges are thought to share similar values around academic and professional excellence, intellectual curiosity, leadership and civil engagement.\\"[144]","input":"What ivy league school is in ithaca ny?"},{"output":"Sumter County","context":"The Villages is a census-designated place (CDP) in Sumter County, Florida, United States. It shares its name with a broader master-planned age-restricted community that spreads into portions of Lake and Marion counties. The Villages consistently ranks as a very high growth area. The U.S. Census ranked The Villages as the fastest-growing U.S. city for the second year in a row (during the 12 months ending in July 2014);[4] As of April 2016, the total population of The Villages reached 157,000 people, due to new areas stretching from Fruitland Park to South SR 44. [5]\\r\\nThe Villages is controlled by several quasi-governmental Community Development Districts (CDD), which are controlled by the development company that created The Villages.[6] H. Gary Morse, the son of the original owner and who was responsible for turning The Villages into one of the most well-known and fastest-growing retirement communities, transferred most direct ownership in the company to his three children in 2006; Morse died in 2014.[7][8] The overall development lies in central Florida, approximately 20 miles (32?km) south of Ocala and approximately 45 miles (72?km) northwest of Orlando.\\r\\nAs of the 2010 United States Census, The Villages had a population of 51,442,[9] reflecting an increase of 43,109 (517.33%) from the 8,333 counted in 2000. It is the center of The Villages Metropolitan Statistical Area (MSA), which consists of all of Sumter County; Lake County is included in the OrlandoÿKissimmeeÿSanford, Florida Metropolitan Statistical Area; and Marion County is included in the Ocala, Florida Metropolitan Statistical Area.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nHarold Schwartz, a Michigan businessman, began selling land tracts via mail order in The Villages area in the 1960s. He and his business partner, Al Tarrson, were forced to close the mail-order aspect of the business due to a 1968 Federal law banning sales of real estate by mail order.[10]\\r\\nStuck with considerable portions of Florida land, in the early 1970s Schwartz and Tarrson began development of a mobile home park, Orange Blossom Gardens, in the northwestern corner of Lake County. By the early 1980s, the community had sold only 400 units. In an attempt to improve the business, Schwartz bought out Tarrson's interest and brought his son, H. Gary Morse, on board in 1983.\\r\\nMorse noted that the successful retirement communities (such as Del Webb's Sun City developments) offered numerous well-maintained amenities to the residents. They also had diverse and nearby commercial development. Morse began to significantly upgrade the development. Their sales improved in the mid-1980s. Schwartz began to buy large tracts of land in nearby Sumter and Marion counties for future expansion. In 1992, Morse officially changed the overall development name to The Villages. The development is still controlled in all major aspects by descendants of Schwartz and Morse.\\r\\nA Declaration of Restrictions has been created for each individual neighborhood, which regulates design and operational aspects, such as landscaping, repairs and maintenance, placement of satellite dishes, hedges, etc. An Architectural Review Committee controls the composition and consistency of the exterior of the residential properties within The Villages. The committee, which consists of Villages residents, reviews and approves alterations and modifications to the properties and homes built by the developer. Committee members serve for three years and are selected by the sitting committee.[11]\\r\\nTo qualify for an exception to the Housing for Older Persons Act prohibitions against discrimination, at least 80% of the homes within The Villages must have at least one person 55 years of age or older residing in the home.[12] Persons under the age of 19 years are not permitted to reside within The Villages unless an exemption is granted. Three subdivisions have been designated as \\"family units\\"[13] and are not subject to this restriction. Otherwise, persons under age 19 (such as grandchildren) are permitted to visit for no more than 30 days within a calendar year.[14]\\r\\nThe Villages is located at 285616N 815816W? / ?28.93778N 81.97111W? / 28.93778; -81.97111 (28.9378, ?81.9712).[1]\\r\\nAccording to the United States Census Bureau, the CDP (Sumter County only) has a total area of 5.6?sq?mi (15?km2), of which 5.2?sq?mi (13?km2) is land and 0.4?sq?mi (1.0?km2) (6.99%) is water. The Villages is located approximately 45 miles northwest of Orlando and 75 miles northeast of Tampa.\\r\\nAs of the census[3] of 2000, there were 8,333 people, 4,392 households, and 3,583 families residing in the CDP (Sumter County). The population density was 1,605.5 people per square mile (619.9/km2). There were 5,065 housing units at an average density of 975.9/mi (376.8/km2). The racial makeup of the CDP was 98.4% White, 0.5% African American, 0.1% Native American, 0.5% Asian, <0.1% Pacific Islander, 0.06% from other races, and 0.4% from two or more races. Hispanics or Latinos of any race made up 1.3% of the population.\\r\\nThere were 4,393 households out of which 0.3% had children under the age of 18 living with them, 80.1% were married couples living together, 1.2% had a female householder with no husband present, and 18.4% were non-families. 15.6% of all households were made up of individuals and 11.1% had someone living alone who was 65 years of age or older. The average household size was 1.89 and the average family size was 2.05.\\r\\nIn the CDP, the population was spread out with 0.3% under the age of 18, 0.3% from 18 to 24, 1.5% from 25 to 44, 40.4% from 45 to 64, and 57.5% 65 years of age or older. The median age was 66 years. For every 100 females there were 91.0 males. For every 100 females age 18 and over, there were 90.9 males.\\r\\nThe median income for a household in the CDP was $42,542, and the median income for a family was $45,078. Males had a median income of $58,173 versus $26,176 for females. The per capita income for the CDP was $28,343. About 2.8% of families and 3.7% of the population were below the poverty line, including none under age 18 and 2.8% of those who are at least age 65.\\r\\nConsidered a conservative community, The Villages is a popular election stop and platform for political figures such as former Vice President Dick Cheney,[15] former presidential and vice presidential candidates Mitt Romney[16] and Paul Ryan,[17] former vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin,[18][19] former presidential candidate Mike Huckabee,[20] 2016 GOP presidential primary candidates Marco Rubio[21] and Ben Carson,[22][23] former presidential candidate Rick Santorum,[24] and talk show hosts/authors Glenn Beck[25] and Brian Kilmeade.[26] In the lead-up to the 2016 Presidential Election, GOP Vice Presidential Nominee Mike Pence visited to campaign for his running mate, Donald Trump.[27]\\r\\nResidents of The Villages have a historically high 80% turnout rate in elections. Republicans outnumber Democrats two-to-one.[28] Some Democratic residents complain about the distinctly Republican coverage in local broadcasting and newspaper, an orientation attributed to The Villages' owner,[29] as well as voicing concerns about politically oriented vandalism.[30]\\r\\nA critical part of Central Florida's Republican party, The Villages has been visited frequently along the campaign trail by Florida Governor Rick Scott and United States Senator Marco Rubio. During the 2014 Florida gubernatorial election, Scott visited The Villages on the eve of the election to rally votes.[31] Just before the 2016 election for Florida Senator, Rubio stopped off at the temporary Republican Headquarters established at Lake Sumter Landing in The Villages.[32]\\r\\nThe Villages is in Florida's 11th congressional district represented by Rep. Daniel Webster.\\r\\nThe entirety of The Villages is within the boundaries of Florida Senate District 12 (currently represented by Republican Dennis Baxley), and is within the boundaries of Florida House of Representatives District 33 (currently represented by Republican Don Hahnfeldt).\\r\\nThe portion of The Villages within Lake County is within Lake County District 1.[33]\\r\\nThe portion of The Villages within Marion County is within Marion County District 3.[34]\\r\\nAreas of The Villages in Sumter County are divided between Sumter County District 1, which takes areas east of Morse Boulevard, and Sumter County District 3, which takes areas west of Morse Boulevard.[35][36]\\r\\nThe majority of The Villages is developed and maintained using several Community Development Districts (CDD).[37] The CDD is a form of special purpose local government available under Florida law; around 225 communities in Florida currently use this form of government.[37] The portion of The Villages located in Lake County is under the jurisdiction of the city of Lady Lake and is not part of any of the District CDDs, but a portion is under the larger CDDs (see below).\\r\\nThe Villages currently operates 12 CDDs. Ten of the 12 CDDs cover the various areas of The Village where residents own homes, and provide and maintain the roads and transportation paths, storm water systems and structures, underground utilities, curbs and gutters, and street lights. The costs of building and maintaining this infrastructure are paid for by annual special assessments included in the property tax bill. District residents (including landowners who have yet to build on their property) elect the members of the District Board of Supervisors. The current district setup is as follows:[38]\\r\\nThe remaining two CDDs are:\\r\\nUnlike the residential CDDs, there are no residents within the CDD boundaries. Thus, the five-member Board of Supervisors for each district is composed of the developer's employees or affiliates. [39][40]\\r\\nThere are also two quasi-homeowners associations in The Villages: The Property Owners Association (POA) and The Villages Homeowners Association (VHA).[41][42]\\r\\nAs a master planned retirement community, The Villages offers numerous forms of recreation. The majority of the costs are paid for via the monthly amenities fee assessed to residents (the facilities are owned by the centralized CDDs discussed above).[43]\\r\\nThe centerpiece of The Villages is its numerous assortment of golf courses. The ability to play \\"Free Golf for Life\\" is a key component of The Villages advertising campaigns (though technically the statement is inaccurate as the costs are covered by the mandatory monthly amenity fees assessed on each residential lot). As of February 2017[update], The Villages operates 48 courses.\\r\\nThe majority (36) of the courses[44] are executive golf courses, all of which are 9-hole layouts. It is these courses at which residents of The Villages can play \\"free golf for life\\" (i.e., no greens fees) and can walk the courses for free as well; fees are charged for riding a golf cart on the courses. These courses are owned by the Villages residents and managed by the Villages Community Center Development District (VCDD)[45]\\r\\nThe remaining 12 courses are country club championship courses.[46] Among notable course architects are Arnold Palmer and Nancy Lopez. The Orange Blossom Hills and Tierra Del Sol clubs are 18-hole layouts; the other eight clubs are 27-hole layouts. Residents of The Villages are automatically members of these clubs; however, unlike the executive courses residents must pay greens fees to play the courses and the clubs charge for priority tee times. These championship courses are owned by the Villages Developer and through an agreement with the VCDD, are managed by that entity.[47]\\r\\nOn October 15, 2013, The Villages officially opened executive courses Sweetgum and Mangrove.[48] The most recent championship course (Belle Glade) was opened for public play on November 26, 2014.[49]\\r\\nBy final buildout, The Villages will operate 12 country-club championship courses (the last two will be 27-hole layouts; there are no plans to expand Orange Blossom Hills or Tierra Del Sol beyond their existing 18-hole layouts) and 35 9-hole executive golf courses, for a total of 621 holes of golf.[50]\\r\\nThe Villages also operates a golf instruction academy[51] for all skill levels.\\r\\nIn addition, The Villages operates numerous recreation centers. There are three classes of centers (the number shown are as of March 2011 and are based on the types of swimming pools offered):\\r\\nThe Villages operates 11 parks, dog parks, and fitness trails, which are separate from the recreation centers.\\r\\nThe Villages has become a popular spot for many artists. In April 2015, The Sharon L. Morse Performing Arts Center, a venue with over 1,000 seats, opened to much fanfare.[55] The Sharon has featured various popular artists such as Frankie Avalon,[56] Jerry Lewis,[57] Felix Cavaliere,[58] Little River Band,[59] Bobby Rydell,[60] Ray Stevens,[61] The Spinners,[62] Kenny G,[63] and Chubby Checker.[64]\\r\\nBeyond the golf courses and recreation centers, The Villages also operates numerous softball fields, a polo stadium (The Villages Polo Stadium),[65] and a woodworking shop, plus the Lifelong Learning College.[66] The newest softball complex, Soaring Eagle, opened on January 16, 2015.[67]\\r\\nNightly activities are held in The Villages three town squares,[68] Lake Sumter Landing's Market Square[69] and Spanish Springs Town Square.[70] A third town square, Brownwood Paddock Square, opened on October 12, 2012.[71]\\r\\nThe Villages is served by television channels from the Orlando market, although channels from the Tampa market also cover the area. It is also served by radio stations from both the Orlando and Gainesville/Ocala markets, and by area newspapers such as the Orlando Sentinel, the Tampa Bay Times, the Leesburg Daily Commercial, and the Ocala Star-Banner.\\r\\nThe Villages developers or their successors operate three media properties:\\r\\nLocal, independent media outlets include:\\r\\nThe Villages development is bounded roughly by US 27/US 441 to the east, US 301 to the west, County Road 42 to the north, and County Road 466A to the south, though construction has now proceeded well south of 466A with the development of several new villages, the Bonifay Country Club, and the Brownwood town center in that area. On December 10, 2013, The Villages of Lake-Sumter Inc. agreed to an $8?million deal to purchase Pine Ridge Dairy tract in Fruitland Park, Florida with a planned construction of 2,038 new Villages homes.[72] Although County Road 466 previously served as the main east-west corridor, the addition of homes and facilities south of County Road 466 and in the city of Fruitland Park, Florida has turned County Road 466A into a secondary east-west corridor.[73] Buena Vista Boulevard and Morse Boulevard serve as major north-south corridors.[74]\\r\\nDue to the prevalence of golf courses many residents in The Villages use golf carts (some of which are street-legal, and some of which are solar-powered) to travel around the community. Tunnels have been built in most of The Villages where a highway must be crossed, but one overpass exists across US 27/US 441 because there was no way to construct a tunnel in this area.\\r\\nSumter County Transit operates The Villages shuttle. They provide various weekday loops through the Villages.[75]\\r\\nThe Villages developers operate a trolley-style bus tour of the community which operates from the sales and information center located at The Market Square in Lake Sumter Landing.\\r\\nAmtrak serves The Villages by connecting bus to Jacksonville and Lakeland.\\r\\nThe following school listings are primarily for tax base purposes only, as The Villages does not allow full-time residents under age 19 except in the three family unit neighborhoods of Bison Valley, Spring Arbor, and Oak Meadows[13] or by exception granted for hardship cases.\\r\\nAlthough children cannot legally reside in most neighborhoods of The Villages, The Villages Charter Schools is a PK-12 charter school in unincorporated Sumter County.[78] Children are eligible to attend the charter school if one or both of their parents work directly for The Villages or one of its direct subcontractors, or if a parent works for a business located within The Villages. Children of residents who reside in a family unit neighborhood or by granted exemption do not automatically qualify for attendance based solely on their residence.[79]\\r\\nThe Lifelong Learning College operated by The Villages developer was shut down on 2016-12-31:[80] \\"The Villages Lifelong Learning College no longer exists. All offices are closed and courses cancelled.\\"[81]\\r\\nSumter District Schools operates the Sumter County Adult Community Education Center in unincorporated Sumter County.[82]\\r\\nFor residents of Lake and Sumter counties, Lake-Sumter State College provides adult education at the South Lake Campus in Clermont, the Leesburg Campus in Leesburg and the Sumter Campus in unincorporated Sumter County.[83]\\r\\nCollege of Central Florida serves residents of Marion County,[84] operating the Ocala Campus and the Hampton Center in Ocala in Marion County and centers and campuses in adjacent counties.[85]\\r\\nIn January 2008, the Village Center CDD was notified by the Internal Revenue Service of the IRS' intent to audit several recreational bonds issued in 2003 to determine compliance with tax regulations (mainly due to their status as municipal bonds which are exempt from Federal income tax). The IRS sent three \\"Notices of Proposed Issues\\" in January 2009 challenging the tax-exempt status of the bonds on three grounds:\\r\\nThe position stems in large part from the interrelationship between VCCDD and The Villages developers (since VCCDD has no residents, the Board of Supervisors consists solely of individuals who work for or have an affiliation with The Villages developers, and VCCDDs infrastructure was purchased by the developers-controlled board from the developers). Essentially, the IRS position is that the VCCDD is an \\"alter ego\\" for the developers.[86]\\r\\nAfter an IRS settlement offer was rejected by VCCDD,[87] the IRS further expanded its audit in July 2009 to include all recreational and utility revenue bonds issued by VCCDD[88] as well as similar bonds issued by Sumter Landing CDD,[89] on the basis that Sumter Landing CDD is also an \\"alter ego\\" of the developers. However, the 10 district CDDs were not included in the expanded audit, since as shown above the District CDDs Boards are elected by the residents.\\r\\nVCCDD opposes the position taken by the IRS, and in January 2010 it formally requested technical advice from the IRS as to the position it has taken.[90] On June 14, 2011, VCCDD (after discussions with the IRS) submitted its final Request for Technical Advice, outlining its position on the matter.[91] In June 2013, the IRS ruled that $426 million in bonds were not tax free since the bureaucracy running The Villages could not be considered a real government. The IRS found that the bureaucracy was not structured to represent the residents.[92] On April 30, 2014, the IRS Office of Tax Exempt Bonds issued a negative response in lieu of The Villages requests for tax relief on the grounds of qualifying as a political subdivision under IRS regulations.[93]\\r\\nFrom March 2008 until October 1, 2013, it is estimated that through the Amenity Authority Committee and CDD government, Villages' residents bore approximately $750,000.00 in legal fees in defending against the IRS audit.[94]\\r\\nIn a memo dated July 11, 2016, the IRS, noting that the remaining Village Center municipal bonds had been redeemed in 2015, stated, \\"We have concluded that closing this examination without further IRS action supports sound tax administration. The IRS had tried to settle the case in November 2016 for $1.5 million. However, the Village Center Supervisors unanimously refused that settlement offer. Now the IRS has closed the examination with no penalty.","input":"What part of florida are the villages in?"},{"output":"March 1, 1872","context":"","input":"When was yellowstone established as a national park?"},{"output":"The Millennium Falcon","context":"The Millennium Falcon is a YT-1300F Corellian Light Freighter spaceship in the Star Wars universe commanded at one time by Corellian smuggler Han Solo (Harrison Ford) and his Wookiee first mate, Chewbacca (Peter Mayhew). Designed by the Corellian Engineering Corporation (CEC), the highly modified freighter is stated as being the second fastest vessel in the Star Wars canon.\\r\\nMillennium Falcon first appears in Star Wars (1977), and subsequently in The Empire Strikes Back (1980), Return of the Jedi (1983) and The Force Awakens (2015). The ship also makes a brief cameo appearance in Revenge of the Sith (2005). Additionally, the Falcon appears in a variety of Star Wars expanded universe materials, including books, comics, and games; James Luceno's novel Millennium Falcon focuses on the titular ship.[2] It also appears in the 2014 animated film The Lego Movie in Lego form, with Billy Dee Williams and Anthony Daniels reprising their roles of Lando Calrissian and C-3PO, with Keith Ferguson voicing Han Solo.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe ship originally had a more elongated appearance, but this design's similarity to the Eagle Transporters in Space: 1999 prompted Lucas to change the Falcon's design.[1] The original model was modified, re-scaled, and used as Princess Leia's ship, Tantive IV.[3] Modelmaker Joe Johnston had about four weeks to redesign the Falcon, and Lucas's only suggestion to Johnston was to \\"think of a flying saucer\\".[4] Johnston did not want to produce a \\"basic flying saucer\\", so he created the offset cockpit, forward cargo mandibles, and rear slot for the engines.[4] The design was simple enough to create in the four-week window. Johnston called production of the new Falcon design one of his most intense projects.[4]\\r\\nThe sound of the ship traveling through hyperspace comes from two tracks of the engine noise of a McDonnell Douglas DC-9, with one track slightly out of synchronization with the other to introduce a phasing effect.[5] To this, sound designer Ben Burtt added the hum of the cooling fans on the motion-control rig at Industrial Light & Magic (ILM).[5]\\r\\nVisually, the Millennium Falcon was represented by several models and external and internal sets. For Star Wars, a partial exterior set was constructed and the set dressed as Docking Bay 94 and the Death Star hangar. Besides the functional landing gear, an additional support held up the structure and was disguised as a fuel line. The interior set included the starboard ring corridor, the boarding ramp, cockpit access tunnel, gun turret ladder, secret compartments, and the forward hold. The cockpit was constructed as a separate set that could be rocked when the ship was supposed to shake. Several inconsistencies exist between the internal set and the external set, the cockpit access tunnel angle being the most noticeable.\\r\\nThe effects models for Star Wars matched the design of the exterior set. The primary model was 5 feet long and detailed with various kit parts. The ship was represented by a matte painting when Princess Leia (Carrie Fisher) sees it for the first time, showing the full upper surface. For the 1997 \\"Special Edition\\", a digital model replaces the effects model in several shots, and is used in a new shot of the Falcon lifting off from Docking Bay 94.\\r\\nFor The Empire Strikes Back, a new external set was constructed. In spring 1979, Marcon Fabrications, a heavy engineering firm that served the UK's petrochemical and oil industries,[6] was hired to build a movable full-scale external model capable of \\"moving as if it were about to take off.\\"[6] Built in secrecy under the project code name Magic Roundabout,[6][7] the company leased the 1930s Western Sunderland Flying Boat hangar in Pembroke Dock, West Wales.[7][8] The model, which took three months to construct, weighed over 25 long tons (25?t), measured 65 feet (20?m) in diameter and 20 feet (6.1?m) high, and used compressed air hover pads for up to 1.5 inches (38?mm) of hover-height movement around the set.[7][9][10] It was then disassembled and shipped to Elstree Studios, Hertfordshire, for filming.[6] Today, the Pembroke Dock museum has an exhibit about the project.[6][7]\\r\\nAlong with the full-size mock-up of the Falcon, a new miniature model was created for Star Wars, Episode V: The Empire Strikes Back to allow ILM to film more intricate in-flight rolls and pitches that weren't possible with the five-foot model. This model was able to be mounted on a gimbal that allowed ILM to simulate very difficult maneuvers as the ship attempted to outrun Imperial Tie-Fighters during the asteroid field escape scene from the film. The new model, which measured at approximately 32 inches in length, had several surface features that differed from the five-foot model including updated landing gear and different surface \\"greeblies\\" (small kit-bashed parts added to simulate random mechanical surface detail). The 32\\" model was the version of the Millennium Falcon most depicted in toys, model kits, and promotional materials for the Star Wars universe prior to the release of The Force Awakens. The model was reused for Star Wars, Episode VI: Return of the Jedi.\\r\\nAs in Star Wars, the location set was changed around the ship set. The only major design change was to add landing gear where the disguised fuel line had been in Star Wars. As this set included the port side, that gave the set seven landing gears. The internal set was slightly refitted from A New Hope and featured a larger cargo hold, an additional corridor to port, and an equipment room. Two new interior sets were created that are not shown to connect to the rest of the set: a top hatch that Lando Calrissian (Billy Dee Williams) uses to rescue Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill), and the compartment where Luke rests on a bunk.\\r\\nThe 5-foot-long (1.5?m) effects model from Star Wars was modified to reflect the additional landing gear, and several new models were built, including one roughly the size of a U.S. Quarter Dollar. For the 1997 Special Edition, a CGI model replaced the effects model during the approach and landing on Cloud City.\\r\\nNo new models or sets were created for Return of the Jedi. A portion of the full-scale ship was used for a scene cut from the film in which several characters board the Falcon in a sandstorm on Tatooine. In the scene when Han exacts a promise from Lando not to damage the Falcon, the Falcon is represented by a backdrop painting. It is also in a matte painting of the entire hangar bay.\\r\\nThe internal and external sets were scrapped after filming on Return of the Jedi ended.[9] The effects models were kept by Lucasfilm and some have been on display from time to time.\\r\\nA digital version of the Falcon appears briefly on Coruscant in Revenge of the Sith. Lucas has said that the ship is the Falcon and not another ship of similar design.[11] A CGI version of the vessel also appears in the Disney attraction Star Tours: The Adventures Continue.\\r\\nOn June 3, 2014, TMZ confirmed that the Falcon would return for Star Wars: The Force Awakens when it leaked a photo from the set of the film, showing a full-scale version of the Falcon being built.[12] An effects shot of the Falcon appears in the teaser trailer for The Force Awakens, released on November 28, 2014. This version of the ship is a digital recreation[13] of the original 1977 5 foot model, with additional detailing reflecting the passage of time. The most noticeable change is the rectangular sensor array above the top hull, which replaces the circular dish from the first three films.[14]\\r\\nHan Solo won the Millennium Falcon from Lando Calrissian in the card game 'sabacc'.[15] In Star Wars, Obi-Wan Kenobi (Alec Guinness) and Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill) charter the ship to deliver them, C-3PO (Anthony Daniels), R2-D2 (Kenny Baker), and the stolen Death Star plans to Alderaan. When the Falcon is captured by the Death Star, the group conceal themselves in smuggling compartments built into the floor to avoid detection during a search of the ship. Solo later collects his fee for delivering them to the hidden Rebel base and departs under bitter circumstances, but returns to assist Luke in destroying the Death Star.\\r\\nSolo pilots the Falcon, with Chewbacca, Leia, and C-3PO aboard, to elude the Imperial Starfleet in The Empire Strikes Back, wherein they take refuge at Cloud City, where Darth Vader (David Prowse/James Earl Jones) captures Solo. Lando Calrissian helps the others escape and, at the film's end, he departs in the Falcon to track down Solo and his captor, Jabba the Hutt. Calrissian again flies the Falcon during the climax of Return of the Jedi, with Nien Nunb as co-pilot, to destroy the second Death Star. Before the second Death Star is destroyed. Lando accidentally damages the ship by hitting the circular radar dish on a random pipe or circuit in the second Death Star. Lando and the others still have success in destroying the Galactic Empire.\\r\\nIn Star Wars: The Force Awakens, set some 30 years after Return of the Jedi, the Falcon is in the possession of a scrap dealer named Unkar Plutt on the desert planet Jakku, having been stolen from Solo and Chewbacca some years prior. Scavenger Rey and former stormtrooper Finn steal the Falcon in order to escape from an attack by the First Order, having been targeted for having the droid BB-8 in their possession. They are captured by a smuggling freighter, which turns out to be piloted by Solo and Chewbacca, who reclaim the Falcon for their own. Forced to escape in the Falcon from an ambush by parties to whom Solo is heavily in debt, Solo reluctantly agrees to help Rey and Finn return BB-8 to the Resistance.\\r\\nIn the initial film, Solo brags that the Falcon made the Kessel Run in \\"less than twelve parsecs\\". As the parsec is a unit of distance, not time, different explanations have been provided. In the fourth draft of the script, Kenobi \\"reacts to Solos stupid attempt to impress them with obvious misinformation\\".[16] In the Expanded Universe, the Kessel Run is a pathway from Kessel past the Maw Black Hole Cluster: used by smugglers to transport precious Glitterstim spice; and Solo's bragging refers to his ability to move the ship closer to the Maw's black holes and therefore shorten the distance traveled.[17] On the Star Wars DVD audio commentary, Lucas comments that, in the Star Wars universe, traveling through hyperspace requires careful navigation to avoid stars, planets, asteroids, and other obstacles,[18] and that because no long-distance journey can be made in a straight line, the \\"fastest\\" ship is the one that can plot the \\"most direct course\\", thereby traveling the least distance.[18]\\r\\nThe novelization changes the line to \\"twelve Standard Time Units\\".\\r\\nThroughout the franchise, the Falcon has been depicted a number of times, and the ship's ownership often comes up during explanations of its history.\\r\\nJoss Whedon credits the Millennium Falcon as one of his two primary inspirations for his Firefly television show.[19] The Falcon and the Falcon's distinct shape appear in Star Trek: First Contact,[20] Blade Runner,[21] Spaceballs, and Starship Troopers.[22] The manga series Berserk includes a Millennium Falcon arc.[23] In another manga and anime series, Hellsing, the Millennium Falcon is referenced briefly for comedic effect. The adult animation sketch-comedy series Robot Chicken aired a sketch entitled \\"The Emperor's Phone Call,\\" in which Palpatine receives the news of the destruction of the Death Star with incredulity, at one point angrily asking \\"What the hell is an aluminum falcon?\\"[24]\\r\\nKenner,[25] Hasbro,[26][27] Steel Tec,[28] Master Replicas,[29] Code 3 Collectibles and Micro Machines have all released Millennium Falcon toys and puzzles, including a Transformers version of the ship. Lego has released multiple versions of the Millennium Falcon in varying sizes. The 5,195-piece Lego model (part of the Star Wars \\"Ultimate Collectors Series\\") was physically the largest Lego set sold by the company, until it was topped in 2008 by the Lego Taj Mahal.[30][31] In September 2017, Lego have released the newly updated Millennium Falcon under of the Star Wars \\"Ultimate Collectors Series\\". With the new interior and more details compare the 2007 model, this model consist of 7,541-piece become the single largest Lego set ever sold (by a considerable margin), and with an $800 price tag, its also the single most expensive Lego set the company has ever sold.[32]\\r\\nIn 2010, Adidas also released a pair of Stan Smith trainers inspired by the Millennium Falcon, as part of the Adidas Originals Star Wars campaign.[33]\\r\\nSpaceX states that its Falcon family of rockets is named after the Millennium Falcon.[34]\\r\\nIn 2015, scale model manufacturer DeAgostini and Model-Space introduced a monthly installment piece-build model of the Millennium Falcon.

He was also the first to recognize the difference between conscious selective breeding in which humans directly select for desirable traits, and unconscious selection where traits evolve as a by-product of natural selection or from selection on other traits.[2][3][4] There is a genetic difference between domestic and wild populations. There is also such a difference between the domestication traits that researchers believe to have been essential at the early stages of domestication, and the improvement traits that have appeared since the split between wild and domestic populations.[5][6][7] Domestication traits are generally fixed within all domesticates, and were selected during the initial episode of domestication of that animal or plant, whereas improvement traits are present only in a proportion of domesticates, though they may be fixed in individual breeds or regional populations.[6][7][8]\\r\\nThe dog was the first domesticated vertebrate,[9][10][11] and was established across Eurasia before the end of the Late Pleistocene era, well before cultivation and before the domestication of other animals.[10] The archaeological and genetic data suggest that long-term bidirectional gene flow between wild and domestic stocks ÿ including donkeys, horses, New and Old World camelids, goats, sheep, and pigs ÿ was common.[7][12] Given its importance to humans and its value as a model of evolutionary and demographic change, domestication has attracted scientists from archaeology, palaeontology, anthropology, botany, zoology, genetics, and the environmental sciences.[13] Among birds, the major domestic species today is the chicken, important for meat and eggs, though economically valuable poultry include the turkey, guineafowl and numerous other species. Birds are also widely kept as cagebirds, from songbirds to parrots. The longest established invertebrate domesticates are the honey bee and the silkworm. Terrestrial snails are raised for food, while species from several phyla are kept for research, and others are bred for biological control.\\r\\nThe domestication of plants began at least 12,000 years ago with cereals in the Middle East, and the bottle gourd in Asia. Agriculture developed in at least 11 different centres around the world, domesticating different crops and animals.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nDomestication, from the Latin domesticus, 'belonging to the house',[14] is \\"a sustained multi-generational, mutualistic relationship in which one organism assumes a significant degree of influence over the reproduction and care of another organism in order to secure a more predictable supply of a resource of interest, and through which the partner organism gains advantage over individuals that remain outside this relationship, thereby benefitting and often increasing the fitness of both the domesticator and the target domesticate.\\"[1][15][16][17][18] This definition recognizes both the biological and the cultural components of the domestication process and the impacts on both humans and the domesticated animals and plants. All past definitions of domestication have included a relationship between humans with plants and animals, but their differences lay in who was considered as the lead partner in the relationship. This new definition recognizes a mutualistic relationship in which both partners gain benefits. Domestication has vastly enhanced the reproductive output of crop plants, livestock, and pets far beyond that of their wild progenitors. Domesticates have provided humans with resources that they could more predictably and securely control, move, and redistribute, which has been the advantage that had fueled a population explosion of the agro-pastoralists and their spread to all corners of the planet.[18]\\r\\nHouseplants and ornamentals are plants domesticated primarily for aesthetic enjoyment in and around the home, while those domesticated for large-scale food production are called crops. Domesticated plants deliberately altered or selected for special desirable characteristics are cultigens. Animals domesticated for home companionship are called pets, while those domesticated for food or work are known as livestock.\\r\\nThis biological mutualism is not restricted to humans with domestic crops and livestock but is well-documented in nonhuman species, especially among a number of social insect domesticators and their plant and animal domesticates, for example the antÿfungus mutualism that exists between leafcutter ants and certain fungi.[1]\\r\\nDomestication syndrome is the suite of phenotypic traits arising during domestication that distinguish crops from their wild ancestors.[5][19] The term is also applied to vertebrate animals, and includes increased docility and tameness, coat color changes, reductions in tooth size, changes in craniofacial morphology, alterations in ear and tail form (e.g., floppy ears), more frequent and nonseasonal estrus cycles, alterations in adrenocorticotropic hormone levels, changed concentrations of several neurotransmitters, prolongations in juvenile behavior, and reductions in both total brain size and of particular brain regions.[20]\\r\\nThe domestication of animals and plants began with the wolf (Canis lupus) at least 15,000 years before present (YBP), which then led to a rapid shift in the evolution, ecology, and demography of both humans and numerous species of animals and plants.[21][7] The sudden appearance of the domestic dog (Canis lupus familiaris) in the archaeological record was followed by livestock and crop domestication, and the transition of humans from foraging to farming in different places and times across the planet.[21][22][23] Around 10,000 YBP, a new way of life emerged for humans through the management and exploitation of plant and animal species, leading to higher-density populations in the centers of domestication,[21][24] the expansion of agricultural economies, and the development of urban communities.[21][25]\\r\\nA 2018 domestication study looked at the reasons why the archeological record that is based on the dating of fossil remains often differed from the genetic record contained within the cells of living species. The study concluded that our inability to date domestication is because domestication is a continuum and there is no single point where we can say that a species was clearly domesticated using these two techniques. The study proposes that changes in morphology across time and how humans were interacting with the species in the past needs to be considered in addition to these two techniques.[26]\\r\\nThe domestication of animals is the mutual relationship between animals with the humans who have influence on their care and reproduction.[1] Charles Darwin recognized the small number of traits that made domestic species different from their wild ancestors. He was also the first to recognize the difference between conscious selective breeding in which humans directly select for desirable traits, and unconscious selection where traits evolve as a by-product of natural selection or from selection on other traits.[2][3][4] There is a genetic difference between domestic and wild populations. There is also such a difference between the domestication traits that researchers believe to have been essential at the early stages of domestication, and the improvement traits that have appeared since the split between wild and domestic populations.[5][6][7] Domestication traits are generally fixed within all domesticates, and were selected during the initial episode of domestication of that animal or plant, whereas improvement traits are present only in a proportion of domesticates, though they may be fixed in individual breeds or regional populations.[6][7][8]\\r\\nDomestication should not be confused with taming. Taming is the conditioned behavioral modification of an animal to reduce its natural avoidance of humans, and to accept the presence of humans. Domestication is the permanent genetic modification of a bred lineage that leads to an inherited predisposition towards humans.[28][29][30] Certain animal species, and certain individuals within those species, make better candidates for domestication than others because they exhibit certain behavioral characteristics: (1) the size and organization of their social structure; (2) the availability and the degree of selectivity in their choice of mates; (3) the ease and speed with which the parents bond with their young, and the maturity and mobility of the young at birth; (4) the degree of flexibility in diet and habitat tolerance; and (5) responses to humans and new environments, including flight responses and reactivity to external stimuli.[18]:Fig 1[31][32][33]\\r\\nThe beginnings of animal domestication involved a protracted coevolutionary process with multiple stages along different pathways.[7] It is proposed that there were three major pathways that most animal domesticates followed into domestication: (1) commensals, adapted to a human niche (e.g., dogs, cats, fowl, possibly pigs); (2) prey animals sought for food (e.g., sheep, goats, cattle, water buffalo, yak, pig, reindeer, llama and alpaca); and (3) targeted animals for draft and nonfood resources (e.g., horse, donkey, camel).[7][12][18][34][35][36][37] The dog was the first domesticant,[10][11] and was established across Eurasia before the end of the Late Pleistocene era, well before cultivation and before the domestication of other animals.[10] Humans did not intend to domesticate animals from, or at least they did not envision a domesticated animal resulting from, either the commensal or prey pathways. In both of these cases, humans became entangled with these species as the relationship between them, and the human role in their survival and reproduction, intensified, leading eventually to a formalised animal husbandry.[7] Although the directed pathway proceeded from capture to taming, the other two pathways are not as goal-oriented and archaeological records suggest that they took place over much longer time frames.[13]\\r\\nUnlike other domestic species which were primarily selected for production-related traits, dogs were initially selected for their behaviors.[38][39] The archaeological and genetic data suggest that long-term bidirectional gene flow between wild and domestic stocks ÿ including donkeys, horses, New and Old World camelids, goats, sheep, and pigs ÿ was common.[7][12] One study has concluded that human selection for domestic traits likely counteracted the homogenizing effect of gene flow from wild boars into pigs and created domestication islands in the genome. The same process may also apply to other domesticated animals.[40][41]\\r\\n\\r\\nDomesticated birds principally mean poultry, raised for meat and eggs:[42] some Galliformes (chicken, turkey, guineafowl) and Anseriformes (waterfowl: duck, goose, swan). Also widely domesticated are cagebirds such as songbirds and parrots; these are kept both for pleasure and for use in research.[43] Domestic pigeon is known as a messenger, research suggests it was domesticated as early as 10,000 years ago.[44] Chickens were domesticated at least 7,000 years ago, with fossils in China from c. 5400 BC. The chicken's wild ancestor is Gallus gallus, the red junglefowl of Southeast Asia, and another species, probably the grey junglefowl of India. It appears to have been kept initially for cockfighting rather than for food.[45]\\r\\nTwo insects, the silkworm and the western honey bee, have been domesticated for over 5,000 years, often for commercial use. The silkworm is raised for the silk threads wound around its pupal cocoon; the western honey bee, for honey, and, lately, for pollination of crops.[46]\\r\\nSeveral other invertebrates have been domesticated, both terrestrial and aquatic, including some such as Drosophila melanogaster fruit flies and the freshwater cnidarian Hydra for research into genetics and physiology. Few have a long history of domestication. Most are used for food or other products such as shellac and cochineal. The phyla involved are Cnidaria, Platyhelminthes (for biological control), Annelida, Mollusca, Arthropoda (marine crustaceans as well as insects and spiders), and Echinodermata. While many marine molluscs are used for food, only a few have been domesticated, including squid, cuttlefish and octopus, all used in research on behaviour and neurology. Terrestrial snails in the genera Helix and Murex are raised for food. Several parasitic or parasitoidal insects including the fly Eucelatoria, the beetle Chrysolina, and the wasp Aphytis are raised for biological control. Conscious or unconscious artificial selection has many effects on species under domestication; variability can readily be lost by inbreeding, selection against undesired traits, or genetic drift, while in Drosophila, variability in eclosion time (when adults emerge) has increased.[47]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe initial domestication of animals impacted most on the genes that controlled their behavior, but the initial domestication of plants impacted most on the genes that controlled their morphology (seed size, plant architecture, dispersal mechanisms) and their physiology (timing of germination or ripening).[18][23]\\r\\nThe domestication of wheat provides an example. Wild wheat shatters and falls to the ground to reseed itself when ripe, but domesticated wheat stays on the stem for easier harvesting. This change was possible because of a random mutation in the wild populations at the beginning of wheat's cultivation. Wheat with this mutation was harvested more frequently and became the seed for the next crop. Therefore, without realizing, early farmers selected for this mutation. The result is domesticated wheat, which relies on farmers for its reproduction and dissemination.[48]\\r\\nThe earliest human attempts at plant domestication occurred in the Middle East. There is early evidence for conscious cultivation and trait selection of plants by pre-Neolithic groups in Syria: grains of rye with domestic traits have been recovered from Epi-Palaeolithic (c. 11,050 BCE) contexts at Abu Hureyra in Syria,[49] but this appears to be a localised phenomenon resulting from cultivation of stands of wild rye, rather than a definitive step towards domestication.[49]\\r\\nBy 10,000 BCE the bottle gourd (Lagenaria siceraria) plant, used as a container before the advent of ceramic technology, appears to have been domesticated. The domesticated bottle gourd reached the Americas from Asia by 8000 BCE, most likely due to the migration of peoples from Asia to America.[50]\\r\\nCereal crops were first domesticated around 9000 BCE in the Fertile Crescent in the Middle East. The first domesticated crops were generally annuals with large seeds or fruits. These included pulses such as peas and grains such as wheat. The Middle East was especially suited to these species; the dry-summer climate was conducive to the evolution of large-seeded annual plants, and the variety of elevations led to a great variety of species. As domestication took place humans began to move from a hunter-gatherer society to a settled agricultural society. This change would eventually lead, some 4000 to 5000 years later, to the first city states and eventually the rise of civilization itself.\\r\\nContinued domestication was gradual, a process of intermittent trial and error. Over time perennials and small trees including the apple and the olive were domesticated. Some plants, such as the macadamia nut and the pecan, were not domesticated until recently.\\r\\nIn other parts of the world very different species were domesticated. In the Americas squash, maize, beans, and perhaps manioc (also known as cassava) formed the core of the diet. In East Asia millet, rice, and soy were the most important crops. Some areas of the world such as Southern Africa, Australia, California and southern South America never saw local species domesticated.\\r\\nDomesticated plants may differ from their wild relatives in many ways, including\\r\\nedible part larger, and easier separated from non-edible part (e.g. freestone fruit).\\r\\nThere are many challenges facing modern farmers, including climate change, pests, soil salinity, drought, and periods with limited sunlight.[52]\\r\\nDrought is one of the most serious challenges facing farmers today. With shifting climates comes shifting weather patterns, meaning that regions that could traditionally rely on a substantial amount of precipitation were, quite literally, left out to dry. In light of these conditions, drought resistance in major crop plants has become a clear priority.[53] One method is to identify the genetic basis of drought resistance in naturally drought resistant plants, i.e. the Bambara groundnut. Next, transferring these advantages to otherwise vulnerable crop plants. Rice, which is one of the most vulnerable crops in terms of drought, has been successfully improved by the addition of the Barley hva1 gene into the genome using transgenetics. Drought resistance can also be improved through changes in a plant's root system architecture,[54] such as a root orientation that maximizes water retention and nutrient uptake. There must be a continued focus on the efficient usage of available water on a planet that is expected to have a population in excess of nine-billion people by 2050.\\r\\nAnother specific area of genetic improvement for domesticated crops is the crop plant's uptake and utilization of soil potassium, an essential element for crop plants yield and overall quality. A plant's ability to effectively uptake potassium and utilize it efficiently is known as its potassium utilization efficiency.[55] It has been suggested that first optimizing plant root architecture and then root potassium uptake activity may effectively improve plant potassium utilization efficiency.\\r\\nCereals, rice, wheat, corn, and barley, make up a huge amount of the global diet across all demographic and social scales. These cereal crop plants are all autogamous, i.e. self- fertilizing, which limits overall diversity in allelic combinations, and therefore adaptability to novel environments.[56] To combat this issue the researchers suggest an \\"Island Model of Genomic Selection\\". By breaking a single large population of cereal crop plants into several smaller sub-populations which can receive \\"migrants\\" from the other subpopulations, new genetic combinations can be generated.\\r\\nThe Bambara groundnut is a durable crop plant that, like many underutilized crops, has received little attention in an agricultural sense. The Bambara Groundnut is drought resistant and is known to be able to grow in almost any soil conditions, no matter how impoverished an area may be. New genomic and transcriptomic approaches are allowing researchers to improve this relatively small-scale crop, as well as other large-scale crop plants.[57] The reduction in cost, and wide availability of both microarray technology and Next Generation Sequencing have made it possible to analyze underutilized crops, like the groundnut, at genome-wide level. Not overlooking particular crops that don't appear to hold any value outside of the developing world will be key to not only overall crop improvement, but also to reducing the global dependency on only a few crop plants, which holds many intrinsic dangers to the global population's food supply.[57]\\r\\nThe semi-arid tropics, ranging from parts of North and South Africa,Asia especially in the South Pacific, all the way to Australia are notorious for being both economically destitute and agriculturally difficult to cultivate and farm effectively. Barriers include everything from lack of rainfall and diseases, to economic isolation and environmental irresponsibility.[58] There is a large interest in the continued efforts, of the International Crops Research Institute for the Semi-Arid Tropics (ICRSAT) to improve staple foods. some mandated crops of ICRISAT include the groundnut, pigeonpea, chickpea, sorghum and pearl millet, which are the main staple foods for nearly one billion people in the semi-arid tropics.[59] As part of the ICRISAT efforts, some wild plant breeds are being used to transfer genes to cultivated crops by interspecific hybridization involving modern methods of embryo rescue and tissue culture.[60] One example of early success has been work to combat the very detrimental peanut clump virus. Transgenetic plants containing the coat protein gene for resistance against peanut clump virus have already been produced successfully.[59] Another region threatened by food security are the Pacific Island Countries, which are disproportionally faced with the negative effects of climate change. The Pacific Islands are largely made up of a chain of small bodies of land, which obviously limits the amount of geographical area in which to farm. This leaves the region with only two viable options 1.) increase agricultural production or 2.) increase food importation. The latter of course runs into the issues of availability and economic feasibility, leaving only the first option as a viable means to solve the region's food crisis. It is much easier to misuse the limited resources remaining, as compared with solving the problem at its' core.[61]\\r\\nWork has also has been focusing on improving domestic crops through the use of crop wild relatives.[59] The amount and depth of genetic material available in crop wild relatives is larger than originally believed, and the range of plants involved, both wild and domestic, is ever expanding.[62] Through the use of new biotechnological tools such as genome editing, cisgenesis/intragenesis, the transfer of genes between crossable donor species including hybrids, and other omic approaches.[62]\\r\\nWild plants can be hybridized with crop plants to form perennial crops from annuals, increase yield, growth rate, and resistance to outside pressures like disease and drought.[63] It is important to remember that these changes take significant lengths of time to achieve, sometimes even decades. However, the outcome can be extremly successful as is the case with a hybrid grass variant known as Kernza.[63] Over the course of nearly three decades, work was done on an attempted hybridization between an already domesticated grass strain, and several of its wild relatives. The domesticated strain as was more uniform in its orientation, but the wild strains were larger and propagated faster. The resulting Kernza crop has traits from both progenitors: uniform orientation and a linearly vertical root system from the domesticated crop, along with increased size and rate of propagation from the wild relatives.[63]\\r\\nSeveral species of fungi have been domesticated for use directly as food, or in fermentation to produce foods and drugs. The white button mushroom Agaricus bisporus is widely grown for food.[64] The yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae have been used for thousands of years to ferment beer and wine, and to leaven bread.[65] Mould fungi including Penicillium are used to mature cheeses and other dairy products, as well as to make drugs such as antibiotics.[66]\\r\\nSelection of animals for visible \\"desirable\\" traits may have undesired consequences. Captive and domesticated animals often have smaller size, piebald color, shorter faces with smaller and fewer teeth, diminished horns, weak muscle ridges, and less genetic variability. Poor joint definition, late fusion of the limb bone epiphyses with the diaphyses, hair changes, greater fat accumulation, smaller brains, simplified behavior patterns, extended immaturity, and more pathology are among the defects of domestic animals. All of these changes have been documented by archaeological evidence, and confirmed by animal breeders in the 20th century.[67] In 2014, a study proposed the theory that under selection, docility in mammals and birds results partly from a slowed pace of neural crest development, that would in turn cause a reduced fearÿstartle response due to mild neurocristopathy that causes domestication syndrome. The theory was unable to explain curly tails nor domestication syndrome exhibited by plants.[20]\\r\\nA side effect of domestication has been zoonotic diseases. For example, cattle have given humanity various viral poxes, measles, and tuberculosis; pigs and ducks have given influenza; and horses have given the rhinoviruses. Many parasites have their origins in domestic animals.[3][page?needed] The advent of domestication resulted in denser human populations which provided ripe conditions for pathogens to reproduce, mutate, spread, and eventually find a new host in humans.[citation needed]\\r\\nPaul Shepard writes \\"Man substitutes controlled breeding for natural selection; animals are selected for special traits like milk production or passivity, at the expense of overall fitness and nature-wide relationships...Though domestication broadens the diversity of forms?ÿ that is, increases visible polymorphism?ÿ it undermines the crisp demarcations that separate wild species and cripples our recognition of the species as a group. Knowing only domestic animals dulls our understanding of the way in which unity and discontinuity occur as patterns in nature, and substitutes an attention to individuals and breeds. The wide variety of size, color, shape, and form of domestic horses, for example, blurs the distinction among different species of Equus that once were constant and meaningful.\\"[68]\\r\\nJared Diamond in his book Guns, Germs, and Steel describes the universal tendency for populations that have acquired agriculture and domestic animals to develop a large population and to expand into new territories. He recounts migrations of people armed with domestic crops overtaking, displacing or killing indigenous hunter-gatherers,[3]:p112 whose lifestyle is coming to an end.[3]:p86\\r\\nSome anarcho-primitivist authors describe domestication as the process by which previously nomadic human populations shifted towards a sedentary or settled existence through agriculture and animal husbandry. They claim that this kind of domestication demands a totalitarian relationship with both the land and the plants and animals being domesticated. They say that whereas, in a state of wildness, all life shares and competes for resources, domestication destroys this balance. Domesticated landscape (e.g. pastoral lands/agricultural fields and, to a lesser degree, horticulture and gardening) ends the open sharing of resources; where \\"this was everyone's\\", it is now \\"mine\\". Anarcho-primitivists state that this notion of ownership laid the foundation for social hierarchy as property and power emerged. It also involved the destruction, enslavement, or assimilation of other groups of early people who did not make such a transition.[69]\\r\\nIn 2016, a study found that humans have had a major impact on global genetic diversity as well as extinction rates, including a contribution to megafaunal extinctions. Pristine landscapes no longer exist and have not existed for millennia, and humans have concentrated the planet's biomass into human-favored plants and animals. Domesticated ecosystems provide food, reduce predator and natural dangers, and promote commerce, but have also resulted in habitat loss and extinctions commencing in the Late Pleistocene. Ecologists and other researchers are advised to make better use of the archaeological and paleoecological data available for gaining an understanding the history of human impacts before proposing solutions.[70]","input":"Where were the early centers of crop domestication?"},{"output":"July 1973","context":"From September 1968 until the summer of 1980, English rock band Led Zeppelin were one of the world's most popular live music attractions, performing hundreds of sold-out concerts around the world.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThroughout the late 1960s and 1970s, Led Zeppelin made numerous concert tours of the United States, the United Kingdom and Europe in particular.

It used to spread by word-of-mouth.[2]\\r\\nHowever, though the band made several early tours of the UK, the majority of Led Zeppelin's live concerts were performed in the United States, which was settled on as the primary foundation for their fame and accomplishment.[3] In 1969, for example, all but 33 of the band's 139 shows were performed in the U.S., and between the years 1968 and 1971 they made no fewer than nine tours of North America. \\"It felt like a vacuum and we'd arrived to fill it\\", guitarist Jimmy Page once told journalist Cameron Crowe. \\"It was like a tornado, and it went rolling across the country.\\"[3] After touring almost incessantly during its early years, Led Zeppelin later limited its tour appearances to alternating years: 1973, 1975, 1977 and 1979.[4]\\r\\nFrom the early 1970s, the commercial and popular drawing power of Led Zeppelin was such that the band began to embark on major stadium tours which attracted vast crowds, more than they had previously performed to. During their 1973 tour of the United States, they played to 56,800 fans at Tampa Stadium, Florida, breaking the record set by The Beatles at Shea Stadium in 1965. Similar crowds were drawn on Led Zeppelin's subsequent U.S. tours, and they continued to break attendance records (on April 30, 1977 they played to 76,229 fans at the Pontiac Silverdome, Michigan, a world record attendance for a solo indoor attraction).[5] It is for these reasons that Led Zeppelin, as much as any other band or artist in this era, is credited for helping to establish what has come to be known as stadium rock. Many critics attribute the band's rapid rise as much to their tremendous appeal as a live act as they do to the quality of their studio albums.\\r\\nLed Zeppelin also performed at several music festivals over the years, including the Atlanta International and the Texas International Pop Festivals in 1969, the Bath Festival of Blues in 1969 and the next one in 1970, the \\"Days on the Green\\" in Oakland, California in 1977, and the Knebworth Music Festival in 1979.\\r\\nLed Zeppelin's reputation as a compelling live act is often attributed to the tight understanding and musical chemistry achieved between all four group members, combined with a shared willingness to try new things on-stage, which resulted in dynamic, unpredictable performances. [6] As is noted by Led Zeppelin archivists Dave Lewis and Simon Pallett:\\r\\nLed Zeppelin live was an extraordinary animal. From the very beginning no two performances were alike. Such was the creative spark between the four that the basic structures of their songs were repeatedly reworked, extended and improvised on, making their studio counterparts almost unrecognisable.[7]\\r\\nLed Zeppelin have been described as the kind of group that actually rehearsed on stage, experimenting with the reaction of the audiences to new material and letting the pieces mature through the live experience.[8] Several tracks from their albums were debuted on stage well before their official release on vinyl. Jimmy Page himself has said that most of the band's songs were designed for live performance.[9]\\r\\nEvery show we did was different. You never knew when you went onstage what you might do by the end of it ... Once a song was recorded, and it went into the set, it began to mutate. The whole improvisational aspect, the riffs coming out of the ether ... it was a magical vehicle collectively soaring into the stratosphere. And as more albums came out, the set got longer and longer.[10]\\r\\nIn an interview he gave to Uncut magazine in 2005, Page elaborated:\\r\\nThe beauty of playing in the band was that when we went onstage we never actually knew what was going to go on within the framework of the songs. They were constantly changing. New parts would come out on the night. The spontaneity was on the level of ESP, which meant it was always exciting.[11]\\r\\nAs described by Cameron Crowe, \\"[Led] Zeppelin live was a direct descendant from Elvis' early shows. Raw, direct, a reminder of when rock was young.\\"[12]\\r\\nWith such shared enthusiasm for playing a diverse range of musical styles coupled with their emphasis on extended improvisation, Led Zeppelin's concerts frequently extended for several hours. Recalled Jones:\\r\\nThings got extended a lot to keep ourselves from going mad. Every tour we tried to cut it down, especially in the later years. We'd say we're only going to play an-hour-and-a-half. After a week, it would creep back up to two hours. By the end of the tour it's three hours![2]\\r\\nDuring the 1977 tour of the U.S., Peter Grant's 11-year-old son Warren was physically assaulted by promoter Bill Graham's right-hand man Jim Matzorkis. As a result, from that time onwards, the band refused to allow family members to join them on tour. After their 1977 tour of the U.S.  their last major tour  the band chose to abandon much of the \\"mystical\\" image that surrounded them up to that point. Instead members would wear ordinary street clothes during their concerts and the setlist was toned down by excluding long, elaborate solo numbers like Bonham's \\"Moby Dick\\" and Page's trademark bowed guitar solo accompanied by a laser show.\\r\\nMany of the band's shows have been preserved as Led Zeppelin bootleg recordings, which continue to be prized by collectors and fans. In addition, footage of Led Zeppelin concerts has been released officially on the band's 1973 concert film The Song Remains the Same, and on the Led Zeppelin DVD (2003). However, unlike other artists of the era such as The Who and The Rolling Stones, comparatively little official concert footage exists of Led Zeppelin. This is largely because of the successful efforts of manager Peter Grant to limit the exposure of the band to television appearances, in order to encourage fans who wanted to see the band to attend Led Zeppelin concerts. Of the few professionally shot concerts the band did, (excluding their July 1973 concert at Madison Square Garden on The Song Remains the Same) six are today available to fans through bootlegs. These concerts include the last two nights of their five-concert run at Earls Court Arena in London in May 1975, their show in Seattle's Kingdome in 1977 and their two shows at Knebworth in August 1979. In addition to these, their Royal Albert Hall performance from January 1970 is available.\\r\\nSince Led Zeppelin disbanded following the death of drummer John Bonham in 1980, the three surviving members of the band have reunited publicly on-stage on just a few occasions.","input":"When did led zeppelin play madison square garden?"},{"output":"14.20%","context":"","input":"How much of india's population is muslim?"},{"output":"after the birth","context":"","input":"When does a woman's body produce milk?"},{"output":"the somatic nervous system","context":"The peripheral nervous system (PNS) is one of two components that make up the nervous system of bilateral animals, with the other part being the central nervous system (CNS). The PNS consists of the nerves and ganglia outside the brain and spinal cord.[1]  The main function of the PNS is to connect the CNS to the limbs and organs, essentially serving as a relay between the brain and spinal cord and the rest of the body.[2] Unlike the CNS, the PNS is not protected by the vertebral column and skull, or by the bloodÿbrain barrier, which leaves it exposed to toxins and mechanical injuries. The peripheral nervous system is divided into the somatic nervous system and the autonomic nervous system.  In the somatic nervous system, the cranial nerves are part of the PNS with the exception of  the optic nerve (cranial nerve II), along with the retina. The second cranial nerve is not a true peripheral nerve but a tract of the diencephalon.[3] Cranial nerve ganglia originated in the CNS. However, the remaining ten cranial nerve axons extend beyond the brain and are therefore considered part of the PNS.[4] The autonomic nervous system is an involuntary control of smooth muscle and glands. The connection between CNS and organs allows the system to be in two different functional states: sympathetic and parasympathetic.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe peripheral nervous system is divided into the somatic nervous system, and the autonomic nervous system. The somatic nervous system is under voluntary control, and transmits signals from the brain to end organs such as muscles. The sensory nervous system is part of the somatic nervous system and transmits signals from senses such as taste and touch (including fine touch and gross touch) to the spinal cord and brain. The autonomic nervous system is a 'self-regulating' system which influences the function of organs outside voluntary control, such as the  heart rate, or the functions of the digestive system.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe somatic system includes the sensory nervous system and the somatosensory system and consists of sensory nerves and somatic nerves, and many nerves which hold both functions.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the head and neck, cranial nerves carry somatosensory data. There are twelve cranial nerves, ten of which originate from the brainstem, and mainly control the functions of the anatomic structures of the head with some exceptions. The nuclei of the olfactory nerve and the optic nerves lie in the forebrain and thalamus, respectively, and are thus not considered to be true cranial nerves. One unique cranial nerve is the vagus nerve, which receives sensory information from organs in the thorax and abdomen. The accessory nerve is responsible for innervating the sternocleidomastoid and trapezius muscles, neither of which being exclusively in the head.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor the rest of the body, spinal nerves are responsible for somatosensory information. These arise from the spinal cord. Usually these arise as a web (\\"plexus\\") of interconnected nerves roots that arrange to form single nerves. These nerves control the functions of the rest of the body. In humans, there are 31 pairs of spinal nerves: 8 cervical, 12 thoracic, 5 lumbar, 5 sacral, and 1 coccygeal. These nerve roots are named according to the spinal vertebrata which they are adjacent to. In the cervical region, the spinal nerve roots come out above the corresponding vertebrae (i.e., nerve root between the skull and 1st cervical vertebrae is called spinal nerve C1). From the thoracic region to the coccygeal region, the spinal nerve roots come out below the corresponding vertebrae. It is important to note that this method creates a problem when naming the spinal nerve root between C7 and T1 (so it is called spinal nerve root C8). In the lumbar and sacral region, the spinal nerve roots travel within the dural sac and they travel below the level of L2 as the cauda equina.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe first 4 cervical spinal nerves, C1 through C4, split and recombine to produce a variety of nerves that serve the neck and back of head.\\r\\n\\r\\nSpinal nerve C1 is called the suboccipital nerve, which provides motor innervation to muscles at the base of the skull.\\r\\nC2 and C3 form many of the nerves of the neck, providing both sensory and motor control. These include the greater occipital nerve, which provides sensation to the back of the head, the lesser occipital nerve, which provides sensation to the area behind the ears, the greater auricular nerve and the lesser auricular nerve.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe phrenic nerve is a nerve essential for our survival which arises from nerve roots C3, C4 and C5. It supplies the thoracic diaphragm, enabling breathing. If the spinal cord is transected above C3, then spontaneous breathing is not possible.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe last four cervical spinal nerves, C5 through C8, and the first thoracic spinal nerve, T1, combine to form the brachial plexus, or plexus brachialis, a tangled array of nerves, splitting, combining and recombining, to form the nerves that subserve the upper-limb and upper back. Although the brachial plexus may appear tangled, it is highly organized and predictable, with little variation between people. See brachial plexus injuries.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe anterior divisions of the lumbar nerves, sacral nerves, and coccygeal nerve form the lumbosacral plexus, the first lumbar nerve being frequently joined by a branch from the twelfth thoracic. For descriptive purposes this plexus is usually divided into three parts:\\r\\n\\r\\nThe autonomic nervous system controls involuntary responses to regulate physiological functions.[5] The brain and spinal cord from the central nervous system are connected with organs that have smooth muscle, such as the heart, bladder, and other cardiac, exocrine, and endocrine related organs, by ganglionic neurons.[5] The most notable physiological effects from autonomic activity are pupil constriction and dilation, and salivation of saliva.[5] The autonomic nervous system is always activated, but is either in the sympathetic or parasympathetic state.[5] Depending on the situation, one state can overshadow the other, resulting in a release of different kinds of neurotransmitters.[5] There is a lesser known division of the autonomic nervous system known as the enteric nervous system.[6] Located only around the digestive tract, this system allows for local control without input from the sympathetic or the parasympathetic branches, though it can still receive and respond to signals from the rest of the body.[6] The enteric system is responsible for various functions related to gastrointestinal system.[6]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe sympathetic system is activated during a fight or flight situation in which great mental stress or physical danger is encountered.[5] Neurotransmitters such as norepinephrine, and epinephrine are released,[5] which increases heart rate and blood flow in certain areas like muscle, while simultaneously decreasing activities of non-critical functions for survival, like digestion.[6] The systems are independent to each other, which allows activation of certain parts of the body, while others remain rested.[6]\\r\\n\\r\\nPrimarily using the neurotransmitter acetylcholine (ACh) as a mediator, the parasympathetic system allows the body to function in a rest and digest state.[6] Consequently, when the parasympathetic system dominates the body, there are increases in salivation and activities in digestion, while heart rate and other sympathetic response decrease.[6] Unlike the sympathetic system, humans have some voluntary controls in the parasympathetic system. The most prominent examples of this control are urination and defecation.[6]\\r\\n\\r\\nDiseases of the peripheral nervous system can be specific to one or more nerves, or affect the system as a whole.\\r\\n\\r\\nAny peripheral nerve or nerve root can be damaged, called a mononeuropathy. Such injuries can be because of injury or trauma, or compression. Compression of nerves can occur because of a tumour mass or injury. Alternatively, if a nerve is in an area with a fixed size it may be trapped if the other components increase in size, such as carpal tunnel syndrome and tarsal tunnel syndrome. Common symptoms of carpal tunnel syndrome include pain and numbness in the thumb, index and middle finger. In peripheral neuropathy, the function one or more nerves are damaged through a variety of means. Toxic damage may occur because of diabetes (diabetic neuropathy), alcohol, heavy metals or other toxins; some infections; autoimmune and inflammatory conditions such as amyloidosis and sarcoidosis.[5] Peripheral neuropathy is associated with a sensory loss in a \\"glove and stocking\\" distribution that begins at the peripheral and slowly progresses upwards, and may also be associated with acute and chronic pain. Peripheral neuropathy is not just limited to the somatosensory nerves, but the autonomic nervous system too (autonomic neuropathy).[5]","input":"What two parts make up the peripheral nervous system?"},{"output":"slightly less than 50%","context":"The National Hockey League evolved from a mono-ethnic and primarily Canadian professional athletic league to span North America.[1][2][3][4][5] The distribution of ethnic groups has been gradually changing since the inception of the NHL.[6] The league consists of a variety of players from varying nationalities and diverse backgrounds. Once known as a league riddled with racism and exclusiveness, the NHL has made positive steps toward a more diverse and inclusive institution.[7]\\r\\n\\r\\nAccording to statistics,[8] gathered by www.quanthockey.com, the NHL began its expansion of player nationalities in the 1970s, where players hailed from the United States, Sweden, and Finland. The share of Canadians in the league dropped to 75% by the 1980s and is now slightly less than 50%.[8] In 2011, the NHL was composed of 93 percent of players who identified as white, with the remaining 7 percent identifying as varying ethnicities.[9][needs update]\\r\\n\\r\\nA number of ice hockey leagues for players of African descent formed in Canada as early as the late-19th century. The Coloured Hockey League was an all-black ice hockey league established in 1895. Operating across the Maritime provinces of Canada, the league operated for several decades until 1930. \\r\\n\\r\\nAlthough other ice hockey leagues saw integration in the early 20th century (including the Quebec Senior Hockey League), the NHL did not see its first non-white player until March 13, 1948, when Larry Kwong broke the NHL's colour barrier playing with the New York Rangers.[10] Born in Vernon, British Columbia, Kwong was a Chinese Canadian of Cantonese descent.[11] In 1953, Fred Sasakamoose was the first Cree NHL player, and the first Canadian indigenous player in the NHL, debuting with the Chicago Black Hawks. On January 18, 1958, Willie O'Ree became the first Black Canadian to play in the NHL. Playing with the Boston Bruins, he was also the first NHL player of African-descent.[12]\\r\\n\\r\\nVal James was the first African American player to play in the NHL. James signed his contract with the Buffalo Sabres in 1982.[13] His stint with the Buffalo Sabres and Toronto Maple Leafs were short lived and he eventually retired in 1987 due to injury.[13] He experienced racism as the first player throughout his skating career. He never spoke of racism on the ice until 30 years after his career ended. In his account, he reported he could not watch hockey games for 10 years after leaving the ice without being haunted by the memories of his treatment as a man of color in the NHL.[14] His hostile experiences were and continue to be representative of how institutional racism permeates the culture and socialization of men (and women) sports. A biography of his life in the sport was published under the title Black Ice: The Val James Story written by John Gallagher.[15] The number of black NHL players moved to 26 by the end of the 20th century and sat at 32 in 2016. This is a seemingly minor yet significant change in the racial demographic of the NHL in its hundred-year history.[9]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn addition to black and white players, other races and ethnicities represented in the NHL (in the 2017ÿ18 season) include players of Middle Eastern-descent (including Brandon Saad, Justin Abdelkader, Mika Zibanejad, and Nazem Kadri), players of Latino-descent (including Al Montoya, Auston Matthews, Max Pacioretty, and Raffi Torres), and players of Asian-descent (including Kailer Yamamoto, and Matthew Dumba).","input":"What percentage of nhl hockey players are canadian?"},{"output":"seven","context":"Sukkot (Hebrew: ?????? or ???????, sukkt, commonly translated as Feast of Tabernacles or Feast of the Ingathering, traditional Ashkenazi pronunciation Sukkos or Succos, literally Feast of Booths) is a biblical Jewish holiday celebrated on the 15th day of the seventh month, Tishrei (varies from late September to late October). During the existence of the Jerusalem Temple, it was one of the Three Pilgrimage Festivals (Hebrew: ???? ??????, shalosh regalim) on which the Israelites were commanded to perform a pilgrimage to the Temple.\\r\\nSukkot has a double significance. The one mentioned in the Book of Exodus is agricultural in nature\\"Feast of Ingathering at the year's end\\" (Exodus 34:22)and marks the end of the harvest time and thus of the agricultural year in the Land of Israel. The more elaborate religious significance from the Book of Leviticus is that of commemorating the Exodus and the dependence of the People of Israel on the will of God (Leviticus 23:42-43).\\r\\nThe holiday lasts seven days in Israel and eight in the diaspora. The first day (and second day in the diaspora) is a Shabbat-like holiday when work is forbidden. This is followed by intermediate days called Chol Hamoed, when certain work is permitted. The festival is closed with another Shabbat-like holiday called Shemini Atzeret (one day in Israel, two days in the diaspora, where the second day is called Simchat Torah). Shemini Atzeret coincides with the eighth day of Sukkot outside Israel.\\r\\nThe Hebrew word sukkt is the plural of sukkah, \\"booth\\" or \\"tabernacle\\", which is a walled structure covered with s'chach (plant material such as overgrowth or palm leaves). A sukkah is the name of the temporary dwelling in which farmers would live during harvesting, a fact connecting to the agricultural significance of the holiday stressed by the Book of Exodus. As stated in Leviticus, it is also intended as a reminiscence of the type of fragile dwellings in which the Israelites dwelt during their 40 years of travel in the desert after the Exodus from slavery in Egypt. Throughout the holiday, meals are eaten inside the sukkah and many people sleep there as well.\\r\\nOn each day of the holiday it is mandatory to perform a waving ceremony with the Four Species.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the Book of Leviticus, God told Moses to command the people: \\"On the first day you shall take the product of hadar trees, branches of palm trees, boughs of leafy trees, and willows of the brook\\" (Lev. 23:40), and \\"You shall live in booths seven days; all citizens in Israel shall live in booths, in order that future generations may know that I made the Israelite people live in booths when I brought them out of the land of Egypt\\" (Lev. 23:42ÿ43).\\r\\nThe origins of Sukkot are both historical and agricultural. Historically, Sukkot commemorates the forty-year period during which the children of Israel were wandering in the desert, living in temporary shelters. Agriculturally, Sukkot is a harvest festival and is sometimes referred to as Chag HaAsif (?? ?????, the \\"Festival of Ingathering\\"), as it celebrates the gathering of the harvest.[1][2]\\r\\nSukkot is a seven-day holiday, with the first day celebrated as a full festival with special prayer services and holiday meals. The seventh day of Sukkot is called Hoshana Rabbah (\\"Great Hoshana\\", referring to the tradition that worshippers in the synagogue walk around the perimeter of the sanctuary during morning services) and has a special observance of its own. Outside Israel, the first and last two days are celebrated as full festivals. The intermediate days are known as Chol HaMoed (\\"festival weekdays\\"). According to Halakha, some types of work are forbidden during Chol HaMoed.[3] In Israel many businesses are closed during this time.[4]\\r\\nThroughout the week of Sukkot, meals are eaten in the sukkah. If a brit milah or Bar Mitzvah rises during Sukkot, the seudat mitzvah (obligatory festive meal) is served in the sukkah. Similarly, the father of a newborn boy greets guests to his Friday-night Shalom Zachar in the sukkah. Males awaken there, although the requirement is waived in case of draught. Every day, a blessing is recited over the Lulav and the Etrog.\\r\\nObservance of Sukkot is detailed in the Book of Nehemiah 8:13-18, Zechariah 14:16-19 and Leviticus 23:34-44 in the Bible, the Mishnah (Sukkah 1:1ÿ5:8); the Tosefta (Sukkah 1:1ÿ4:28); and the Jerusalem Talmud (Sukkah 1aÿ) and Babylonian Talmud (Sukkah 2aÿ56b).\\r\\nThe sukkah walls can be constructed of any material (wood, canvas, aluminum siding, sheets). The walls can be free-standing or include the sides of a building or porch. The roof must be of organic material, known as s'chach, such as leafy tree overgrowth, schach mats or palm fronds.[5] It is customary to decorate the interior of the sukkah with hanging decorations of the four species[6] as well as with attractive artwork.\\r\\nPrayers during Sukkot include the reading of the Torah every day, reciting the Mussaf (additional) service after morning prayers, reciting Hallel, and adding special additions to the Amidah and Grace after Meals. In addition, the service includes rituals involving the Four Species. The lulav and etrog are not brought to the synagogue on Shabbat.[7]\\r\\nOn each day of the festival, worshippers walk around the synagogue carrying their Four species while reciting special prayers known as Hoshanot.[7]:852 This takes place either after the morning's Torah reading or at the end of Mussaf. This ceremony commemorates the willow ceremony at the Temple in Jerusalem, in which willow branches were piled beside the altar with worshippers parading around the altar reciting prayers.[8]\\r\\nA custom originating with Lurianic Kabbalah is to recite the ushpizin prayer to \\"invite\\" one of seven \\"exalted guests\\" into the sukkah.[9] These ushpizin (Aramaic ???????? 'guests'), represent the seven shepherds of Israel: Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, Moses, Aaron, Joseph and David. According to tradition, each night a different guest enters the sukkah followed by the other six. Each of the ushpizin has a unique lesson which teaches the parallels of the spiritual focus of the day on which they visit.\\r\\nThe second through seventh days of Sukkot (third through seventh days outside Israel) are called Chol HaMoed (??? ????? - lit. \\"festival weekdays\\"). These days are considered by halakha to be more than regular weekdays but less than festival days. In practice, this means that all activities that are needed for the holidaysuch as buying and preparing food, cleaning the house in honor of the holiday, or traveling to visit other people's sukkot or on family outingsare permitted by Jewish law. Activities that will interfere with relaxation and enjoyment of the holidaysuch as laundering, mending clothes, engaging in labor-intensive activitiesare not permitted.[10][11]\\r\\nReligious Jews often treat Chol HaMoed as a vacation period, eating nicer than usual meals in their sukkah, entertaining guests, visiting other families in their sukkot, and taking family outings. Many synagogues and Jewish centers also offer events and meals in their sukkot during this time to foster community and goodwill.\\r\\nOn the Shabbat which falls during the week of Sukkot (or in the event when the first day of Sukkot is on Shabbat), the Book of Ecclesiastes is read during morning synagogue services in Israel. (Diaspora communities read it the second Shabbat {eighth day} when the first day of sukkot is on Shabbat.) This Book's emphasis on the ephemeralness of life (\\"Vanity of vanities, all is vanity...\\") echoes the theme of the sukkah, while its emphasis on death reflects the time of year in which Sukkot occurs (the \\"autumn\\" of life). The penultimate verse reinforces the message that adherence to God and His Torah is the only worthwhile pursuit. (Cf. Ecclesiastes 12:13,14.)[12]\\r\\nIn the days of the Temple in Jerusalem, all Israelite, and later Jewish men, women, and children on pilgrimage to Jerusalem for the festival would gather in the Temple courtyard on the first day of Chol HaMoed Sukkot to hear the Jewish king read selections from the Torah. This ceremony, which was mandated in Deuteronomy 31:10-13, was held every seven years, in the year following the Shmita (Sabbatical) year. This ceremony was discontinued after the destruction of the Temple, but it has been revived in Israel since 1952 on a smaller scale.[13]\\r\\nDuring the intermediate days of Sukkot, gatherings of music and dance, known as Simchat Beit HaShoeivah (Celebration of the Place of Water-Drawing), take place. This commemorates the drawing of the water for the water-libation on the Altar, an offering unique to Sukkot, when water was carried up the Jerusalem pilgrim road from the Pool of Siloam to the Temple in Jerusalem.[14]\\r\\nThe seventh day of Sukkot is known as Hoshana Rabbah (Great Supplication). This day is marked by a special synagogue service in which seven circuits are made by worshippers holding their Four Species, reciting additional prayers. In addition, a bundle of five willow branches is beaten on the ground.[7]:859?[8]\\r\\nThe holiday immediately following Sukkot is known as Shemini Atzeret (lit. \\"Eighth [Day] of Assembly\\"). Shemini Atzeret is usually viewed as a separate holiday.[15] In the Diaspora a second additional holiday, Simchat Torah (\\"Joy of the Torah\\"), is celebrated. In the Land of Israel, Simchat Torah is celebrated on Shemini Atzeret. On Shemini Atzeret people leave their sukkah and eat their meals inside the house. Outside Israel, many eat in the sukkah without making the blessing. The sukkah is not used on Simchat Torah.[16]\\r\\nAccording to 1 Kings 12:32-33, King Jeroboam, first king of the rebellious northern kingdom, instituted a feast on the fifteenth day of the eighth month in imitation of the feast of Sukkot in Judah, and pilgrims went to Bethel instead of Jerusalem to make thanksgiving offerings. Jeroboam feared that continued pilgrimages from the northern kingdom to Jerusalem could lead to pressure for reunion with Judah:\\r\\nSukkot is celebrated by a number of Christian denominations that observe holidays from the Old Testament. These groups base this on the fact that Jesus celebrated Sukkot (see the Gospel of John 7). The holiday is celebrated according to its Hebrew calendar dates. The first mention of observing the holiday by Christian groups dates to the 17th century, among the sect of the Subbotniks in Russia.[citation needed] In the Orthodox Church, the holiday is said to correspond to the new covenant Feast of the Transfiguration.\\r\\nDe Moor has suggested that there are links between Sukkot and the Ugaritic New Year festival, in particular the Ugaritic custom of erecting two rows of huts built of branches on the temple roof as temporary dwelling houses for their gods.[18][19]\\r\\nSome have pointed out that the original Thanksgiving holiday had many similarities with Sukkot in the Bible.[20][21]","input":"How many days is the feast of tabernacles?"},{"output":"November 30, 1993","context":"The history of the Jacksonville Jaguars, an American football team in the National Football League (NFL), formally dates to November 30, 1993, when the NFL awarded Jacksonville, Florida the expansion franchise that became the Jacksonville Jaguars.[1] The Jaguars, along with the Carolina Panthers, started play in the 1995 NFL season as expansion teams.\\r\\nFor decades, Jacksonville had earned a reputation of being a good football town, hospitable for both college and pro football. Every year the city hosts the Gator Bowl, an annual civic highlight traditionally accompanied by parties, ceremonies, parades and other events leading up to the game. Jacksonville is also host to the FloridaÿGeorgia rivalry, the annual college football rivalry game between the Florida Gators and the Georgia Bulldogs.\\r\\nThe Gator Bowl stadium was built out of steel trusses and was frequently built onto, with the final addition of the reinforced-concrete west upper deck coming in 1982. The stadium hosted short-lived teams in both the World Football League (Jacksonville Sharks/Express), American Football Association (Jacksonville Firebirds, a team that coincidentally used the Jaguars name in its earlier years) and the United States Football League (Jacksonville Bulls) and the occasional NFL exhibition game. The city briefly attempted to lure the Baltimore Colts, whose team owner Robert Irsay famously landed a helicopter in the stadium as thousands of Jacksonville citizens urged him to move the team there. City leaders also attempted to get the Houston Oilers to move to Jacksonville at one point in the late 1980s. (At the time, Oilers owner Bud Adams threatened the relocation of the Oilers out of Houston since the Astrodome was not updated until the Harris County Sports Authority responded with a $67 million improvement.) Great efforts were made to lure the Oilers, including the creation of a \\"Jacksonville Oilers\\" banner and designation of a specific section of the Gator Bowl as a non-alcohol, family section for proposed home games. Though the efforts proved unsuccessful, it did serve as a launching pad for the city's attempt to gain an NFL expansion team.\\r\\nJacksonville had long sought an NFL franchise, and in 1989 an ownership group, Touchdown Jacksonville!, organized. The group initially included future Florida Governor Jeb Bush and Jacksonville developer Tom Petway, and came to be led by shoe magnate Wayne Weaver, founder of Nine West. In 1991, the NFL announced its decision to expand the league by two teams, its first expansion since it added the Seattle Seahawks and the Tampa Bay Buccaneers in the 1976 season. Touchdown Jacksonville! announced its official bid for a team, and Jacksonville was ultimately chosen as one of five finalists, along with Charlotte, North Carolina; St. Louis, Missouri; Baltimore, Maryland; and Memphis, Tennessee. For several reasons Jacksonville was believed to be the least likely candidate. Its metropolitan area and television market were smaller than nearly every city with an NFL team. In addition, its stadium, the Gator Bowl, was outdated and the ownership group struggled to negotiate a lease with the city. In July Touchdown Jacksonville! withdrew its bid after failing to come to terms with the city.[2]\\r\\nHowever, Jacksonville had other assets and a number of strong supporters. It had a very strong football culture, evidenced by the high level of support for the University of Florida Gators and the Florida State University Seminoles, a solid ownership group, and a location in the growing and attractive Southeast region. Supporters included NFL Commissioner Paul Tagliabue, President Neil Austrian, Vice President Roger Goodell, Bud Adams of the Houston Oilers, Rankin Smith of the Atlanta Falcons and Ken Hofmann of the Seattle Seahawks. Encouraged by Tagliabue, Jacksonville interests revisited the issue, and the city agreed to fund $121 million in renovations for the Gator Bowl including sky boxes and club seats. The stadium's 10,000 preferred seats were sold in just ten days, and Jacksonville officially returned to the bidding.[2]\\r\\nCharlotte was awarded the first franchise ÿ the Carolina Panthers ÿ in October 1993. St. Louis was considered the favorite for the second franchise, with Baltimore's three bids also considered strong. A timely release of a newcomer video called Discover the First Coast, produced by Jacksonville native, Jack Burns, helped sway the NFL in Jacksonville's direction. In a surprising move, the NFL owners voted 26-2 in favor of awarding the 30th franchise to Jacksonville.[2] The video was subsequently edited later to include a mention about the NFL.\\r\\nAlong with the Carolina Panthers, the Jacksonville Jaguars entered the NFL as the first expansion teams in almost 20 years. Both teams participated in the 1995 NFL Expansion Draft, with the Jaguars taking Steve Beuerlein with the first pick. Beuerlein quickly lost his starting job to former Green Bay Packer backup Mark Brunell. The Jaguars finished their inaugural season with a record of 4ÿ12. Both the Jaguars and the Panthers (7ÿ9) broke the previous record for most wins by an expansion team (3) set by the Cincinnati Bengals in 1968. The inaugural season featured many of the players who would lead Jacksonville into the playoffs in the team's next four seasons, including quarterback Mark Brunell (acquired in a draft day trade from Green Bay), offensive lineman Tony Boselli (drafted with the 2nd pick overall in the 1995 NFL Draft) running back James Stewart (also drafted in 1995), and wide receiver Jimmy Smith (signed as a free agent).\\r\\nThe team played its first regular season game at home before a crowd of 72,363[3] on September 3, 1995, a 10ÿ3 loss against the Houston Oilers. The team picked up its first win in Week 4 as the Jaguars defeated the Oilers 17ÿ16 on October 1 in Houston. The next week against the Pittsburgh Steelers, the Jaguars earned their first home win by defeating the eventual AFC Champions 20ÿ16. The team's other two wins came in a season sweep of the Cleveland Browns including a Week 17 24ÿ21 victory sealed by a Mike Hollis 34-yard field goal[4] in the Browns' final game before the team relocated to Baltimore and was renamed the Ravens.\\r\\nJacksonville's 1996 season was a marked success as they won six of their last seven games of the season and finished with a record of 9ÿ7. Quarterback Mark Brunell threw for over 4,000 yards and wide receivers Keenan McCardell and Jimmy Smith each accumulated over 1,000 receiving yards. In the team's final game of the regular season against the Atlanta Falcons, needing a win to earn a playoff berth, the Jaguars caught a bit of luck when Morten Andersen, one of the most accomplished kickers in NFL history, missed a 30-yard field goal with less than a minute remaining that would have given the Falcons the lead.[5] The Jaguars clinched the fifth seed in the AFC playoffs.\\r\\nThe Jaguars visited the Buffalo Bills in their first playoff game in franchise history. Despite being a heavy underdog, the Jaguars won 30ÿ27, and knocked Buffalo quarterback Jim Kelly out of what would turn out to be the last game of his career. Their next game was on the road against the Denver Broncos, who had earned the AFC's top seed with a 13ÿ3 record and were widely regarded as the best team in the AFC, if not the NFL. While the Broncos scored two touchdowns early in the game, after the first quarter, the Jaguars largely dominated. In what is often regarded as one of the three biggest upsets in NFL playoff history,[6][7][8] the Jaguars defeated the Broncos by the same score as the previous week against the Bills, 30-27. Upon their return home, the Jags were greeted by an estimated 40,000 fans at the stadium. Many of these fans had watched the game on the stadium JumboTron displays and had stayed into the early hours of the morning when the team arrived. In the AFC Championship Game, the Jaguars miracle season came to an end, as they lost 20ÿ6 to the New England Patriots, in Foxboro. Their fellow second-year NFC expansion team, the Carolina Panthers, also got to their conference championship game, where they lost 30ÿ13 to the eventual Super Bowl champion Green Bay Packers.[citation needed]\\r\\nIn 1997, the franchise's third season, the Jaguars and the Steelers both finished the season with an 11ÿ5 record, tops in the AFC Central Division. Pittsburgh won the division in a tiebreaker as a result of having higher net in division games than Jacksonville.[9] As a result, the Jaguars settled for 2nd place in the division, a Wild Card berth and, for the second straight year, the 5th seed in the AFC playoffs. The Jags postseason would end quickly as they fell in their first game, a 42ÿ17 defeat against the eventual Super Bowl champion Denver Broncos at Mile High Stadium. The Broncos, led by Terrell Davis, ran at will against the Jaguars, rushing for 5 touchdowns and over 300 yards.[10]\\r\\nIn 1998, the Jaguars again finished 11ÿ5 and won their first AFC Central Division title. The team became the first NFL expansion team to make the playoffs three times in its first four seasons of play. In the Wild Card Round, the Jaguars hosted their first home playoff game, a 25ÿ10 win over the New England Patriots. The team's season ended the next week in the Divisional Round as the New York Jets defeated the Jaguars 34ÿ24.[citation needed]\\r\\nIn 1999, the Jaguars compiled a league best 14ÿ2 regular season record, the best record in franchise history. The team's two losses were to the Tennessee Titans. The Jaguars won the AFC Central Division for the second straight year and clinched the #1 seed in the AFC. The Jaguars hosted the Miami Dolphins in the AFC Divisional playoffs, a 62ÿ7 victory in what would be Dan Marino and Jimmy Johnson's last NFL game. Jacksonville's 62 points and 55-point margin are the second most ever in NFL playoff history, and Fred Taylor's 90-yard run in the first quarter is the longest ever in an NFL playoff game.[11]\\r\\nThe Jaguars' bid for a Super Bowl title came to an end the next week in the AFC championship game. The Jags fell at home to the Titans 33ÿ14 in a game that the Jaguars led 14ÿ10 at halftime, before allowing 23 unanswered points in the 2nd half. The Jaguars finished the 1999 season 15ÿ3, with all three of their losses coming against the Titans. The loss marked the end of an era that saw the Jaguars make the playoffs in four of the team's first five years and would be the team's last playoff appearance until the 2005 season.[citation needed], with all three of their losses coming against the Titans. (Not surprisingly, this was the only time in NFL history that a 3-loss team met all of its losses at the hands of only one team.)\\r\\nThe Jaguars struggled during this period, due in part to salary cap problems.[12] In the 2000 season, veteran quarterback Mark Brunell and young running back Fred Taylor led the squad through a painful 7ÿ9 season. The Jaguars finished with records of 6ÿ10 in both the 2001 and 2002 seasons.\\r\\nAfter the 2002 season, head coach Tom Coughlin was fired after eight seasons, leading the Jaguars to a total record of 68ÿ60 and four trips to the playoffs. The 2002 season also marked the last full season for Jaguars quarterback Mark Brunell, who was benched in the third game of 2003 in favor of Byron Leftwich. Brunell piled up over 25,000 yards as a Jaguar and earned three trips to the Pro Bowl. In 2002 the NFL split up the two conferences into four divisions, sending the Jacksonville Jaguars to the AFC South. This put them in the same division as the Indianapolis Colts, Tennessee Titans, and the expansion Houston Texans.[citation needed]\\r\\nIn 2003, the Jaguars hired Jack Del Rio as head coach. Del Rio was a linebacker during the late 80s and early 90s before retiring. He was formerly the Carolina Panthers' defensive coordinator, bringing the team's defensive ranking from 30th to second. Prior to that, Del Rio was the Baltimore Ravens linebackers coach, participating in that capacity on the Ravens' record setting championship 2000 defense. The Jaguars selected quarterback Byron Leftwich with the seventh pick of the NFL draft. The Jaguars had high hopes for their new quarterback. The team had many failures and heartbreaking moments, ending the 2003 season at 5ÿ11 and missing the playoffs for the fourth consecutive season. Despite resolving their salary cap problems, the team's rebuilding was clearly taking longer than expected.\\r\\nThe 2004 season, the tenth season of the Jaguars franchise, resulted in a 9ÿ7 record, their first winning season since 1999, with road victories against the Green Bay Packers at Lambeau Field and the Indianapolis Colts at the RCA Dome. The Jaguars' defense was a strong suit, as it included two Pro Bowl players, defensive tackles Marcus Stroud and John Henderson. Byron Leftwich enjoyed a solid year in 2004, helped by strong performances from holdovers Fred Taylor and Jimmy Smith. Unfortunately, Taylor sustained a season-ending injury at Green Bay. The very next week the Jaguars fell to the Houston Texans, which would ultimately eliminate them from playoff contention. This denied them an opportunity to play the Super Bowl at their home stadium. In 2004, the Jaguars became the first[citation needed] NFL team to have three African-American quarterbacks on their roster. The quarterbacks were Byron Leftwich, David Garrard, and Quinn Gray.\\r\\nThe 2005 Jaguars' hoped to challenge the Colts for the division title. However, due to their 13-0 start, including two victories against the Jaguars, the Colts were able to easily clinch the AFC South title. With a 12ÿ4 record (second best finish in team history), the Jaguars easily qualified for one of the conference's two wild card playoff allocations. Among these 12 wins were a 23-20 victory over the Cincinnati Bengals on October 9, 2005 and a 23-17 overtime victory over the Pittsburgh Steelers on October 16, 2005. While the Jaguars managed to win key games in 2005, 9 of their final 10 games were played against opponents with losing records. Though these games were wins, key players Byron Leftwich, Mike Peterson, Paul Spicer, and Rashean Mathis were hurt during this stretch. The Jaguars ended the season losing 28-3 to the two-time defending champion New England Patriots on January 7, 2006 in the 2005 season's AFC wild card playoff round.\\r\\nJacksonville looked like a team on the rise coming off of their 12ÿ4 season, and was considered a playoff contender entering the season. But injuries plagued the team. Reggie Hayward, Greg Jones, Donovin Darius, Byron Leftwich, and Mike Peterson all suffered season-ending injuries. Marcus Stroud, Matt Jones, Paul Spicer, and Fred Taylor also faced injuries during the season. The team started off 2ÿ0, defeating the Dallas Cowboys (earning the NFL's highest winning percentage on opening days at .750 with a record of 9ÿ3), and shutting out the defending champs Pittsburgh Steelers. But the team lost its next two games, and suffered embarrassing losses to the Houston Texans over the course of the season (Jacksonville has struggled against the Texans since Houston entered the league in 2002). They missed the playoffs with an 8ÿ8 record, but there were some positives, in particular an impressive rookie season by their second-round draft pick, running back Maurice Jones-Drew.[citation needed]\\r\\nOn April 28, 2007, the Jaguars used their first-round pick (21st overall) to select Florida safety Reggie Nelson. On June 15, 2007, the Jaguars released longtime strong safety Donovin Darius, who had seen diminished playing time in recent years due to mounting injuries. On August 31, 2007, the Jaguars announced that long time back-up quarterback David Garrard would start for the team, ahead of former 1st round draft pick, Byron Leftwich who was released in the team's final roster cuts. Garrard led the Jaguars to an 11ÿ5 record and the playoffs. On January 5, 2008, the Jaguars defeated the Pittsburgh Steelers 31ÿ29 to win their first playoff game in almost 8 years and their first road playoff win since 1997. It was also the first time in the 50+ year history of the Steelers that they had been beaten twice at home by the same team in the same season. However, in the divisional round, the Jaguars fell to the as of then undefeated New England Patriots; the teams were tied at halftime, but the Patriots pulled ahead and won 31ÿ20. Tom Brady completed 22 of 24 passes in this game, being pressured by the Jaguars' defense only once, on the first play. This game, more than any other, gave the Jaguars' front office a strong desire to upgrade the pass rush during the offseason.\\r\\nThe team's offense in 2007 was largely a run-first offense, with Maurice Jones-Drew and Fred Taylor each putting up a lot of yards. David Garrard, however showed to be an accurate passer in 2007, throwing only 3 interceptions.\\r\\nThe 2008 season began with high expectations for the Jaguars. The team acquired free agent wide receiver Jerry Porter and rookie defensive ends Quentin Groves of Auburn and Derrick Harvey of Florida to address the team's most glaring needs. (Porter was released the following year and Groves was traded to Oakland in 2010.) Journalists including ESPN.com's Kevin Seifert predicted the Jaguars were poised to make a Super Bowl run.[13]\\r\\nHowever, the Jaguars failed to live up to those expectations, struggling to a 5ÿ11 finish, the franchise's worst record since 2003. The team's struggles were in part, the result of a rash of injuries to the team's offensive line. The Jaguars lost starting guards Vince Manuwai and Maurice Williams for the season within the first quarter of the opening game. Tackle Richard Collier's career ended in early September when he was brutally attacked and shot 14 times.[14] Center Brad Meester missed the first two months of the season and guard Chris Naeole, signed to the roster mid-season in response to these injuries, was injured in pregame warmups before playing a single snap. The 2008 season marked the end of running back Fred Taylor's eleven-year career as a Jaguar. Taylor, who is considered to be one of the greatest Jaguars in the history of the franchise, rushed for over 10,000 yards during his tenure with Jacksonville and earned one trip to the Pro Bowl. In 2009, he signed with the New England Patriots. Taylor's departure opened up the door for Maurice Jones-Drew to become the team's feature running back. In 2011, Taylor signed a one-day contract so he could retire as a Jaguar.[15]\\r\\nThe Jaguars hoped to begin a new era in 2009 under their first-ever general manager, Gene Smith. Smith made his mark early on in the 2009 NFL Draft by acquiring talent such as Eugene Monroe, Terrance Knighton, Derek Cox, Eben Britton and Mike Thomas, who all made significant contributions in their rookie years. The Jaguars finished off this season 7ÿ9 and did not manage to make the playoffs. In the offseason, the Jaguars parted ways with veteran players John Henderson and Reggie Hayward as part of the team's \\"youth movement\\".\\r\\nHowever, 2009 also saw the team's attendance numbers plummet, leading to television blackouts and speculation that the team could eventually be moved or sold.[16] 2009 marked a low point, with the team's attendance averaging around 50,000,[17] causing seven of the eight home games to be blacked out, and leading NFL commissioner Roger Goodell to address the issue with owner Wayne Weaver.[16][18] Jacksonville is one of the league's smallest markets, though its stadium is relatively large; since 2005 the team has covered nearly 10,000 of the stadium's 73,000 total seats with tarp in order to lower the stadium's official capacity to a more typical size and reduce blackouts.[19] 73,000 total seats still ranks as one of the largest in the NFL. From 2008 the team further suffered from the late-2000s recession, which hit Florida particularly hard, and structural changes within the NFL that disadvantage teams in smaller markets.[16]\\r\\nIn 2010, to address this issue, the team and the City of Jacksonville undertook several measures aimed at ensuring the franchise's continued viability in Jacksonville. Supporters began the \\"Team Teal\\" drive to drum up ticket sales.[20][21] The city negotiated a five-year, $16.6 million naming rights deal with Jacksonville-based EverBank to rename the stadium EverBank Field.[16][22] As a result, the Jaguars' attendance increased dramatically in 2010. While attendance figures were stagnant for most of the NFL, Jacksonville saw an increase of 36.5%, by far the highest in the league, and had none of their home games blacked out.[23][24]\\r\\nThe 2010 season proved a big year for the Jaguars on the field as well. Running back Maurice Jones-Drew emerged as second in the league in rushing yards and David Garrard threw for 23 touchdowns, a franchise record. Marcedes Lewis went to his first pro bowl and the Jags had one of the best young defensive tackle duo with Terrance Knighton and rookie Tyson Alualu.[25] Heading into December, Jacksonville was at the top of the AFC South and in playoff contention. In Week 15, they lost to Indianapolis, 34ÿ24, which placed the Colts back atop the AFC South. The Jaguars lost their last two games, placing themselves out of playoff contention. They finished the season 8ÿ8.\\r\\nIn the 2011 NFL draft, the Jaguars traded a first and a second round pick in order to move up to the 10th pick and select Missouri quarterback Blaine Gabbert.[26]\\r\\nOn September 6, 2011, quarterback David Garrard was cut from the team just days before the start of the season; Luke McCown was named starter. The move was similar to the one that named Garrard himself the starter over Byron Leftwich in 2007. McCown started two games until he threw four interceptions in a lopsided loss to the New York Jets and Blaine Gabbert was named the starter the following week. The Jaguars offense would continue to struggle under the rookie quarterback, losing the next 4 games in a row, until an upset victory over the Baltimore Ravens at home on Monday Night Football.\\r\\nOn November 29, 2011, owner Wayne Weaver announced the firing of head coach Jack Del Rio, whose record had been 3ÿ8 through the first 12 weeks of the season and 68ÿ71 over his nine-year tenure. Del Rio was succeeded by defensive coordinator Mel Tucker on an interim basis. Weaver also announced that General Manager Gene Smith had been given a three-year extension of his contract.\\r\\nImmediately following the announcement of Del Rio being fired, Weaver also announced that the team would be sold to Illinois businessman Shahid Khan.[27][28] Khan's assumption of ownership was approved a couple of weeks later by the NFL owners, and Khan took over full ownership on January 4, 2012. He immediately began the team's search for head coaching candidates.[29]\\r\\nOn February 13, 2012, the Jaguars hired MetLife Stadium president and CEO Mark Lamping as team president. Lamping also spent 13 years as the president of the St. Louis Cardinals. Lamping is the second team president in franchise history and the first since 1997, when David Seldin left that position.[30]\\r\\nOn January 10, 2012, former Atlanta Falcons offensive coordinator Mike Mularkey was named head coach of the Jaguars. On January 13, it was announced that interim head coach Mel Tucker would remain on the staff as defensive coordinator/assistant head coach and that former Falcons quarterbacks coach Bob Bratkowski would become offensive coordinator.[31] On January 20, 2012, the team hired John Bonamego as special teams coordinator.\\r\\nThe Jaguars began the 2012 season with a new coaching staff and a new owner. One of the main priorities of the new leadership was to improve the team's struggling receiving corps and see improvement from quarterback Blaine Gabbert after a disappointing rookie season. To do this, the team selected wide receiver Justin Blackmon in the first round of the 2012 NFL Draft and acquired Laurent Robinson in free agency. Despite the changes, the team struggled mightily on both sides of the ball. The team finished with a 2ÿ14 record, the worst in franchise history. Both general manager Gene Smith and head coach Mike Mularkey were fired shortly after the end of the season.[32]\\r\\nOn August 21, 2012, the Jaguars announced they had finalized a deal to play one regular season home game each year between 2013 and 2016 at London's historic Wembley Stadium as part of the NFL International Series.[33] The first of these games was against the San Francisco 49ers on October 27, 2013.[34][35]\\r\\nOn January 8, 2013, former Atlanta Falcons Director of Player Personnel David Caldwell was hired as the second full-time General Manager in Jaguars history.[36] He formerly served as a scout for the Indianapolis Colts for 10 years from 1998ÿ2007. His first task with the team was to lead the interview process for a new head coach. Nine days later former Seattle Seahawks defensive coordinator Gus Bradley was named head coach of the Jaguars.[37] The Jaguars struggled early on in 2013 and went into the bye week with an 0ÿ8 record. On November 1 Justin Blackmon was suspended indefinitely after violating the NFL's Policy and Program for Substances of Abuse.[38] Despite the loss of Blackmon the Jaguars got their first win with Gus Bradley on November 10 with a 29ÿ27 victory over the Tennessee Titans. This was followed by a respectable showing against the Arizona Cardinals, despite a 27-14 loss, and the Jaguars' second and third victory of the season against the Houston Texans and the Cleveland Browns. The Jaguars would win again the very next week against the Houston Texans 27-20 on Thursday night, improving to 4-9.\\r\\nAfter finishing the 2013 season with a 4-12 record, a two-win improvement over the previous season, the Jaguars traded their 2011 NFL draft first round draft pick Blaine Gabbert to the San Francisco 49ers for the 6th round pick of the 2014 NFL draft.[39] Maurice Jones-Drew, after 7 years with the Jaguars, also left the team and signed a three-year contract with the Oakland Raiders.[40]\\r\\nIn the first round of the 2014 NFL draft the Jaguars selected quarterback Blake Bortles from University of Central Florida and then wide receiver Marqise Lee from University of Southern California in the second round. The new draft picks helped put more confidence in the struggling team.[41] Justin Blackmon was suspended yet again for violating the NFL's Policy and Program for Substances of Abuse in July.[42] Later in July, EverBank Field unveiled their two new endzone scoreboards, which are considered to be the world's largest.[43] The Jaguars managed to end their season with a 3-13 record.[44]\\r\\nBuffalo Bills\\r\\nMiami Dolphins\\r\\nNew England Patriots\\r\\nNew York Jets\\r\\nBaltimore Ravens\\r\\nCincinnati Bengals\\r\\nCleveland Browns\\r\\nPittsburgh Steelers\\r\\nHouston Texans\\r\\nIndianapolis Colts\\r\\nJacksonville Jaguars\\r\\nTennessee Titans\\r\\nDenver Broncos\\r\\nKansas City Chiefs\\r\\nLos Angeles Chargers\\r\\nOakland Raiders\\r\\nDallas Cowboys\\r\\nNew York Giants\\r\\nPhiladelphia Eagles\\r\\nWashington Redskins\\r\\nChicago Bears\\r\\nDetroit Lions\\r\\nGreen Bay Packers\\r\\nMinnesota Vikings\\r\\nAtlanta Falcons\\r\\nCarolina Panthers\\r\\nNew Orleans Saints\\r\\nTampa Bay Buccaneers\\r\\nArizona Cardinals\\r\\nLos Angeles Rams\\r\\nSan Francisco 49ers\\r\\nSeattle Seahawks","input":"When did the jacksonville jaguars become an nfl team?"},{"output":"Super Bowl XXXIV","context":"Super Bowl XXXIV was an American football game between the National Football Conference (NFC) champion St. Louis Rams (now the Los Angeles Rams) and the American Football Conference (AFC) champion Tennessee Titans to decide the National Football League (NFL) champion for the 1999 season. The Rams defeated the Titans by the score of 23ÿ16, capturing their first Super Bowl win and first NFL championship since 1951.[5] The game, played on January 30, 2000 at the Georgia Dome in Atlanta, was the fourth Super Bowl to be held a week after the conference championship games (the previous time this happened was Super Bowl XXVIII, and coincidentally that game was also played on January 30 at the Georgia Dome in Atlanta).[6]\\r\\nThe Rams entered their second Super Bowl in team history with an NFC-best 13ÿ3 regular season record. It was the franchise's first playoff appearance since 1989, when they were still in Los Angeles. The Titans, who were originally the Houston Oilers, also finished the regular season with a 13ÿ3 record, but advanced to their first Super Bowl in team history after entering the playoffs as a wild-card team. Tennessee finished in second place in the AFC Central division behind the 14ÿ2 Jacksonville Jaguars.[7]\\r\\nThe first two quarters of Super Bowl XXXIV were largely a defensive battle. Despite outgaining the Titans in total offensive yards in the first half, 294ÿ89,[8] the Rams held only a 9ÿ0 halftime lead on three field goals. St. Louis later scored their first touchdown midway through the 3rd quarter to go up 16ÿ0. Tennessee then responded by scoring 16 consecutive points to tie the game with 2:12 left in regulation. This was the largest deficit to be erased in a Super Bowl and the first deficit that was greater than 10 points. On the Rams' ensuing drive, quarterback Kurt Warner completed a 73-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver Isaac Bruce to regain the lead. The Titans then drove to the St. Louis 10-yard line with six seconds remaining, but on the final play of the game, Rams linebacker Mike Jones tackled Tennessee wide receiver Kevin Dyson one yard short of the goal line to prevent a potential game-tying touchdown. This play went into NFL lore as One Yard Short, or simply The Tackle.[9] Warner was then named Super Bowl MVP, becoming the sixth player to win both that award and the NFL MVP during the same season.[10][11] At the time, his 414 passing yards and 45 pass attempts without an interception broke Super Bowl records.[12][13][14]\\r\\nThis game is often referred to as the \\"Dot-com Super Bowl\\" due to the large amount of advertisements purchased by dot-com companies.[15][16] This game was later featured as one of NFL's Greatest Games as The Longest Yard.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nNFL owners awarded Super Bowl XXXIV to Atlanta during their October 31, 1996 meeting held in New Orleans. Other cities under consideration were Miami, Tampa, and Los Angeles. Owners initially planned on selecting only two hosts (XXXIII and XXXIV), but decided to name three after strong showings by the respective delegations. Miami, Atlanta, and Tampa were selected to host XXXIII, XXXIV, and XXXV, respectively.[17][18]\\r\\nThe Rams entered 1999 having been among the league's stragglers for a decade. The reasons are many, including, some suggest, mismanagement by executive John Shaw. The franchise moved to a taxpayer-funded stadium in St. Louis, Missouri for the 1995 season but continued to struggle. In 1997, the team hired Dick Vermeil as their head coach, bringing him back to the NFL after 15 years of retirement. Vermeil had previously turned the Philadelphia Eagles from one of the worst teams in the league into a Super Bowl team in 1980, but his first two seasons in St. Louis were hardly stellar, winning just 5 games in 1997 and 4 in 1998.\\r\\nLittle was expected of the Rams for 1999. Indeed, ESPN The Magazine's 1999 NFL preview predicted the Rams would be the worst team in the NFL; worse even than the Cleveland Browns, who had returned as an expansion team that year.\\r\\nThe Rams proceeded to shock the NFL with an NFC-best 13ÿ3 regular season record and outscored their opponents 526ÿ242, the highest scoring margin (284) of any Super Bowl champion. This was the Rams' first playoff appearance since 1989 and only the second Super Bowl appearance in team history.[19] St. Louis was led by undrafted quarterback Kurt Warner, who started the season as a backup to Trent Green. Green suffered a season-ending knee injury in the preseason, making Warner the team's new starter. Warner previously played for the Iowa Barnstormers of the Arena Football League and the Amsterdam Admirals of NFL Europe.[20]\\r\\nIn his first NFL season in 1998, Warner played only one game and threw just 11 passes. But in 1999, he experienced one of the most spectacular seasons ever by a quarterback, recording a passer rating of 109.2, completing 65.1 percent of his passes for 4,353 yards, 41 touchdowns, and just 13 interceptions, and earning the NFL Most Valuable Player Award. Warner was not the only Rams player compiling significant statistics, though. Running back Marshall Faulk, in his first year in St. Louis after spending five seasons with the Indianapolis Colts, won the NFL Offensive Player of the Year Award. He scored 12 touchdowns, rushed for 1,381 yards, and recorded a team-leading 87 receptions for 1,048 yards. In all, Faulk gained a record 2,429 total yards and became just the second running back in NFL history to gain over 1,000 yards rushing and receiving in the same season (Roger Craig was the first to do it, in 1985).[21] Faulk held the NFL record for yards from scrimmage in a single season until Tennessee's Chris Johnson broke it in 2009.\\r\\nFaulk wasnt the only weapon at Warner's disposal in 1999. Veteran receiver Isaac Bruce was the top Rams receiver with 77 receptions for 1,165 yards and 12 touchdowns. while breakout rookie wide receiver Torry Holt recorded 52 receptions, 788 yards, and 6 touchdowns. Even the team's third wide receiver, Az-Zahir Hakim, was a big contributor by catching 36 passes for 677 yards and 8 touchdowns, while also returning punts for 461 yards and another touchdown. The Rams' offensive line was led by Pro Bowlers Orlando Pace and Adam Timmerman. Timmerman, acquired by the Rams in 1999, had previously won Super Bowl XXXI with the Green Bay Packers. On special teams, receiver Tony Horne returned 30 kickoffs for 892 yards and 2 touchdowns, giving him an NFL-leading 29.7 yards per return average.[22]\\r\\nOverall, St. Louis' offense led the league in total yards gained (6,639), scoring (526 points), and passing touchdowns (42).\\r\\nThe Rams' defense led the league in fewest rushing yards allowed (1,189) and fewest rushing touchdowns allowed (4), while giving up just 242 points. Overall, the defense ranked 4th in the league in fewest total yards allowed (5,056).[21] The line was anchored by Pro Bowl defensive end Kevin Carter and defensive end Grant Wistrom. Carter led the league with 17 sacks, while Wistrom recorded 8.5 sacks and 2 interceptions, returning both for touchdowns and a combined total of 131 yards. Behind them, the Rams had three linebackers: London Fletcher (66 tackles and 3 sacks), Mike Jones (4 interceptions for 96 return yards and 2 touchdowns, and 2 fumble recoveries for 51 return yards and 1 touchdown), and Todd Collins (72 tackles, 1 sack, and 2 interceptions for 16 yards). The secondary was led by Pro Bowler Todd Lyght (6 interceptions), Dexter McCleon (4 interceptions), and rookie Dr Bly (3 interceptions).[23]\\r\\nThe Titans advanced to their first Super Bowl in team history, after originating as a charter member of the American Football League.[24] From 1960 to 1996, the team was owned by Houston, Texas businessman Bud Adams and known as the Houston Oilers. By 1995, however, Adams, like Frontiere, was lured to move his team from Houston, in this case to a new stadium in Nashville, Tennessee. Since this new stadium was not ready until the 1999 season, Adams decided to move his team to Liberty Bowl Memorial Stadium in Memphis, Tennessee in 1997 after playing before small Houston crowds in 1996.\\r\\nThe renamed Tennessee Oilers also played before sparse Memphis crowds, and thus spent the 1998 season playing at Nashville's Vanderbilt Stadium. After the new Adelphia Coliseum (now known as Nissan Stadium) was completed in 1999, the team's name was changed to Tennessee Titans.[25] [26] With Tennessee's Super Bowl appearance, every former AFL team had now played in the Super Bowl, including the original eight AFL teams and two AFL expansion teams: the Miami Dolphins and the Cincinnati Bengals.\\r\\nThe 1999 Titans were led by quarterback Steve McNair and running back Eddie George. McNair had missed five games due to injuries during the season, but he was still able to put up solid numbers, throwing for 2,179 yards and 12 touchdowns with only 8 interceptions. Despite his injury problems, McNair finished the season as the second-leading rusher on the team with 337 yards and scoring 8 touchdowns. George also had an outstanding season, rushing for 1,304 yards, and catching 47 passes for 458 yards (his receptions, receiving yards, and receiving touchdowns were all career highs). In all, George scored a grand total of 13 rushing and receiving touchdowns, and was selected to play in the Pro Bowl for the 3rd consecutive year.[27]\\r\\nAnother contributor on the Titans' offense was fullback Lorenzo Neal, who frequently served as George's lead blocker and was widely considered one of the best blocking backs in the league. The team did not have any outstanding deep threats, but wide receiver Yancey Thigpen recorded 38 receptions for 648 yards, wide receiver Kevin Dyson had 54 receptions for 658 yards, and tight end Frank Wycheck caught 69 passes for 641 yards. Up front, their line was anchored by Pro Bowl tackle Bruce Matthews.[28]\\r\\nTennessee's defense was also extremely effective. Pro Bowl defensive end Jevon Kearse anchored the line, recording 14.5 sacks to go along with 8 forced fumbles and was named the NFL's Defensive Rookie of the Year. The linebacking corps was led by Eddie Robinson, who recorded 64 tackles and 6 sacks. Their secondary was led by cornerback Samari Rolle, who led the team with 4 interceptions.[29]\\r\\nThe Titans finished the regular season with a 13ÿ3 record (including a home win over the Rams), but finished second behind the 14ÿ2 Jacksonville Jaguars in the AFC Central. The Jaguars' only two losses were to the Titans, but Tennessee's three losses forced them to enter the playoffs as a wild-card team.[30]\\r\\nPlaying in his first ever NFL playoff game, Warner threw for 395 yards and 5 touchdowns, with 1 interception, as the Rams defeated the Minnesota Vikings, 49ÿ37, by scoring 35 unanswered points in the second half. Bruce caught 4 passes for 133 yards and a touchdown. Faulk gained 101 combined rushing/receiving yards and scored 2 touchdowns. Although Vikings quarterback Jeff George threw for 423 yards and 4 touchdowns, three of his scores occurred late in the 4th quarter, after the Rams had already put the game away.[31]\\r\\nThe Rams then narrowly defeated the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, 11ÿ6 in a hard-fought defensive struggle in the NFC Championship Game. The first half ended with the Rams leading 5ÿ3 on a Jeff Wilkins field goal and after a bad snap by the Buccaneers went through their own end zone for a safety. Tampa Bay then scored a field goal in the 3rd quarter to take the lead. But Warner threw a 30-yard go-ahead touchdown pass to receiver Ricky Proehl with 4:44 left in the game.[32]\\r\\nMeanwhile, the Titans started out their postseason by narrowly defeating the Buffalo Bills, 22ÿ16 on a famous, trick kickoff return play that became known in NFL lore as the Music City Miracle. Tennessee jumped to a 12ÿ0 halftime lead with an Al Del Greco field goal, a safety by Kearse, and a McNair touchdown run. However, Buffalo came back to take the lead, 13ÿ12 with Antowain Smith's two touchdown runs in the second half (the two-point conversion after Smith's second touchdown failed). In the 4th quarter, the Titans regained the lead after Del Greco kicked his second field goal. With 16 seconds left in the game, Bills kicker Steve Christie made what seemed to be the game-winning 41-yard field goal to give his team the lead, 16ÿ15. However, Neal received the ensuing kickoff and handed the ball off to Wycheck, who then lateraled the ball to Dyson on the other side of the field, who eventually ran 75 yards to the end zone for the game-winning touchdown.[33] The play was reviewed to determine whether Wycheck had lateraled the ball to Dyson or made an illegal forward pass. Referee Phil Luckett upheld the original call on the field of a touchdown, giving Tennessee the win.\\r\\nThe Titans then defeated the Indianapolis Colts 19ÿ16. After both teams exchanged field goals in the first half, George scored on a 68-yard touchdown run to give his team a 13ÿ9 lead. Del Greco then kicked two more field goals in the 4th quarter to put the game away. George finished the game with a franchise playoff record 162 rushing yards and a touchdown, while Del Greco made four field goals.[34]\\r\\nThe Titans then eliminated the Jacksonville Jaguars, 33ÿ14, in the AFC Championship Game. The Jaguars finished the 1999 regular season with a league-best 14ÿ2 record, and advanced to the AFC title game after crushing the Miami Dolphins 62ÿ7 and limiting future Hall of Fame quarterback Dan Marino to just 11 of 25 completions for 95 yards and 1 touchdown, with 2 interceptions. However, Tennessee's defense dominated the Jaguars in the AFC Championship Game, forcing 6 turnovers.[35] Jacksonville led 14ÿ10 at halftime, but the Titans then scored 23 unanswered points on two touchdown runs by McNair, a safety, and Derrick Mason's 80-yard kickoff return for a touchdown. Although McNair passed for only 112 yards and one touchdown with one interception, he rushed for 91 yards and 2 touchdowns on 9 carries. George rushed for 86 yards and caught 3 passes for 19 yards.[36]\\r\\nIn January 2000, two ice storms struck the Atlanta area within a week of each other. The second storm occurred during the week the Super Bowl was hosted. Despite the rare adverse weather conditions, city and state crews kept streets and sidewalks free of ice, and MARTA public transport kept running. The Atlanta region does not receive more ice storms than most other areas of the country, and Super Bowl XXXIV was played indoors and unaffected by the elements. But some residents believe the poor weather during Super Bowl week negatively impacted the city's chances of hosting another Super Bowl, including the bid it lost for the Super Bowl XLIII.[37] That bid included meteorological data showing the rarity of such storms in the area.[38]\\r\\nNashville, home of the Titans, is also the midway point of the Atlanta-St. Louis highway corridor, which contains the entirety of Interstate 24, and uses other highways to complete the route.\\r\\nThis is, to date, the most recent Super Bowl in which neither team had won a Super Bowl before.\\r\\nABC televised the game in the United States with play-by-play announcer Al Michaels and color commentator Boomer Esiason. Chris Berman from Disney-owned corporate sibling ESPN hosted all the events. Berman was joined by fellow ESPN analyst Steve Young, while ESPN's Mike Tirico was on hand for the post-game presentation of the Vince Lombardi Trophy. Lesley Visser and Lynn Swann served as sideline reporters.\\r\\nIt was also the first Super Bowl to be aired in high definition and 5.1 Dolby Digital. ABC Sports chose to use the 720p format.[39]\\r\\nIronically, the ABC affiliate in St. Louis, KDNL-TV, has been regarded as one of the network's weakest affiliates since joining the network in 1995[citation needed]. The previous ABC affiliate, KTVI, in contrast, was one of the strongest affiliates[citation needed] ÿ it had become a Fox station in 1995, and thus, has televised the majority of the Rams' games in this period.\\r\\nThe game was later featured as one of the NFL's Greatest Games as The Longest Yard.\\r\\nThe pregame show featured a tribute to \\"The Great American Music of the 20th Century\\". Narrated by the Smothers Brothers, the show highlighted some of the unique American musical styles such as gospel, big band, classical, country and rock. Singers Tina Turner and Travis Tritt along with the Georgia Tech Marching Band and the Georgia Mass Choir performed during the show.\\r\\nCountry singer Faith Hill then sang the national anthem.\\r\\nTo celebrate the 30th anniversary of Super Bowl IV, the following participants of the game were featured during the coin toss ceremony: Bud Grant, Lamar Hunt, Bobby Bell, Paul Krause, Willie Lanier, Alan Page, and Jan Stenerud.[40]\\r\\nThe E-Trade halftime show was produced by Disney and titled \\"Tapestry of Nations\\" after the Epcot parade of the same name. The show, narrated by actor Edward James Olmos, was inspired by Walt Disney World's millennium celebration. It featured a full symphony orchestra conducted by Steven Byess; a multi-generational, 80-person choir; and singers Phil Collins, Christina Aguilera, Enrique Iglesias, Tina Turner, and Toni Braxton.[41]\\r\\nSetlist:[42]\\r\\nThis game is often referred to as the \\"dot-com\\" Super Bowl since it was held during the height of the dot-com bubble, and several Internet companies purchased television commercials. E-Trade ran a commercial featuring a chimpanzee dancing in an E-Trade T-shirt and the text \\"Well, we just wasted 2 million bucks.\\" Lifeminders.com ran a commercial of plain typewritten text beginning with the line \\"This is the worst commercial on the Super Bowl. But it might be the best thing you see tonight.\\" Pets.com famously paid millions for an advertisement featuring a sock puppet, though the company would collapse before the end of the year.[43]\\r\\nThe two teams defenses seemed to dominate most of the first half. The Rams started the game out strong by taking the opening kickoff and marching to the Tennessee 17-yard line. But on third down, safety Blaine Bishop pressured quarterback Kurt Warner to throw an incomplete pass. Then the ensuing field goal attempt failed when punter/holder Mike Horan fumbled the snap. The Titans responded by moving the ball to the St. Louis 29-yard line, aided with running back Eddie George's 32-yard reception. But they also came up empty after kicker Al Del Greco missed a 47-yard field goal attempt.\\r\\nFor the rest of the half, the Titans were forced to punt on all of their possessions. In contrast, the Rams were able to reach inside the Tennessee 20-yard line on all four of their remaining drives before halftime, but on each one, the Titans' defense forced St. Louis to settle for field goal attempts from kicker Jeff Wilkins, who was successful in making three of them, but missed one attempt from 34 yards. The Rams ended up leading at halftime, 9ÿ0, but their scoring margin over the Titans seemed somewhat small, considering they drove into scoring range on every one of their first-half possessions and outgained Tennessee in total yards, 294ÿ89.\\r\\nBoth teams' offenses started to get going in the second half. The Titans took the opening kickoff of the 3rd quarter and drove 43 yards to the St. Louis 29-yard line. But Tennessee remained scoreless after defensive back Todd Lyght blocked Del Greco's 47-yard field goal attempt. After that, Warner converted a third down situation with a completion to Marshall Faulk, then on the next two plays threw a 31-yard strike to Isaac Bruce and a 16-yard completion to tight end Ernie Conwell before finishing the 68-yard drive with a 9-yard touchdown pass to Torry Holt, giving St. Louis a 16ÿ0 lead. On the completion to Conwell, Bishop combined to make the tackle, but suffered a spinal injury and had to leave the game. The game was delayed for several minutes while Bishop was being treated.\\r\\nTennessee wide receiver Derrick Mason returned the ensuing kickoff 35 yards to the 34-yard line. From there, five runs by George good for 24 yards, three completions from quarterback Steve McNair to tight end Frank Wycheck for 15 yards and a run by McNair for two advanced the ball to the St. Louis 25-yard line. Then McNair scrambled 23 yards to the 2-yard line, setting up a 1-yard touchdown run by George two plays later. The touchdown cut the Titans' deficit to 16ÿ6 after McNair's pass to Wycheck on the two-point conversion attempt fell incomplete.[44]\\r\\nThe Titans' first score sparked them to rally. After forcing the Rams to punt on their ensuing possession, a pair of 21-yard completions from McNair to tight end Jackie Harris and wide receiver Isaac Byrd aided a 13-play, 79-yard drive that was capped by George's 2-yard touchdown run to make the score 16ÿ13. The Tennessee defense then forced the Rams to a three-and-out, and Horan's 30-yard punt gave the Titans the ball back at their 47-yard line. The Titans' offense then drove only 28 yards on their ensuing possession, but it was close enough for Del Greco to attempt a 43-yard field goal. This time, Del Greco's kick was good, tying the score at 16ÿ16 with just 2:12 left in the game. The 16-point deficit was the largest deficit to be erased in a Super Bowl and the first greater than 10 points. It was also the first time in any Super Bowl a team down double digits in the 4th quarter had tied the game. Also, however, the Titans only tied the game and hadn't yet gained the lead.\\r\\nThen on the Rams' first play of their ensuing drive, Warner threw a long pass that was caught at the Titans' 38-yard line by Bruce, who then ran it all the way into the end zone for a 73-yard touchdown to give St. Louis a 23ÿ16 lead. Likewise, in the 1951 NFL Championship Game, quarterback Norm Van Brocklin's 73-yard game-winning touchdown pass to wide receiver Tom Fears broke a 17ÿ17 tie in the fourth quarter and gave the Rams a seven-point victory to win the NFL title.[45] Warner's touchdown pass to Bruce was his only completion of the 4th quarter.\\r\\nThe Titans took over the ball at their own 12-yard line with 1:48 left in the game after committing a holding penalty on the ensuing kickoff. McNair started out the drive with a pair of completions to Mason and Wycheck for gains of 9 and 7 yards to reach the 28-yard line. After an incomplete pass, defensive back Dr Bly's 15-yard facemask penalty while tackling McNair on a 12-yard scramble gave the Titans a 1st down at the St. Louis 45-yard line. On the next play, St. Louis was penalized 5 yards for being offsides, moving the ball to the 40-yard line with 59 seconds left. McNair then ran for 2 yards, then threw a 7-yard completion to wide receiver Kevin Dyson. On the next play, Tennessee nearly lost the ball when Bly stepped in front of a pass intended for Mason, only to have it go right through his arms. Two plays later, with the Titans facing 3rd down and 5 to go, McNair was hit by two Rams defenders, but he escaped and completed a 16-yard pass to Dyson to gain a 1st down at the Rams 10-yard line. Tennessee then used up their final timeout with just six seconds left in the game, giving them a chance for one last play. This final play has gone down in NFL history as simply \\"The Tackle\\".[46][47]\\r\\nThe Titans had just used their final timeout with six seconds remaining. With the ball on the Rams' 10-yard line, the Titans were trailing by a touchdown and had one last opportunity to tie the game. The plan was to use tight end Frank Wycheck as a decoy. Wycheck would run straight up the field on the right side, to lure linebacker Mike Jones away from receiver Kevin Dyson. Dyson would then slant left through the middle of the field. With Jones occupying Wycheck, quarterback Steve McNair would pass the ball to Dyson, who would be open from about five yards out for the score.\\r\\nAs the play began, everything appeared to go as planned. Jones ran with Wycheck up the field at the beginning of the play. However, as the pass was being delivered to Dyson, Jones, who was at the goal line, glanced over his left shoulder and noticed an open Dyson catching the ball. Jones switched directions and ran towards the Titans receiver. Dyson ran directly toward the end zone, but his legs were wrapped up by Jones with about two and a half yards left to the goal line.\\r\\nSince Dyson was being tackled by the legs, there was still the possibility he could reach towards the end zone and get the ball across the goal line. Both players went into a rolling motion as Dyson outstretched his hand with the football towards the goal line in the hopes of scoring the touchdown. Though his reach was close, and the ball mere inches away from the end zone, it was still not enough to score. As the rolling motion came to an end, with Jones now on top of Dyson's legs, his shoulder had touched the ground and, therefore, the game was over. Had Dyson scored and the extra point been converted, it would have been the first Super Bowl ever to go into overtime. Alternatively, had Dyson scored, the Titans could have attempted a 2-point conversion for the outright win.\\r\\nConsidering the magnitude of the Super Bowl, and the wild game that preceded it, \\"The Tackle\\" is considered one of the greatest and most exciting game-ending plays in modern NFL history. The image of Dyson stretching the ball towards the goal line with Jones wrapped around him has become a staple of NFL highlights. ESPN.com ranked \\"The Tackle\\" as the 35th greatest moment of the past 25 years in sports (as of 2007).[48] NFL.com ranked Jones' tackle of Dyson as the fourth greatest clutch moment in Super Bowl history.[49] Fox Sports ranked The Tackle as the Greatest Clutch Play in Super Bowl History (as of 2007). Like Dallas Cowboys cornerback Larry Brown, Jones was included on the NFL Network's \\"Top 10 One-Hit Wonders\\" list (Jones was #10, Brown was #3), although Jones also mirrored Brown in having a solid if unspectacular career outside of his Super Bowl heroics.\\r\\nAfter the game, many sports writers commented on Warner's rise from an unknown backup to a Super Bowl MVP, but Warner himself wasn't impressed by it. \\"How can you be in awe of something that you expect yourself to do?\\" Warner pointed out. \\"People think this season is the first time I touched a football; they don't realize I've been doing this for years ÿ just not on this level, because I never got the chance. Sure, I had my tough times, but you don't sit there and say, 'Wow, I was stocking groceries five years ago, and look at me now.' You don't think about it, and when you do achieve something, you know luck has nothing to do with it.\\"\\r\\nHowever, he later told The New York Times \\"I guess it is sort of a storybook ending. When you think about where I was and where I am now, it seems pretty incredible.\\"[50]\\r\\nat Georgia Dome, Atlanta\\r\\nBruce caught 6 passes for 162 yards (3rd highest) and a touchdown, an average of 27 yards per catch. Holt had 7 receptions for 109 yards (the most ever by a rookie in a Super Bowl) and a touchdown. Bruce and Holt became the fourth pair of teammates to each have over 100 yards receiving in a Super Bowl, joining the Steelers' John Stallworth and Lynn Swann in Super Bowl XIII, the Bengals' Cris Collinsworth and Dan Ross in Super Bowl XVI, and the Redskins' Gary Clark and Art Monk in Super Bowl XXVI.[51]\\r\\nRams starting running back Marshall Faulk was held to just 17 rushing yards, but gained 90 receiving yards on 5 receptions. McNair set a Super Bowl record for rushing yards by a quarterback, recording 64 yards on 8 carries. He also completed 22 out of 36 passes for 214 yards. George finished the game with 95 rushing yards, 35 receiving yards, and 2 touchdowns. Harris was the top receiver for Tennessee with 7 catches for 64 yards. Mason returned 5 kickoffs for 122 yards, and caught 2 passes for 18 yards.[52]\\r\\nRams coach Dick Vermeil became the oldest coach ever to win a Super Bowl (age 63).

Degrassi: The Next Generation is a Canadian serial teen drama television series. The series introduces a group of seventh and eighth grade school children, and follows their lives as they deal with some of the challenges and issues teenagers face such as online predators, body image, dysfunctional families, sex, puberty, rumors, peer pressure, stress, and drug use.\\r\\nThe first season was broadcast on the Canadian terrestrial television network CTV, on Sundays at 7:00 p.m. It debuted with a one-hour movie of the week special, \\"Mother and Child Reunion\\", which form the first two episodes of season one. In the United States, it was broadcast on The N, a digital cable network aimed at teenagers and young adults. The season was released domestically on DVD as a three disc boxed set on 19 October 2004 by Alliance Atlantis Home Entertainment, although it was released to the US market almost a month earlier, on 28 September 2004. Registered users of the Canadian and US iTunes Stores are also able purchase and download the season for playback on home computers and certain iPods.[1]\\r\\nThe reception for Degrassi: The Next Generation's first season was mixed. It had earned itself 365,000 Canadian viewers aged 18 to 49, while its accompanying website was attracting 28 million hits per month, but press reviews were not as complimentary. The season picked up nominations at the Directors Guild of Canada Awards, the Gemini Awards and the Young Artist Awards.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe opening season features thirteen actors in starring roles. Providing ties to the previous series in the Degrassi universe, Stefan Brogren was hired to play his old character Archie \\"Snake\\" Simpson (12 episodes), who is now working at the school as the Media Immersion teacher. Dan Woods was also hired to reprise his role as Mr. Raditch (11 episodes), who has been promoted to the school principal.\\r\\nFor the new generation of students, the producers kept the same model that had been used during the casting of the previous series, Degrassi Junior High and Degrassi High and chose 11 children out of 600 auditionees,[2] hoping to provide a group of characters the target audience of kids and teenagers could relate to, rather than the typical gorgeous actors in their twenties pretending to be teenagers, something that some of the other shows of the same period, such as Buffy the Vampire Slayer and Dawson's Creek which were targeting the same audience, were and still are continually doing to this day.[3] The young actors that had been selected were:\\r\\nAmanda Stepto also reprised her Degrassi character Christine \\"Spike\\" Nelson in a recurring role[4] while former Degrassi Junior High and Degrassi High actors Danah Jean Brown (Trish Skye), Darrin Brown (Dwayne Myers), Michael Carry (Simon Dexter), Irene Courakos (Alexa Pappadopoulos), Chrissa Erodotou (Diana Economopoulos), Anais Granofsky (Lucy Fernandez), Rebecca Haines (Kathleen Mead), Sara Holmes (Alison Hunter), Neil Hope (Derek \\"Wheels\\" Wheeler), Kyra Levy (Maya Goldberg), Cathy Keenan (Liz O'Rourke), Pat Mastroianni (Joey Jeremiah), Stacie Mistysyn (Caitlin Ryan), and Siluck Saysanasy (Yick Yu) reprised their roles to guest in the first episode.[5]\\r\\nThe season was produced by Epitome Pictures and CTV.

The directors throughout the season are James Allodi, Anthony Browne, Paul Fox, Laurie Lynd, Bruce McDonald, Eleanor Lindo, and Stefan Scaini.[6][7]\\r\\nDegrassi: The Next Generation received mixed reviews about its first season. Based on the pilot episode, Stephanie McGrath of Canoe.ca's AllPop acknowledged Miriam McDonald's portrayal of Emma Nelson as \\"stellar acting abilities in a super creepy storyline ... high on tension, low on cheese [and] top-notch\\". She criticized the reunion sub-plot, though, saying it was marred by \\"wooden, stilted and over-rehearsed acting; the young actors actually showed up their classic Degrassi counter-parts in the pilot episode. Their acting was solid, believable and age-appropriate [in a story-line which] demonstrates that the creative forces behind The Next Generation haven't lost touch with teens yet ... One installment of Degrassi: The Next Generation is worth 20 episodes of Dawson's Creek\\".[8] Towards the end of the season, the Canadian issue of TV Guide summed up the run as \\"Not just Canadian TV - It's great Canadian TV! Degrassi offers a gritty look into the lives of real teens complete with acne and bad dye jobs. It has something for everyone because we've all been there.\\"[9]\\r\\nOther critics were less enthusiastic about the season, though. The Seattle Times' Melanie McFarland was unsure whether the series' success in Canada would follow when it began airing in the US. \\"As popular as 'Degrassi' was, it was still a mere cult hit in the United States; the crowd that had access to it initially on PBS might not be able to tune into [The N]. Soft-pedaling through the issues might work for today's family of viewers, but what's gentle enough for Mom and Dad's peace of mind might not be enough to hook Junior or the original Degrassi's older fans\\". She was, however, \\"happy [The N] chose Degrassi students to navigate teen perils instead of digging up Screech and the gang for another nauseating go-round\\".[10] Tony Atherton of the Ottawa Citizen had mixed feelings of the new incarnation, saying it \\"has a cleaner, more polished look, has lost its edge [and offers] nothing new to viewers familiar with the groundbreaking preceding series, nor to anyone else who has watched the deluge of teen dramas since\\", adding that because there is \\"little ground left to break in teen drama there is a sense of dj vu with regards to the plots and characters\\". He did, however, praise the show for having \\"the same simple narrative told from a kid's viewpoint, and the same regard for unvarnished reality [as Degrassi Junior High and Degrassi High, making it] light years from far-fetched high-school melodramas like Boston Public and Dawson's Creek [and for that] is every bit as good as its beloved predecessor. In fact, in some respects it is even better\\".[11] After watching nearly seventy hours of twenty-one Canadian-produced programs, the Simon Fraser University cited Degrassi: The Next Generation in their report as one of the Canadian television programmes that is \\"too Caucasian\\".[12][13]\\r\\nDespite the mixed reviews and controversy over the storylines,[14] the first season was still watched by 365,000 18- to 49-year-old Canadians, making it Canada's top-rated domestic drama at the time,[15] while its accompanying website was attracting 28 million hits per month. [16]\\r\\nThe pilot was nominated for two Directors Guild of Canada Awards, winning in the \\"Outstanding Achievement in a Television Series - Children's\\" category,[17] and picked up Gemini Award nominations in the categories for \\"Best Photography in a Dramatic Program or Series\\" and \\"Best Short Dramatic Program\\".[18] Actors Jake Goldsbie and Ryan Cooley were nominated for their portrayals of Toby Isaacs and J.T.

This caused continuity problems for viewers as the episode depicted Toby being introduced to Manny and Emma for the first time, and was set before the school year began. The final episode of the season, \\"Jagged Little Pill\\", was also held back while The N decided whether its subject about ecstasy abuse was too controversial.[22] When an edited version was made available, The N aired it as part of season two.[14] In reruns however, the episodes have aired in the original order intended by the show's producers.\\r\\nThis list is by order of production, as they appear on the DVD.\\r\\nDegrassi High's classes of 1992 and 1993 return for their high school reunion.

Established by a resolution of the Congress on June 14, 1775, it was created to coordinate the military efforts of the Thirteen Colonies in their revolt against the rule of Great Britain. The Continental Army was supplemented by local militias and troops that remained under control of the individual states or were otherwise independent. General George Washington was the commander-in-chief of the army throughout the war.\\r\\nMost of the Continental Army was disbanded in 1783 after the Treaty of Paris ended the war. The 1st and 2nd Regiments went on to form the nucleus of the Legion of the United States in 1792 under General Anthony Wayne. This became the foundation of the United States Army in 1796.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Continental Army consisted of soldiers from all 13 colonies and, after 1776, from all 13 states. When the American Revolutionary War began at the Battles of Lexington and Concord on April 19, 1775, the colonial revolutionaries did not have an army. Previously, each colony had relied upon the militia, made up of part-time citizen-soldiers, for local defense, or the raising of temporary \\"provincial regiments\\" during specific crises such as the French and Indian War of 1754ÿ63. As tensions with Great Britain increased in the years leading to the war, colonists began to reform their militias in preparation for the perceived potential conflict. Training of militiamen increased after the passage of the Intolerable Acts in 1774. Colonists such as Richard Henry Lee proposed forming a national militia force, but the First Continental Congress rejected the idea.[1]\\r\\nOn April 23, 1775, the Massachusetts Provincial Congress authorized the raising of a colonial army consisting of 26 company regiments. New Hampshire, Rhode Island, and Connecticut soon raised similar but smaller forces. On June 14, 1775, the Second Continental Congress decided to proceed with the establishment of a Continental Army for purposes of common defense, adopting the forces already in place outside Boston (22,000 troops) and New York (5,000).[2] It also raised the first ten companies of Continental troops on a one-year enlistment, riflemen from Pennsylvania, Maryland, Delaware and Virginia to be used as light infantry,[2] who became the 1st Continental Regiment in 1776.\\r\\nOn June 15, 1775, the Congress elected by unanimous vote George Washington as Commander-in-Chief, who accepted and served throughout the war without any compensation except for reimbursement of expenses.[3][4][5][6]\\r\\nOn July 18, 1775, the Congress requested all colonies form militia companies from \\"all able bodied effective men, between sixteen and fifty years of age.\\" It was not uncommon for men younger than sixteen to enlist as most colonies had no requirement of parental consent for those under twenty-one (adulthood).[7]\\r\\nFour major-generals (Artemas Ward, Charles Lee, Philip Schuyler, and Israel Putnam) and eight brigadier-generals (Seth Pomeroy, Richard Montgomery, David Wooster, William Heath, Joseph Spencer, John Thomas, John Sullivan, and Nathanael Greene) were appointed by the Second Continental Congress in the course of a few days.[8][9][10] After Pomeroy did not accept, John Thomas was appointed in his place.[11]\\r\\nAs the Continental Congress increasingly adopted the responsibilities and posture of a legislature for a sovereign state, the role of the Continental Army became the subject of considerable debate. Some Americans had a general aversion to maintaining a standing army; but on the other hand the requirements of the war against the British required the discipline and organization of a modern military. As a result, the army went through several distinct phases, characterized by official dissolution and reorganization of units.\\r\\nSoldiers in the Continental Army were citizens who had volunteered to serve in the army (but were paid), and at various times during the war, standard enlistment periods lasted from one to three years. Early in the war the enlistment periods were short, as the Continental Congress feared the possibility of the Continental Army evolving into a permanent army. The army never numbered more than 17,000 men. Turnover proved a constant problem, particularly in the winter of 1776ÿ77, and longer enlistments were approved. Broadly speaking, Continental forces consisted of several successive armies, or establishments:\\r\\nIn addition to the Continental Army regulars, local militia units, raised and funded by individual colonies/states, participated in battles throughout the war. Sometimes the militia units operated independently of the Continental Army, but often local militias were called out to support and augment the Continental Army regulars during campaigns. (The militia troops developed a reputation for being prone to premature retreats, a fact that Brigadier-General Daniel Morgan integrated into his strategy at the Battle of Cowpens in 1781.)\\r\\nThe financial responsibility for providing pay, food, shelter, clothing, arms, and other equipment to specific units was assigned to states as part of the establishment of these units. States differed in how well they lived up to these obligations. There were constant funding issues and morale problems as the war continued. This led to the army offering low pay, often rotten food, hard work, cold, heat, poor clothing and shelter, harsh discipline, and a high chance of becoming a casualty.\\r\\nAt the time of the Siege of Boston, the Continental Army at Cambridge, Massachusetts, in June 1775, is estimated to have numbered from 14ÿ16,000 men from New England (though the actual number may have been as low as 11,000 because of desertions). Until Washington's arrival, it remained under the command of Artemas Ward, while John Thomas acted as executive officer and Richard Gridley commanded the artillery corps and was chief engineer.\\r\\nThe British force in Boston was increasing by fresh arrivals. It numbered then about 10,000 men. Major Generals Howe, Clinton, and Burgoyne, had arrived late in May and joined General Gage in forming and executing plans for dispersing the rebels. Feeling strong with these veteran officers and soldiers around himand the presence of several Men-of-War under Admiral Gravesthe governor issued a proclamation, declaring martial law, branding the entire Continental Army and supporters as \\"rebels\\" and \\"parricides of the Constitution.\\" Amnesty was offered to those who gave up their allegiance to the Continental Army and Congress in favor of the British authorities, though Samuel Adams and John Hancock were still wanted for high treason. This proclamation only served to strengthen the resolve of the Congress and Army.\\r\\nAfter the British evacuation of Boston (prompted by the placement of Continental artillery overlooking the city in March 1776), the Continental Army relocated to New York. For the next five years, the main bodies of the Continental and British armies campaigned against one another in New York, New Jersey, and Pennsylvania. These campaigns included the notable battles of Trenton, Princeton, Brandywine, Germantown, and Morristown, among many others.\\r\\nThe Continental Army was racially integrated, a condition the United States Army would not see again until Truman ordered the desegregation of the military in 1948. African American slaves were promised freedom in exchange for military service in New England, and made up one fifth of the Northern Continental Army.[12]\\r\\nThroughout its existence, the Army was troubled by poor logistics, inadequate training, short-term enlistments, interstate rivalries, and Congress's inability to compel the states to provide food, money or supplies. In the beginning, soldiers enlisted for a year, largely motivated by patriotism; but as the war dragged on, bounties and other incentives became more commonplace. Two major mutinies late in the war drastically diminished the reliability of two of the main units, and there were constant discipline problems.\\r\\nThe army increased its effectiveness and success rate through a series of trials and errors, often at great human cost. General Washington and other distinguished officers were instrumental leaders in preserving unity, learning and adapting, and ensuring discipline throughout the eight years of war. In the winter of 1777ÿ1778, with the addition of Baron von Steuben, of Prussian origin, the training and discipline of the Continental Army began to vastly improve. (This was the infamous winter at Valley Forge.) Washington always viewed the Army as a temporary measure and strove to maintain civilian control of the military, as did the Continental Congress, though there were minor disagreements about how this was carried out.\\r\\nNear the end of the war, the Continental Army was augmented by a French expeditionary force (under General Rochambeau) and a squadron of the French navy (under the Comte de Barras), and in the late summer of 1781 the main body of the army travelled south to Virginia to rendezvous with the French West Indies fleet under Admiral Comte de Grasse. This resulted in the Siege of Yorktown, the decisive Battle of the Chesapeake, and the surrender of the British southern army. This essentially marked the end of the land war in America, although the Continental Army returned to blockade the British northern army in New York until the peace treaty went into effect two years later, and battles took place elsewhere between British forces and those of France and its allies.\\r\\nA small residual force remained at West Point and some frontier outposts until Congress created the United States Army by their resolution of June 3, 1784.\\r\\nPlanning for the transition to a peacetime force had begun in April 1783 at the request of a congressional committee chaired by Alexander Hamilton. The commander-in-chief discussed the problem with key officers before submitting the army's official views on 2 May. Significantly, there was a broad consensus of the basic framework among the officers. Washington's proposal called for four components: a small regular army, a uniformly trained and organized militia, a system of arsenals, and a military academy to train the army's artillery and engineer officers. He wanted four infantry regiments, each assigned to a specific sector of the frontier, plus an artillery regiment. His proposed regimental organizations followed Continental Army patterns but had a provision for increased strength in the event of war. Washington expected the militia primarily to provide security for the country at the start of a war until the regular army could expandthe same role it had carried out in 1775 and 1776. Steuben and Duportail submitted their own proposals to Congress for consideration.\\r\\nAlthough Congress declined on May 12 to make a decision on the peace establishment, it did address the need for some troops to remain on duty until the British evacuated New York City and several frontier posts. The delegates told Washington to use men enlisted for fixed terms as temporary garrisons. A detachment of those men from West Point reoccupied New York without incident on November 25. When Steuben's effort in July to negotiate a transfer of frontier forts with Major General Frederick Haldimand collapsed, however, the British maintained control over them, as they would into the 1790s. That failure and the realization that most of the remaining infantrymen's enlistments were due to expire by June 1784 led Washington to order Knox, his choice as the commander of the peacetime army, to discharge all but 500 infantry and 100 artillerymen before winter set in. The former regrouped as Jackson's Continental Regiment under Colonel Henry Jackson of Massachusetts. The single artillery company, New Yorkers under John Doughty, came from remnants of the 2nd Continental Artillery Regiment.\\r\\nCongress issued a proclamation on October 18, 1783, which approved Washington's reductions. On November 2, Washington then released his Farewell Order to the Philadelphia newspapers for nationwide distribution to the furloughed men. In the message he thanked the officers and men for their assistance and reminded them that \\"the singular interpositions of Providence in our feeble condition were such, as could scarcely escape the attention of the most unobserving; while the unparalleled perseverance of the Armies of the United States, through almost every possible suffering and discouragement for the space of eight long years, was little short of a standing miracle.\\"\\r\\nWashington believed that the blending of persons from every colony into \\"one patriotic band of Brothers\\" had been a major accomplishment, and he urged the veterans to continue this devotion in civilian life.\\r\\nWashington said farewell to his remaining officers on December 4 at Fraunces Tavern in New York City. On December 23 he appeared in Congress, then sitting at Annapolis, and returned his commission as commander-in-chief: \\"Having now finished the work assigned me, I retire from the great theatre of Action; and bidding an Affectionate farewell to this August body under whose orders I have so long acted, I here offer my Commission, and take my leave of all the employments of public life.\\" Congress ended the War of American Independence on January 14, 1784, by ratifying the definitive peace treaty that had been signed in Paris on September 3.\\r\\nCongress had again rejected Washington's concept for a peacetime force in October 1783. When moderate delegates then offered an alternative in April 1784 which scaled the projected army down to 900 men in one artillery and three infantry battalions, Congress rejected it as well, in part because New York feared that men retained from Massachusetts might take sides in a land dispute between the two states. Another proposal to retain 350 men and raise 700 new recruits also failed. On June 2 Congress ordered the discharge of all remaining men except twenty-five caretakers at Fort Pitt and fifty-five at West Point. The next day it created a peace establishment acceptable to all interests.\\r\\nThe plan required four states to raise 700 men for one year's service. Congress instructed the Secretary at War to form the troops into eight infantry and two artillery companies. Pennsylvania, with a quota of 260 men, had the power to nominate a lieutenant colonel, who would be the senior officer. New York and Connecticut each were to raise 165 men and nominate a major; the remaining 110 men came from New Jersey. Economy was the watchword of this proposal, for each major served as a company commander, and line officers performed all staff duties except those of chaplain, surgeon, and surgeon's mate. Under Josiah Harmar, the First American Regiment slowly organized and achieved permanent status as an infantry regiment of the new Regular Army. The lineage of the First American Regiment is carried on by the 3rd United States Infantry Regiment (The Old Guard).\\r\\nHowever the United States military realized it needed a well-trained standing army following St. Clair's Defeat on November 4, 1791, when a force led by General Arthur St. Clair was almost entirely wiped out by the Western Confederacy near Fort Recovery, Ohio. The plans, which were supported by U.S. President George Washington and Henry Knox, Secretary of War, led to the disbandment of the Continental Army and the creation of the Legion of the United States. The command would be based on the 18th-century military works of Henry Bouquet, a professional Swiss soldier who served as a colonel in the British army, and French Marshal Maurice de Saxe. In 1792 Anthony Wayne, a renowned hero of the American Revolutionary War, was encouraged to leave retirement and return to active service as Commander-in-Chief of the Legion with the rank of Major General.\\r\\nThe legion was recruited and raised in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. It was formed into four sub-legions. These were created from elements of the 1st and 2nd Regiments from the Continental Army. These units then became the First and Second Sub-Legions. The Third and Fourth Sub-Legions were raised from further recruits. From June 1792 to November 1792, the Legion remained cantoned at Fort LaFayette in Pittsburgh. Throughout the winter of 1792ÿ93, existing troops along with new recruits were drilled in military skills, tactics and discipline at Legionville on the banks of the Ohio River near present-day Baden, Pennsylvania. The following Spring the newly named Legion of the United States left Legionville for the Northwest Indian War, a struggle between American Indian tribes affiliated with the Western Confederacy in the area south of the Ohio River. The overwhelmingly successful campaign was concluded with the decisive victory at the Battle of Fallen Timbers on August 20, 1794, Maj. Gen. Anthony Wayne applied the techniques of wilderness operations perfected by Sullivan's 1779 expedition against the Iroquois. The training the troops received at Legionville was also seen as an instrumental to this overwhelming victory.\\r\\nNevertheless, Steuben's Blue Book remained the official manual for the legion, as well as for the militia of most states, until Winfield Scott in 1835. In 1796, the United States Army was raised following the discontinuation with the legion of the United States. This preceded the graduation of the first cadets from United States Military Academy at West Point, New York, which was established in 1802.\\r\\nDuring the American Revolutionary War, the Continental Army initially wore ribbons, cockades and epaulettes of various colors as an ad hoc form of rank insignia, as General George Washington wrote in 1775:\\r\\n\\"As the Continental Army has unfortunately no uniforms, and consequently many inconveniences must arise from not being able to distinguish the commissioned officers from the privates, it is desired that some badge of distinction be immediately provided; for instance that the field officers may have red or pink colored cockades in their hats, the captains yellow or buff, and the subalterns green.\\"\\r\\nIn 1776 captains were to have buff or white cockades.\\r\\nLater on in the war, the Continental Army established its own uniform with a black cockade (as used in much of the British Army) among all ranks and the following insignia:","input":"When did the colonists form their first united and official army?"},{"output":"extend the scope of the Consumer Credit Act 1974","context":"The Consumer Credit Act 2006 (c 14) is an Act of the Parliament of the United Kingdom intended to increase consumer protection when borrowing money.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe main provisions of the Act are to extend the scope of the Consumer Credit Act 1974, to create an Ombudsman scheme, and to increase the powers of the Office of Fair Trading in relation to consumer credit.

It was founded on May 28, 1892, in San Francisco, California, by the Scottish-American preservationist John Muir, who became its first president. The Sierra Club primarily operates in the United States; an affiliated organization, Sierra Club Canada, operates in Canada and deals exclusively with Canadian issues.\\r\\n\\r\\nTraditionally associated with the progressive movement, the club was one of the first large-scale environmental preservation organizations in the world, and currently engages in lobbying politicians to promote environmentalist policies. Recent focuses of the club include promoting sustainable energy, mitigating global warming, and opposing the use of coal. The club is known for its political endorsements, which are often sought after by candidates in local elections; it generally supports liberal and progressive candidates in elections.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Sierra Club is organized on both a national and local level. The club is divided into large chapters representing large geographic areas, some of which have tens of thousands of members. These chapters are divided into regional groups, and special interest sections, committees, and task forces. While much activity is coordinated at a local level, the Club is a unified organization; decisions made at the national level take precedent.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn addition to political advocacy, the Sierra Club organizes outdoor recreation activities, and has historically been a notable organization for mountaineering and rock climbing in the United States. Members of the Sierra Club pioneered the Yosemite Decimal System of climbing, and were responsible for a substantial amount of the early development of climbing. Much of this activity occurred in the group's namesake Sierra Nevada. The Sierra Club does not set standards for or regulate alpinism, but it organizes wilderness courses, hikes, and occasional alpine expeditions for members. In California, the club, through its outdoor recreation groups, is usually considered the state's analogue to other state mountaineering clubs such as Mazamas or the Colorado Mountain Club.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Sierra Club's stated mission is \\"To explore, enjoy, and protect the wild places of the earth; To practice and promote the responsible use of the earth's ecosystems and resources; To educate and enlist humanity to protect and restore the quality of the natural and human environment; and to use all lawful means to carry out these objectives.\\"[4]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Sierra Club is governed by a 15-member Board of Directors.[5] Each year, five directors are elected to three-year terms, and all club members are eligible to vote. A president is elected annually by the Board from among its members. The Executive Director runs the day-to-day operations of the group. Michael Brune, formerly of Rainforest Action Network, has served as the organization's executive director since 2010.[6] Brune succeeded Carl Pope. Pope stepped down amid discontent that the group had strayed from its core principles.[3]\\r\\n\\r\\nSierra Club members belong to statewide chapters and local groups. National and local special-interest sections, committees, and task forces address particular issues. The national Sierra Club sets the organization's policy agenda and overarching rules.[4]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe club is known for engaging in two main activities: promoting and guiding outdoor recreational activities, which is done throughout the United States but primarily in California (especially Southern California), and political activism to promote environmental causes. Richard M. Skinner of the Brookings Institution describes the Sierra Club as one of the United States' \\"leading environmental organizations\\". The Sierra Club makes endorsements of individual candidates for elected office, which has substantial weight given the club's reputation and large membership.[7]\\r\\n\\r\\nJournalist Robert Underwood Johnson had worked with John Muir on the successful campaign to create a large Yosemite National Park surrounding the much smaller state park which had been created in 1864.  This campaign succeeded in 1890. As early as 1889, Johnson had encouraged Muir to form an \\"association\\" to help protect the Sierra Nevada, and preliminary meetings were held to plan the group. Others involved in the early planning included artist William Keith, Willis Linn Jepson, Willard Drake Johnson, Joseph LeConte and David Starr Jordan.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn May 1892, a group of professors from the University of California, Berkeley and Stanford University helped Muir and attorney Warren Olney launch the new organization modeled after the eastern Appalachian Mountain Club. The Sierra Club's charter members elected Muir president, an office he held until his death in 1914.[8]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Club's first goals included establishing Glacier and Mount Rainier national parks, convincing the California legislature to give Yosemite Valley to the U.S. federal government, and preserving California's coastal redwoods.\\r\\n\\r\\nMuir escorted President Theodore Roosevelt through Yosemite in 1903, and two years later the California legislature ceded Yosemite Valley and Mariposa Grove to the federal government. The Sierra Club won its first lobbying victory with the creation of the country's second national park, after Yellowstone in 1872.[9]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the first decade of the 1900s, the Sierra Club became embroiled in the  Hetch Hetchy Reservoir controversy that divided preservationists from \\"resource management\\" conservationists. In the late 19th century, the city of San Francisco was rapidly outgrowing its limited water supply, which depended on intermittent local springs and streams. In 1890, San Francisco mayor James D. Phelan proposed to build a dam and aqueduct on the Tuolumne River, one of the largest southern Sierra rivers, as a way to increase and stabilize the city's water supply.[10]\\r\\n\\r\\nGifford Pinchot, a progressive supporter of public utilities and head of the US Forest Service, which then had jurisdiction over the national parks, supported the creation of the Hetch Hetchy dam. Muir appealed to his friend U.S. President Roosevelt, who would not commit himself against the dam, given its popularity with the people of San Francisco (a referendum in 1908 confirmed a seven-to-one majority in favor of the dam and municipal water). Muir and attorney William Edward Colby began a national campaign against the dam, attracting the support of many eastern conservationists. With the 1912 election of U.S. President Woodrow Wilson, who carried San Francisco, supporters of the dam had a friend in the White House.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe bill to dam Hetch Hetchy passed Congress in 1913, and so the Sierra Club lost its first major battle. In retaliation, the Club supported creation of the National Park Service in 1916, to remove the parks from Forest Service oversight. Stephen Mather, a Club member from Chicago and an opponent of the Hetch Hetchy dam, became the first National Park Service director.[9]\\r\\n\\r\\nDuring the 1920s and 1930s, the Sierra Club functioned as a social and recreational society, conducting outings, maintaining trails and building huts and lodges in the Sierras. Preservation campaigns included a several-year effort to enlarge Sequoia National Park (achieved in 1926) and over three decades of work to protect and then preserve Kings Canyon National Park (established in 1940). Historian Stephen Fox notes, \\"In the 1930s most of the three thousand members were middle-aged Republicans.\\"[9]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe New Deal brought many conservationists to the Democratic Party, and many Democrats entered the ranks of conservationists. Leading the generation of Young Turks who revitalized the Sierra Club after World War II were attorneys Richard Leonard and Bestor Robinson, nature photographer Ansel Adams, and David Brower.\\r\\n\\r\\nAdams sponsored Brower for membership in the Club, and he was appointed to the editorial board of the Sierra Club Bulletin. After World War II Brower returned to his job with the University of California Press, and began editing the Sierra Club Bulletin in 1946.[9]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1950, the Sierra Club had some 7,000 members, mostly on the West Coast. That year the Atlantic chapter became the first formed outside California. An active volunteer board of directors ran the organization, assisted by a small clerical staff. Brower was appointed the first executive director in 1952, and the Club began to catch up with major conservation organizations such as the National Audubon Society, National Wildlife Federation, The Wilderness Society, and Izaak Walton League, which had long had professional staff.[9]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Sierra Club secured its national reputation in the battle against the Echo Park Dam in Dinosaur National Monument in Utah, which had been announced by the Bureau of Reclamation in 1950. Brower led the fight, marshaling support from other conservation groups. Brower's background in publishing proved decisive; with the help of publisher Alfred Knopf, This Is Dinosaur was rushed into press. Invoking the specter of Hetch Hetchy, conservationists effectively lobbied Congress, which deleted the Echo Park dam from the Colorado River project as approved in 1955. Recognition of the Sierra Club's role in the Echo Park dam victory boosted membership from 10,000 in 1956 to 15,000 in 1960.[9]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Sierra Club was now truly a national conservation organization, and preservationists took the offensive with wilderness proposals. The Club's Biennial Wilderness Conferences, launched in 1949 in concert with The Wilderness Society, became an important force in the campaign that secured passage of the Wilderness Act in 1964.[9]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1960, Brower launched the Exhibit Format book series with This Is the American Earth, and in 1962 In Wildness Is the Preservation of the World, with color photographs by Eliot Porter. These coffee-table books, published by their Sierra Club Books division, introduced the Sierra Club to a wider audience. Fifty thousand copies were sold in the first four years, and by 1960 sales exceeded $10 million. Soon Brower was publishing two new titles a year in the Exhibit Format series, but not all did as well as In Wildness. Although the books were successful in introducing the public to wilderness preservation and the Sierra Club, they lost money for the organization, some $60,000 a year after 1964. Financial management became a matter of contention between Brower and his board of directors.[9]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Sierra Club's most publicized crusade of the 1960s was the effort to stop the Bureau of Reclamation from building two dams that would flood portions of the Grand Canyon. Opposing the Bridge Canyon and Marble Canyon dam projects, full-page ads the Club placed in the New York Times and the Washington Post in 1966 exclaimed, \\"This time it's the Grand Canyon they want to flood,\\" and asked, \\"Should we also flood the Sistine Chapel so tourists can get nearer the ceiling?\\" The ads generated a storm of protest to the Congress, prompting the Internal Revenue Service to announce it was suspending the Sierra Club's 501(c)(3) status pending an investigation. The board had taken the precaution of setting up the Sierra Club Foundation as a (c)(3) organization in 1960 for endowments and contributions for educational and other non-lobbying activities.[8] Even so, contributions to the Club dropped off, aggravating its annual operating deficits. Membership, however, climbed sharply in response to the investigation into the legitimacy of the society's tax status by the IRS from 30,000 in 1965 to 57,000 in 1967 and 75,000 in 1969.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe victory over the dam projects and challenges from the IRS did not come without costs. To make up for the power that would have been produced by the dams, the Sierra Club actually advocated for coal power plants. The result of the campaign and its trade-off was, in the words of historian Andrew Needham, that \\"the Grand Canyon became protected, sacred space,\\" while \\"the Navajo Reservation\\"which housed some of the main power plants picking up the slack ÿ \\"became increasingly industrial.\\"[11]\\r\\n\\r\\nDespite the Club's success in blocking plans for the Grand Canyon dams and weathering the transition from 501(c)(3) to 501(c)(4) status, tension grew over finances between Brower and the board of directors. The Club's annual deficits rose from $100,000 in 1967 and 1968 to some $200,000 in 1969. Another conflict occurred over the Club's policy toward the nuclear power plant to be constructed by Pacific Gas and Electric (PG&E) at Diablo Canyon near San Luis Obispo, California. Although the Club had played the leading role blocking PG&E's nuclear power plant proposed for Bodega Bay, California in the early 1960s, that case had been built around the local environmental impact and earthquake danger from the nearby San Andreas fault, not from opposition to nuclear power itself. In exchange for moving the new proposed site from the environmentally sensitive Nipomo Dunes to Diablo Canyon, the board of directors voted to support PG&E's plan for the power plant. A membership referendum in 1967 upheld the board's decision. But Brower concluded that nuclear power at any location was a mistake, and he voiced his opposition to the plant, contrary to the Club's official policy. As pro- and anti-Brower factions polarized, the annual election of new directors reflected the conflict. Brower's supporters won a majority in 1968, but in the April 1969 election the anti-Brower candidates won all five open positions. Ansel Adams and president Richard Leonard, two of his closest friends on the board, led the opposition to Brower, charging him with financial recklessness and insubordination and calling for his ouster as executive director. The board voted ten to five to accept Brower's resignation.[8] Eventually reconciled with the Club, Brower was elected to the board of directors for a term from 1983 to 1988, and again from 1995 to 2000.\\r\\n\\r\\nMichael McCloskey, hired by Brower in 1961 as the Club's first northwest field representative, became the Club's second executive director in 1969. An administrator attentive to detail, McCloskey had set up the Club's conservation department in 1965 and guided the campaigns to save the Grand Canyon and establish Redwoods National Park and North Cascades National Park. During the 1970s, McCloskey led the Club's legislative activitypreserving Alaskan lands and eastern wilderness areas, and supporting the new environmental agenda: the Toxic Substances Control Act of 1976, the Clean Air Act amendments, and the Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act of 1977, passed during the administration of President Jimmy Carter. The Sierra Club made its first presidential endorsement in 1984 in support of Walter Mondale's unsuccessful campaign to unseat Ronald Reagan. McCloskey resigned as executive director in 1985 after 16-1/2 years (the same length of time Brower had led the organization), and assumed the title of chairman, becoming the Club's senior strategist, devoting his time to conservation policy rather than budget planning and administration.[12] After a two-year interlude with Douglas Wheeler, whose Republican credentials were disconcerting to liberal members, the Club hired Michael Fischer, the former head of the California Coastal Commission, who served as executive director from 1987 to 1992. Carl Pope, formerly the Club's legislative director, was named executive director in 1992.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the 1990s, club members Jim Bensman, Roger Clarke, David Dilworth, Chad Hanson and David Orr along with about 2,000 members formed the John Muir Sierrans (JMS), an internal caucus, to promote changes to club positions. They favored a zero-cut forest policy on public lands and, a few years later, decommissioning Glen Canyon Dam. JMS was successful in changing club positions on both counts.[13]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn September 2005, the Sierra Club held its first Sierra Summit in San Francisco. Approximately 1,000 volunteers from around the country, selected by their chapters and groups, were delegates; some nondelegate members also attended. There were seminars and exhibit presentations about current environmental issues and about techniques for more effective activism. Prominent guest speakers included Al Gore; Bill Maher; Robert F. Kennedy, Jr.; and Arianna Huffington.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 2008, several Sierra Club officers quit in protest after the Sierra Club agreed to promote products by Clorox, which had been named one of a \\"dangerous dozen\\" chemical companies by the Public Interest Research Group in 2004.[14] According to Carl Pope, the Sierra Club chairman, the deal brought the Club 1.3 million US dollars over the four-year term of the contract.[15]\\r\\n\\r\\nAlso in 2008, the Sierra Club endorsed Senator Barack Obama for President, citing \\"his strong record of support for clean air, wetlands protection, and clean energy.\\"[16]\\r\\n\\r\\nBetween 2007 and 2010, the Sierra Club accepted over 25 million US dollars in donations from the gas industry, mostly from Aubrey McClendon, CEO of Chesapeake Energy, one of the biggest gas drilling companies in the US and a firm heavily involved in fracking.[17]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn November 2011, Sierra Club chairman Carl Pope stepped down amid discontent about the Clorox deal and other issues.[15]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn January 2013, executive director Michael Brune announced [18] that the Sierra Club would officially participate in the first civil disobedience action in its 120-year history as part of the ongoing protest calling on the Obama administration to reject the Keystone XL tar sands pipeline, stating, \\"we are watching a global crisis unfold before our eyes, and to stand aside and let it happen ÿ even though we know how to stop it ÿ would be unconscionable.\\" On 13 February 2013, Michael Brune was arrested along with forty-eight people, including civil rights leader Julian Bond and NASA climate scientist James Hansen.[19][20]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn May 2015, the Sierra Club appointed its first black president of the board of directors, Aaron Mair.[21]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Sierra Club endorsed Hillary Clinton in the 2016 U.S. presidential election.[22]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1901, William Colby organized the first Sierra Club excursion to Yosemite Valley. The annual High Trips were led by mountaineers  such as Francis P. Farquhar, Joseph Nisbet LeConte, Norman Clyde, Walter A. Starr, Jr., Jules Eichorn, Glen Dawson, Ansel Adams, and David R. Brower. A number of first ascents  in the Sierra Nevada were made on Sierra Club outings. Sierra Club members were also early enthusiasts of rock climbing. In 1911, the first chapter was formed, Angeles, and it began conducting local excursions in the mountains surrounding Los Angeles and throughout the West.\\r\\n\\r\\nMany major innovations in mountaineering have come from Sierra Club members. Norman Clyde and Jules Eichorn, considered among the most famous members of the club, completed many first ascents of peaks in the Sierra Nevada.\\r\\n\\r\\nGlen Dawson and Royal Robbins, often on trips sponsored and organized by the Rock Climbing Section of the Angeles Chapter, opened up much of the Tahquitz Peak area to climbing, which at the time was said to contain some of the hardest routes in the world. The Yosemite Decimal System, the primary method of rating a route's difficulty used in the United States, was developed into its modern form at Tahquitz.\\r\\n\\r\\nSteve Roper's Fifty Classic Climbs of North America, sponsored and published by the Sierra Club, is still considered one of the definitive rock climbing guidebooks in the United States.\\r\\n\\r\\nDue to an increasing focus on political activity and concerns about financial liability, mountaineering activity in the Sierra Club has subsided since the 1980s. Some chapters, mostly in California, continue to maintain large mountaineering programs.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe club currently occasionally awards the Francis P. Farquhar Mountaineering Award to outstanding member mountaineers.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn World War II, a number of Sierra Club leaders joined the 10th Mountain Division.[23] Among them was David R. Brower, who managed the High Trip program from 1947 to 1954, while serving as a major in the Army Reserve.[24]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn many areas of the country, Sierra Club also organizes hiking tours. Sierra Club's website has a \\"hiking near me\\" function. Section \\"Sierra Club Near You\\" shows all the upcoming trips in nearby area.[25]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe historic High Trips, sometimes large expeditions with more than a hundred participants and crew, have given way to smaller and more numerous excursions held across the United States and abroad. These outings form a major part of Sierra Club culture, and in some chapters, constitute the majority of member activity.[23] Other chapters, however, may sponsor very few outdoor or recreational activities, being focused solely on political advocacy. Generally, chapters in California are much more active with regard to outdoor activities.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Sierra Club presents a number of annual awards. These awards include the Sierra Club John Muir Award, which is the organization's top award.\\r\\nThe John Muir Award is given to an individual with \\"a distinguished record of achievement in national or international conservation causes.\\"[26]\\r\\n\\r\\nOther awards given by the Sierra Club include the Ansel Adams Award for Conservation Photography, which honors excellence in conservation photography; and the Francis P. Farquhar Mountaineering Award, which recognizes contributions to mountaineering.\\r\\n\\r\\nLand management, access, conservation are traditionally considered the core advocacy areas of the Sierra Club. Uniquely for a progressive organization, the Sierra Club has strong grassroots organization in rural areas, with much activity focused on ensuring equitable and environmentally-friendly use of public lands. This is particularly accentuated by the fact that the club attracts many people who primarily join the club for recreation and use of public land for hiking.[27]\\r\\n\\r\\nSome Sierra Club members have urged the Club to be more forceful in advocating for the protection of National Forests and other federally owned public lands. For example, in 2002 the Club was criticized for joining with the Wilderness Society in agreeing to a compromise that would allow logging in the Black Hills in South Dakota.[28]\\r\\n\\r\\nA goal of the Sierra Club is to replace coal with other energy sources.[29] Through its \\"Beyond Coal\\" campaign, the Sierra Club has set a goal to close half of all coal plants in the U.S. by 2017. American business magnate and former New York City mayor Michael Bloomberg donated $50 million to the Sierra Club's anti-coal work in 2011, and announced another $30 million gift to Sierra's Beyond Coal campaign in 2015.[30] The Beyond Coal campaign says 187 coal plants have been closed since 2010.[31] Other funders of the Sierra Club's anti-coal campaign include the William and Flora Hewlett Foundation and the John D. and Catherine T. MacArthur Foundation.[32] The CEO of Chesapeake Energy, a natural gas company, donated $26 million to the Beyond Coal campaign between 2007 and 2010.[33]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Sierra Club is also opposed to nuclear energy.[34][35]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Sierra Club opposes dams it considers inappropriate, including some government-built dams in national parks.[36][37] In the early 20th century, the organization fought against the damming and flooding of the Hetch Hetchy Valley in Yosemite National Park. Despite this lobbying, Congress authorized the construction of O'Shaughnessy Dam on the Tuolumne River. The Sierra Club continues to support removal of the dam.[38]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Sierra Club advocates the decommissioning of Glen Canyon Dam and the draining of Lake Powell.[39] The Club also supports removal, breaching or decommissioning of many other dams, including four dams on the lower Snake River in eastern Washington.[40]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Sierra Club is a member of the BlueGreen Alliance, a coalition of environmental groups and labor unions.  The BlueGreen Alliance was formed in 2006 and grew out of a less-formal collaboration between the Sierra Club and the United Steelworkers. In 2012, the Laborers' International Union of North America left the coalition due to the Sierra Club and other environmental groups' opposition to the Keystone Pipeline.[41]\\r\\n\\r\\nImmigration was historically among the most divisive issues within the club. In 1996, after years of debate, the Sierra Club adopted a neutral position on immigration levels. As the club has shifted to the left over the years, this position was amended in 2013 to support \\"an equitable path to citizenship for undocumented immigrants\\".[42][43]\\r\\n\\r\\nAlthough the position of the Sierra Club has generally been favorable towards immigration, some critics of the Sierra Club have charged that the efforts of some club members to restrain immigration, are a continuation of aspects of human population control and the eugenics movement.[44][45] In 1969, the Sierra Club published Paul R. Ehrlich's book, The Population Bomb, in which he said that population growth was responsible for environmental decline and advocated coercive measures to reduce it. Some observers have argued that the book had a \\"racial dimension\\" in the tradition of the Eugenics movement, and that it \\"reiterated many of Osborn's jeremiads.\\"[46][47][48]\\r\\n\\r\\nDuring the 1980s, some Sierra Club members, including Paul Ehrlich's wife Anne,[46] wanted to take the Club into the contentious field of immigration to the United States. The Club's position was that overpopulation was a significant factor in the degradation of the environment. Accordingly, the Club supported stabilizing and reducing U.S. and world population. Some members argued that, as a practical matter, U.S. population could not be stabilized, let alone reduced, at the then-current levels of immigration. They urged the Club to support immigration reduction. The Club had previously addressed the issue of \\"mass immigration\\",[49] and in 1988, the organization's Population Committee and Conservation Coordinating Committee stated that immigration to the U.S. should be limited, so as to achieve population stabilization.[50]\\r\\n\\r\\nOther Sierra Club members thought that the immigration issue was too far from the Club's core environmentalist mission, and were also concerned that involvement would impair the organization's political ability to pursue its other objectives. In 1998, 60.1% of Sierra Club voting members voted that the organization should remain neutral on America's immigration policies, while 39.2% supported a measure calling for stricter curbs on immigration to the United States.[51]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1996, after the Sierra Club board adopted a neutral position on immigration policy, some members who were advocates of immigration reduction organized themselves as \\"SUSPS\\"[52]?ÿ a name originally derived from \\"Sierrans for U.S. Population Stabilization\\", which now stands for \\"Support U.S. Population Stabilization.\\"[53] SUSPS advocates a return to the Sierra Club's \\"traditional\\" (1970ÿ1996) immigration policy stance.[54] SUSPS has called for fully closing the borders of the United States, and for returning to immigration levels established by the Immigration Act of 1924, which includes strict ethnic quotas.[55]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe controversy resurfaced when a group of three immigration reduction proponents ran in the 2004 Sierra Club Board of Directors election, hoping to move the Club's position away from a neutral stance on immigration, and to restore the stance previously held.[56][57] Groups outside of the Club became involved, such as the Southern Poverty Law Center and MoveOn.[58] Of the three candidates, two (Frank Morris and David Pimentel), were on the board of the anti-immigration group Diversity Alliance for a Sustainable America[59][60] and two (Richard Lamm and Frank Morris) were on the board of directors or the board of advisors of the Federation for American Immigration Reform;[59] both had also held leadership positions within the NAACP.[61] Their candidacies were denounced by a fourth candidate, Morris Dees of the SPLC, as a \\"hostile takeover\\" attempt by \\"radical anti-immigrant activists.\\"[62] The immigration reduction proponents won 7% of all votes cast in the election.[63] In 2005, members voted 102,455 to 19,898 against a proposed change to \\"recognize the need to adopt lower limits on migration to the United States.\\"[64]\\r\\n\\r\\nWith the increased number of progressive activists joining the club in recent years, the Sierra Club has dramatically shifted its stance on immigration further towards the affirmative. Today, the Sierra Club supports a path to citizenship for undocumented immigrants, opposes a border wall[65] and works with immigrant groups to promote environmental justice.[43]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Sierra Club has come under criticism for opposing high-density housing development projects in California, which are intended to reduce housing shortage and reduce greenhouse gas emissions.[66][67][68] Ethan Elkind, director of the climate program at the Center for Law, Energy and the Environment (CLEE) at UC Berkeley Law, said that the Sierra Club's opposition to California Senate Bill 827 - which would require cities to allow denser and taller housing near public transport centrals, and ease the parking requirements that cities can impose on housing developments - was \\"surprising\\".[68] He wrote, \\"is Sierra Club an organization of wealthy homeowners who want to keep newcomers out of their upscale, transit-rich areas? Or are they actually committed to fighting climate change by providing enough housing for Californians in low-carbon, infill areas? Because their opposition to SB 827 unfortunately indicates more of the former than the latter.\\"[68]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Sierra Club Foundation was founded in 1960 by David R. Brower. A 501(c)(3) organization, it was founded after the Internal Revenue Service revoked the Sierra Club's tax-exempt status due to the group's political activities.[69][70]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Sierra Club added its first Canadian chapter in 1963 and in 1989 opened a national office in Ottawa. Canadian affiliates of the Sierra Club operate under the Sierra Club Canada.[71]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1971, volunteer lawyers who had worked with the Sierra Club established the Sierra Club Legal Defense Fund. This was a separate organization that used the \\"Sierra Club\\" name under license from the Club; it changed its name to Earthjustice in 1997.[72]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Sierra Student Coalition (SSC) is the student-run arm of the Sierra Club. Founded by Adam Werbach in 1991, it has 30,000 members.[73]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Sierra Club Voter Education Fund is a 527 group that became active in the 2004 Presidential election by airing television advertisements about the major party candidates' positions on environmental issues. Through the Environmental Voter Education Campaign (EVEC), the Club sought to mobilize volunteers for phone banking, door-to-door canvassing and postcard writing to emphasize these issues in the campaign.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe organization maintains a publishing imprint, Sierra Club Books, publishing books on environmental issues, wilderness photographic essays, nature guides, and other related subjects. They publish the Sierra Club Calendars, perennial bestsellers, featuring photographs by well-known nature photographers such as Galen Rowell. They also publish the John Muir library, which includes many of their founder's titles.[74]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Wilderness Travel Course is a basic mountaineering class that is administered by the Sierra Club.[75]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Sierra Club's annual budget was $88 million in 2011 and $100 million in 2012.[76] In 2013, the group's budget was $97.8 million.[2]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 2008, Clorox donated $1.3 million to the Sierra Club in exchange for the right to display the Sierra Club's logo on a line of cleaning products.[3]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn February 2012, it was reported that the Sierra Club had secretly accepted over $26 million in gifts from the natural gas industry, mostly from Aubrey McClendon, CEO of Chesapeake Energy.[77] The Sierra Club used the Chesapeake Energy money for its Beyond Coal campaign to block new coal-fired power plants and close old ones. Michael Brune reported that he learned of the gifts after he succeeded Carl Pope as executive director of the Sierra Club in 2010. Brune reported that he ended the financial agreement with natural gas industry interests.[33]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 2014, the Energy and Environment Legal Institute filed a referral with the Internal Revenue Service pointing out that Sierra Club and Sierra Club Foundation were not paying income taxes from sales of solar panels for their partners across the US.[78]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Sierra Club has an affiliated super PAC. It spent $1,000,575 on the 2014 elections, all of it opposing Republican candidates for office.[79] The Sierra Club is a partner of America Votes, an organization that coordinates and promotes progressive issues.[80]\\r\\n\\r\\nDonors to the Sierra Club have included David Gelbaum, Michael Bloomberg, the William and Flora Hewlett Foundation and the John D. and Catherine T. MacArthur Foundation.[81] The Sierra Club has also received funding from the Democracy Alliance and the Tides Foundation Advocacy Fund.[82][83]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 2015, a PR front group, known as the Environmental Policy Alliance, claimed that the Sierra Club and other U.S. environmental groups received funding from groups with ties to Russia's state-owned oil company.[84]\\r\\n\\r\\nPresidents of the Sierra Club have included:[85]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Sierra Club's executive directors have included:[87]","input":"What is the purpose of the sierra club?"},{"output":"June 12, 1898","context":"The Philippine Declaration of Independence (Filipino: Pagpapahayag ng Kasarinlan ng Pilipinas) was proclaimed on June 12, 1898 in Cavite II el Viejo (present-day Kawit, Cavite), Philippines. With the public reading of the Act of the Declaration of independence (Spanish: Acta de la proclamaci܇n de independencia del pueblo Filipino; Filipino: Paggawa ng Proklamasyon ng Kasarinlan ng sambayanang Pilipino), Filipino revolutionary forces under General Emilio Aguinaldo proclaimed the sovereignty and independence of the Philippine Islands from the colonial rule of Spain.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1896, the Philippine Revolution began. In December 1897, the Spanish government and the revolutionaries signed a truce, the Pact of Biak-na-Bato, requiring that the Spanish pay the revolutionaries 800,000 pesos and that Aguinaldo and other leaders go into exile in Hong Kong. In April 1898, at the outbreak of the SpanishÿAmerican War, Commodore George Dewey aboard the U.S.S. Olympia sailed from Hong Kong to Manila Bay leading the Asiatic Squadron of the U.S. Navy. On May 1, 1898, the United States defeated the Spanish in the Battle of Manila Bay. Emilio Aguinaldo decided to return to the Philippines to help American forces defeat the Spaniards. The U.S. Navy agreed to transport him back aboard the USS McCulloch, and on May 19, he arrived in Cavite.[2]\\r\\nIndependence was proclaimed on June 12, 1898 between four and five in the afternoon in Cavite at the ancestral home of General Emilio Aguinaldo some 30 kilometers South of Manila. The event saw the unfurling of the National Flag of the Philippines, made in Hong Kong by Marcela Agoncillo, Lorenza Agoncillo, and Delfina Herboza, and the performance of the Marcha Filipina Magdalo, as the national anthem, now known as Lupang Hinirang, which was composed by Julin Felipe and played by the San Francisco de Malabon marching band.\\r\\nThe Act of the Declaration of Independence was prepared, written, and read by Ambrosio Rianzares Bautista in Spanish. The Declaration was signed by 98 people, among them American army officer who witnessed the proclamation. The final paragraph states that there was a \\"stranger\\" (stranger in English translationextranjero in the original Spanish, meaning foreigner) who attended the proceedings, Mr. L. M. Johnson, described as \\"a citizen of the U.S.A, a Colonel of Artillery\\". [3] Despite his prior military experience, Johnson had no official role in the Philippines.[4] The proclamation of Philippine independence was, however, promulgated on 1 August, when many towns had already been organized under the rules laid down by the Dictatorial Government of General Aguinaldo.[5][6]\\r\\nLater at Malolos, Bulacan, the Malolos Congress modified the declaration upon the insistence of Apolinario Mabini who objected to that the original proclamation essentially placed the Philippines under the protection of the United States.\\r\\nThe declaration was never recognized by either the United States or Spain.\\r\\nLater in 1898, Spain ceded the Philippines to the United States in the 1898 Treaty of Paris that ended the SpanishÿAmerican War.\\r\\nThe Philippine Revolutionary Government did not recognize the treaty or American sovereignty, and subsequently fought and lost a conflict with the United States originally referred to by the Americans as the \\"Philippine Insurrection\\" but now generally and officially called the PhilippineÿAmerican War, which ended when Emilio Aguinaldo was captured by U.S. forces,[7] and issued a statement acknowledging and accepting the sovereignty of the United States over the Philippines.[8] This was then followed on July 2, 1902, by U.S. Secretary of War Elihu Root telegraphing that the insurrection the United States had come to an end and that provincial civil governments had been established everywhere except those areas inhabited by Moro tribes.[9] Pockets of resistance continued for several years.\\r\\nFollowing the end of World War II, the United States granted independence to the Philippines on 4 July 1946 via the Treaty of Manila.[10] July 4 was observed in the Philippines as Independence Day until August 4, 1964 when, upon the advice of historians and the urging of nationalists, President Diosdado Macapagal signed into law Republic Act No. 4166 designating June 12 as the country's Independence Day.[11] June 12 had previously been observed as Flag Day and many government buildings are urged to display the Philippine Flag in their offices.\\r\\nThe Declaration is currently housed in the National Library of the Philippines.[1] It is not on public display but can be viewed with permission like any other document held by the National Library.\\r\\nDuring the PhilippineÿAmerican War, the American government captured and sent to the United States about 400,000 historical documents.[12] In 1958, the documents were given to the Philippine government along with two sets of microfilm of the entire collection, with the U.S. Federal Government keeping one set.[12]\\r\\nSometime in the 1980s or 1990s the Declaration was stolen from the National Library.[1] As part of a larger investigation into the widespread theft of historical documents and a subsequent public appeal for the return of stolen documents, the Declaration was returned to the National Library in 1994 by historian and University of the Philippines professor Milagros Guerrero, who mediated the return of the documents.[12]\\r\\nThe Act of Proclamation of the Independence of the Filipino People (Spanish: Acta de la proclamaci܇n de independencia del pueblo Filipino; Filipino: Paggawa ng Proklamasyon ng Kasarinlan ng sambayanang Pilipino) is part of a long line of declarations of independence including the United States Declaration of Independence.

Amherst is located at the northeast end of the Cumberland Basin, an arm of the Bay of Fundy, Amherst is strategically situated on the eastern boundary of the Tantramar Marshes 3 kilometres (1.9?mi) east of the interprovincial border with New Brunswick and 65 kilometres southeast of the city of Moncton. It is 60 kilometres (37?mi) southwest of the New Brunswick abutment of the Confederation Bridge to Prince Edward Island at Cape Jourimain. Amherst is the shire town and largest population centre in Cumberland County.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nAccording to Dr. Graham P. Hennessey, \\"The Micmac name was Nemcheboogwek meaning 'going up rising ground', in reference to the higher land to the east of the Tantramar Marshes. The Acadians who settled here as early as 1672 called the village Les Planches. The village was later renamed Amherst by Colonel Joseph Morse in honour of Lord Amherst, the commander-in-chief of the British Army in North America during the Seven Years' War.\\"\\r\\nThe town was first settled in 1764 by immigrants from Yorkshire following the expulsion of the Acadians, with the original settlement being located three kilometres southwest of the present town on the shore of the Bay of Fundy.[citation needed] These settlers were joined by United Empire Loyalists (Loyalists who fled the American colonies during the American Revolution). A mill was built on the current townsite, and the residents moved there to be closer to work.\\r\\nDuring the 19th century, Amherst became an important regional centre for shipbuilding and other services to outlying communities. An indication of the town's importance in Canadian history is seen with its four Fathers of Confederation: Edward B. Chandler, Robert B. Dickey, Jonathan McCully, and Sir Charles Tupper.\\r\\nDuring the late 19th century, local industrialists and entrepreneurs constructed many fine Victorian and Edwardian homes along Victoria Street East, leading toward the farming hamlet of East Amherst. Many notable residents have lived in this district, including Tupper, Senator Thomas R. Black, the Barker Family, the Lamy Family, the Pugsley Family and Mary (Molly) Simmons Critchley. Amherst gained brief notoriety in the late 19th century as the location of alleged poltergeist phenomena afflicting Amherst resident Esther Cox in 1878 and 1879, which became known as the Great Amherst Mystery after the publication of a popular book on the affair.[2]\\r\\nAmherst experienced unprecedented industrialization in the late 1870s after the Intercolonial Railway of Canada constructed its main line from Halifax to Quebec through the town in 1872. The location of the railway line away from the Bay of Fundy coast further consolidated the town at its present location as industry and commercial activity centred around this important transportation link. The economic boom created by the arrival of the Intercolonial Railway lasted through World War I and numerous foundries, factories and mills opened, giving rise to the nickname \\"Busy Amherst\\".\\r\\nIn 1908, the manufacturing output of Amherst's industries was not exceeded by any centre in the Maritime Provinces. Many of the fine old buildings along Victoria Street are considered industrial artifacts because they were constructed during a period of tremendous industry growth. Local contractors employed local craftsmen, who used local materials. Notice the emphasis on sandstone and brick, both locally produced and delightful detail which reflects the skilled craftsmanship prevalent in the 19th century.\\r\\nAmherst's prosperity would not last as the failed economic policies of the federal and provincial governments, coupled with World War I, saw the town's industrial economy begin a slow decline during the 1910s. A prisoner-of-war and enemy alien camp was set up at Malleable Iron Foundry in Amherst from April 1915 to September 1919,[3] and Russian revolutionary Leon Trotsky was incarcerated there for one month after he was arrested in Halifax, Nova Scotia in April 1917.[4][5] Trotsky was transferred to the isolated Kapuskasing Interment Camp in northern Ontario until his release and expulsion after Soviet Russia signed the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk, ending their involvement in the war.\\r\\nDuring the Amherst general strike in 1919, worker unrest over social and economic conditions led to mass protests in sympathy with the Winnipeg general strike.\\r\\nThe eventual closure of companies such as Robb Engineering & Manufacturing (purchased by Canada Car and Foundry and then closed) and Amherst Pianos, among others led to a resignation of lost dreams as the town was overtaken by other newer manufacturing centres in central Canada during the 20th century. Amherst had a modest-sized industrial park constructed during the 1960s when the Trans-Canada Highway was being developed. Today the majority of the town's major employers are located there, including PolyCello and IMP Aerospace.\\r\\nDuring World War II, the Royal Canadian Navy named a Flower class corvette HMCS Amherst.\\r\\nThe town is currently served by Via Rail's Halifax-to-Montreal train Ocean.\\r\\nAmherst is the retail centre for Cumberland County and the southeastern part of Westmorland County (New Brunswick). The town has several big box stores, including Walmart, Sobeys, Atlantic Superstore, Canadian Tire, Kent Building Supplies, Giant Tiger and Dollarama in addition to several fast food restaurants and auto dealerships. Shoppers Drug Mart was the town's anchor pharmacy retail until its closure on October 8, 2015 due to the long periods of declining profits and change of shopping habits. Zellers was a long time anchor store in the area until the purchase of the majority of the chain by Target which promptly announced the closure of many Zellers locations in smaller centers such as Amherst. There are also smaller independent retailers and restaurants in the downtown area, situated among various historic buildings. The town's location on Highway 104 (part of the Trans-Canada Highway) has transformed South Albion Street and Robert Angus Drive into a highway service centre. Liberty Enterprises Limited, started in 1973, operates a brass and aluminum foundry.[6]\\r\\nAmherst is home of the Amherst Ramblers, a Junior A Hockey League team from the Maritime Hockey League. All home games are played out of the 2,500 seat Amherst Stadium. The season usually runs from mid-September to early March every year.

Villeins had more rights and status than those in slavery, but were under a number of legal restrictions which differentiated them from the freeman.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nVillein, or villain, was a term used in the feudal era to denote a peasant (tenant farmer) who was legally tied to a lord of the manor?ÿ a villein in gross?ÿ or in the case of a villein regardant to a manor.[1] Villeins occupied the social space between a free peasant (or \\"freeman\\") and a slave. The majority of medieval European peasants were villeins. An alternative term is serf, from the Latin servus, meaning \\"slave\\". A villein was thus a bonded tenant, so could not leave the land without the landowner's consent.\\r\\nThe term derives from Late Latin villanus, meaning a man employed at a Roman villa rustica, or large agricultural estate. The system of tied serfdom originates from a decree issued by the late Roman Emperor Diocletian (ruled 284ÿ305) in an attempt to prevent the flight of peasants from the land and the consequent decline in food production. The decree obliged peasants to register in their locality and never leave it; they could leave their villages only to deliver a message or to accompany their lord to war.\\r\\nBecause of the low status, the term became derogatory. In modern French vilain means \\"ugly\\" or \\"naughty\\" and in Italian, villano means \\"rude\\" or \\"ill-mannered\\". For the Spanish villano, the RAE preserves the definition of \\"neighbor or inhabitant of a village or town\\", but it also accepts the derogatory use, which is very similar to English usage; in modern English villain means a scoundrel, criminal or a lawless member of society.\\r\\nVilleinage was important and commonplace in the European Middle Ages, though it was later superseded in most of Western Europe.\\r\\nVilleins generally rented small homes, with or without land. As part of the contract with their landlord, they were expected to use some of their time to farm the lord's demesne or provide other services, possibly in addition to a rent of money or goods. These services could be very onerous. Villeins might also be required to pay a fine on the marriage of their daughters outside of the manor, the inheritance of a holding by a son, or other circumstances. Villeins were tied to the land and could not move away without their lord's consent.\\r\\nHowever, except to their own lords, they were free men in the eyes of the law. Villeins were generally able to have their own property, unlike slaves.\\r\\nVilleinage, as opposed to other forms of serfdom, was most common in Western European feudalism, where land ownership had developed from roots in Roman law.\\r\\nA variety of kinds of villeinage existed in the European Middle Ages, and it is impossible to arrive at a precise definition which satisfies them all. Different times and countries dealt with villeinage in slightly different ways. Some villeins had clearly defined and limited responsibilities to their lords, while others were essentially at their whim.\\r\\nThe array of restrictions and taxes seems harsh and arbitrary to modern minds. However, it makes sense if one views the medieval manor as an economic unit. For instance, the marriage of a daughter away meant the loss of an able-bodied worker to the village.\\r\\nVilleinage was not always an involuntary arrangement. In the early Middle Ages families entered villeinage voluntarily, to guarantee tenure of land. And while villeins were heavily restricted in what they could do, it was also possible for them to gain manumission. Many villeins were in villeinage because of the land they held, rather than by birth, and could become free men if their lord agreed with them to move them to a different holding.\\r\\nVilleinage was not a purely exploitative relationship. In the Middle Ages, land guaranteed sustenance and survival; being a villein guaranteed access to land. Landlords, even where legally able to, rarely evicted villeins because of the value of their labour. Villeinage was much preferable to being a vagabond, a slave, or an unlanded labourer.\\r\\nVilleinage became progressively less common through the Middle Ages, particularly after the Black Death reduced the rural population and increased the bargaining power of workers. Furthermore, the lords of many manors were willing (for payment) to manumit their villeins. It had largely died out in England by 1500 as a personal status, but land held by villein tenure (unless enfranchised) continued to be held by what was henceforth known as a copyhold tenancy, which was not abolished until 1925. Villeinage continued in France until 1789.\\r\\nIn Scandinavia, being crofter (torpare) has been the quite similar position, being torp holders.\\r\\nNotes","input":"What is the difference between a villain and a freeman?"},{"output":"late Latin name derived from rosa","context":"\\r\\n\\r\\nRose is a given female name.

It was the first newspaper printed in Asia, and was published for two years, before the East India Company seized the newspaper's types and printing press. Founded by James Augustus Hicky, a highly eccentric Irishman who had previously spent two years in jail for debt, the newspaper was a strong critic of the administration of the Governor General Warren Hastings. The newspaper was important for its provocative journalism well before its time and its fight for free expression in India.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nHicky began publication of Hicky's Bengal Gazette on January 29, 1780, having first printed a prospectus announcing that he would begin printing a newspaper. The idea of printing a newspaper in India had been first floated twelve years earlier by the Dutch Adventurer William Bolts, but Hicky was to execute the concept.\\r\\nHicky first maintained a neutral editing policy (his slogan was \\"Open to all Parties, but Influenced by None\\") but after he learned that competitors with ties to the East India Company were intending to launch a rival newspaper,The India Gazette, he changed his editorial stance. Hicky accused an East India Company employee, Simeon Droz, of supporting the India Gazette as punishment for Hicky's refusal to pay a bribe to Droz and Marian Hastings, Warren Hastings' wife. In retaliation for Hicky's accusation, Hastings' Supreme Council forbid Hicky from mailing his newspaper through the post office.\\r\\nHicky claimed Hastings' order violated his right to free expression, and accused Hastings of corruption, tyranny, and even erectile dysfunction. Hicky also accused other British leaders in Calcutta of corruption, including the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of Judicature at Fort William, Elijah Impey of taking bribes, and the leader of the Protestant Mission, Johann Zacharias Kiernander of stealing from an orphaned children's fund. Hicky's editorial independence was short lived as Hastings and Kiernander sued him for libel. After four dramatic trials in June 1781, the Supreme Court found Hicky guilty and sentenced him to jail.\\r\\nHicky continued to print his newspaper from jail, and continued to accuse Hastings and others of corruption. He was finally suppressed when Hastings instituted fresh law suits against him. Hicky's Bengal Gazette ceased publication on March 23, 1782 when its types were seized by an order of the Supreme Court.\\r\\nHicky's Bengal Gazette was known for its sarcastic and provocative writing style. Unlike many newspapers of its time, the newspaper discussed taboo topics like female masturbation, and proto-class consciousness, arguing for the rights of the poor and the right to taxation with representation. It was strongly anti-war and anti-colonial and routinely ridiculed East India Company leadership for their expansionist and imperialist objectives.\\r\\nThe memoirist William Hickey (who, confusingly, was not in fact related to the paper's founder) describes its establishment shortly after he had succeeded (in his capacity as an attorney-at-law) in having James Hicky released from debtor's jail:\\r\\n\\"At the time I first saw Hicky he had been about seven years in India. During his confinement he met with a treatise upon printing, from which he collected sufficient information to commence [as a] printer, there never having been a press in Calcutta ... it occurred to Hicky that great benefit might arise from setting on foot a public newspaper, nothing of that kind ever having appeared. Upon his types &c., therefore reaching him, he issued proposals for printing a weekly paper, which, meeting with extraordinary encouragement, he speedily issued his first work. As a novelty every person read it, and was delighted. Possessing a fund of low wit, his paper abounded with proof of that talent. He had also a happy knack at applying appropriate nicknames and relating satirical anecdotes\\".[1]\\r\\nHicky benefited little from the paper, as William Hickey further tells us that he allowed it \\"to become the channel of personal invective, and the most scurrilous abuse of individuals of all ranks, high and low, rich and poor, many were attacked in the most wanton and cruel manner ...

Its diameter is approximately 945 kilometers (587 miles),[6] making it the largest of the minor planets within the orbit of Neptune. The 33rd-largest known body in the Solar System, it is the only dwarf planet within the orbit of Neptune.[c][19] Composed of rock and ice, Ceres is estimated to compose approximately one third of the mass of the entire asteroid belt. Ceres is the only object in the asteroid belt known to be rounded by its own gravity (though detailed analysis was required to exclude 4 Vesta). From Earth, the apparent magnitude of Ceres ranges from 6.7 to 9.3, and hence even at its brightest it is too dim to be seen with the naked eye except under extremely dark skies.\\r\\nCeres was the first asteroid to be discovered (by Giuseppe Piazzi at Palermo on 1 January 1801). It was originally considered a planet, but was reclassified as an asteroid in the 1850s after many other objects in similar orbits were discovered.\\r\\nCeres appears to be differentiated into a rocky core and an icy mantle, and may have a remnant internal ocean of liquid water under the layer of ice.[20][21] The surface is probably a mixture of water ice and various hydrated minerals such as carbonates and clay. In January 2014, emissions of water vapor were detected from several regions of Ceres.[22] This was unexpected because large bodies in the asteroid belt typically do not emit vapor, a hallmark of comets.\\r\\nThe robotic NASA spacecraft Dawn entered orbit around Ceres on 6 March 2015.[23][24][25] Pictures with a resolution previously unattained were taken during imaging sessions starting in January 2015 as Dawn approached Ceres, showing a cratered surface. Two distinct bright spots (or high-albedo features) inside a crater (different from the bright spots observed in earlier Hubble images[26]) were seen in a 19 February 2015 image, leading to speculation about a possible cryovolcanic origin[27][28][29] or outgassing.[30] On 3 March 2015, a NASA spokesperson said the spots are consistent with highly reflective materials containing ice or salts, but that cryovolcanism is unlikely.[31] However, on 2 September 2016, NASA scientists released a paper in Science that claimed that a massive ice volcano called Ahuna Mons is the strongest evidence yet for the existence of these mysterious ice volcanoes.[32][33] On 11 May 2015, NASA released a higher-resolution image showing that, instead of one or two spots, there are actually several.[34] On 9 December 2015, NASA scientists reported that the bright spots on Ceres may be related to a type of salt, particularly a form of brine containing magnesium sulfate hexahydrite (MgSO4{6H2O); the spots were also found to be associated with ammonia-rich clays.[35] In June 2016, near-infrared spectra of these bright areas were found to be consistent with a large amount of sodium carbonate (Na\\r\\n2CO\\r\\n3), implying that recent geologic activity was probably involved in the creation of the bright spots.[36][37][38]\\r\\nIn October 2015, NASA released a true color portrait of Ceres made by Dawn.[39] In February 2017, organics were reported to have been detected on Ceres in Ernutet crater (see image).[40]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nJohann Elert Bode, in 1772, first suggested that an undiscovered planet could exist between the orbits of Mars and Jupiter.[41] Kepler had already noticed the gap between Mars and Jupiter in 1596.[41] Bode based his idea on the TitiusÿBode law which is a now-discredited hypothesis that was first proposed in 1766. Bode observed that there was a regular pattern in the semi-major axes of the orbits of known planets, and that the pattern was marred only by the large gap between Mars and Jupiter.[41][42] The pattern predicted that the missing planet ought to have an orbit with a semi-major axis near 2.8 astronomical units (AU).[42] William Herschel's discovery of Uranus in 1781[41] near the predicted distance for the next body beyond Saturn increased faith in the law of Titius and Bode, and in 1800, a group headed by Franz Xaver von Zach, editor of the Monatliche Correspondenz, sent requests to twenty-four experienced astronomers (whom he dubbed the \\"celestial police\\"), asking that they combine their efforts and begin a methodical search for the expected planet.[41][42] Although they did not discover Ceres, they later found several large asteroids.[42]\\r\\nOne of the astronomers selected for the search was Giuseppe Piazzi, a Catholic priest at the Academy of Palermo, Sicily. Before receiving his invitation to join the group, Piazzi discovered Ceres on 1 January 1801.[43][44] He was searching for \\"the 87th [star] of the Catalogue of the Zodiacal stars of Mr la Caille\\", but found that \\"it was preceded by another\\".[41] Instead of a star, Piazzi had found a moving star-like object, which he first thought was a comet.[45] Piazzi observed Ceres a total of 24 times, the final time on 11 February 1801, when illness interrupted his observations. He announced his discovery on 24 January 1801 in letters to only two fellow astronomers, his compatriot Barnaba Oriani of Milan and Bode of Berlin.[46] He reported it as a comet but \\"since its movement is so slow and rather uniform, it has occurred to me several times that it might be something better than a comet\\".[41] In April, Piazzi sent his complete observations to Oriani, Bode, and Jr?me Lalande in Paris. The information was published in the September 1801 issue of the Monatliche Correspondenz.[45]\\r\\nBy this time, the apparent position of Ceres had changed (mostly due to Earth's orbital motion), and was too close to the Sun's glare for other astronomers to confirm Piazzi's observations. Toward the end of the year, Ceres should have been visible again, but after such a long time it was difficult to predict its exact position. To recover Ceres, Carl Friedrich Gauss, then 24 years old, developed an efficient method of orbit determination.[45] In only a few weeks, he predicted the path of Ceres and sent his results to von Zach. On 31 December 1801, von Zach and Heinrich W. M. Olbers found Ceres near the predicted position and thus recovered it.[45]\\r\\nThe early observers were only able to calculate the size of Ceres to within an order of magnitude. Herschel underestimated its diameter as 260?km in 1802, whereas in 1811 Johann Hieronymus Schr?ter overestimated it as 2,613?km.[47][48]\\r\\nPiazzi originally suggested the name Cerere Ferdinandea for his discovery, after the goddess Ceres (Roman goddess of agriculture, Cerere in Italian, who was believed to have originated in Sicily and whose oldest temple was there) and King Ferdinand of Sicily.[41][45] \\"Ferdinandea\\", however, was not acceptable to other nations and was dropped. Ceres was called Hera for a short time in Germany.[49] In Greece, it is called Demeter (?׻Ҷϫ), after the Greek equivalent of the Roman Cers;[d] in English, that name is used for the asteroid 1108 Demeter.\\r\\nThe regular adjectival forms of the name are Cererian and Cererean,[50] derived from the Latin genitive Cereris,[2] but Ceresian is occasionally seen for the goddess (as in the sickle-shaped Ceresian Lake), as is the shorter form Cerean.\\r\\nThe old astronomical symbol of Ceres is a sickle, ??? (),[51] similar to Venus' symbol ?? but with a break in the circle. It has a variant ?  ?, reversed under the influence of the initial letter 'C' of 'Ceres'. These were later replaced with the generic asteroid symbol of a numbered disk, ??.[45][52]\\r\\nCerium, a rare-earth element discovered in 1803, was named after Ceres.[53][e] In the same year another element was also initially named after Ceres, but when cerium was named, its discoverer changed the name to palladium, after the second asteroid, 2 Pallas.[55]\\r\\nThe categorization of Ceres has changed more than once and has been the subject of some disagreement. Johann Elert Bode believed Ceres to be the \\"missing planet\\" he had proposed to exist between Mars and Jupiter, at a distance of 419?million?km (2.8?AU) from the Sun.[41] Ceres was assigned a planetary symbol, and remained listed as a planet in astronomy books and tables (along with 2 Pallas, 3 Juno, and 4 Vesta) for half a century.[41][45][56]\\r\\nAs other objects were discovered in the neighborhood of Ceres, it was realized that Ceres represented the first of a new class of objects.[41] In 1802, with the discovery of 2 Pallas, William Herschel coined the term asteroid (\\"star-like\\") for these bodies,[56] writing that \\"they resemble small stars so much as hardly to be distinguished from them, even by very good telescopes\\".[57] As the first such body to be discovered, Ceres was given the designation 1 Ceres under the modern system of minor-planet designations. By the 1860s, the existence of a fundamental difference between asteroids such as Ceres and the major planets was widely accepted, though a precise definition of \\"planet\\" was never formulated.[56]\\r\\nThe 2006 debate surrounding Pluto and what constitutes a planet led to Ceres being considered for reclassification as a planet.[58][59] A proposal before the International Astronomical Union for the definition of a planet would have defined a planet as \\"a celestial body that (a) has sufficient mass for its self-gravity to overcome rigid-body forces so that it assumes a hydrostatic equilibrium (nearly round) shape, and (b) is in orbit around a star, and is neither a star nor a satellite of a planet\\".[60] Had this resolution been adopted, it would have made Ceres the fifth planet in order from the Sun.[61] This never happened, however, and on 24 August 2006 a modified definition was adopted, carrying the additional requirement that a planet must have \\"cleared the neighborhood around its orbit\\". By this definition, Ceres is not a planet because it does not dominate its orbit, sharing it as it does with the thousands of other asteroids in the asteroid belt and constituting only about a third of the mass of the belt. Bodies that met the first proposed definition but not the second, such as Ceres, were instead classified as dwarf planets.\\r\\nCeres is the largest object in the asteroid belt.[13] It is sometimes assumed that Ceres has been reclassified as a dwarf planet, and that it is therefore no longer considered an asteroid. For example, a news update at Space.com spoke of \\"Pallas, the largest asteroid, and Ceres, the dwarf planet formerly classified as an asteroid\\",[62] whereas an IAU question-and-answer posting states, \\"Ceres is (or now we can say it was) the largest asteroid\\", though it then speaks of \\"other asteroids\\" crossing Ceres' path and otherwise implies that Ceres is still considered an asteroid.[63] The Minor Planet Center notes that such bodies may have dual designations.[64] The 2006 IAU decision that classified Ceres as a dwarf planet never addressed whether it is or is not an asteroid. Indeed, the IAU has never defined the word 'asteroid' at all, having preferred the term 'minor planet' until 2006, and preferring the terms 'small Solar System body' and 'dwarf planet' after 2006. Lang (2011) comments \\"the [IAU has] added a new designation to Ceres, classifying it as a dwarf planet.?... By [its] definition, Eris, Haumea, Makemake and Pluto, as well as the largest asteroid, 1 Ceres, are all dwarf planets\\", and describes it elsewhere as \\"the dwarf planetÿasteroid 1 Ceres\\".[65] NASA continues to refer to Ceres as an asteroid,[66] as do various academic textbooks.[67][68]\\r\\nCeres follows an orbit between Mars and Jupiter, within the asteroid belt, with a period of 4.6 Earth years.[4] The orbit is moderately inclined (i = 10.6 compared to 7 for Mercury and 17 for Pluto) and moderately eccentric (e = 0.08 compared to 0.09 for Mars).[4]\\r\\nThe diagram illustrates the orbits of Ceres (blue) and several planets (white and gray).

In this diagram (but not in general), the perihelion of Mars is on the opposite side of the Sun from those of Ceres and several of the large main-belt asteroids, including 2 Pallas and 10 Hygiea. The bottom diagram is a side view showing the inclination of the orbit of Ceres compared to the orbits of Mars and Jupiter.\\r\\nCeres was once thought to be a member of an asteroid family.[69] The asteroids of this family share similar proper orbital elements, which may indicate a common origin through an asteroid collision some time in the past. Ceres was later found to have spectral properties different from other members of the family, which is now called the Gefion family after the next-lowest-numbered family member, 1272 Gefion.[69] Ceres appears to be merely an interloper in the Gefion family, coincidentally having similar orbital elements but not a common origin.[70]\\r\\nCeres is in a near-1:1 mean-motion orbital resonance with Pallas (their proper orbital periods differ by 0.2%).[71] However, a true resonance between the two would be unlikely; due to their small masses relative to their large separations, such relationships among asteroids are very rare.[72] Nevertheless, Ceres is able to capture other asteroids into temporary 1:1 resonant orbital relationships (making them temporary trojans) for periods up to 2 million years or more; fifty such objects have been identified.[73]\\r\\nMercury, Venus, Earth, and Mars can all appear to cross the Sun, or transit it, from a vantage point on Ceres. The most common transits are those of Mercury, which usually happen every few years, most recently in 2006 and 2010. The most recent transit of Venus was in 1953, and the next will be in 2051; the corresponding dates are 1814 and 2081 for transits of Earth, and 767 and 2684 for transits of Mars.[74]\\r\\nThe rotation period of Ceres (the Cererian day) is 9 hours and 4?minutes.[75] It has an axial tilt of 4. This is small enough for Ceres's polar regions to contain permanently shadowed craters that are expected to act as cold traps and accumulate water ice over time, similar to the situation on the Moon and Mercury. About 0.14% of water molecules released from the surface are expected to end up in the traps, hopping an average of 3 times before escaping or being trapped.[76]\\r\\nCeres has a mass of 7020939000000000000?9.39G1020?kg as determined from the Dawn spacecraft.[77] With this mass Ceres composes approximately a third of the estimated total 3.0?I?0.2G1021?kg mass of the asteroid belt,[78] which is in turn approximately 4% of the mass of the Moon. Ceres is massive enough to give it a nearly spherical, equilibrium shape.[79] Among Solar System bodies, Ceres is intermediate in size between the smaller Vesta and the larger Tethys. Its surface area is approximately the same as the land area of India or Argentina.[80]\\r\\nThe surface composition of Ceres is broadly similar to that of C-type asteroids.[13] Some differences do exist. The ubiquitous features in Ceres' IR spectrum are those of hydrated materials, which indicate the presence of significant amounts of water in its interior. Other possible surface constituents include iron-rich clay minerals (cronstedtite) and carbonate minerals (dolomite and siderite), which are common minerals in carbonaceous chondrite meteorites.[13] The spectral features of carbonates and clay minerals are usually absent in the spectra of other C-type asteroids.[13] Sometimes Ceres is classified as a G-type asteroid.[81]\\r\\nCeres' surface is relatively warm. The maximum temperature with the Sun overhead was estimated from measurements to be 235?K (approximately ?38?C, ?36?F) on 5 May 1991.[17] Ice is unstable at this temperature. Material left behind by the sublimation of surface ice could explain the dark surface of Ceres compared to the icy moons of the outer Solar System.\\r\\nStudies by the Hubble Space Telescope reveal that graphite, sulfur, and sulfur dioxide are present on Ceres's surface. The former is evidently the result of space weathering on Ceres's older surfaces; the latter two are volatile under Cerean conditions and would be expected to either escape quickly or settle in cold traps, and are evidently associated with areas with recent geological activity.[82]\\r\\nPrior to the Dawn mission, only a few surface features had been unambiguously detected on Ceres. High-resolution ultraviolet Hubble Space Telescope images taken in 1995 showed a dark spot on its surface, which was nicknamed \\"Piazzi\\" in honor of the discoverer of Ceres.[81] This was thought to be a crater. Later near-infrared images with a higher resolution taken over a whole rotation with the Keck telescope using adaptive optics showed several bright and dark features moving with Ceres' rotation.[83][84] Two dark features had circular shapes and were presumed to be craters; one of them was observed to have a bright central region, whereas another was identified as the \\"Piazzi\\" feature.[83][84] Visible-light Hubble Space Telescope images of a full rotation taken in 2003 and 2004 showed eleven recognizable surface features, the natures of which were then undetermined.[12][85] One of these features corresponds to the \\"Piazzi\\" feature observed earlier.[12]\\r\\nThese last observations indicated that the north pole of Ceres pointed in the direction of right ascension 19?h 24?min (291), declination +59, in the constellation Draco, resulting in an axial tilt of approximately 3.[12][79] Dawn later determined that the north polar axis actually points at right ascension 19?h 25?m 40.3?s (291.418), declination +66 45' 50\\" (about 1.5 degrees from Delta Draconis), which means an axial tilt of 4.[6]\\r\\nDawn revealed that Ceres has a heavily cratered surface; nevertheless, Ceres does not have as many large craters as expected, likely due to past geological processes.[86][87] An unexpectedly large number of Cererian craters have central pits, perhaps due to cryovolcanic processes, and many have central peaks.[88] Ceres has one prominent mountain, Ahuna Mons; this peak appears to be a cryovolcano and has few craters, suggesting a maximum age of no more than a few hundred million years.[89][90] A later computer simulation has suggested that there were originally other cryovolcanoes on Ceres that are now unrecognisable due to viscous relaxation.[91] Several bright spots have been observed by Dawn, the brightest spot (\\"Spot 5\\") located in the middle of an 80-kilometer (50?mi) crater called Occator.[92] From images taken of Ceres on 4 May 2015, the secondary bright spot was revealed to actually be a group of scattered bright areas, possibly as many as ten. These bright features have an albedo of approximately 40%[93] that are caused by a substance on the surface, possibly ice or salts, reflecting sunlight.[94][95] A haze periodically appears above Spot 5, the best known bright spot, supporting the hypothesis that some sort of outgassing or sublimating ice formed the bright spots.[95][96] In March 2016, Dawn found definitive evidence of water molecules on the surface of Ceres at Oxo crater.[97][98] JPL states: \\"This water could be bound up in minerals or, alternatively, it could take the form of ice.\\"\\r\\nOn 9 December 2015, NASA scientists reported that the bright spots on Ceres may be related to a type of salt, particularly a form of brine containing magnesium sulfate hexahydrite (MgSO4{6H2O); the spots were also found to be associated with ammonia-rich clays.[35] Another team thinks the salts are sodium carbonate.[37][38]\\r\\nCeres' oblateness is consistent with a differentiated body, a rocky core overlain with an icy mantle.[79] This 100-kilometer-thick mantle (23%ÿ28% of Ceres by mass; 50% by volume)[100] contains up to 200?million cubic kilometers of water, which would be more than the amount of fresh water on Earth.[101] This result is supported by the observations made by the Keck telescope in 2002 and by evolutionary modeling.[20][83] Also, some characteristics of its surface and history (such as its distance from the Sun, which weakened solar radiation enough to allow some fairly low-freezing-point components to be incorporated during its formation), point to the presence of volatile materials in the interior of Ceres.[83] It has been suggested that a remnant layer of liquid water may have survived to the present under a layer of ice.[20][21]\\r\\nShape and gravity field measurements by Dawn confirm Ceres is a body in hydrostatic equilibrium with partial differentiation[8][102] and isostatic compensation, with a mean moment of inertia of 0.37 (which is similar to that of Callisto at ~0.36).[9] The densities of the core and outer layer are estimated to be 2.46ÿ2.90 and 1.68ÿ1.95 g/cm3, with the latter being about 70ÿ190?km thick. Only partial dehydration of the core is expected. The high density of the outer layer (relative to water ice) reflects its enrichment in silicates and salts.[9] Ceres is the smallest object confirmed to be in hydrostatic equilibrium, being 600?km smaller and less than half the mass of Saturn's moon Rhea, the next smallest such object.[103] Modeling has suggested Ceres could have a small metallic core from partial differentiation of its rocky fraction.[104]\\r\\nThere are indications that Ceres has a tenuous water vapor atmosphere outgassing from water ice on the surface.[105][106][107]\\r\\nSurface water ice is unstable at distances less than 5 AU from the Sun,[108] so it is expected to sublime if it is exposed directly to solar radiation. Water ice can migrate from the deep layers of Ceres to the surface, but escapes in a very short time. As a result, it is difficult to detect water vaporization. Water escaping from polar regions of Ceres was possibly observed in the early 1990s but this has not been unambiguously demonstrated. It may be possible to detect escaping water from the surroundings of a fresh impact crater or from cracks in the subsurface layers of Ceres.[83] Ultraviolet observations by the IUE spacecraft detected statistically significant amounts of hydroxide ions near Ceres' north pole, which is a product of water vapor dissociation by ultraviolet solar radiation.[105]\\r\\nIn early 2014, using data from the Herschel Space Observatory, it was discovered that there are several localized (not more than 60?km in diameter) mid-latitude sources of water vapor on Ceres, which each give off approximately 7026100000000000000?1026 molecules (or 3?kg) of water per second.[109][110][f] Two potential source regions, designated Piazzi (123E, 21N) and Region A (231E, 23N), have been visualized in the near infrared as dark areas (Region A also has a bright center) by the W. M. Keck Observatory. Possible mechanisms for the vapor release are sublimation from approximately 0.6?km2 of exposed surface ice, or cryovolcanic eruptions resulting from radiogenic internal heat[109] or from pressurization of a subsurface ocean due to growth of an overlying layer of ice.[21] Surface sublimation would be expected to be lower when Ceres is farther from the Sun in its orbit, whereas internally powered emissions should not be affected by its orbital position. The limited data available was more consistent with cometary-style sublimation;[109] however, subsequent evidence from Dawn strongly suggests ongoing geologic activity could be at least partially responsible.[113][114]\\r\\nStudies using Dawn's gamma ray and neutron detector (GRaND) reveal that Ceres is accelerating electrons from the solar wind regularly; although there are several possibilities as to what is causing this, the most accepted is that these electrons are being accelerated by collisions between the solar wind and a tenuous water vapor exosphere.[115]\\r\\nIn 2017, Dawn confirmed that Ceres has a transient atmosphere that appears to be linked to solar activity. Ice on Ceres can sublimate when energetic particles from the Sun hit exposed ice within craters.[116]\\r\\nCeres is possibly a surviving protoplanet (planetary embryo), which formed 4.57?billion years ago in the asteroid belt.[20] Although the majority of inner Solar System protoplanets (including all lunar- to Mars-sized bodies) either merged with other protoplanets to form terrestrial planets or were ejected from the Solar System by Jupiter,[117] Ceres is thought to have survived relatively intact.[20] An alternative theory proposes that Ceres formed in the Kuiper belt and later migrated to the asteroid belt.[118] The discovery of ammonia salts in Occator crater supports an origin in the outer Solar System.[119] Another possible protoplanet, Vesta, is less than half the size of Ceres; it suffered a major impact after solidifying, losing ~1% of its mass.[120]\\r\\nThe geological evolution of Ceres was dependent on the heat sources available during and after its formation: friction from planetesimal accretion, and decay of various radionuclides (possibly including short-lived extinct radionuclides such as aluminium-26). These are thought to have been sufficient to allow Ceres to differentiate into a rocky core and icy mantle soon after its formation.[12][20] This process may have caused resurfacing by water volcanism and tectonics, erasing older geological features.[20] Ceres's relatively warm surface temperature implies that any of the resulting ice on its surface would have gradually sublimated, leaving behind various hydrated minerals like clay minerals and carbonates.[13]\\r\\nToday, Ceres has become considerably less geologically active, with a surface sculpted chiefly by impacts;[12] nevertheless, evidence from Dawn reveals that internal processes have continued to sculpt Ceres's surface to a significant extent, in stark contrast to Vesta[121] and of previous expectations that Ceres would have become geologically dead early in its history due to its small size.[20][122] The presence of significant amounts of water ice in its composition[79] and evidence of recent geological resurfacing, raises the possibility that Ceres has a layer of liquid water in its interior.[20][122] This hypothetical layer is often called an ocean.[13] If such a layer of liquid water exists, it is hypothesized to be located between the rocky core and ice mantle like that of the theorized ocean on Europa.[20] The existence of an ocean is more likely if solutes (i.e. salts), ammonia, sulfuric acid or other antifreeze compounds are dissolved in the water.[20]\\r\\nAlthough not as actively discussed as a potential home for microbial extraterrestrial life as Mars, Titan, Europa or Enceladus, there is evidence that Ceres' icy mantle was once a watery subterranean ocean, and that has led to speculations that life could have existed there,[123][124][125][126] and that hypothesized ejecta bearing microorganisms could have come from Ceres to Earth.[127][128]\\r\\nWhen Ceres has an opposition near the perihelion, it can reach a visual magnitude of +6.7.[14] This is generally regarded as too dim to be seen with the naked eye, but under exceptional viewing conditions a very sharp-sighted person may be able to see it. The only other asteroids that can reach a similarly bright magnitude are 4 Vesta, and, during rare oppositions near perihelion, 2 Pallas and 7 Iris.[130] At a conjunction Ceres has a magnitude of around +9.3, which corresponds to the faintest objects visible with 10G50 binoculars. It can thus be seen with binoculars whenever it is above the horizon of a fully dark sky.\\r\\nSome notable observations and milestones for Ceres include:\\r\\nIn 1981, a proposal for an asteroid mission was submitted to the European Space Agency (ESA). Named the Asteroidal Gravity Optical and Radar Analysis (AGORA), this spacecraft was to launch some time in 1990ÿ1994 and perform two flybys of large asteroids. The preferred target for this mission was Vesta. AGORA would reach the asteroid belt either by a gravitational slingshot trajectory past Mars or by means of a small ion engine. However, the proposal was refused by ESA. A joint NASAÿESA asteroid mission was then drawn up for a Multiple Asteroid Orbiter with Solar Electric Propulsion (MAOSEP), with one of the mission profiles including an orbit of Vesta. NASA indicated they were not interested in an asteroid mission. Instead, ESA set up a technological study of a spacecraft with an ion drive. Other missions to the asteroid belt were proposed in the 1980s by France, Germany, Italy, and the United States, but none were approved.[135] Exploration of Ceres by fly-by and impacting penetrator was the second main target of the second plan of the multiaimed Soviet Vesta mission, developed in cooperation with European countries for realisation in 1991ÿ1994 but canceled due to the Soviet Union disbanding.\\r\\nIn the early 1990s, NASA initiated the Discovery Program, which was intended to be a series of low-cost scientific missions. In 1996, the program's study team recommended as a high priority a mission to explore the asteroid belt using a spacecraft with an ion engine. Funding for this program remained problematic for several years, but by 2004 the Dawn vehicle had passed its critical design review.[136]\\r\\nIt was launched on 27 September 2007, as the space mission to make the first visits to both Vesta and Ceres. On 3 May 2011, Dawn acquired its first targeting image 1.2 million kilometers from Vesta.[137] After orbiting Vesta for 13 months, Dawn used its ion engine to depart for Ceres, with gravitational capture occurring on 6 March 2015[138] at a separation of 61,000?km,[139] four months prior to the New Horizons flyby of Pluto.\\r\\nDawn's mission profile calls for it to study Ceres from a series of circular polar orbits at successively lower altitudes. It entered its first observational orbit (\\"RC3\\") around Ceres at an altitude of 13,500?km on 23 April 2015, staying for only approximately one orbit (fifteen days).[25][140] The spacecraft will subsequently reduce its orbital distance to 4,400?km for its second observational orbit (\\"survey\\") for three weeks,[141] then down to 1,470?km (\\"HAMO;\\" high altitude mapping orbit) for two months[142] and then down to its final orbit at 375?km (\\"LAMO;\\" low altitude mapping orbit) for at least three months.[143] The spacecraft instrumentation includes a framing camera, a visual and infrared spectrometer, and a gamma-ray and neutron detector. These instruments will examine Ceres' shape and elemental composition.[144] On 13 January 2015, Dawn took the first images of Ceres at near-Hubble resolution, revealing impact craters and a small high-albedo spot on the surface, near the same location as that observed previously. Additional imaging sessions, at increasingly better resolution took place on 25 January, 4, 12, 19, and 25 February, 1 March, and 10 and 15 April.[145]\\r\\nDawn's arrival in a stable orbit around Ceres was delayed after, close to reaching Ceres, it was hit by a cosmic ray, making it take another, longer route around Ceres in back, instead of a direct spiral towards it.[146]\\r\\nThe Chinese Space Agency is designing a sample retrieval mission from Ceres that would take place during the 2020s.[147]\\r\\nThe following imagemap of the dwarf planet Ceres is divided into 15 quadrangles. They are named after the first craters whose names the IAU approved in July 2015.[149] The map image(s) were taken by the Dawn space probe.\\r\\n2004\\r\\nHubble Space Telescope\\r\\n14 April 2015; Dawn\\r\\n22,000?km (14,000?mi)\\r\\n6 May 2015; Dawn\\r\\n13,600?km (8,500?mi)\\r\\n16 May 2015; Dawn\\r\\n7,500?km (4,700?mi)\\r\\n(1;2;3)\\r\\n22 May 2015; Dawn\\r\\n5,100?km (3,200?mi)\\r\\n(1;2;3;4;5) (Ezinu crater: context;closeup)\\r\\n23 April 2015; Dawn\\r\\n1st Map Orbit - RC3\\r\\n13,600?km (8,500?mi)\\r\\n(1;2;3;4;5;6;7;8;9;10;11;12;13;14;15;16;17;18;19;20;21;22;23;24) (3D: 1;5;6;7) (animation)\\r\\n6 June 2015: Dawn\\r\\n2nd Map Orbit - SRVY\\r\\n4,400?km (2,700?mi)\\r\\n(1;2;3;4;5;6;7;8;9;10;11;12;13;14;15;16;17;18;19;20;21;22;23;24;25;26;27;28;29;30;31;32;33;34;35;36;37;38;39;40;41;42;43;44;45;46;47;48;49;50;51;52;53;54)\\r\\n17 August 2015: Dawn\\r\\n3rd Map Orbit - HAMO\\r\\n1,470?km (910?mi)\\r\\n(1;2;3;4;5;6;7;8;9;10;11;12;13;14;15;16;17;18;19;20;21;22;23;24;25;26;27;28;29;30;31;32;33;34;35;36;37;38;39;40;41;42;43;44;45;46;47;48;49;50;51;52;53;54;55;56;57;58;59;60;61;62;63;64;65;66;67;68;69;70;71;72;73;74;75;76;77;78;79;80;81;82;83;84;85;86;87;88;89)\\r\\n10 Dec 2015: Dawn\\r\\n4th Map Orbit - LAMOa\\r\\n385?km (239?mi)\\r\\n(a;b;c;d;e;1;2;3;4;5;6;7;8;9;10;11;12;13;14;15;16;17;18;19;20;21;22;23;24;25;26;27;28;29;30;31;32;33;34;35;36;37;38;39;40;m1;m2;m3;41;42;43;44;45;46;47;48;49;50;51;52;53;54;55;56;57;58;59;60;61;62;63;64;65;66;67;68;69;70;71;72;73;74;75;76;77;78;79;80;81;82;83)\\r\\n10 Dec 2015: Dawn\\r\\n4th Map Orbit - LAMOb\\r\\n385?km (239?mi)\\r\\n(84;85;86;87;88;89;90;91;92;93;94;95;96;97;98;99;100;101;102;103;104;105;106;107;108;109;110;111;112;113;114;115;116;117;118;119;120;121;122;123;124;125;126;127;128;129;130;131;132;133;134;135;136;137;138;139;140;141;142;143;144;145;146;147;148;149)\\r\\n10 Dec 2015: Dawn\\r\\n4th Map Orbit - LAMOc\\r\\n385?km (239?mi)\\r\\n(150;151;152;153;154;155;156;157;158;159;160;161;162;163;164;165;166;167;168;169;170;171;172;173;174;175;176;177;178;179;180;181;182;183;184;185;186;187;188;189;190;191;192;193;194;195;196;197;198;199;200;201;202;203;204;205;206;207 ÿ end)\\r\\n4 February 2015; Dawn\\r\\n90,000?km (56,000?mi)\\r\\n29 April 2017: Dawn\\r\\n20,000?km (12,000?mi)\\r\\n4 May 2015; Dawn\\r\\n13,600?km (8,500?mi)\\r\\n4 May 2015; Dawn\\r\\n13,600?km (8,500?mi)\\r\\nbright spots\\r\\n\\r\\nSolar System?L Local Interstellar Cloud?L Local Bubble?L Gould Belt?L Orion Arm?L Milky Way?L Milky Way subgroup?L Local Group?L Virgo Supercluster?L Laniakea Supercluster?L Observable universe?L Universe\\r\\nEach arrow (L) may be read as \\"within\\" or \\"part of\\".","input":"How long does it take ceres to orbit the sun?"},{"output":"Samsung","context":"The following list encompasses notable smart TV platforms and application software that are used as software framework and middleware platforms used by more than just one manufacturer.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor TV sets and companion boxes vendors, available under OEM license.\\r\\n\\r\\nAvailable to third parties, under OEM license.\\r\\n\\r\\nAsus\\r\\n\\r\\nB&O\\r\\n\\r\\nBouygues Telecom (Bbox Miami)\\r\\n\\r\\nCCC Mobile (Air Stick)[1]\\r\\n\\r\\nFree/Iliad (Freebox Mini 4K)\\r\\n\\r\\nLeEco (Super4 X Series)\\r\\n\\r\\nNVIDIA (Shield TV Console)\\r\\n\\r\\nPhilips\\r\\n\\r\\nRCA\\r\\n\\r\\nSDMC Tech(DV8219, DV8035)[2]\\r\\n\\r\\nSharp\\r\\n\\r\\nSony\\r\\n\\r\\nChannelMaster\\r\\n\\r\\nHyundai\\r\\n\\r\\nXiaomi (Mi Box)\\r\\n\\r\\nWestinghouse, Element\\r\\n\\r\\nHisense\\r\\n\\r\\nLG\\r\\n\\r\\nLogitech\\r\\n\\r\\nNetgear\\r\\n\\r\\nSFR\\r\\n\\r\\nSony\\r\\n\\r\\nTCL\\r\\n\\r\\nVizio\\r\\n\\r\\nPace\\r\\n\\r\\nSagemcom\\r\\n\\r\\nSmit\\r\\n\\r\\nThomson\\r\\n\\r\\nSony\\r\\n\\r\\nSky Italia (Italy)\\r\\n\\r\\nDigital+ (Spain)\\r\\n\\r\\nNumericable (France)\\r\\n\\r\\nEchoStar (USA)\\r\\n\\r\\nMediatek\\r\\n\\r\\nHumax\\r\\n\\r\\nSamsung\\r\\n\\r\\nSony\\r\\n\\r\\nSwisscom\\r\\n\\r\\nVestel\\r\\n\\r\\nTelef܇nica\\r\\n\\r\\nNTT\\r\\n\\r\\nCharter Communications \\r\\n\\r\\nRogers\\r\\n\\r\\nJVC\\r\\n\\r\\nRoku\\r\\n\\r\\nTCL\\r\\n\\r\\nSharp\\r\\n\\r\\nInsignia\\r\\n\\r\\nLG\\r\\n\\r\\nHaier\\r\\n\\r\\nHumax\\r\\n\\r\\nPace\\r\\n\\r\\nPanasonic (VierraConnect)\\r\\n\\r\\nPhilips / TP Vision\\r\\n\\r\\nToshiba (CloudTV) \\r\\n\\r\\nPlayJam\\r\\n\\r\\nSamsung\\r\\n\\r\\nSony\\r\\n\\r\\nTrident\\r\\n\\r\\nToshiba\\r\\n\\r\\nVizio (Internet Apps Plus)\\r\\n\\r\\nLG\\r\\n\\r\\nTCL\\r\\n\\r\\nSkyworth\\r\\n\\r\\nAlibaba\\r\\n\\r\\nand various OTT boxes\\r\\n\\r\\nIncludes first and third-party solutions.","input":"What is the os of samsung smart tv?"},{"output":"1710s","context":"garment or device designed to protect a diver from the underwater environment\\r\\nA diving suit is a garment or device designed to protect a diver from the underwater environment. A diving suit may also incorporate a breathing gas supply (i.e. Standard diving dress or atmospheric diving suit).[1] but in most cases applies only to the environmental protective covering worn by the diver. The breathing gas supply is usually referred to separately. There is no generic term for the combination of suit and breathing apparatus alone. It is generally referred to as diving equipment or dive gear along with any other equipment necessary for the dive.\\r\\nDiving suits can be divided into two classes: \\"soft\\" or ambient pressure diving suits - examples are wetsuits, dry suits, semi-dry suits and dive skins, and \\"hard\\" or atmospheric pressure diving suits - armored suits that keep the diver at atmospheric pressure at any depth within the operating range of the suit.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe first diving suit designs appeared in the early 18th century. Two English inventors developed the first pressure-proof diving suits in the 1710s. John Lethbridge built a completely enclosed suit to aid in salvage work. It consisted of a pressure-proof air-filled barrel with a glass viewing hole and two watertight enclosed sleeves.[2] This suit gave the diver more maneouverability to accomplish useful underwater salvage work.\\r\\nAfter testing this machine in his garden pond (specially built for the purpose) Lethbridge dived on a number of wrecks: four English men-of-war, one East Indiaman (both English and Dutch), two Spanish galleons and a number of galleys. He became very wealthy as a result of his salvages. One of his better-known recoveries was on the Dutch Slot ter Hooge, which had sunk off Madeira with over three tons of silver on board.[3]\\r\\nAt the same time, Andrew Becker created a leather-covered diving suit with a helmet featuring a window. Becker used a system of tubes for inhaling and exhaling, and demonstrated his suit in the River Thames, London, during which he remained submerged for an hour.\\r\\nGerman-born British engineer Augustus Siebe developed the standard diving dress in the 1830s. Expanding on improvements already made by another engineer, George Edwards, Siebe produced his own design - a helmet fitted to a full length watertight canvas diving suit. Later suits were made from waterproofed canvas invented by Charles Mackintosh. From the late 1800s and throughout most of the 20th century, most standard dress was made from a sheet of solid rubber laminated between layers of tan twill.[4]\\r\\nDry suits made of latex rubber were used in World War II by Italian frogmen who found them indispensable. They were made by Pirelli and patented in 1951.[5]\\r\\nAmbient pressure suits are a form of exposure protection protecting the wearer from the cold. They also provide some defence from abrasive and sharp objects as well as potentially harmful underwater life. They do not protect divers from the pressure of the surrounding water or resulting barotrauma and decompression sickness.\\r\\nThere are five main types of ambient pressure diving suits; dive skins, wetsuits and their derivative semi-dry suit and hot-water suits, and dry suits. Apart from hot water suits, these types of suit are not exclusively used by divers but are often used for thermal protection by people engaged in other water sports activities such as surfing, sailing, powerboating, windsurfing, kite surfing, waterskiing, caving and swimming.\\r\\nAdded buoyancy due to the volume of the suit is a side effect of most diving suits. A diving weighting system can be worn to counteract this buoyancy.\\r\\nDive skins are used when diving in water temperatures above 25?C (77?F). They are made from spandex or Lycra and provide little thermal protection, but do protect the skin from jellyfish stings, abrasion and sunburn. This kind of suit is also known as a 'Stinger Suit'. Some divers wear a dive skin under a wetsuit, which allows easier donning and (for those who experience skin problems from neoprene) provides additional comfort.[6]\\r\\nThe \\"Dive Skin\\" was originally invented to protect scuba divers in Queensland Australia against the \\"Box\\" jellyfish (Chironex fleckeri)[citation needed]\\r\\nIn 1978, Tony Farmer was a swimsuit designer and manufacturer who owned a business called \\"Daring Designs\\". Besides swimwear he also did underwear and aerobic wear which included a full suit in Lycra/Spandex. He became a scuba diver and that was the catalyst to the invention of the \\"dive skin\\" as we know it today.[citation needed]\\r\\nWetsuits are relatively inexpensive, simple, expanded neoprene suits that are typically used where the water temperature is between 10 and 25?C (50 and 77?F). The foamed neoprene of the suit thermally insulates the wearer.[7][8] Although water can enter the suit, a close fitting suit prevents excessive heat loss because little of the water warmed inside the suit escapes from the suit to be replaced by cold water, a process referred to as \\"flushing\\".\\r\\nProper fit is critical for warmth. A suit that is too loose will allow a large amount of water to circulate over the diver's skin, taking up body heat. A suit that is too tight is very uncomfortable and can impair circulation at the neck, a very dangerous condition which can cause blackouts. For this reason, many divers choose to have wetsuits custom-tailored instead of buying them \\"off the rack\\". Many companies offer this service and the cost is often comparable to an off-the-rack suit.\\r\\nWetsuits are limited in their ability to preserve warmth by three factors: the wearer is still exposed to some water, the suit is compressed by the ambient pressure, reducing effectiveness at depth, and the insulating neoprene can only be made to a certain thickness before it becomes impractical to don and wear. The thickest commercially available wetsuits are usually 10?mm thick. Other common thicknesses are 7?mm, 5?mm, 3?mm, and 1?mm. A 1?mm suit provides very little warmth and is usually considered a dive skin, rather than a wetsuit. Wetsuits can be made using more than one thickness of neoprene, to put the most thickness where it will be most effective in keeping the diver warm. A similar effect can be achieved by layering wetsuits of different coverage. Some makes of neoprene are softer, lighter and more compressible than others for the same thickness, and are more suitable for wetsuits for non-diving purposes as they will compress and lose their insulating value more quickly under pressure, though they are more comfortable for surface sports because they are more flexible and allow more freedom of movement.[9]\\r\\nSemi-dry suits are effectively a thick wetsuit with nearly watertight seals at wrist, neck and ankles and zip. They are typically used where the water temperature is between 10 and 20?C (50 and 68?F). The seals limit the volume of water entering and leaving the suit, and a close fit minimises pumping action caused by limb motion. The wearer gets wet in a semi-dry suit but the water that enters is soon warmed up and does not readily leave the suit, so the wearer remains warm. The trapped layer of water does not add to the suit's insulating ability, and any water circulation past the seals still causes heat loss, but semi-dry suits are cheap and simple compared to dry suits, and do not fail catastrophically. They are made from thick Neoprene, which provides good thermal protection, but lose buoyancy and thermal protection as the trapped gas bubbles in the neoprene foam compress at depth. Semi-dry suits are usually made as a one piece full suit with slick inside surface neoprene wrist, cuff and neck seals Two-piece sets tend to be a one piece full length suit, sometimes described as \\"long johns\\", plus accessories to be worn over, under or with the one-piece suit, such as a shortie tunic, which may be worn separately in warm water, but has no flush-limiting seals at the openings. Semi dry suits do not usually include hoods, boots or gloves, so separate insulating hoods, boots and gloves are worn.[10][11]\\r\\nHot water suits are used in cold water commercial surface supplied diving.[12] A hose in the umbilical line, which links the diver to the surface support, carries the hot water from a heater on the surface down to the suit. The diver controls the flow rate of the water from a valve near his waist, allowing him to vary the warmth of the suit in response to changes in environmental conditions and workload. Tubes inside the suit distribute the water to the limbs, chest, and back. Special boots, gloves, and hood are worn. These suits are normally made of foamed neoprene and are similar to wetsuits in construction and appearance, but they do not fit as closely by design. The wrists and ankles of the suit are open, allowing water to flush out of the suit as it is replenished with fresh hot water from the surface.[13]\\r\\nHot water suits are often employed for extremely deep dives when breathing mixes containing helium are used. Helium conducts heat much more efficiently than air, which means that the diver will lose large quantities of body heat through the lungs when breathing it. This fact compounds the risk of hypothermia already present in the cold temperatures found at these depths. Under these conditions a hot water suit is a matter of survival, not comfort. Just as an emergency backup source of breathing gas is required, a backup water heater is also an essential precaution whenever dive conditions warrant a hot water suit. If the heater fails and a backup unit cannot be immediately brought online, a diver in the coldest conditions can die within minutes; depending on decompression obligations, bringing the diver directly to the surface could prove equally deadly.[13]\\r\\nHeated water in the suit forms an active insulation barrier to heat loss, but the temperature must be regulated within fairly close limits. If the temperature falls below about 32?C, hypothermia can result, and temperatures above 45?C can cause burn injury to the diver. The diver may not notice a gradual change in inlet temperature, and in the early stages of hypo- or hyperthermia, may not notice the deteriorating condition.[13] The suit is loose fitting to allow unimpeded water flow. This causes a large volume of water (13 to 22 litres) to be held in the suit, which can impede swimming due to the added inertia.[13] When controlled correctly, the hot water suit is safe, comfortable and effective, and allows the diver adequate control of thermal protection, however hot water supply failure can be life-threatening.[13]\\r\\nDry suits[14][15][16] are used typically where the water temperature is between ?2 and 15?C (28 and 59?F). Water is prevented from entering the suit by seals at the neck and wrists; also, the means of getting the suit on and off (typically a zipper) is waterproof. The suit insulates the wearer in one of two main ways: by maintaining an insulating layer of air in the undersuit between the body and the suit shell, (in exactly the way that thermal insulation garments work above water) or by using a watertight expanded neoprene suit shell, which is inherently insulating in the same way as a wet suit, and which can usually be worn with additional insulating undergarments.\\r\\nBoth fabric and neoprene drysuits have advantages and disadvantages: a fabric drysuit is more adaptable to varying water temperatures because different garments can be layered underneath. However, they are quite bulky and this causes increased drag and swimming effort. Additionally, if a fabric drysuit malfunctions and floods, it loses nearly all of its insulating properties. Neoprene drysuits are comparatively streamlined like wetsuits, but in some cases do not allow garments to be layered underneath and are thus less adaptable to varying temperatures. An advantage of this construction is that even it if floods completely, it essentially becomes a wetsuit and will still provide a degree of insulation.\\r\\nSpecial dry suits (typically made of strong rubberised fabric) are worn by commercial divers who work in contaminated environments such as sewage or hazardous chemicals. The hazmat dry suit has integral boots and is sealed to a diving helmet and dry gloves to prevent any contact with the hazardous material.\\r\\nConstant volume dry suits have a system allowing the suit to be inflated to prevent \\"suit squeeze\\" caused by increasing pressure and to prevent excessive compression of the insulating undergarments. They also have vents allowing the excess air to escape from the suit during ascent.[17]\\r\\nFor additional warmth, some dry suit users inflate their suits with argon, an inert gas which has superior thermal insulating properties compared to air.[18] The argon is carried in a small cylinder, separate from the diver's breathing gas. This arrangement is frequently used when the breathing gas contains helium, which is a very poor insulator in comparison with other breathing gases.\\r\\nA \\"shortie\\" wetsuit may be worn over a full wetsuit for added warmth. Some vendors sell a very similar item and refer to it as a 'core warmer' when worn over another wetsuit. A \\"skin\\" may also be worn under a wetsuit. This practice started with divers (of both sexes) wearing body tights under a wetsuit for extra warmth and to make donning and removing the wetsuit easier. A \\"skin\\" may also be as an undersuit beneath a drysuit in temperatures where a full undersuit is not necessary.[citation needed]\\r\\nAn atmospheric diving suit is a small one-man articulated submersible of anthropomorphic form which resembles a suit of armour, with elaborate pressure joints to allow articulation while maintaining an internal pressure of one atmosphere.\\r\\nThese can be used for very deep dives for long periods without the need for decompression, and eliminate the majority of physiological dangers associated with deep diving. Divers do not even need to be skilled swimmers. Mobility and dexterity are usually restricted by mechanical constraints, and the ergonomics of movement are problematic.","input":"When was the first scuba diving suit made?"},{"output":"United Arab Emirates","context":"The world's tallest artificial structure is the 829.8?m (2,722?ft) tall Burj Khalifa in Dubai (of the United Arab Emirates). The building gained the official title of \\"Tallest Building in the World\\" and the tallest self supported structure at its opening on January 9, 2010. The second tallest self-supporting structure and the tallest tower is the Tokyo Skytree. The tallest guyed structure is the KVLY-TV mast.\\r\\nThe Council on Tall Buildings and Urban Habitat, an organization that certifies buildings as the \\"World's Tallest\\", recognizes a building only if at least 50% of its height is made up of floor plates containing habitable floor area.[1] Structures that do not meet this criterion, such as the CN Tower, are defined as \\"towers\\".\\r\\nThere are dozens of radio and television broadcasting towers which measure over 600?metres (about 2,000?ft) in height, and only the tallest are recorded in publicly available information sources.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe assessment of the height of artificial structures has been controversial. Various standards have been used by different organizations which has meant that the title of world's tallest structure or building has changed depending on which standards have been accepted. The Council on Tall Buildings and Urban Habitat has changed its definitions over time. Some of the controversy regarding the definitions and assessment of tall structures and buildings has included the following:\\r\\nWithin an accepted definition of a building further controversy has included the following factors:\\r\\nThis category does not require the structure to be \\"officially\\" open but does require it to be 'topped out'.\\r\\nThe tallest artificial structure is Burj Khalifa, a skyscraper in Dubai that reached 828.1?m (2,717?ft) in height on January 17, 2009.[2] By April 7, 2008 it had been built higher than the KVLY-TV mast in North Dakota, USA.[3] That September it officially surpassed Poland's 646.38?m (2,120.7?ft) Warsaw radio mast, which stood from 1974 to 1991, to become the tallest structure ever built. Guyed lattice towers such as these masts had held the world height record since 1954.\\r\\nThe Petronius Platform stands 610?m (2,000?ft) off the sea floor leading some, including Guinness World Records 2007, to claim it as the tallest freestanding structure in the world. However, it is debated whether underwater height should be counted, in the same manner as height below ground is ignored on buildings. The Troll A platform is 472?m (1,549?ft), without any part of that height being supported by wires. The tension-leg type of oil platform has even greater below-water heights with several examples more than 1,000?m (3,300?ft) deep. However, these platforms are not considered constant structures as the vast majority of their height is made up of the length of the tendons attaching the floating platforms to the sea floor. Despite this, Guinness World Records 2009 listed the Ursa tension leg platform as the tallest structure in the world with a total height of 1,306?m (4,285?ft). The Magnolia Tension-leg Platform in the Gulf of Mexico is even taller with a total height of 1,432?m (4,698?ft).\\r\\nTaipei 101 in Taipei, Taiwan, set records in three of the four skyscraper categories at the time it opened in 2004; at the time the Burj Khalifa opened in 2010 it remained the world's tallest inhabited building 509.2?m (1,671?ft) as measured to its architectural height (spire). The height of its roof 449.2?m (1,474?ft) and highest occupied floor 439.2?m (1,441?ft) had been surpassed by the Shanghai World Financial Center with corresponding heights of 487 and 474?m (1,598 and 1,555?ft). Willis Tower (formerly Sears Tower) was the highest in the final category: the greatest height to top of antenna of any building in the world at 527.3?m (1,730?ft).\\r\\nBurj Khalifa broke the height record in all four categories for completed buildings.\\r\\nDue to the disagreements over how to measure height and classify structures, engineers have created various definitions for categories of buildings and other structures. One measure includes the absolute height of a building, another includes only spires and other permanent architectural features, but not antennas. The tradition of including the spire on top of a building and not including the antenna dates back to the rivalry between the Chrysler Building and 40 Wall Street. A modern-day example is that the antenna on top of Willis Tower (formerly Sears Tower) is not considered part of its architectural height, while the spires on top of the Petronas Twin Towers are counted.\\r\\nNote: The following table is a list of the tallest completed structure in each of the 53 categories below. There can only be one structure in each category, unless the title for the tallest is a draw.\\r\\n24426N 1014045E? / ?2.740486N 101.679069E? / 2.740486; 101.679069? (Kuala Lumpur International Airport 2 Control Tower)\\r\\nThere are some destroyed architectural structures which were taller than the tallest existing structure of their type. There are also destroyed structures omitted from this list that had been surpassed in height prior to being destroyed.\\r\\n* Mixed-Use is defined as having three or more real estate uses (such as retail, office, hotel, etc.) that are physically and functionally integrated in a single property and are mutually supporting.[10]\\r\\nPrior to 1998, the tallest building status was determined by the height of the building to the top of its architectural elements including spires, but not including \\"temporary\\" structures (such as antennas or flagpoles), which could be added or changed relatively easily without requiring major changes to the building's design. Other criteria for height measurement were not used. For this reason, the originally 1,451-foot (442-meter) to rooftop or 1518 feet with original antennas[11] Willis Tower (formerly Sears Tower) was generally accepted as being the tallest building continuously after its completion in 1973, and being taller than both World Trade Center towers, in spite of the fact the 1 World Trade Center Tower (North Tower) possessed a higher pinnacle absolute height after it added its 360-foot (110?m) radio antenna (total height of 1730 feet or 527.3 meters) in 1978. The 1 World Trade Center building maintained a higher absolute height to antenna top until the Sears Tower enlarged its own radio antenna in 2000 to a total height of 1730 feet.[11] However, the Willis Tower was always considered the taller building because it still possessed a greater height to its architectural top (1451 feet vs. 1362 feet), and thus its status as the world's tallest was generally not contested.\\r\\nOther historic cases in which a building with a taller absolute pinnacle height was not considered the tallest building include, in 1905 when the former New York Times building or The Times Square Building (at 229 West 43rd Street in New York) was completed at 111?m (364?ft) to the roof with 128?m (420?ft) including a flagpole. That building was never considered to be taller than the 119?m (390?ft) high then-current record-holder Park Row Building of New York because a flagpole is not an integral architectural part of a building.[12]\\r\\nPrior to 1998 the tallest building status had been contested on occasion, but the disputes did not result in a change of the criteria used to determine the world's tallest building. An example was the rivalry between the Trump Building (then known as the Bank of Manhattan Building) and the Chrysler Building. The Bank of Manhattan Building employed only a short spire and was 927?ft (283?m) tall and had a much higher top occupied floor (the second category in the 1996 criteria for tallest building). In contrast, the Chrysler Building employed a very large 125-foot (38?m) spire secretly assembled inside the building to claim the title of world's tallest building with a total height of 1,048 feet (319?m), despite having a lower top occupied floor and a shorter height when both buildings' spires are not counted in their heights. Upset by Chryslers victory, Shreve & Lamb, the consulting architects of Bank of Manhattan building, wrote a newspaper article claiming that their building was actually the tallest, since it contained the world's highest usable floor. They pointed out that the observation deck in the Bank of Manhattan Building was nearly 100 feet (30?m) above the top floor in the Chrysler Building, whose surpassing spire was strictly ornamental and essentially inaccessible.[13] However, the Chrysler Building was generally accepted as the tallest building in the world despite their protests.\\r\\nHowever, none of the previous discrepancies or disputes in criteria to measure height (spires vs antennas, absolute pinnacle height vs. architectural height, height of highest occupied floor, etc.) resulted in the controversy that occurred upon the completion of the Petronas Towers in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia in 1998. The Petronas Towers possessed a higher architectural height (spires, but not antennas), but a lower absolute pinnacle height and lower top occupied floor than the previous record-holder Willis Tower in Chicago, United States. Counting buildings as structures with floors throughout, and with antenna masts excluded, Willis Tower was still considered the tallest at that time. When the Petronas Twin Towers were built, controversy arose because their spires extended nine metres higher than the roof of Willis Tower. Excluding their spires, the Petronas Towers are not taller than Willis Tower. At their convention in Chicago, the Council on Tall Buildings and Urban Habitat (CTBUH) found the Willis Tower to be the third-tallest building, and the Petronas Towers to be the world's tallest buildings. This decision caused a considerable amount of controversy in the news media because this was the first time a country outside the United States had held the worlds tallest building record.[12] Therefore, the CTBUH revised their criteria and defined four categories in which the world's tallest building can be measured,[14] by retaining the old criterion of height to architectural top and added three new categories[12]\\r\\nThe height-to-roof criterion was discontinued because relatively few modern tall buildings possess flat rooftops, making this criterion difficult to determine and measure.[16] The CTBUH has further clarified their definitions of building height, including specific criteria concerning subbasements and ground level entrances (height measured from lowest, significant, open-air, pedestrian entrance rather than from a previously undefined \\"main entrance\\"), building completion (must be topped out both structurally and architecturally, fully clad, and able to be occupied), condition of the highest occupied floor (must be continuously used by people living or working and be conditioned, thus including observation decks, but not mechanical floors) and other aspects of tall buildings.[16][17]\\r\\nThe height is measured from the level of the lowest, significant, open-air, pedestrian entrance. At the time, the Willis Tower held first place in the second and third categories, the Petronas Towers held the first category, and the 1 World Trade Center building held the fourth with its antenna height to top of pinnacle.[12] In 2000, however, a new antenna mast was placed on the Willis Tower, giving it hold of the fourth category. On April 20, 2004, Taipei 101 in Taipei, Taiwan, was completed. Its completion gave it the world record for the first three categories. On July 21, 2007 it was announced that Burj Khalifa had surpassed Taipei 101 in height, reaching 512?m (1,680?ft).\\r\\nSince being completed in early 2010, Burj Khalifa leads in all categories (the first building to do so). With a spire height of 829.8?m (2,722?ft), Burj Khalifa surpassed Taipei 101 as the tallest building to architectural detail and the Willis Tower as the tallest building to tip. It also leads in the category of highest occupied floor.\\r\\nBefore Burj Khalifa was completed, Willis Tower led in the fourth category with 527?m (1,729?ft), previously held by the World Trade Center until the extension of the Chicago tower's western broadcast antenna in 2000, over a year prior to the World Trade Center's destruction in 2001. Its antenna mast included, One World Trade Center measured 527.3?m (1,730?ft). The World Trade Center became the world's tallest building to be destroyed or demolished; indeed, its site entered the record books twice on September 11, 2001, in that category, replacing the Singer Building, which once stood a block from the World Trade Center site.[citation needed] A different superlative for skyscrapers is their number of floors. The World Trade Center set that at 110, and this was not surpassed for nearly four decades until the Burj Khalifa, which opened in 2010.\\r\\nStructures such as the CN Tower, the Ostankino Tower and the Oriental Pearl Tower are excluded from these categories because they are not \\"habitable buildings\\", which are defined as frame structures made with floors and walls throughout.[1]\\r\\nFreestanding structures must not be supported by guy wires, the sea or other types of support. It therefore does not include guyed masts, partially guyed towers and drilling platforms but does include towers, skyscrapers (pinnacle height) and chimneys. (See also history of tallest skyscrapers.)\\r\\nThe world's tallest freestanding structure on land is defined as the tallest self-supporting artificial structure that stands above ground. This definition is different from that of world's tallest building or world's tallest structure based on the percentage of the structure that is occupied and whether or not it is self-supporting or supported by exterior cables. Likewise, this definition does not count structures that are built underground or on the seabed, such as the Petronius Platform in the Gulf of Mexico. Visit world's tallest structure by category for a list of various other definitions.\\r\\nThe tallest freestanding structure on land is the Burj Khalifa in Dubai, United Arab Emirates. The building surpassed the height of the previous record holder, the 553.3?m (1,815?ft) CN Tower in Toronto, Ontario, on September 12, 2007. It was completed in 2010, with final height of 829.8?m (2,722?ft).\\r\\nThe following is a list of structures that have held the title as the tallest freestanding structure on land.\\r\\nNotable mentions include the Pharos (lighthouse) of Alexandria, built in the third century BC and estimated between 115ÿ135?m (377ÿ443?ft). It was the world's tallest non-pyramidal structure for many centuries. Another notable mention includes the Jetavanaramaya stupa in Anuradhapura, Sri Lanka, which was built in the third century, and was similarly tall at 122?m (400?ft). These were both the world's tallest or second tallest non-pyramidal structure for over a thousand years.\\r\\nThe tallest secular building between the collapse of the Pharos and the erection of the Washington Monument may have been the Torre del Mangia in Siena, which is 102?m (335?ft) tall, and was constructed in the first half of the fourteenth century, and the 97?m (318?ft) tall Torre degli Asinelli in Bologna, also Italy, built between 1109 and 1119.\\r\\nTimeline of development of world's highest observation deck since inauguration of Eiffel Tower.\\r\\nHigher observation decks have existed on mountain tops or cliffs, rather than on tall structures.

Named a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1979, the park is located in northwestern Arizona. The park's central feature is the Grand Canyon, a gorge of the Colorado River, which is often considered one of the Wonders of the World. The park, which covers 1,217,262 acres (1,901.972?sq?mi; 492,608?ha; 4,926.08?km2) of unincorporated area in Coconino and Mohave counties, received nearly six million recreational visitors in 2016, which is the second highest count of all U.S. national parks after Great Smoky Mountains National Park.[4]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\"Grand Canyon\\" was officially designated a national park on February 26, 1919,[5] though the landmark had been well known to Americans for over thirty years prior.[6] In 1903, President Theodore Roosevelt visited the site and said: \\"The Grand Canyon fills me with awe. It is beyond comparisonbeyond description; absolutely unparalleled through-out the wide world... Let this great wonder of nature remain as it now is. Do nothing to mar its grandeur, sublimity and loveliness. You cannot improve on it. But what you can do is to keep it for your children, your children's children, and all who come after you, as the one great sight which every American should see.\\"[7]\\r\\nDespite Roosevelt's enthusiasm and strong interest in preserving land for public use, the Grand Canyon was not immediately designated as a national park. The first bill to establish Grand Canyon National Park was introduced in 1882 by then-Senator Benjamin Harrison, which would have established Grand Canyon as the second national park in the United States after Yellowstone. Harrison unsuccessfully reintroduced his bill in 1883 and 1886; after his election to the presidency, he established the Grand Canyon Forest Reserve in 1893. Theodore Roosevelt created the Grand Canyon Game Preserve by proclamation on 28 November 1906,[8] and the Grand Canyon National Monument in 1908.[9] Further Senate bills to establish the site as a national park were introduced and defeated in 1910 and 1911, before the Grand Canyon National Park Act was finally signed by President Woodrow Wilson in 1919. The National Park Service, established in 1916, assumed administration of the park.\\r\\nThe creation of the park was an early success of the conservation movement. Its national park status may have helped thwart proposals to dam the Colorado River within its boundaries. (Later, the Glen Canyon Dam would be built upriver.) In 1975, the former Marble Canyon National Monument, which followed the Colorado River northeast from the Grand Canyon to Lee's Ferry, was made part of Grand Canyon National Park. In 1979, UNESCO declared the park a World Heritage Site.\\r\\nIn 2010, Grand Canyon National Park was honored with its own coin under the America the Beautiful Quarters program.[10]\\r\\nThe Grand Canyon, including its extensive system of tributary canyons, is valued for its combination of size, depth, and exposed layers of colorful rocks dating back to Precambrian times. The canyon itself was created by the incision of the Colorado River and its tributaries after the Colorado Plateau was uplifted, causing the Colorado River system to develop along its present path.\\r\\nThe primary public areas of the park are the North and South Rims of the Grand Canyon itself. The rest of the park is extremely rugged and remote, although many places are accessible by pack trail and backcountry roads. Only the Navajo Bridge near Page connects the rims by road in Arizona; this journey can take around five hours by car. Otherwise, the two rims of the Canyon are connected via the Mike O'CallaghanÿPat Tillman Memorial Bridge and the Hoover Dam.[11]\\r\\nThe park headquarters are at Grand Canyon Village, not far from the south entrance to the park, near one of the most popular viewpoints.\\r\\nThe North Rim is a smaller, more remote area with less tourist activity. It is accessed by Arizona State Route 67.[12]\\r\\nThe South Rim is more accessible than the North Rim;[13] most visitors to the park come to the South Rim, arriving on Arizona State Route 64. The highway enters the park through the South Entrance, near Tusayan, Arizona, and heads eastward, leaving the park through the East Entrance.[13] Interstate 40 provides access to the area from the south. From the north, U.S. Route 89 connects Utah, Colorado, and the North Rim to the South Rim.[14] Overall, some 30 miles of the South Rim are accessible by road.[citation needed]\\r\\nGrand Canyon Village is located at the north end of U.S. Route 180, coming from Flagstaff. It is a full-service community, including lodging, fuel, food, souvenirs, a hospital, churches, and access to trails and guided walks and talks.[11]\\r\\nSeveral lodging facilities are available along the South Rim. Hotels and other lodging include: El Tovar, Bright Angel Lodge, Kachina Lodge, Thunderbird Lodge, and Maswik Lodge, all of which are located in the village area, and Phantom Ranch, located on the canyon floor. There is also an RV Park named Trailer Village. All of these facilities are managed by Xanterra Parks & Resorts, while the Yavapai Lodge (also in the village area) is managed by Delaware North.[15]\\r\\nOn the North rim there is the historic Grand Canyon Lodge[15] managed by Forever Resorts and a campground near the lodge, managed by the National Park staff.[16]\\r\\nA variety of activities at the South Rim cater to park visitors. The South Rim Drive (35 miles (56?km) is a driving tour split into two segments. The western drive to Hermit's Point is 8 miles (13?km) with several overlooks along the way, including Mohave Point, Hopi Point, and the Powell Memorial.[11] From March to December, access to Hermit's Rest is restricted to the free shuttle provided by the Park Service. The eastern portion to Desert View is 25 miles (40?km), and is open to private vehicles year round.\\r\\nWalking tours include the Rim Trail, which runs west from the Pipe Creek viewpoint for about 8 miles (13?km) of paved road, followed by 7 miles (11?km) unpaved to Hermit's Rest. Hikes can begin almost anywhere along this trail, and a shuttle can return hikers to their point of origin. Mather Point, the first view most people reach when entering from the South Entrance, is a popular place to begin.\\r\\nPrivate canyon flyovers are provided by helicopters and small airplanes out of Las Vegas, Phoenix, and Grand Canyon National Park Airport. Due to a crash in the 1990s, scenic flights are no longer allowed to fly within 1,500 feet (460?m) of the rim within the Grand Canyon National Park.[17] Flights within the canyon are still available outside of park boundaries.[18]\\r\\nOn the North Rim there are few roads, however, there are some notable vehicle accessible lookout points including Point Imperial, Roosevelt Point, and Cape Royal. Mule rides are also available that go to a variety of places including several thousand feet down into the canyon.\\r\\nMany visitors to the North Rim choose to make use of the variety of hiking trails including the Widforss Trail, Uncle Jim's Trail, the Transept Trail, and the North Kaibab Trail, the latter of which can be followed all the way down to the Colorado River, and to across to the South Kaibab Trail and the Bright Angel Trail, which continue up to the south rim of the Grand Canyon.\\r\\nThe Toroweap Overlook is located in the western part of the park on the North Rim. Access is via unpaved roads off Route 389 west of Fredonia, Arizona. The roads lead through Grand Canyon-Parashant National Monument and to the overlook.\\r\\nThe US government had halted development of a 1.6 million acres area including the National Park from 1966 to 2009, during the Bennett Freeze, because of an ownership dispute between Hopi and Navajo.[19]\\r\\nThe Grand Canyon Association (GCA) is the National Park Service's official nonprofit partner.

This process forms part of the innate immune response, involving the recruitment of non-specific leukocytes. Monocytes also use this process in the absence of infection or tissue damage during their development into macrophages.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nLeukocyte extravasation occurs mainly in post-capillary venules, where haemodynamic shear forces are minimised. This process can be understood in several steps, outlined below as \\"chemoattraction\\", \\"rolling adhesion\\", \\"tight adhesion\\" and \\"(endothelial) transmigration\\". It has been demonstrated that leukocyte recruitment is halted whenever any of these steps is suppressed.\\r\\nWhite blood cells (leukocytes) perform most of their functions in tissues. Functions include phagocytosis of foreign particles, production of antibodies, secretion of inflammatory response triggers (histamine and heparin), and neutralization of histamine. In general, leukocytes are involved in the defense of an organism and protect it from disease by promoting or inhibiting inflammatory responses. Leukocytes use the blood as a transport medium to reach the tissues of the body. Here is a brief summary of each of the four steps currently thought to be involved in leukocyte extravasation:\\r\\nUpon recognition of and activation by pathogens, resident macrophages in the affected tissue release cytokines such as IL-1, TNFϫ and chemokines. IL-1, TNFϫ and C5a[1] cause the endothelial cells of blood vessels near the site of infection to express cellular adhesion molecules, including selectins. Circulating leukocytes are localised towards the site of injury or infection due to the presence of chemokines.\\r\\nLike velcro, carbohydrate ligands on the circulating leukocytes bind to selectin molecules on the inner wall of the vessel, with marginal affinity. This causes the leukocytes to slow down and begin rolling along the inner surface of the vessel wall. During this rolling motion, transitory bonds are formed and broken between selectins and their ligands.\\r\\nFor example, the carbohydrate ligand for P-selectin, P-selectin glycoprotein ligand-1 (PSGL-1), is expressed by different types of leukocytes (white blood cells). The binding of PSGL-1 on the leukocyte to P-selectin on the endothelial cell allows for the leukocyte to roll along the endothelial surface. This interaction can be tuned by the glycosylation pattern of PSGL-1, such that certain glycovariants of PSGL-1 will have unique affinities for different selectins, allowing in some cases for cells to migrate to specific sites within the body (e.g. the skin).[2]\\r\\nAt the same time, chemokines released by macrophages activate the rolling leukocytes and cause surface integrin molecules to switch from the default low-affinity state to a high-affinity state. This is assisted through juxtacrine activation of integrins by chemokines and soluble factors released by endothelial cells. In the activated state, integrins bind tightly to complementary receptors expressed on endothelial cells, with high affinity. This causes the immobilisation of the leukocytes, despite the sheer forces of the ongoing blood flow.\\r\\nThe cytoskeletons of the leukocytes are reorganised in such a way that the leukocytes are spread out over the endothelial cells. In this form, leukocytes extend pseudopodia and pass through gaps between endothelial cells. Transmigration of the leukocyte occurs as PECAM proteins, found on the leukocyte and endothelial cell surfaces, interact and effectively pull the cell through the endothelium. Once through the endothelium, the leukocyte must penetrate the basement membrane. The mechanism for penetration is disputed, but may involve proteolytic digestion of the membrane, mechanical force, or both.[3] The entire process of blood vessel escape is known as diapedesis. Once in the interstitial fluid, leukocytes migrate along a chemotactic gradient towards the site of injury or infection.\\r\\nThe phases of the leukocyte extravasation depicted in the schema are: approach, capture, rolling, activation, binding, strengthening of the binding and spreading, intravascular creeping, paracellular migration or transcellular migration.\\r\\nSelectins are expressed shortly after cytokine activation of endothelial cells by tissue macrophages. Activated endothelial cells initially express P-selectin molecules, but within two hours after activation E-selectin expression is favoured. Endothelial selectins bind carbohydrates on leukocyte transmembrane glycoproteins, including sialyl-LewisX.\\r\\nSuppressed expression of some selectins results in a slower immune response. If L-selectin is not produced, the immune response may be ten times slower, as P-selectins (which can also be produced by leukocytes) bind to each other. P-selectins can bind each other with high affinity, but occur less frequently because the receptor-site density is lower than with the smaller E-selectin molecules. This increases the initial leukocyte rolling speed, prolonging the slow rolling phase.\\r\\nIntegrins involved in cellular adhesion are primarily expressed on leukocytes. 2 integrins on rolling leukocytes bind endothelial cellular adhesion molecules, arresting cell movement.\\r\\nCellular activation via extracellular chemokines causes pre-formed 2 integrins to be released from cellular stores. Integrin molecules migrate to the cell surface and congregate in high-avidity patches. Intracellular integrin domains associate with the leukocyte cytoskeleton, via mediation with cytosolic factors such as talin, ϫ-actinin and vinculin. This association causes a conformational shift in the integrin's tertiary structure, allowing ligand access to the binding site. Divalent cations (e.g. Mg2+) are also required for integrin-ligand binding.\\r\\nIntegrin ligands ICAM-1 and VCAM-1 are activated by inflammatory cytokines, while ICAM-2 is constitutively expressed by some endothelial cells but downregulated by inflammatory cytokines. ICAM-1 and ICAM-2 share two homologous N-terminal domains; both can bind LFA-1.\\r\\nDuring chemotaxis, cell movement is facilitated by the binding of 1 integrins to components of the extracellular matrix: VLA-3, VLA-4 and VLA-5 to fibronectin and VLA-2 and VLA-3 to collagen and other extracellular matrix components.\\r\\nExtravasation is regulated by the background cytokine environment produced by the inflammatory response, and is independent of specific cellular antigens. Cytokines released in the initial immune response induce vasodilation and lower the electrical charge along the vessel's surface. Blood flow is slowed, facilitating intermolecular binding.\\r\\nIn 1976, SEM images showed that there were homing receptors on microvilli-like tips on leukocytes that would allow white blood cells to get out of the blood vessel and get into tissue.[5] Since the 1990s the identity of ligands involved in leukocyte extravasation have been studied heavily. This topic was finally able to be studied thoroughly under physiological shear stress conditions using a typical flow chamber.[6] Since the first experiments, a strange phenomenon was observed. Binding interactions between the white blood cells and the vessel walls were observed to become stronger under higher force. Selectins (E-selection, L-selection, and P-selectin) were found to be involved in this phenomenon. The shear threshold requirement seems counterintuitive because increasing shear elevates the force applied to adhesive bonds and it would seem that this should increase the dislodging ability. Nevertheless, cells roll more slowly and more regularly until an optimal shear is reached where rolling velocity is minimal. This paradoxical phenomenon has not been satisfactorily explained despite the widespread interest.\\r\\nOne initially dismissed hypothesis that has been gaining interest is the catch bond hypothesis, where the increased force on the cell slows off-rates and lengthen the bond lifetimes and stabilizing the rolling step of leukocyte extravasation.[7] Flow-enhanced cell adhesion is still an unexplained phenomenon that could result from a transport-dependent increase in on-rates or a force-dependent decrease in off-rates of adhesive bonds. L-selectin requires a particular minimum of shear to sustain leukocyte rolling on P-selectin glycoprotein ligand-1 (PSGL-1) and other vascular ligands. It has been hypothesized that low forces decrease L-selectinÿPSGL-1 off-rates (catch bonds), whereas higher forces increase off-rates (slip bonds). Experiments have found that a force-dependent decrease in off-rates dictated flow-enhanced rolling of L-selectinÿbearing microspheres or neutrophils on PSGL-1. [5] Catch bonds enable increasing force to convert short bond lifetimes into long bond lifetimes, which decrease rolling velocities and increase the regularity of rolling steps as shear rose from the threshold to an optimal value. As shear increases, transitions to slip bonds shorten their bond lifetimes and increase rolling velocities and decrease rolling regularity. It is hypothesized that force-dependent alterations of bond lifetimes govern L-selectinÿdependent cell adhesion below and above the shear optimum. These findings establish a biological function for catch bonds as a mechanism for flow-enhanced cell adhesion.[8] While leukocytes seem to undergo a catch bond behavior with increasing flow leading to the tethering and rolling steps in leukocyte extravasation, firm adhesion is achieved through another mechanism, integrin activation.\\r\\nOther biological examples of a catch bond mechanism is seen in bacteria that tightly cling to urinary tract walls in response to high fluid velocities and large shear forces exerted on the cells and bacteria with adhesive tips of fimbria.[7][9] Schematic mechanisms of how increased shear force is proposed to cause stronger binding interactions between bacteria and target cells show that the catch bond acts very similar to a Chinese finger trap. For a catch-bond, the force on the cell pulls the adhesive tip of a fimbria to close tighter on its target cell. As the strength of the forces increases, the stronger the bond between the fimbria and the cell-receptor on the surface of the target cell.[9] For a cryptic-bond, the force causes the fimbria to swivel toward the target cell and have more binding sites able to attach to the target cell ligands, mainly sugar molecules. This creates a stronger bonding interaction between the bacteria and the target cell.\\r\\nParallel plate flow chambers are among the most popular flow chambers used to study the leukocyte-endothelial interaction in vitro. They have been used for investigation since the later 1980s.[10] Although flow chambers have been an important tool to study leukocyte rolling, there are several limitations when it comes to studying the physiological in vivo conditions, as they lack correspondence with in vivo geometry, including scale/aspect ratio (microvasculature vs large vessel models), flow conditions (e.g. converging vs diverging flows at bifurcations), and require large reagent volumes (~ ml) due to their large size (height > 250?m and width > 1mm).[11] With the advent of microfluidic-based devices, these limitations have been overcome. A new in vitro model, called SynVivo Synthetic microvascular network (SMN) was produced by the CFD Research Corporation (CFDRC) and developed using the polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) based soft-lithography process. The SMN can recreate the complex in vivo vasculature, including geometrical features, flow conditions, and reagent volumes, thereby providing a biologically realistic environment for studying the extravasation cellular behavior, but also for drug delivery and drug discovery.[12][13]\\r\\nLeukocyte adhesion deficiency (LAD) is a genetic disease associated with a defect in the leukocyte extravasation process, caused by a defective integrin 2 chain (found in LFA-1 and Mac-1). This impairs the ability of the leukocytes to stop and undergo diapedesis. People with LAD suffer from recurrent bacterial infections and impaired wound healing. Neutrophilia is a hallmark of LAD.","input":"What is the first cell to migrate to an injured area?"},{"output":"Constantinople","context":"","input":"What was the center of the byzantine empire?"},{"output":"Fenris Wolf","context":"The Fenris Wolf is a fictional character appearing in American comic books published by Marvel Comics, based on  Fenrir from Norse mythology.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Fenris Wolf first appeared in Marvel Comics in Journey into Mystery #114 (March 1965), and was adapted from Norse legends by Stan Lee and Jack Kirby.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe character subsequently appeared in Thor #277-278 (NovemberÿDecember 1978), and Thor Vol. 2 #80-83 (AugustÿOctober 2004) and #85 (December 2004).\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Fenris Wolf received an entry in the Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe Deluxe Edition #4.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Fenris Wolf is a creature of Asgardian origin, said to be offspring of Loki and the giantess Angrboda.\\r\\n\\r\\nHowever, many years ago, he was part of the basis of Little Red Riding Hood.

While the United States represents about 4.4 percent of the world's population, it houses around 22 percent of the world's prisoners.[1] Corrections (which includes prisons, jails, probation, and parole) cost around $74 billion in 2007 according to the U.S. Bureau of Justice Statistics.[2][3]\\r\\nIn 2016, the Prison Policy Initiative estimated that in the United States that about 2,298,300 people were incarcerated out of a population of 323.1 million. This means that 0.71% of the population was behind bars. Of those who were incarcerated, about 1,351,000 people were in state prison, 646,000 in local jails, 211,000 in federal prisons, 34,000 in youth correctional facilities, 33,000 in immigration detention camps, 14,000 in territorial prisons, 5,500 in civil commitment, 2,400 in Indian country jails, and 1,400 in United States military prisons.[4]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nTotal U.S. incarceration (prisons and jails) peaked in 2008. Total correctional population peaked in 2007.[5] If all prisoners are counted (including those juvenile, territorial, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) (immigration detention), Indian country, and military), then in 2008 the United States had around 24.7% of the world's 9.8 million prisoners.[6][7][8]\\r\\nThe United States has the highest documented incarceration rate in the world, at 754 per 100,000 (as of 2009[update]).[9][10] As of December 31, 2010, the International Centre for Prison Studies (ICPS) at King's College London estimated 2,266,832 prisoners from a total population of 310.64 million as of this date (730 per 100,000 in 2010).[11]\\r\\nThis number comprises local jails with a nominal capacity of 866,782 inmates occupied at 86.4% (June 6, 2010), state prisons with a nominal capacity of approximately 1,140,500 occupied at approximately 115% (December 31, 2010), and federal prisons with a nominal capacity of 126,863 occupied at 136.0% (December 31, 2010). Of this number, 21.5% are pretrial detainees (December 31, 2010), 8.7% are female prisoners (December 31, 2010), 0.4% are juveniles (June 6, 2009), and 5.9% are foreign prisoners (June 30, 2007).[11]\\r\\nThe imprisonment rate varies widely by state; Louisiana surpasses this by about 100%, but Maine incarcerates at about a fifth this rate. A report released 28 February 2008, indicates that more than 1 in 100 adults in the United States are in prison.[12]\\r\\nAccording to a U.S. Department of Justice report published in 2006, over 7.2 million people were at that time in prison, on probation, or on parole (released from prison with restrictions). That means roughly 1 in every 32 Americans are under some sort of criminal justice system control.[13][14]\\r\\nIn the last forty years, incarceration has increased with rates upwards of 500% despite crime rates decreasing nationally.[15] Between the years 2001 and 2012, crime rates (both property and violent crimes) have consistently declined at a rate of 22% after already falling an additional 30% in years prior between 1991 and 2001.[16] As of 2012, there are 710 people per every 100,000 U.S. residents in the United States that are imprisoned in either local jails, state prisons, federal prisons, and privately operated facilities.[16] This correlates to incarcerating a number close to almost a quarter of the prison population in the entire world.[17] Mass incarceration is an intervening variable to more incarceration.[18]\\r\\nThe Bureau of Justice Statistics has released a study which finds that, despite the total number of prisoners incarcerated for drug-related offenses increasing by 57,000 between 1997 and 2004, the proportion of drug offenders to total prisoners in State prison populations stayed steady at 21%. The percentage of Federal prisoners serving time for drug offenses declined from 63% in 1997 to 55% in that same period.[19] In the twenty-five years since the passage of the Anti-Drug Abuse Act of 1986, the United States penal population rose from around 300,000 to more than two million.[20] Between 1986 and 1991, African-American women's incarceration in state prisons for drug offenses increased by 828 percent.[21]\\r\\nIn 2009, the U.S. Department of Justice announced that the growth rate of the state prison population had fallen to its lowest since 2006, but it still had a 0.2% growth-rate compared to the total U.S. prison population.[22] The California state prison system population fell in 2009, the first year that populations had fallen in 38 years.[23]\\r\\nWhen looking at specific populations within the criminal justice system the growth rates are vastly different. In 1977, there were just slightly more than eleven thousand incarcerated women. By 2004, the number of women under state or federal prison had increased by 757 percent, to more than 111,000, and the percentage of women in prison has increased every year, at roughly double the rate of men, since 2000.[24] The rate of incarcerated women has expanded at about 4.6% annually between 1995 and 2005 with women now accounting for 7% of the population in state and federal prisons.\\r\\nComparing some countries with similar percentages of immigrants, Germany has an incarceration rate of 76 per 100,000 population (as of 2014),[25] Italy is 85 per 100,000 (as of 2015),[26] and Saudi Arabia is 161 per 100,000 (as of 2013).[27] Comparing other countries with a zero tolerance policy for illegal drugs, the rate of Russia is 455 per 100,000 (as of 2015),[28] Kazakhstan is 275 per 100,000 (as of 2015),[29] Singapore is 220 per 100,000 (as of 2014),[30] and Sweden is 60 per 100,000 (as of 2014).[31]\\r\\nA 2014 report by the National Research Council identified two main causes of the increase in the United States' incarceration rate over the previous 40 years: longer prison sentences and increases in the likelihood of imprisonment. The same report found that longer prison sentences were the main driver of increasing incarceration rates since 1990.[33]\\r\\nEven though there are other countries that commit more inmates to prison annually, the fact that the United States keeps their prisoners longer causes the total rate to become higher. To give an example, the average burglary sentence in the United States is 16 months, compared to 5 months in Canada and 7 months in England.[34]\\r\\nLooking at reasons for imprisonment will further clarify why the incarceration rate and length of sentences are so high. The practice of imposing longer prison sentences on repeat offenders is common in many countries but the three-strikes laws in the U.S. with mandatory 25 year imprisonment  implemented in many states in the 1990s  are statutes enacted by state governments in the United States which mandate state courts to impose harsher sentences on habitual offenders who are previously convicted of two prior serious criminal offenses and then commit a third.\\r\\nCrime rates in low-income areas are much higher than in middle to high class areas. As a result, Incarceration rates in low-income areas are much higher than in wealthier areas due to these high crime rates.[35] When the incarcerated or criminal is a youth, there is a significant impact on the individual and rippling effects on entire communities. Social capital is lost when an individual is incarcerated. How much social capital is lost is hard to accurately estimate, however Aizer and Doyle found a strong positive correlation between lower income as an adult if an individual is incarcerated in their youth in comparison to those who are not incarcerated.[36] 63 percent to 66 percent of those involved in crimes are under the age of thirty.[35] People incarcerated at a younger age lose the capability to invest in themselves and in their communities. Their children and families become susceptible to financial burden preventing them from escaping low-income communities. This contributes to the recurring cycle of poverty that is positively correlated with incarceration.[37] Poverty rates have not been curbed despite steady economic growth. Poverty is not the sole dependent variable for increasing incarceration rates. Incarceration leads to more incarceration by putting families and communities at a dynamic social disadvantage.[38]\\r\\nThe \\"War on Drugs\\" is a policy that was initiated by Richard Nixon with the Comprehensive Drug Abuse Prevention and Control Act of 1970 and vigorously pursued by Ronald Reagan.[39] By 2010, drug offenders in federal prison had increased to 500,000 per year, up from 41,000 in 1985. According to Michelle Alexander, drug related charges accounted for more than half the rise in state prisoners between 1985 and 2000. 31 million people have been arrested on drug related charges, approximately 1 in 10 Americans.[40][41] In contrast, John Pfaff of Fordham Law School has accused Alexander of exaggerating the influence of the War on Drugs on the rise in the United States' incarceration rate: according to him, the percent of state prisoners whose primary offense was drug-related peaked at 22% in 1990.[42] The Brookings Institution reconciles the differences between Alexander and Pfaff by explaining two ways to look at the prison population as it relates to drug crimes, concluding \\"The picture is clear: Drug crimes have been the predominant reason for new admissions into state and federal prisons in recent decades\\" and \\"rolling back the war on drugs would not, as Pfaff and Urban Institute scholars maintain, totally solve the problem of mass incarceration, but it could help a great deal, by reducing exposure to prison.\\" [43]\\r\\nAfter the passage of Reagan's Anti-Drug Abuse Act in 1986, incarceration for non-violent offenses dramatically increased. The Act imposed the same five-year mandatory sentence on those with convictions involving crack as on those possessing 100 times as much powder cocaine.[39][44] This had a disproportionate effect on low-level street dealers and users of crack, who were more commonly poor blacks, Latinos, the young, and women.[45]\\r\\nCourts were given more discretion in sentencing by the Kimbrough v. United States (2007) decision, and the disparity was decreased to 18:1 by the Fair Sentencing Act of 2010.[46] As of 2006[update], 49.3% of state prisoners, or 656,000 individuals, were incarcerated for non-violent crimes. As of 2008[update], 90.7% of federal prisoners, or 165,457 individuals, were incarcerated for non-violent offenses.[6]\\r\\nBy 2003, 58% of all women in federal prison were convicted of drug offenses.[47] Black and Hispanic women in particular have been disproportionately affected by the War on Drugs. Since 1986, incarceration rates have risen by 400% for women of all races, while rates for Black women have risen by 800%.[48] Formerly incarcerated Black women are also most negatively impacted by the collateral legal consequences of conviction.[49]\\r\\nAccording to the American Civil Liberties Union, \\"Even when women have minimal or no involvement in the drug trade, they are increasingly caught in the ever-widening net cast by current drug laws, through provisions of the criminal law such as those involving conspiracy, accomplice liability, and constructive possession that expand criminal liability to reach partners, relatives and bystanders.\\"[50]\\r\\nThese new policies also disproportionately affect African-American women. According to Dorothy E. Roberts, the explanation is that poor women, who are disproportionately black, are more likely to be placed under constant supervision by the State in order to receive social services.[51] They are then more likely to be caught by officials who are instructed to look specifically for drug offenses. Roberts argues that the criminal justice system's creation of new crimes has a direct effect on the number of women, especially black women, who then become incarcerated.\\r\\nIt is important to understand the background of the war on drugs. The earliest influences can be seen in early Chinese immigration for railroad buildings. One of the first acts against drugs was the Opium Exclusion Act of 1909. It prohibited the smoking of opium, ingested by a vast percentage of caucasian housewives in America, but smoked mainly by Asian American immigrants coming to build the railroads. These immigrants were targeted with anti-Asian sentiment as America had a stigma that they came solely to take away jobs. Experts say that the easiest thing to do if we can't remove our problems by killing them is to throw them in jail, and America found a way to do this by criminalizing aspects of ethnic traditions and practices.[citation needed] This continued with African Americans and cocaine and led to the cycle that we now see today.[citation needed]\\r\\nThe?Sentencing Reform Act?emerged as the ultimate culmination to this. By going tough on crimes, the United States federal government tried to increase consistency on federal sentencing. This stemmed from a tough on crime campaign headed largely by Ronald Reagan. The Crime rate was steadily dipping by upwards of an average of 8 percent each year, and 12 percent in violent crime in the years preceding the bill pointing to numerous questions at the true motive of the bill. Many experts, such as Michael C. Campbell, a doctorate in the department of criminology at the University of Missouri- St.Louis, declares that the scheme of a war on crime was used for political action. Fear was created among the citizens of the state and thus the country looked to him to keep their doors safe. The effects of this bill on the incarceration are shown in the diagram to the right. The effects on crime per 100,000 capita released by the department of homeland security states that violent crimes remained to steadily decrease; however, in the 10 years following the bill, crimes such as rape, theft, robbery, and murder grew by 6, 4, 3, and 2 percent, respectively. It is important to understand the political domination that a war on drugs and crime created, and thus shapes the prison industrial complex today. While incarceration stays at an all time high, crime was actually decreasing.\\r\\nThe motivation for these acts can also be looked at from an economical lens as well. Private prison companies have 3.3 billion dollars in yearly revenue, once growing by over 175% yearly. Buying and trading goods produced by those in prisons stems from exploiting prisoners as free labor. The running of prisons costs numerous sums of money for American tax payers: 31,087 dollars per year per prisoner, just 3 thousand shy of the national average salary. Companies benefit greatly from the use of these prisoners and the construction of prisons and their infrastructure. This causes more and more to be invested in prisons rather than reform programs to help guide individuals out of prison. Many towns have spawned as \\"prison-towns\\" in the last 70 years. These towns are run solely by the prison, and to keep its economy flourishing, jobs must be readily available. They solved this by building a prison and incarcerating more individuals for nonviolent crimes. With more prisoners comes more responsibility to hold the prisoners which creates more jobs. This scheme creates a vicious cycle of incarceration that is also duly responsible for the growth in the incarceration rate. Many experts believe the for-profit private prison expansion motivated by economic benefit, laid down by the foundation of the war on drugs, is the reason why the incarceration rate will remain to increase in the coming years.\\r\\nIt is important to analyze this from a logical perspective as well. Matthew De Michael (Ph. D from William Penn University) frankly states the issues with the American people regarding the recognition of the corruption hidden within the modern era of prisons. He states that the system has a fatal flaw, and though he believes parts are necessary, he notes that money is not invested in reform programs to help get prisoners out of jail and off with jobs. With prisoners coming out of prison with a felony, their chances of receiving a job, experts estimate, are reduced by 78%. To make ends meet, they will fall back into the cycle of drug dealing, and with laws continuing to become stricter and stricter, they will come back to prison. This makes for over-crowding and the ultimate expansion of jails.\\r\\nIn the 1980s, the rising number of people incarcerated as a result of the War on Drugs and the wave of privatization that occurred under the Reagan Administration saw the emergence of the for-profit prison industry. Prior to the 1980s, private prisons did not exist in the US.[52][53][54]\\r\\nIn a 2011 report by the ACLU, it is claimed that the rise of the for-profit prison industry is a \\"major contributor\\" to \\"mass incarceration,\\" along with bloated state budgets.[55] Louisiana, for example, has the highest rate of incarceration in the world with the majority of its prisoners being housed in privatized, for-profit facilities. Such institutions could face bankruptcy without a steady influx of prisoners.[56] A 2013 Bloomberg report states that in the past decade the number of inmates in for-profit prisons throughout the U.S. rose 44 percent.[57]\\r\\nCorporations who operate prisons, such as the Corrections Corporation of America and The GEO Group, spend significant amounts of money lobbying the federal government along with state governments.[55] The two aforementioned companies, the largest in the industry, have been contributors to the American Legislative Exchange Council (ALEC), which seeks to expand the privatization of corrections and lobbies for policies that would increase incarceration, such as three-strike laws and truth-in-sentencing legislation.[58][59][60][61][62][63] Prison companies also sign contracts with states that guarantee at least 90 percent of prison beds be filled. If these \\"lockup quotas\\" aren't met, the state must reimburse the prison company for the unused beds. Prison companies use the profits to expand and put pressure on lawmakers to incarcerate a certain number of people.[64][65] This influence on the government by the private prison industry has been referred to as the Prisonÿindustrial complex.[60]\\r\\nThe industry is well aware of what reduced crime rates could mean to their bottom line. This from the CCA's SEC report in 2010:\\r\\nOur growth  depends on a number of factors we cannot control, including crime rates  [R]eductions in crime rates  could lead to reductions in arrests, convictions and sentences requiring incarceration at correctional facilities.[55]\\r\\nGallup polling since 1989 has found that in most years in which there was a decline in the U.S. crime rate, a majority of Americans said that violent crime was getting worse.[66][67][68]\\r\\nA substantial body of research claims that incarceration rates are primarily a function of media editorial policies, largely unrelated to the actual crime rate. Constructing Crime: Perspectives on Making News and Social Problems is a book collecting together papers on this theme.[69] The researchers say that the jump in incarceration rate from 0.1% to 0.5% of the United States population from 1975 to 2000 (documented in the figure above) was driven by changes in the editorial policies of the mainstream commercial media and is unrelated to any actual changes in crime. Media consolidation reduced competition on content. That allowed media company executives to maintain substantially the same audience while slashing budgets for investigative journalism and filling the space from the police blotter, which tended to increase and stabilize advertising revenue. It is safer, easier and cheaper to write about crimes committed by poor people than the wealthy. Poor people can be libeled with impunity, but major advertisers can materially impact the profitability of a commercial media organization by reducing their purchases of advertising space with that organization.\\r\\nNews media thrive on feeding frenzies (such as missing white women) because they tend to reduce production costs while simultaneously building an audience interested in the latest development in a particular story. It takes a long time for a reporter to learn enough to write intelligently about a specific issue. Once a reporter has achieved that level of knowledge, it is easier to write subsequent stories. However, major advertisers have been known to spend their advertising budgets through different channels when they dislike the editorial policies. Therefore, a media feeding frenzy focusing on an issue of concern to an advertiser may reduce revenue and profits.[70]\\r\\nSacco described how \\"competing news organizations responded to each other's coverage [while] the police, in their role as gatekeepers of crime news, reacted to the increased media interest by making available more stories that reflected and reinforced\\" a particular theme. \\"[T]he dynamics of competitive journalism created a media feeding frenzy that found news workers 'snatching at shocking numbers' and 'smothering reports of stable or decreasing use under more ominous headlines.'\\"[71]\\r\\nThe reasons cited above for increased incarcerations (US racial demographics, Increased sentencing laws, and Drug sentencing laws) have been described as consequences of the shift in editorial policies of the mainstream media.[72]\\r\\nAccording to the Federal Bureau of Prisons, 77.6% of Federal inmates are U.S. citizens (as of April 2016). 15.2% are citizens of Mexico, and the next three countriesColombia, Cuba, and the Dominican Republic, contribute less than 1% each. 4.9% have other or unknown citizenship.

He founded the Mel Blount Youth Home.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nBlount was born in Toombs County, Georgia.[3] The early years of his life were spent in poverty on a Georgia farm. Blount was a star in baseball, football, basketball, and track at Lyons High School. Upon graduation, he was offered a scholarship to Southern University in Baton Rouge, Louisiana. While there, he was a Pro-Scouts All-American pick as both safety and cornerback.\\r\\nBlount was the prototype cornerback of his era and a significant reason why the Pittsburgh Steelers were the dominant team of the National Football League in the 1970s.[3] A third-round draft choice of the Pittsburgh Steelers in 1970, he had the size, speed, and quickness for the position, plus the toughness and mental ability to adjust his coverage tactics and excel despite rule changes that favored receivers.\\r\\nA Pro-Scouts All-American as both a safety and cornerback at Southern University, Blount became a starter in the Steelers secondary beginning in 1972. That season, he did not allow a single touchdown.[citation needed] Blount was equally effective playing either zone or man-to-man defense. Known for his rugged style of play, his specialty was the bump-and-run pass defense. Because of his size and speed, he physically overpowered pass receivers.\\r\\nMidway through his career, however, the rules regarding pass coverage were changed, making such harassment of a receiver illegal. The rule would come to be named the Mel Blount Rule. Blount ended his career with 57 interceptions, which he returned for 736 yards and two touchdowns. He intercepted at least one pass in all 14 NFL seasons and led the league in interceptions with 11 in 1975. Blount also was used as a kickoff returner early in his career. He totaled 36 returns for 911 yards and a 25.3-yard average. He also recovered 13 opponents' fumbles, two of which he returned for touchdowns.\\r\\nBlount, who was named the NFL's most valuable defensive player in 1975 by the Associated Press, earned All-Pro acclaim in 1975, 1976, 1977 and 1981.

His fumble recovery in the 1979 AFC Championship Game led to the Steelers' winning touchdown in a 27-13 victory over the Houston Oilers. A season earlier in Super Bowl XIII, Blount's interception ignited a Pittsburgh drive that resulted in a go-ahead touchdown in a 35-31 victory over the Dallas Cowboys.\\r\\nFollowing his football career, Blount became Director of Player Relations for the NFL, serving in the position from 1983 to 1990. He also became active in charity work. He founded the Mel Blount Youth Home, a shelter and Christian mission for victims of child abuse and neglect in Toombs County, Georgia in 1983. In 1989, he opened a second youth home in Claysville, Pennsylvania, near Pittsburgh. The Mel Blount Youth Home was investigated for the use of corporal punishment in the 1990s.[4]\\r\\nIn 1989, he was inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame and the Louisiana Sports Hall of Fame.

If the meat is not fatty enough, strips of fat are added so that the roasting meat always remains moist and crisp. The rate of roasting can be adjusted by varying the strength of the heat and the distance between the heat and the meat, allowing the cook to adjust to varying rates of consumption. The outside of the meat is sliced vertically in thin, crisp shavings when done. It is generally served in an oiled, lightly grilled piece of pita, rolled up with sliced tomatoes, chopped onions, fries, and tzatziki. Gyros form part of the sandwich family and are differentiated from other hand-held semi-folded foods by their complete over-wrap but unsecured lower flap.[1]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe name comes from Greek ??

The PRC has for several decades been synonymous with China, but it is only the most recent political entity to govern mainland China, preceded by the Republic of China (ROC) and thousands of years of imperial dynasties.\\r\\n\\r\\nFollowing the Chinese Civil War and the victory of Mao Zedong's Communist forces over the Kuomintang forces of Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek, who fled to Taiwan, Mao declared the founding of the People's Republic of China on October 1, 1949. Mao's first goal was a total overhaul of the land ownership system, and extensive land reforms. China's old system of gentry landlord ownership of farmland and tenant peasants was replaced with a distribution system in favor of poor/landless peasants which significantly reduced economic inequality. Over a million landlords were executed.[1] In Zhangzhuangcun, in the more thoroughly reformed north of the country, most \\"landlords\\" and \\"rich peasants\\" had lost all their land and often their lives or had fled. All formerly landless workers had received land, which eliminated this category altogether. As a result, \\"middling peasants,\\" who now accounted for 90 percent of the village population, owned 90.8 percent of the land.[2] Mao laid heavy theoretical emphasis on class struggle, and in 1953 began various campaigns to persecute former landlords and merchants, including the execution of more powerful landlords. Drug trafficking in the country as well as foreign investment were largely wiped out.\\r\\n\\r\\nMao believed that socialism would eventually triumph over all other ideologies, and following the First Five-Year Plan based on a Soviet-style centrally controlled economy, Mao took on the ambitious project of the Great Leap Forward in 1958, beginning an unprecedented process of collectivization in rural areas. Mao urged the use of communally organized iron smelters to increase steel production, pulling workers off of agricultural labor to the point that large amounts of crops rotted unharvested. Mao decided to continue to advocate these smelters despite a visit to a factory steel mill which proved to him that high quality steel could only be produced in a factory. He thought that ending the program would dampen peasant enthusiasm for his political mobilization, the Great Leap Forward.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe implementation of Maoist thought in China may have been responsible for over 40ÿ70 million deaths including famine during peacetime[3], with the Great Leap Forward,  Anti-Rightist Campaign of 1957ÿ1958,[4] and the Cultural Revolution. Millions died from both executions and forced labour.\\r\\nBecause of Mao's land reforms during the Great Leap Forward, which resulted in massive famines, thirty million perished between 1958 and 1961.  By the end of 1961 the birth rate was nearly cut in half because of malnutrition.[5] Active campaigns, including party purges and \\"reeducation\\" resulted in the imprisonment or execution of those deemed to hold views contrary to Maoist ideals.[6]\\r\\nMao's failure with the Leap reduced his power in government, whose administrative duties fell to Liu Shaoqi and Deng Xiaoping.\\r\\n\\r\\nTo impose socialist orthodoxy and rid China of \\"old elements\\", and at the same time serving certain political goals, Mao began the Cultural Revolution in May 1966. The campaign was far reaching into all aspects of Chinese life. Red Guards terrorized the streets as many ordinary citizens were deemed counter-revolutionaries. Education and public transportation came to a nearly complete halt. Daily life involved shouting slogans and reciting Mao quotations. Many prominent political leaders, including Liu and Deng, were purged and deemed \\"capitalist-roaders\\". The campaign would not come to a complete end until the death of Mao in 1976.\\r\\n\\r\\nSupporters of the Maoist Era claim that under Mao, China's unity and sovereignty was assured for the first time in a century, and there was development of infrastructure, industry, healthcare, education (only 20% of the population could read in 1949, compared to 65.5% thirty years later)[7], which raised standard of living for the average Chinese. They also claimed that campaigns such as the Great Leap Forward ÿ an example of the concept New Democracy ÿ and the Cultural Revolution were essential in jumpstarting China's development and \\"purifying\\" its culture. Others[8] claim that though the consequences of both these campaigns were economically and humanly disastrous, they left behind a \\"clean slate\\" on which later economic progress could be built. Supporters often also doubt statistics or accounts given for death tolls or other damages incurred by Mao's campaigns, attributing the high death toll to natural disasters, famine, or other consequences of political chaos during the rule of Chiang Kai-shek.\\r\\n\\r\\nMao Zedong's death was followed by a power struggle between the Gang of Four, Hua Guofeng, and eventually Deng Xiaoping. Deng would maneuver himself to the top of China's leadership by 1980. At the Third Plenum of the Eleventh National Party Congress Central Committee, Deng embarked China on the road to Economic Reforms and Openness (T˜ Gaige Kaifang), policies that began with the de-collectivization of the countryside, followed with industrial reforms aimed at decentralizing government controls in the industrial sector. A major document presented at the September 1979 Fourth Plenum, gave a \\"preliminary assessment\\" of the entire 30-year period of Communist rule. At the plenum, party Vice Chairman Ye Jianying declared the Cultural Revolution \\"an appalling catastrophe\\" and \\"the most severe setback to [the] socialist cause since [1949].\\"[9] The Chinese government's condemnation of the Cultural Revolution culminated in the Resolution on Certain Questions in the History of Our Party Since the Founding of the People's Republic of China, adopted by the Sixth Plenary Session of the Eleventh Central Committee of the Communist Party of China. This stated that \\"Comrade Mao Zedong was a great Marxist and a great proletarian revolutionary, strategist and theorist. It is true that he made gross mistakes during the \\"cultural revolution\\", but, if we judge his activities as a whole, his contributions to the Chinese revolution far outweigh his mistakes. His merits are primary and his errors secondary.\\"[10]\\r\\n\\r\\nOn the subject of Mao's legacy Deng coined the famous phrase \\"7 parts good, 3 parts bad\\" and avoided denouncing Mao altogether. Deng championed the idea of Special Economic Zones (SEZs), areas where foreign investment would be allowed to pour in without strict government restraint and regulations, running on a basically capitalist system. Deng laid emphasis on light industry as a stepping stone to the development of heavy industries.\\r\\n\\r\\nSupporters of the economic reforms point to the rapid development of the consumer and export sectors of the economy, the creation of an urban middle class that now constitutes 15% of the population, higher living standards (which is shown via dramatic increases in GDP per capita, consumer spending, life expectancy, literacy rate, and total grain output) and a much wider range of personal rights and freedoms for average Chinese as evidence of the success of the reforms.\\r\\n\\r\\nAlthough standards of living improved significantly in the 1980s, Deng's reforms were not without criticism. Hard-liners asserted that Deng opened China once again to various social evils, and an overall increase in materialistic thinking, while liberals attacked Deng's unrelenting stance on political reform. Liberal forces began gathering in different forms to protest against the Party's authoritarian leadership. In 1989, the death of Hu Yaobang, a liberal figure, triggered weeks of spontaneous protests in the Tiananmen Square. The government imposed martial law and sent in tanks and soldiers to suppress the demonstrations. Western countries and multilateral organizations briefly suspended their formal ties with China's government under Premier Li Peng's leadership, which was directly responsible for the military curfew and bloody crackdown.\\r\\n\\r\\nCritics of the economic reforms, both in China and abroad, claim that the reforms have caused wealth disparity, environmental pollution, rampant corruption, widespread unemployment associated with layoffs at inefficient state-owned enterprises, and has introduced often unwelcome cultural influences. Consequently, they believe that China's culture has been corrupted, the poor have been reduced to a hopeless abject underclass, and that the social stability is threatened. They are also of the opinion that various political reforms, such as moves towards popular elections, have been unfairly nipped in the bud.  Regardless of either view, today, the public perception of Mao has improved at least superficially; images of Mao and Mao related objects have become fashionable, commonly used on novelty items and even as talismans. However, the path of modernization and market-oriented economic reforms that China started since the early 1980s appears to be fundamentally unchallenged. Even critics of China's market reforms do not wish to see a backtrack of these two decades of reforms, but rather propose corrective measures to offset some of the social issues caused by existing reforms.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1979, the Chinese government instituted a one child policy to try to control its rapidly increasing population.  The controversial policy resulted in a dramatic decrease in child poverty. The law currently applies to about a third of mainland Chinese, with plans in place to ease it to a two-child limit.[11][12]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe achievements of Lee Kuan Yew to create an economic superpower in Singapore had a profound effect on the Communist leadership in China. They made a major effort, especially under Deng Xiaoping, to emulate his policies of economic growth, entrepreneurship, and subtle suppression of dissent. Over 22,000 Chinese officials were sent to Singapore to study its methods.[13]\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter the events at Tiananmen, Deng Xiaoping retired from public view. While keeping ultimate control, power was passed onto the third generation of leadership led by Jiang Zemin, who was hailed as its \\"core\\". Economic growth, despite foreign trade embargoes, returned to a fast pace by the mid-1990s. Jiang's macroeconomic reforms furthered Deng's vision for \\"Socialism with Chinese Characteristics\\". At the same time, Jiang's period saw a continued rise in social corruption in all areas of life.  Unemployment skyrocketed as unprofitable SOE's were closed to make way for more competitive ventures, internally and abroad. The ill-equipped social welfare system was put on a serious test. Jiang also laid heavy emphasis on scientific and technological advancement in areas such as space exploration. To sustain vast human consumption, the Three Gorges Dam was built, attracting supporters and widespread criticism. Environmental pollution became a very serious problem as Beijing was frequently hit by sandstorms as a result of desertification.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe 1990s saw two foreign colonies returned to China, Hong Kong from Britain in 1997, and Macau from Portugal in 1999. Hong Kong and Macau mostly continued their own governance, retaining independence in their economic, social, and judicial systems.\\r\\n\\r\\nJiang and President Clinton exchanged state visits, but Sino-American relations took very sour turns at the end of the decade. On May 7, 1999, during the Kosovo War, US aircraft bombed the Chinese embassy in Belgrade. The U.S. government claimed the strike was due to bad intelligence and false target identification.\\r\\n\\r\\nInside the US, the Cox Report stated that China had been stealing various top US military secrets.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 2001, a US surveillance plane collided with a Chinese fighter jet over international waters near Hainan, inciting further outrage with the Chinese public, already dissatisfied with the US.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn the political agenda, China was once again put on the spotlight for the banning of public Falun Gong activity in 1999. Silent protesters from the spiritual movement sat outside of Zhongnanhai, asking for dialogue with China's leaders. Jiang saw it as threatening to the political situation and outlawed the group altogether, while using the mass media to denounce it as an evil cult.\\r\\n\\r\\nConversely, Premier Zhu Rongji's economic policies held China's economy strong during the Asian Financial Crisis. Economic growth averaged at 8% annually, pushed back by the 1998 Yangtze River Floods. After a decade of talks, China was finally admitted into the World Trade Organization.  Standards of living improved significantly, although a wide urban-rural wealth gap was opened, as China saw the reappearance of the middle class. Wealth disparity between East and the Western hinterlands continued to widen by the day, prompting government programs to \\"develop the West\\", taking on such ambitious projects such as the Qinghai-Tibet Railway. The burden of education was greater than ever.  Rampant corruption continued despite Premier Zhu's anti-corruption campaign that executed many officials.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe first major issue faced by China in the 21st century as a new generation of leaders led by Hu Jintao after assuming power was the public health crisis involving SARS, an illness that seemed to have originated out of Guangdong province. China's position in the war on terror drew the country closer diplomatically to the United States. The economy continues to grow in double-digit numbers as the development of rural areas became the major focus of government policy. In gradual steps to consolidate his power, Hu Jintao removed Shanghai Party Chief Chen Liangyu and other potential political opponents amidst the fight against corruption, and the ongoing struggle against once powerful Shanghai clique. The assertion of the Scientific Perspective to create a Socialist Harmonious Society is the focus of the Hu-Wen administration, as some Jiang-era excesses are slowly reversed. In the years after Hu's rise to power, respect of basic human rights in China continue to be a source of concern.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe political status and future of Taiwan remain uncertain, but steps have been taken to improving relations between the Communist Party and several of Taiwan's parties that hold a less antagonistic view towards China, notably former rival Kuomintang.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe continued economic growth of the country as well as its sporting power status gained China the right to host the 2008 Summer Olympics. However, this also put Hu's administration under intense spotlight.  While the 2008 Olympic was commonly understood to be a come-out party for People's Republic of China, in light of the March 2008 Tibet protests, the government received heavy scrutiny. The Olympic torch was met with protest en route. Within the country these reactions were met with a fervent wave of nationalism with accusations of Western bias against China.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn May 2008, a massive earthquake registering 8.0 on the Richter scale hit Sichuan province of China, exacting a death toll officially estimated at approximately 70,000.  The government responded more quickly than it did with previous events, and has allowed foreign media access to the regions that were hit the hardest.  The adequacy of the government response was generally praised, and the relief efforts extended to every corner of Chinese life.\\r\\nIn May and June 2008, heavy rains in southern China caused severe flooding in the provinces of Anhui, Hunan, Jiangxi, Fujian and Guangdong, with dozens of fatalities and over a million people forced to evacuate. As of 2009 China has increased its internet monitoring capabilities by adding hundreds of new monitoring stations.","input":"Who was the founding father of the peoples republic of china?"},{"output":"Harsha","context":"Ratnavali is a Sanskrit drama about a beautiful princess named Ratnavali, and a great king named Udayana. It is attributed to the Indian emperor Harsha (606ÿ648).[1][2] It is a Natika in four acts. One of the first textual references to the celebration of Holi, the festival of Colours have been found in this text.[3]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nUdayana, King of Kaushambi, is both valiant and romantic. He is happily married to Vasavadatta, princess of a neighboring kingdom, and the story of their courtship and wedding is the subject of an earlier work, Svapnavasavadattam, written by Bhsa.\\r\\n\\r\\nUdayana is well-served by Yougandharayana, an extremely loyal and astute, if rather presumptuous and devious minister. Yougandharayana now wishes the king to marry Ratnavali, princess of the distant island kingdom of Simhala (presumably Sri Lanka). This is because a sage had prophesied that the man who marries Ratnavali would become a Sarvabhauma (Emperor). Incidentally, Ratnavali's father, king Vikramabahu of Simhala, is Vasavadatta's uncle. He is aware that Udayana and Vasavadatta are unusually close to each other (because they had married for love), and that a second wife would either be unhappy herself or make his niece Vasavadatta unhappy. He is therefore initially reluctant to accept the proposal of marriage which the minister makes to him. While the envoys from Kaushambi are still in Simhala with the proposal, the news reaches them that Queen Vasavadatta is dead, having perished in a fire which engulfed a hunting camp at Lavanaka. This news is in fact a falsehood initiated by the devious minister in order to facilitate the second marriage. King Vikramabahu is however taken in by the ploy, and agrees to give his daughter in marriage to Udayana. The necessary preparations are made, and Princess Ratnavali embarks on a ship to make the voyage to Kaushambi and her new life as queen of that kingdom.\\r\\n\\r\\nUnfortunately, a storm crosses their path and the ship gets wrecked. Ratnavali alone is rescued by a passing merchant ship, and reaches the mainland safely. She however does not reveal her identity as princess of Simhala to the people who rescue her, because she is fearful of being held for political ransom, that her father or fiance will be made to give up territories to secure her release. She therefore pretends to be suffering from amnesia. The merchants who rescue her are impressed by her rich garments, her refined speech and cultivated manners. They infer from all this that she is a lady of noble birth. Therefore, when they reach their native land (which is Kaushambi, by a coincidence), they place the nameless maiden in the custody of minister Yougandharayana. By this time, news of the shipwreck and the loss of Princess Ratnavali has reached Kaushambi. The minister immediately recognizes that the girl rescued from the sea and suffering from amnesia is almost certainly the princess. He also sees the situation as an opportunity to reconcile Vasavadatta to the idea of receiving a co-wife. He gives the rescued girl a new name, \\"Sagarika,\\" (\\"Ocean-lady\\"), takes her to the queen and asks her to keep the homeless waif as a maid. The queen agrees, and \\"Sagarika\\" becomes Vasavadatta's maid.\\r\\n\\r\\nOnce, in the cupid festival, Sagarika sees Udayana and instantly falls in love with him. Sagarika sits in a grove and keeps herself occupied in drawing Udayana's picture and fantasizing about him. Her shrewd friend Susangatha finds her, takes the picture into her hands and draws the picture of Sagarika by the side of the king. Sagarika confesses her love to Susangatha and a bird Sarika hears the conversation. Suddenly, there is a panic in the grove because of an escaped monkey and the maidens run away from there.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter a while, the Udayana and his jester enter the grove and hear the bird Sarika reproduce the ladies' conversation. They find the picture Sagarika and Susangatha have drawn, and Udayana finds it alluring. By this time, the two maidens return and overhear the conversation of the king and his jester, and see that Udayana is interested in Sagarika. Susangatha then makes a plan to bring Udayana and Sagarika together, but Vasavadatta (Udayana's first wife) also finds the picture when walking in the grove. Susangatha's plan is destroyed by the angry Vasavadatta and she leaves the grove without accepting Udayana's words of appeasement.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the third act, the jester and Susangata hatch a plan to make Udayana and Sagarika meet. Sagarika disguises herself as Vasavadatta, and Susangata as her maid. They go to meet Udayana, who has been told of the plan and is expecting Sagarika to come in Vasavadatta's disguise. But the real Vasavadatta comes to know of this plan and also sets off to meet Udayana. Vasavadatta reaches him first, but Udayana mistakes her for Sagarika and declares that he loves her. Vasavadatta is very angry at Udayana for the second time, and reproaches him and walks away. Sagarika comes to know that their plan is foiled again, and ties a noose to her neck wanting to commit suicide. Meanwhile, Udayana is frantically searching for the real Vasavadatta, and finds Sagarika about to die. He mistakes her for the real Vasavadatta, and saves her. Afterwards, the two recognize each other and finally they have a chance to declare their love. But at exactly the same moment, Vasavadatta, having calmed down, comes back to Udayana ready for appeasement. She is outraged for the third time on seeing Sagarika and Udayana together, and throws Sagarika into prison.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the fourth act, no one knows where Sagarika is imprisoned by Vasavadatta. Suddenly, there is heard a news of the royal harem catching fire. It turns out that Sagarika is kept there, and Vasavadatta turns remorseful. She implores Udayana to run to her rescue. Udayana comes out safely from the fire with Sagarika. It is later revealed that the entire fire was a trick by a magician. At this tense moment, Babhravya and Vasubhuti recognize Sagarika to be the Simhala princess. Yaugandharayana enters and reveals himself to be the plotter.  Vasavadatta now gladly brings about the marriage of Udayana and Ratnavali, her cousin, relying on the prophecy.\\r\\n\\r\\nA Natika should be based on an invented love-story according to Sahityadarpana.  But this play, although a natika, does not present to us an entirely original story.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Udayana legend is found in both Jaina and Bauddha literature besides the Kathasaritsagara, Brihatkathamanjari and Brihatkathalokasangraha. The Jaina legends are not earlier than the 12th century, while the Bauddha ones are of about 4th century.\\r\\n\\r\\nMany distinguished poets of ancient India, who flourished before Sri Harsha, have referred to the love of Udayana and Vasavadatta, and the devotion of Yougandharayana for his master Udayana. This shows how popular the story of Udayana was even in Ancient India. Kalidasa has referred to Udayana in his Meghaduta. ?udraka refers in his Mricchakatika to the devotion of minister Yaugandharayana to Udayana. Bhsa has dramatized the story in his two plays Pratignayougandharayanam and Swapnavsadattam.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn conclusion, it can be said that it is not unlikely that Sri Harsha took the frame-work of the Udayana story from either the Bauddha literature or some early version of the Brihatkatha and dramatized it in his own way.  Although the story is not entirely invented, it must be admitted that the treatment of it at Harsha's hands is quite original and that the play on the whole is a very charming one.","input":"The author of the play/book ratnawali is?"},{"output":"September 12, 2012","context":"Dirty Jobs is a TV series on the Discovery Channel in which host Mike Rowe is shown performing difficult, strange, disgusting, or messy occupational duties alongside the typical employees. The show, produced by Pilgrim Films & Television, premiered with three pilot episodes in November 2003. It returned as a series on July 26, 2005, running for eight seasons until September 12, 2012. The show's setting was refocused in Australia for the eighth season, advertised as Dirty Jobs Down Under.[1]\\r\\nThere is also a European edition of the show hosted by former Manchester United and Denmark goalkeeper Peter Schmeichel.[2]\\r\\nOn November 21, 2012, Rowe announced that Discovery Channel had cancelled Dirty Jobs.[3] In 2014, Rowe announced that CNN had picked up Somebody's Gotta Do It, starring him and featuring many of the Dirty Jobs crew.\\r\\nThe series was nominated for 5 Primetime Emmys: 3 for Outstanding Reality Program, which Rowe was nominated for as a producer, and 2 for Cinematography.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nA worker or team of workers takes on Rowe as a fully involved assistant for a typical work day, working hard to complete every task as best he can despite discomfort, hazards, or repulsive situations - and, at times, all three. The Dirty Jobs crew, including field producer Dave Barsky, cameramen Doug Glover, Troy Paff, and Dan Eggiman, and audio technician Josh Atkins, often get just as dirty as Rowe does. Rowe frequently takes on-camera jabs at Dave Barsky, regarding Barsky's penchant for setting up scenes where Rowe will encounter the most dangerous or dirty part of the job in order to get a great camera shot; indeed, the entire crew frequently joke and prank each other on-camera, for example, when a safety officer finishes going over the rules and regulations for the Billboard Installer job in the third season (the safety officer asks Rowe to sign a release, which he does while mock-voicing the words he signs: \\"Dave...Barsky...\\"), or attempting to film Troy defecating in the woods.[4]\\r\\nRowe engages in near-constant self-deprecating humor, making what he calls \\"dirty jokes\\", but rarely more than the occasional playful jab at the workers themselves. Nearly every job is even more difficult than he had expected, and this often has him expressing admiration and respect for the workers' skills and their willingness to take on jobs that most people avoid. The show always begins with the following quote from Rowe, usually spoken while in the midst of a particularly dirty task:\\r\\nMy name's Mike Rowe, and this is my job. I explore the country looking for people who aren't afraid to get dirty  hard-working men and women who earn an honest living doing the kinds of jobs that make civilized life possible for the rest of us. Now, get ready to get dirty.\\r\\nThe show is a spin-off of a segment host Mike Rowe once did on a local San Francisco show called Evening Magazine. The segment was called Somebody's Gotta Do It. After completing a graphic piece on cow artificial insemination, Rowe was inundated with letters expressing \\"shock, horror, fascination, disbelief, and wonder\\". Rowe sent the tape to numerous networks, including Comedy Central, who replied saying \\"At this time, our fall schedule does not allow for a talk show that takes place inside a septic tank.\\"[5] Ultimately Rowe also sent the tape to the Discovery Channel, which commissioned a series based on this format.[6] Dirty Jobs was produced by Craig Piligian (executive producer) of Pilgrim Films & Television. The Discovery Channel executive producer was Gena McCarthy.\\r\\nOn May 6, 2013 Mike Rowe posted on Facebook that he was open to creating a new show that is similar to Dirty Jobs using Somebody's Gotta Do It, the title of the original segment that had inspired Dirty Jobs. Rowe said that if half the people on his Facebook fan page said \\"Hey, Mike, here's 10 bucks for jet fuel and basic production costs,\\" he'd \\"put the band back together and start shooting Somebody's Gotta Do It tomorrow.\\"[7] On April 10, 2014 Rowe announced on his Facebook page that CNN had decided to air the show.[8]\\r\\nIn July 2006, the show aired two special episodes to kick off and wrap up Discovery's annual Shark Week, of which Mike Rowe was the host. The episodes featured him in a number of jobs related to the animals, some as outlandish as shark repellent tester and shark suit tester, both of which necessitated his jumping into a shark feeding frenzy. As a pun on Discovery Channel's \\"Shark Week\\" theme, the two episodes were named \\"Jobs That Bite\\" and \\"Jobs That Bite... Harder\\" for the opening and closing hours respectively.\\r\\nIn late August 2006, the show reached a milestone with Mike Rowe's 100th dirty job. This was commemorated with a special two-hour episode which mainly showed Mike's day with the U.S. Army's 187th Ordnance Battalion at Fort Jackson, and included bloopers plus an \\"about me\\" segment of Mike's crew. At the end of the episode, Mike Rowe and Dave Barsky had a guitar/banjo duet and performed a song about the 100 dirty jobs. A 2-hour 150th job special aired in early December 2007, which combined footage of Rowe's 150th job (working on a yak and bison farm in Montana) with footage of a party held at a San Francisco garbage dump where people featured in past Dirty Jobs segments were reunited with Rowe. In 2009, the show returned for a fifth season, with Rowe commenting in promotional spots, \\"After 200 dirty jobs, I'm back for more.\\"\\r\\nIt was renewed for a seventh season,[9] which Rowe described as including \\"a broader geographical palate.\\"[10]\\r\\nAn eighth season, marketed as Dirty Jobs Down Under, premiered on August 22, 2012.[1] There were only four episodes filmed for season eight.[11]\\r\\nAs a result of being featured in the season 1 episode \\"Vexcon\\", exterminator Billy Bretherton later starred in his own series on A&E, Billy the Exterminator.\\r\\nEach episode ends with a segment, usually shot at a previous dirty job, where Rowe tells the viewers that the show's continued existence depends on viewer submissions of suggestions for additional dirty jobs, and instructs them to go to the show's website for details on how to submit ideas (this segment is, however, usually edited out of the Canadian broadcasts of the series on Discovery Channel Canada). Rowe has often noted on-screen and off-screen that without viewer contributions, the show would be lost; Rowe originally concocted a list of a dozen jobs that could be featured in the three episodes that served as the show's pilot, and within days after the first episode aired, viewers flooded Discovery Channel with e-mail and video featuring their own dirty jobs, a tradition that has kept the show going ever since. As Rowe explained to Craig Ferguson on an episode of The Late Late Show with Craig Ferguson in July 2007 about his original cache of jobs for the pilots, \\"I haven't had an original idea since then\\".[12]\\r\\nAccording to roadkill taxidermy artist Stephen Paternite, Dirty Jobs filmed a segment featuring him in 2003, which was ultimately cut by the Discovery Channel as \\"too gross\\". The segment follows Mike Rowe and Paternite as they gather and skin dead raccoons, which Paternite will eventually turn into art pieces. The segment is available to view on Paternite's website,[13] and on YouTube, under the name \\"Too Gross for Discovery\\".[14] In an interview on The Late Late Show with Craig Ferguson, Rowe also mentioned that there were several segments which they have chosen not to air because they were too disturbing, including a \\"body farmer\\". Even aired segments can be heavily edited, such as the \\"skull cleaner\\" segment, the final aired version of which Mike has likened to \\"The Sound of Music with the songs edited out\\" because parts of it were deemed too graphic for television.[15]\\r\\nThere is also an episode produced in 2006 wherein Rowe visited his doctor while producers Piligian and Eddie Barbini try two dirty jobs themselves. The episode, entitled \\"Mike's Day Off\\", was never aired in the United States for that season; it was only available as a DVD-exclusive episode (bundled with the episode \\"Skull Cleaner\\") and a downloadable episode in iTunes.[16] The episode has been aired in some local Discovery Channel feeds such as those of Southeast Asia and Australia, as well as on Discovery Channel Canada before finally being aired in the United States on March 3, 2009. Various episodes air in certain countries with different scenes.\\r\\nThe show's theme song was originally Faith No More's \\"We Care A Lot\\" which features the lyrics, \\"Oh, it's a dirty job but someone's gotta do it\\". In the first half of 2007, it was replaced with a generic theme song by Matt Koskenmaki[17] (who also did the other music cues for the show), due to rights issues; older episodes aired at the time had their introductions reedited. Mike Rowe has said \\"Bottom line, the rights to 'We Care a Lot' were either not renewed on time, or not properly acquired in the first place\\".[18] Although the network has not issued any statement clarifying the situation, \\"We Care A Lot\\" returned as the show's theme song beginning with the June 26, 2007 episode and has been retained on subsequent DVD releases of earlier episodes.\\r\\nSeason 2 commercials for the show feature the song \\"Dirty White Boy\\" by Foreigner. Season 3 commercials feature Rowe sharing the stage with a pig positioned on a rounded white pedestal, with nondescript formal-sounding light instrumental music in the background.\\r\\nRowe often sings on-camera during the segments as part of a sardonic hat-tip to his days as an opera singer. During the candy making segment in episode 34 (\\"Fuel Tank Cleaner\\"), Rowe discovers that one of the candy makers makes a confection called \\"opera fudge\\" and ask if she sings opera during the making of opera fudge, then belts out a segment of \\"Vecchia zimarra\\" from Puccini's La Bohme. During the cow pots segment of episode 47 (\\"Poo Pot Maker\\"), Rowe imitates the singing gondoliers of Venice while paddling around the liquid holding lagoon on the Freund farm: \\"'O Sole Mio/Don't know the words/I've paddled for hours/In ponds of turds...\\" In a 2007 episode set at Prince George's Stadium with Mike spending the day doing the \\"dirty jobs\\" associated with groundskeeping and dugout maintenance for the Bowie Baysox minor league baseball team in Bowie, Maryland, Mike ended the segment singing the National Anthem prior to the game and throwing out the first pitch.\\r\\nWhen Mike reads the very last piece of viewer mail in the viewer's choice episode, he was asked if he could sing the Dirty Jobs Theme Song because his online bio says that he used to be an opera singer. So he explained that one night, as they sat on \\"Foley\\" Creek (actually \\"Folly\\" Creek, but he has a tendency to pronounce it incorrectly), after a night of oysters and drinking (likely during the Oyster Harvester segment of the shrimper episode), he, Juke Joint Johnny and Sam (likely Silky Sam) jotted down some lyrics and the \\"official, unofficial Dirty Jobs Theme Song\\" was born. This shortest version of the song clocked in at just under a minute in length, and it varies a bit from later versions, but it is fun in that it was less planned than the later ones.[19]\\r\\nAt the end of the pipe organ specialist segment of the geoduck farmer episode, Mike Rowe sang what he called the Dirty Jobs Anthem.[20] Rowe reprised this moment in the \\"Leather Tanner\\" episode from the third season on an antique piano at the tannery.\\r\\nAt the conclusion of a two-hour special edition commemorating Mike's 100th dirty job, he and field producer Dave Barsky faked a guitar/banjo duet, featuring an extended version of this anthem which ran a little over two minutes in length (Rowe actually sang all the parts while Rowe's friend Matt played all the instruments).[21] The extended song differs slightly from the shorter versions which aired previously, and even the words that are similar vary somewhat. Mike performed the song again with slightly different lyrics on the 150th Job Extravaganza with the Burning Embers.[22]\\r\\nDiscovery Channel issued the following statement in its publicity of the program:\\r\\nDiscovery Channel has released over 130 episodes on DVD and on iTunes.","input":"When did dirty jobs go off the air?"},{"output":"Donald Trump","context":"\\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe President of the United States (POTUS)[B] is the head of state and head of government of the United States of America. The president directs the executive branch of the federal government and is the commander-in-chief of the United States Armed Forces.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn contemporary times, the president is looked upon as one of the world's most powerful political figures and as the leader of the only remaining global superpower.[9][10][11][12] The role includes responsibility for the world's most expensive military that has the second largest nuclear arsenal. The president also leads the nation with the largest economy by nominal GDP. The president possesses significant domestic and international hard and soft power.\\r\\n\\r\\nArticle II of the Constitution establishes the executive branch of the federal government. It vests the executive power of the United States in the president. The power includes the execution and enforcement of federal law, alongside the responsibility of appointing federal executive, diplomatic, regulatory and judicial officers, and concluding treaties with foreign powers with the advice and consent of the Senate. The president is further empowered to grant federal pardons and reprieves, and to convene and adjourn either or both houses of Congress under extraordinary circumstances.[13] The president directs the foreign and domestic policies of the United States, and takes an active role in promoting his policy priorities to members of Congress.[14] In addition, as part of the system of checks and balances, Article I, Section 7 of the Constitution gives the president the power to sign or veto federal legislation. The power of the presidency has grown substantially since its formation, as has the power of the federal government as a whole.[15]\\r\\n\\r\\nThrough the Electoral College, registered voters indirectly elect the president and vice president to a four-year term. This is the only federal election in the United States which is not decided by popular vote.[16] Nine vice presidents became president by virtue of a president's intra-term death or resignation.[C]\\r\\n\\r\\nArticle II, Section 1, Clause 5 sets three qualifications for holding the presidency: natural-born U.S. citizenship; at least thirty-five years of age; and residency in the United States for at least fourteen years. The Twenty-second Amendment precludes any person from being elected president to a third term. In all, 44 individuals have served 45 presidencies spanning 57 full four-year terms.[17] Grover Cleveland served two non-consecutive terms, so he is counted twice; as both the 22nd and 24th president.[18]\\r\\n\\r\\nDonald Trump of New York is the 45th and current president. He assumed office on January 20, 2017.\\r\\n\\r\\nDuring the American Revolution in 1776, the Thirteen Colonies, acting through the Second Continental Congress, declared political independence from Great Britain. The new states were independent of each other as nation states[19] and recognized the necessity of closely coordinating their efforts against the British.[20] Congress desired to avoid anything that remotely resembled a monarchy and negotiated the Articles of Confederation to establish an alliance between the states.[19] Under the Articles, Congress was a central authority without any legislative power. It could make its own resolutions, determinations, and regulations, but not any laws, and could not impose any taxes or enforce local commercial regulations upon its citizens.[20] This institutional design reflected how Americans believed the deposed British system of Crown and Parliament ought to have functioned with respect to the royal dominion: a superintending body for matters that concerned the entire empire.[20] The states were out from under any monarchy and assigned some formerly royal prerogatives (e.g., making war, receiving ambassadors, etc.) to Congress; the remaining prerogatives were lodged within their own respective state governments. The states agreed to a resolution that settled competing western land claims. The Articles took effect on March 1, 1781, when Maryland became the final state to ratify them.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1783, the Treaty of Paris secured independence for each of the former colonies. With peace at hand, the states each turned toward their own internal affairs.[19] By 1786, Americans found their continental borders besieged and weak and their respective economies in crises as neighboring states agitated trade rivalries with one another. They witnessed their hard currency pouring into foreign markets to pay for imports, their Mediterranean commerce preyed upon by North African pirates, and their foreign-financed Revolutionary War debts unpaid and accruing interest.[19] Civil and political unrest loomed.\\r\\n\\r\\nFollowing the successful resolution of commercial and fishing disputes between Virginia and Maryland at the Mount Vernon Conference in 1785, Virginia called for a trade conference between all the states, set for September 1786 in Annapolis, Maryland, with an aim toward resolving further-reaching interstate commercial antagonisms. When the convention failed for lack of attendance due to suspicions among most of the other states, Alexander Hamilton led the Annapolis delegates in a call for a convention to offer revisions to the Articles, to be held the next spring in Philadelphia. Prospects for the next convention appeared bleak until James Madison and Edmund Randolph succeeded in securing George Washington's attendance to Philadelphia as a delegate for Virginia.[19][21]\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen the Constitutional Convention convened in May 1787, the 12 state delegations in attendance (Rhode Island did not send delegates) brought with them an accumulated experience over a diverse set of institutional arrangements between legislative and executive branches from within their respective state governments. Most states maintained a weak executive without veto or appointment powers, elected annually by the legislature to a single term only, sharing power with an executive council, and countered by a strong legislature.[19] New York offered the greatest exception, having a strong, unitary governor with veto and appointment power elected to a three-year term, and eligible for reelection to an indefinite number of terms thereafter.[19] It was through the closed-door negotiations at Philadelphia that the presidency framed in the U.S. Constitution emerged.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Presentment Clause requires that any bill passed by Congress must be presented to the president before it can become law. Once the legislation has been presented, the president has three options:\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1996, Congress attempted to enhance the president's veto power with the Line Item Veto Act. The legislation empowered the president to sign any spending bill into law while simultaneously striking certain spending items within the bill, particularly any new spending, any amount of discretionary spending, or any new limited tax benefit. Congress could then repass that particular item. If the president then vetoed the new legislation, Congress could override the veto by its ordinary means, a two-thirds vote in both houses. In Clinton v. City of New York, 524 U.S. 417 (1998), the U.S. Supreme Court ruled such a legislative alteration of the veto power to be unconstitutional.\\r\\n\\r\\nOne of the most important of all executive powers is the president's role as Commander-in-Chief of the United States Armed Forces. The power to declare war is constitutionally vested in Congress, but the president has ultimate responsibility for the direction and disposition of the military. The exact degree of authority that the Constitution grants to the President as Commander in Chief has been the subject of much debate throughout history, with Congress at various times granting the President wide authority and at others attempting to restrict that authority.[22]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe amount of military detail handled personally by the President in wartime has varied dramatically.[23] George Washington, the first U.S. president, firmly established military subordination under civilian authority. In 1794, Washington used his constitutional powers to assemble 12,000 militia to quell the Whiskey Rebelliona conflict in western Pennsylvania involving armed farmers and distillers who refused to pay excise tax on spirits. According to historian Joseph Ellis, this was the \\"first and only time a sitting American president led troops in the field\\", though James Madison briefly took control of artillery units in defense of Washington D.C. during the War of 1812.[24] Abraham Lincoln was deeply involved in overall strategy and in day-to-day operations during the American Civil War, 1861ÿ1865; historians have given Lincoln high praise for his strategic sense and his ability to select and encourage commanders such as Ulysses S. Grant.[25]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe present-day operational command of the Armed Forces is delegated to the Department of Defense and is normally exercised through the Secretary of Defense. The Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff  and the Combatant Commands assist with the operation as outlined in the presidentially approved Unified Command Plan (UCP).[26][27][28] The framers of the Constitution took care to limit the president's powers regarding the military; Alexander Hamilton explained this in Federalist No. 69:\\r\\nThe President is to be commander-in-chief of the army and navy of the United States. ... It would amount to nothing more than the supreme command and direction of the military and naval forces ... while that [the power] of the British king extends to the DECLARING of war and to the RAISING and REGULATING of fleets and armies, all [of] which ... would appertain to the legislature.[29] [Emphasis in the original.]\\r\\n\\r\\n Pursuant to the War Powers Resolution, Congress must authorize any troop deployments longer than 60 days, although that process relies on triggering mechanisms that have never been employed, rendering it ineffectual.[30] Additionally, Congress provides a check to presidential military power through its control over military spending and regulation. Presidents have historically initiated the process for going to war,[31][32] but critics have charged that there have been several conflicts in which presidents did not get official declarations, including Theodore Roosevelt's military move into Panama in 1903,[31] the Korean War,[31] the Vietnam War,[31] and the invasions of Grenada in 1983[33] and Panama in 1989.[34]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe constitution also empowers the President to propose and chiefly negotiate agreements between the United States and other countries. Such agreements become, upon receiving the advice and consent of the U.S. Senate (by a two-thirds majority vote), become binding with the force of federal law.\\r\\n\\r\\nNixon v. General Services Administration, 433 U.S. 425 (1977) (Rehnquist, J., dissenting)\\r\\n\\r\\nThe president is the head of the executive branch of the federal government and is constitutionally obligated to \\"take care that the laws be faithfully executed\\".[35] The executive branch has over four million employees, including members of the military.[36]\\r\\n\\r\\nPresidents make numerous executive branch appointments: an incoming president may make up to 6,000 before taking office and 8,000 more while serving. Ambassadors, members of the Cabinet, and other federal officers, are all appointed by a president with the \\"advice and consent\\" of a majority of the Senate. When the Senate is in recess for at least ten days, the president may make recess appointments.[37] Recess appointments are temporary and expire at the end of the next session of the Senate.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe power of a president to fire executive officials has long been a contentious political issue. Generally, a president may remove executive officials purely at will.[38] However, Congress can curtail and constrain a president's authority to fire commissioners of independent regulatory agencies and certain inferior executive officers by statute.[39]\\r\\n\\r\\nTo manage the growing federal bureaucracy, presidents have gradually surrounded themselves with many layers of staff, who were eventually organized into the Executive Office of the President of the United States. Within the Executive Office, the president's innermost layer of aides (and their assistants) are located in the White House Office.\\r\\n\\r\\nAdditionally, the president possesses the power to manage operations of the federal government through issuing various types of directives, such as presidential proclamation and executive orders. When the president is lawfully exercising one of his constitutionally conferred responsibilities, the scope of this power is broad.[40] Even so, these directives are subject to judicial review by U.S. federal courts, which can find them to be unconstitutional. Moreover, Congress can overturn an executive order though legislation (e.g., Congressional Review Act).\\r\\n\\r\\nThe president also has the power to nominate federal judges, including members of the United States courts of appeals and the Supreme Court of the United States. However, these nominations require Senate confirmation. Securing Senate approval can provide a major obstacle for presidents who wish to orient the federal judiciary toward a particular ideological stance. When nominating judges to U.S. district courts, presidents often respect the long-standing tradition of senatorial courtesy. Presidents may also grant pardons and reprieves. Gerald Ford pardoned Richard Nixon a month after taking office. Bill Clinton pardoned Patty Hearst on his last day in office, as is often done just before the end of a second presidential term, but not without controversy.[41][42][43]\\r\\n\\r\\nHistorically, two doctrines concerning executive power have developed that enable the president to exercise executive power with a degree of autonomy. The first is executive privilege, which allows the president to withhold from disclosure any communications made directly to the president in the performance of executive duties. George Washington first claimed the privilege when Congress requested to see Chief Justice John Jay's notes from an unpopular treaty negotiation with Great Britain. While not enshrined in the Constitution, or any other law, Washington's action created the precedent for the privilege. When Nixon tried to use executive privilege as a reason for not turning over subpoenaed evidence to Congress during the Watergate scandal, the Supreme Court ruled in United States v. Nixon, 418 U.S. 683 (1974), that executive privilege did not apply in cases where a president was attempting to avoid criminal prosecution. When President Clinton attempted to use executive privilege regarding the Lewinsky scandal, the Supreme Court ruled in Clinton v. Jones, 520 U.S. 681 (1997), that the privilege also could not be used in civil suits. These cases established the legal precedent that executive privilege is valid, although the exact extent of the privilege has yet to be clearly defined. Additionally, federal courts have allowed this privilege to radiate outward and protect other executive branch employees, but have weakened that protection for those executive branch communications that do not involve the president.[44]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe state secrets privilege allows the president and the executive branch to withhold information or documents from discovery in legal proceedings if such release would harm national security. Precedent for the privilege arose early in the 19th century when Thomas Jefferson refused to release military documents in the treason trial of Aaron Burr and again in Totten v. United States 92 U.S. 105 (1876), when the Supreme Court dismissed a case brought by a former Union spy.[45] However, the privilege was not formally recognized by the U.S. Supreme Court until United States v. Reynolds 345 U.S. 1 (1953), where it was held to be a common law evidentiary privilege.[46] Before the September 11 attacks, use of the privilege had been rare, but increasing in frequency.[47] Since 2001, the government has asserted the privilege in more cases and at earlier stages of the litigation, thus in some instances causing dismissal of the suits before reaching the merits of the claims, as in the Ninth Circuit's ruling in Mohamed v. Jeppesen Dataplan, Inc.[46][48][49] Critics of the privilege claim its use has become a tool for the government to cover up illegal or embarrassing government actions.[50][51]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Constitution's Ineligibility Clause prevents the president (and all other executive officers) from simultaneously being a member of Congress. Therefore, the president cannot directly introduce legislative proposals for consideration in Congress. However, the president can take an indirect role in shaping legislation, especially if the president's political party has a majority in one or both houses of Congress. For example, the president or other officials of the executive branch may draft legislation and then ask senators or representatives to introduce these drafts into Congress. The president can further influence the legislative branch through constitutionally or statutorily mandated, periodic reports to Congress. These reports may be either written or oral, but today the greatest in importance are given as the oral State of the Union addresses, which often outline the president's legislative proposals for the coming year. Additionally, the president may attempt to have Congress alter proposed legislation by threatening to veto that legislation unless requested changes are made.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the 20th century, critics charged that too many legislative and budgetary powers that should have belonged to Congress had slid into the hands of presidents. As the head of the executive branch, presidents control a vast array of agencies that can issue regulations with little oversight from Congress. One critic charged that presidents could appoint a \\"virtual army of 'czars' ÿ each wholly unaccountable to Congress yet tasked with spearheading major policy efforts for the White House\\".[52] Presidents have been criticized for making signing statements when signing congressional legislation about how they understand a bill or plan to execute it.[53] This practice has been criticized by the American Bar Association as unconstitutional.[54] Conservative commentator George Will wrote of an \\"increasingly swollen executive branch\\" and \\"the eclipse of Congress\\".[55]\\r\\n\\r\\nAccording to Article II, Section 3 of the Constitution, the president may convene either or both houses of Congress. If both houses cannot agree on a date of adjournment, the president may appoint a date for Congress to adjourn. For example, Franklin Delano Roosevelt convened a special session of Congress immediately after the December 7, 1941, Japanese sneak attack on Pearl Harbor and asked for a declaration of war.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs head of state, the president can fulfill traditions established by previous presidents. William Howard Taft started the tradition of throwing out the ceremonial first pitch in 1910 at Griffith Stadium, Washington, D.C., on the Washington Senators' Opening Day. Every president since Taft, except for Jimmy Carter, threw out at least one ceremonial first ball or pitch for Opening Day, the All-Star Game, or the World Series, usually with much fanfare.[56]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe President of the United States has served as the honorary president of the Boy Scouts of America since the founding of the organization.[57]\\r\\n\\r\\nOther presidential traditions are associated with American holidays. Rutherford B. Hayes began in 1878 the first White House egg rolling for local children.[58] Beginning in 1947, during the Harry S. Truman administration, every Thanksgiving the president is presented with a live domestic turkey during the annual National Thanksgiving Turkey Presentation held at the White House. Since 1989, when the custom of \\"pardoning\\" the turkey was formalized by George H. W. Bush, the turkey has been taken to a farm where it will live out the rest of its natural life.[59]\\r\\n\\r\\nPresidential traditions also involve the president's role as head of government. Many outgoing presidents since James Buchanan traditionally give advice to their successor during the presidential transition.[60] Ronald Reagan and his successors have also left a private message on the desk of the Oval Office on Inauguration Day for the incoming president.[61]\\r\\n\\r\\nDuring a state visit by a foreign head of state, the president typically hosts a State Arrival Ceremony held on the South Lawn, a custom begun by John F. Kennedy in 1961.[62] This is followed by a state dinner given by the president which is held in the State Dining Room later in the evening.[63]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe modern presidency holds the president as one of the nation's premier celebrities. Some argue that images of the presidency have a tendency to be manipulated by administration public relations officials as well as by presidents themselves. One critic described the presidency as \\"propagandized leadership\\" which has a \\"mesmerizing power surrounding the office\\".[64] Administration public relations managers staged carefully crafted photo-ops of smiling presidents with smiling crowds for television cameras.[65] One critic wrote the image of John F. Kennedy was described as carefully framed \\"in rich detail\\" which \\"drew on the power of myth\\" regarding the incident of PT 109[66] and wrote that Kennedy understood how to use images to further his presidential ambitions.[67] As a result, some political commentators have opined that American voters have unrealistic expectations of presidents: voters expect a president to \\"drive the economy, vanquish enemies, lead the free world, comfort tornado victims, heal the national soul and protect borrowers from hidden credit-card fees\\".[68]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe nation's Founding Fathers expected the Congresswhich was the first branch of government described in the Constitutionto be the dominant branch of government; they did not expect a strong executive department.[69] However, presidential power has shifted over time, which has resulted in claims that the modern presidency has become too powerful,[70][71] unchecked, unbalanced,[72] and \\"monarchist\\" in nature.[73] Professor Dana D. Nelson believes presidents over the past thirty years have worked towards \\"undivided presidential control of the executive branch and its agencies\\".[74] She criticizes proponents of the unitary executive for expanding \\"the many existing uncheckable executive powers ÿ such as executive orders, decrees, memorandums, proclamations, national security directives and legislative signing statements ÿ that already allow presidents to enact a good deal of foreign and domestic policy without aid, interference or consent from Congress\\".[74] Bill Wilson, board member of Americans for Limited Government, opined that the expanded presidency was \\"the greatest threat ever to individual freedom and democratic rule\\".[75]\\r\\n\\r\\nArticle II, Section 1, Clause 5 of the Constitution sets three qualifications for holding the presidency. To serve as president, one must:\\r\\n\\r\\nA person who meets the above qualifications would, however, still be disqualified from holding the office of president under any of the following conditions:\\r\\n\\r\\nThe modern presidential campaign begins before the primary elections, which the two major political parties use to clear the field of candidates before their national nominating conventions, where the most successful candidate is made the party's nominee for president. Typically, the party's presidential candidate chooses a vice presidential nominee, and this choice is rubber-stamped by the convention. The most common previous profession of U.S. presidents is lawyer.[81]\\r\\n\\r\\nNominees participate in nationally televised debates, and while the debates are usually restricted to the Democratic and Republican nominees, third party candidates may be invited, such as Ross Perot in the 1992 debates. Nominees campaign across the country to explain their views, convince voters and solicit contributions. Much of the modern electoral process is concerned with winning swing states through frequent visits and mass media advertising drives.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe president is elected indirectly by the voters of each state and the District of Columbia through the Electoral College, a body of electors formed every four years for the sole purpose of electing the president and vice president to concurrent four-year terms. As prescribed by the Twelfth Amendment, each state is entitled to a number of electors equal to the size of its total delegation in both houses of Congress. Additionally, the Twenty-third Amendment provides that the District of Columbia is entitled to the number it would have if it were a state, but in no case more than that of the least populous state.[82] Currently, all states and D.C. select their electors based on a popular election held on Election Day.[83] In all but two states, the party whose presidential-vice presidential ticket receives a plurality of popular votes in the state has its entire slate of elector nominees chosen as the state's electors.[84] Maine and Nebraska deviate from this winner-take-all practice, awarding two electors to the statewide winner and one to the winner in each congressional district.[85][86]\\r\\n\\r\\nOn the first Monday after the second Wednesday in December, about six weeks after the election, the electors convene in their respective state capitals (and in Washington D.C.) to vote for president and, on a separate ballot, for vice president. They typically vote for the candidates of the party that nominated them. While there is no constitutional mandate or federal law requiring them to do so, the District of Columbia and 30 states have laws requiring that their electors vote for the candidates to whom they are pledged.[83][87] Following the vote, each state then sends a certified record of their electoral votes to Congress. The votes of the electors are opened and counted during a joint session of Congress, held in the first week of January. If a candidate has received an absolute majority of electoral votes for president (currently 270 of 538), that person is declared the winner. Otherwise, the House of Representatives must meet to elect a president using a contingent election procedure in which representatives, voting by state delegation, with each state casting a single vote, choose between the top electoral vote-getters for president. For a candidate to win, he or she must receive the votes of an absolute majority of states (currently 26 of 50).[83]\\r\\n\\r\\nThere have been two contingent presidential elections in the nation's history. A 73ÿ73 electoral vote tie between Thomas Jefferson and fellow Democratic-Republican Aaron Burr in the election of 1800 necessitated the first. Conducted under the original procedure established by Article II, Section 1, Clause 3 of the Constitution, which stipulates that if two or three persons received a majority vote and an equal vote, the House of Representatives would choose one of them for president; the runner up would become Vice President.[88] On February 17, 1801, Jefferson was elected president on the 36th ballot, and Burr became vice president. Afterward, the system was overhauled through the Twelfth Amendment in time to be used in the 1804 election.[89] A quarter-century later, the choice for president again devolved to the House when no candidate won an absolute majority of electoral votes (131 of 261) in the election of 1824. Under the Twelfth Amendment, the House was required to choose a president from among the top three electoral vote recipients: Andrew Jackson, John Quincy Adams, and William H. Crawford. Held February 9, 1825, this second and most recent contingent election resulted in John Quincy Adams being elected president on the first ballot.[90]\\r\\n\\r\\nPursuant to the Twentieth Amendment, the four-year term of office for both the president and vice president begins at noon on January 20.[91] The first presidential and vice presidential terms to begin on this date, known as Inauguration Day, were the second terms of President Franklin D. Roosevelt and Vice President John Nance Garner in 1937.[92] Previously, Inauguration Day was on March 4. As a result of the date change, the first term (1933ÿ37) of both men had been shortened by 43 days.[93]\\r\\n\\r\\nBefore executing the powers of the office, a president is required to recite the presidential oath of office, found in Article II, Section 1, Clause 8. This is the only component in the inauguration ceremony mandated by the Constitution:\\r\\n\\r\\nI do solemnly swear (or affirm) that I will faithfully execute the Office of President of the United States, and will to the best of my Ability, preserve, protect, and defend the Constitution of the United States.[94]\\r\\n\\r\\nPresidents have traditionally placed one hand upon a Bible while taking the oath, and have added \\"So help me God\\" to the end of the oath.[95][96] Although the oath may be administered by any person authorized by law to administer oaths, presidents are traditionally sworn in by the Chief Justice of the United States.[94]\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen the first president, George Washington, announced in his Farewell Address that he was not running for a third term, he established a \\"two-terms then out\\" precedent. Precedent became tradition after Thomas Jefferson publicly embraced the principle a decade later during his second term, as did his two immediate successors, James Madison and James Monroe.[97] In spite of the strong two-term tradition, Ulysses S. Grant sought a non-consecutive third term in 1880,[98] as did Theodore Roosevelt in 1912 (though it would have been only his second full term).[99] Both were unsuccessful.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1940, after leading the nation through the Great Depression, Franklin Roosevelt was elected to a third term, breaking the self-imposed precedent. Four years later, with the U.S. engaged in World War II, he was re-elected again despite his declining physical health; he died 82 days into his fourth term on April 12, 1945.[100]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn response to the unprecedented length of Roosevelt's presidency, the Twenty-second Amendment was adopted in 1951. The amendment bars anyone from being elected president more than twice, or once if that person served more than two years (24 months) of another president's four-year term. Harry S. Truman, president when this term limit came into force, was exempted from its limitations, and briefly sought a second full termto which he would have otherwise been ineligible for election, as he had been president for more than two years of Roosevelt's fourth termbefore he withdrew from the 1952 election.[100]\\r\\n\\r\\nSince the amendment's adoption, five presidents have served two full terms: Dwight D. Eisenhower, Ronald Reagan, Bill Clinton, George W. Bush, and Barack Obama. Both Jimmy Carter and George H. W. Bush sought a second term, but were defeated. Richard Nixon was elected to a second term, but resigned before completing it. Lyndon B. Johnson, having held the presidency for one full term in addition to only 14 months of John F. Kennedy's unexpired term, was eligible for a second full term in 1968, but withdrew from Democratic Primary. Additionally, Gerald Ford, who served out the last two years and five months of Nixon's second term, sought a full term, but was defeated by Jimmy Carter in the 1976 election.\\r\\n\\r\\nArticle II, Section 4 of the Constitution allows for the removal of high federal officials, including the president, from office for \\"treason, bribery, or other high crimes and misdemeanors.\\" Article I, Section 2, Clause 5 authorizes the House of Representatives to serve as a \\"grand jury\\" with the power to impeach said officials by a majority vote.[101] Article I, Section 3, Clause 6 authorizes the Senate to serve as a court with the power to remove impeached officials from office, by a two-thirds vote to convict.[102]\\r\\n\\r\\nTwo presidents have been impeached by the House of Representatives: Andrew Johnson in 1868, and Bill Clinton in 1998. Both were acquitted by the senate: Johnson by one vote, and Clinton by 17 votes. Additionally, the House Judiciary Committee commenced impeachment proceedings against Richard Nixon in 1974; however, he resigned from office before the full House voted on the articles of impeachment.[101]\\r\\n\\r\\nSuccession to or vacancies in the office of president may arise under several possible circumstances: death, resignation, and removal from office. Deaths have occurred a number of times, resignation has occurred only once, and removal from office has never occurred.\\r\\n\\r\\nUnder Section 3 of the Twenty-fifth Amendment, the president may transfer the presidential powers and duties to the vice president, who then becomes acting president, by transmitting a statement to the Speaker of the House and the President pro tempore of the Senate stating the reasons for the transfer. The president resumes the discharge of the presidential powers and duties upon transmitting, to those two officials, a written declaration stating that resumption. Such a transfer of power has occurred on three occasions: Ronald Reagan to George H. W. Bush once, on July 13, 1985, and George W. Bush to Dick Cheney twice, on June 29, 2002, and on July 21, 2007.[103]\\r\\n\\r\\nUnder Section 4 of the Twenty-fifth Amendment, the vice president, in conjunction with a majority of the Cabinet, may transfer the presidential powers and duties from the president to the vice president by transmitting a written declaration to the Speaker of the House and the president pro tempore of the Senate that the president is incapacitatedunable to discharge their presidential powers and duties. If this occurs, then the vice president will assume the presidential powers and duties as acting president; however, the president can declare that no such inability exists and resume the discharge of the presidential powers and duties. If the vice president and Cabinet contest this claim, it is up to Congress, which must meet within two days if not already in session, to decide the merit of the claim.\\r\\n\\r\\nSection 1 of the Twenty-fifth Amendment states that the vice president becomes president upon the removal from office, death, or resignation of the preceding president. Article II, Section 1, Clause 6 authorizes Congress to declare who shall become acting president in the \\"Case of Removal, Death, Resignation or Inability, both of the President and Vice President.\\"[104] The Presidential Succession Act of 1947, (codified as 3 U.S.C.??19) provides that if both the president and vice president have left office or are both otherwise unavailable to serve during their terms of office, the presidential line of succession follows the order of: Speaker of the House, then, if necessary, the President pro tempore of the Senate, and then if necessary, the eligible heads of federal executive departments who form the president's Cabinet. The Cabinet currently has 15 members, of which the Secretary of State is first in line; the other Cabinet secretaries follow in the order in which their department (or the department of which their department is the successor) was created. Those department heads who are constitutionally ineligible to be elected to the presidency are also disqualified from assuming the powers and duties of the presidency through succession. No statutory successor has yet been called upon to act as president.[105]\\r\\n\\r\\nThroughout most of its history, politics of the United States have been dominated by political parties. Political parties had not been anticipated when the U.S. Constitution was drafted in 1787, nor did they exist at the time of the first presidential election in 1788ÿ1789. Organized political parties developed in the U.S. in the midÿ1790s, but political factions, from which organized parties evolved, began to appear almost immediately after the Federal government came into existence. Those who supported the Washington administration were referred to as \\"pro-administration\\" and would eventually form the Federalist Party, while those in opposition joined the emerging Democratic-Republican Party.[106]\\r\\n\\r\\nGreatly concerned about the very real capacity of political parties to destroy the fragile unity holding the nation together, Washington remained unaffiliated with any political faction or party throughout his eight-year presidency. He was, and remains, the only U.S. president never to be affiliated with a political party.[107] Since George Washington, 43 persons have been sworn into the office of president, and each has been affiliated with a political party at the time of assuming office. The number of presidents per political party (at the time of entry into office) are:[108][109]\\r\\n\\r\\nSince 2001, the president's annual salary has been $400,000 annual salary, along with a: $50,000 expense allowance; $100,000 nontaxable travel account, and $19,000 entertainment account. The president's salary is set by Congress, and under Article II, Section 1, Clause 7 of the Constitution, may not be increased or reduced during his or her current term of office.[112][113]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe White House in Washington, D.C. serves as the official residence of the president. The site was selected by George Washington, and the cornerstone was laid in 1792. Every president since John Adams (in 1800) has lived there. At various times in U.S. history, it has been known as the \\"President's Palace,\\" the \\"Presidents House,\\" and the \\"Executive Mansion.\\" Theodore Roosevelt officially gave the White House its current name in 1901.[114] Facilities that are available to the president include access to the White House staff, medical care, recreation, housekeeping, and security services. The federal government pays for state dinners and other official functions, but the president pays for personal, family, and guest dry cleaning and food.[115]\\r\\n\\r\\nCamp David, officially titled Naval Support Facility Thurmont, a mountain-based military camp in Frederick County, Maryland, is the president's country residence. A place of solitude and tranquility, the site has been used extensively to host foreign dignitaries since the 1940s.[116]\\r\\n\\r\\nBlair House, located next to the Eisenhower Executive Office Building at the White House Complex and Lafayette Park, serves as the president's official guest house and as a secondary residence for the president if needed. Four interconnected, 19th century housesBlair House, Lee House, and 700 and 704 Jackson Placewith a combined floor space exceeding 70,000 square feet (6,500?m2) comprise the property.[117]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe primary means of long distance air travel for the president is one of two identical Boeing VC-25 aircraft, which are extensively modified Boeing 747 airliners and are referred to as Air Force One while the president is on board (although any U.S. Air Force aircraft the president is aboard is designated as \\"Air Force One\\" for the duration of the flight). In-country trips are typically handled with just one of the two planes, while overseas trips are handled with both, one primary and one backup. The president also has access to smaller Air Force aircraft, most notably the Boeing C-32, which are used when the president must travel to airports that cannot support a jumbo jet. Any civilian aircraft the president is aboard is designated Executive One for the flight.[118][119]\\r\\n\\r\\nFor short distance air travel, the president has access to a fleet of U.S. Marine Corps helicopters of varying models, designated Marine One when the president is aboard any particular one in the fleet. Flights are typically handled with as many as five helicopters all flying together and frequently swapping positions as to disguise which helicopter the president is actually aboard to any would-be threats.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor ground travel, the president uses the presidential state car, which is an armored limousine designed to look like a Cadillac sedan, but built on a truck chassis.[120][121] The US Secret Service operates and maintains the fleet of several limousines. The president also has access to two armored motorcoaches, which are primarily used for touring trips.[122]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe presidential limousine\\r\\n\\r\\nThe presidential plane, called Air Force One when the president is inside.\\r\\n\\r\\nMarine One helicopter, when the president is aboard\\r\\n\\r\\nThe U.S. Secret Service is charged with protecting the president and the first family. As part of their protection, presidents, first ladies, their children and other immediate family members, and other prominent persons and locations are assigned Secret Service codenames.[123] The use of such names was originally for security purposes and dates to a time when sensitive electronic communications were not routinely encrypted; today, the names simply serve for purposes of brevity, clarity, and tradition.[124]\\r\\n\\r\\nUnder the Former Presidents Act, all living former presidents are granted a pension, an office, and a staff. The pension has increased numerous times with Congressional approval. Retired presidents now receive a pension based on the salary of the current administration's cabinet secretaries, which was $199,700 each year in 2012.[125] Former presidents who served in Congress may also collect congressional pensions.[126] The act also provides former presidents with travel funds and franking privileges. Prior to 1997, all former presidents, their spouses, and their children until age 16 were protected by the Secret Service until the president's death.[127][128] In 1997, Congress passed legislation limiting secret service protection to no more than 10 years from the date a president leaves office.[129] On January 10, 2013, President Obama signed legislation reinstating lifetime secret service protection for him, George W. Bush, and all subsequent presidents.[130] A spouse who remarries is no longer eligible for secret service protection.[129]\\r\\n\\r\\nSome presidents have had significant careers after leaving office. Prominent examples include William Howard Taft's tenure as Chief Justice of the United States and Herbert Hoover's work on government reorganization after World War II. Grover Cleveland, whose bid for reelection failed in 1888, was elected president again four years later in 1892. Two former presidents served in Congress after leaving the White House: John Quincy Adams was elected to the House of Representatives, serving there for seventeen years, and Andrew Johnson returned to the Senate in 1875. John Tyler served in the provisional Congress of the Confederate States during the Civil War and was elected to the Confederate House of Representatives, but died before that body first met.\\r\\n\\r\\nPresidents may use their predecessors as emissaries to deliver private messages to other nations or as official representatives of the United States to state funerals and other important foreign events.[131][132] Richard Nixon made multiple foreign trips to countries including China and Russia and was lauded as an elder statesman.[133] Jimmy Carter has become a global human rights campaigner, international arbiter, and election monitor, as well as a recipient of the Nobel Peace Prize. Bill Clinton has also worked as an informal ambassador, most recently in the negotiations that led to the release of two American journalists, Laura Ling and Euna Lee, from North Korea. Clinton has also been active politically since his presidential term ended, working with his wife Hillary on her 2008 and 2016 presidential bids and President Obama on his 2012 reelection campaign.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere are currently (since January 20, 2017) five living former presidents. In order of office they are:\\r\\n\\r\\nJimmy Carter (age 94)since 1981\\r\\n\\r\\nGeorge H. W. Bush (age 94)since 1993\\r\\n\\r\\nBill Clinton (age 72)since 2001\\r\\n\\r\\nGeorge W. Bush (age 72)since 2009\\r\\n\\r\\nBarack Obama (age 57)since 2017\\r\\n\\r\\nEvery president since Herbert Hoover has created a repository known as a presidential library for preserving and making available his papers, records, and other documents and materials. Completed libraries are deeded to and maintained by the National Archives and Records Administration (NARA); the initial funding for building and equipping each library must come from private, non-federal sources.[134] There are currently thirteen presidential libraries in the NARA system. There are also presidential libraries maintained by state governments and private foundations and Universities of Higher Education, such as the Abraham Lincoln Presidential Library and Museum, which is run by the State of Illinois, the George W. Bush Presidential library and Museum, which is run by Southern Methodist University, the George H. W. Bush Presidential Library and Museum, which is run by Texas A&M University, and the Lyndon Baines Johnson Presidential Library and Museum, which is run by the University of Texas at Austin.\\r\\n\\r\\nA number of presidents have lived for many years after leaving office, and several of them have personally overseen the building and opening of their own presidential libraries. Some have even made arrangements for their own burial at the site. Several presidential libraries contain the graves of the president they document, including the Dwight D. Eisenhower Presidential Library, Museum and Boyhood Home in Abilene, Kansas, Richard Nixon Presidential Library and Museum in Yorba Linda, California, and the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library in Simi Valley, California. These gravesites are open to the general public.","input":"Who is the president of u s a?"},{"output":"a political party formed in India in January 1923 after the Gaya annual conference in December 1922 of the National Congress, that sought greater self-government and political freedom for the Indian people from the British Raj","context":"The Swaraj Party, Swarajaya Party or Swarajya Party or Swarajist Party, established as the Congress-Khilafat Swarajaya Party, was a political party formed in India in January 1923 after the Gaya annual conference in December 1922 of the National Congress, that sought greater self-government and political freedom for the Indian people from the British Raj. It was inspired by the concept of Swaraj. In Hindi and many other languages of India, swaraj means \\"independence\\" or \\"self-rule.\\" The two most important leaders were Chittaranjan Das, who was its president and Motilal Nehru, who was its secretary.\\r\\nDas and Nehru thought of contesting elections to enter the legislative council with a view to obstructing a foreign government. Many candidates of the Swaraj Party got elected to the central legislative assembly and provincial legislative council in the 1923 elections. In these legislatures ,they strongly opposed the unjust government policies.[1]\\r\\nThe establishment of fully responsible government for India, the convening of a round table conference to resolve the problems of Indians, and the releasing of certain political prisoners, were the resolutions in the central legislative council.[2][page?needed]\\r\\nAs a result of the Bengal Pact, the Swaraj Party won the most seats during elections to the Bengal Legislative Council in 1923. The party disintegrated after the death of C. R. Das.[3]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Swaraj Party was formed on 9 January 1923 by Indian politicians and members of the Indian National Congress who had opposed Mahatma 's suspension of all civil resistance on 5 February 1922 in response to the Chauri Chaura tragedy, where policemen were killed by a mob of protestors. Gandhi felt responsible for the killings, reproached himself for not emphasizing non-violence more firmly, and feared that the entire Non-Cooperation Movement could degenerate into an orgy of violence between the British-controlled army and police and mobs of freedom-fighters, alienating and hurting millions of common Indians. He went on a fast-unto-death to convince all Indians to stop civil resistance. The Congress and other nationalist groups disavowed all activities of disobedience.\\r\\nBut many Indians felt that the Non-Cooperation Movement should not have been suspended over an isolated incident of violence, and that its astonishing success was actually close to breaking the back of British rule in India. These people became disillusioned with Gandhi's political judgments and instincts.\\r\\nGandhi and most of the Congress party rejected the provincial and central legislative councils created by the British to offer some participation for Indians. They argued that the councils were rigged with un-elected allies of the British, and too un-democratic and simply \\"rubber stamps\\" of the Viceroy.\\r\\nIn December 1922, Chittaranjan Das, Narasimha Chintaman Kelkar and Motilal Nehru formed the Congress-Khilafat Swarajaya Party with Das as the president and Nehru as one of the secretaries. Other prominent leaders included Huseyn Shaheed Suhrawardy and Subhas Chandra Bose of Bengal, Vithalbhai Patel and other Congress leaders who were becoming dissatisfied with the Congress. The other group was the 'No-Changers', who had accepted Gandhi's decision to withdraw the movement.\\r\\nNow both the Swarajists and the No-Changers were engaged in a fierce political struggle, but both were determined to avoid the disastrous experience of the 1907 split at Surat. On the advice of Gandhi, the two groups decided to remain in the Congress but to work in their separate ways. There was no basic difference between the two.\\r\\nSwarajist members were elected to the councils. Vithalbhai Patel became the president of the Central Legislative Assembly. However, the legislatures had very limited powers, and apart from some heated parliamentary debates, and procedural stand-offs with the British authorities, the core mission of obstructing British rule failed.\\r\\nWith the death of Chittaranjan Das in 1925, and with Motilal Nehru's return to the Congress the following year, the Swaraj party was greatly weakened.\\r\\nAfter his release from prison in 1924, Gandhi sought to bring back the Swarajists to the Congress and re-unite the party. Gandhi's supporters were in a vast majority in the Congress, and the Congress still remained India's largest political party, but Gandhi felt it necessary to heal the divide with the Swarajists, so as to heal the nation's wounds over the 1922 suspension.\\r\\nThe Swarajists sought more representation in the Congress offices, and an end to the mandatory requirement for Congressmen to spin khadi cloth and do social service as a prerequisite for office. This was opposed by Gandhi's supporters, men like Vallabhbhai Patel, Jawaharlal Nehru and Rajendra Prasad, who became known as the No Changers as opposed to the Swarajist Changers. Gandhi relaxed the rules on spinning and named some Swarajists to important positions in the Congress Party. He also encouraged the Congress to support those Swarajists elected to the councils, so as not to embarrass them and leave them rudderless before the British authorities.\\r\\nWhen the Simon Commission arrived in India in 1928, millions of Indians were infuriated with the idea of an all-British committee writing proposals for Indian constitutional reforms without any Indian member or consultations with the Indian people. The Congress created a committee to write Indian proposals for constitutional reforms, headed by now Congress President Motilal Nehru. The death of Lala Lajpat Rai, beaten by police in Punjab further infuriated India. People rallied around the Nehru Report and old political divisions and wounds were forgotten, and Vithalbhai Patel and all Swarajist councillors resigned in protest.\\r\\nBetween 1929 and 1937, the Indian National Congress would declare the independence of India and launch the Salt Satyagraha. In this tumultuous period, the Swaraj Party was defunct as its members quietly dissolved into the Congress fold.\\r\\nThe Madras Province Swarajya Party was established in 1923. S. Satyamurti and S. Srinivasa Iyengar led the party. The party contested in all provincial elections between 1923 and 1934 with the exception of the 1930 election which it did not participate officially due to the Civil Disobedience Movement, though some of the members of the party contested for office as independents. The party emerged as the single largest party in the 1926 and 1934 Assembly elections but refused to form the provincial government under the existing dyarchy system. In 1934, the Madras Province Swarajya Party merged with the All India Swarajya Party which subsequently merged with the Indian National Congress when it contested the 1935 elections to the Imperial Legislative Council under the Government of India Act 1935.\\r\\nFrom 1935 onward, the Swarajya Party ceased to exist and was succeeded by the Indian National Congress in the elections to the Imperial Legislative Council as well as the Madras Legislative Council.","input":"Who were the swarajists what was their purpose?"},{"output":"Jack Paar","context":"The Tonight Show is an American late-night talk show currently broadcast from the NBC studios in Rockefeller Center in New York City (and previously from various studios in the Los Angeles region) and airing on NBC since 1954. It is the world's longest-running talk show, and the longest running, regularly scheduled entertainment program in the United States. It is the third-longest-running show on NBC, after the news-and-talk shows Today and Meet the Press.\\r\\nOver the course of more than 60 years, The Tonight Show has undergone only minor title changes. It aired under the name Tonight for several of its early years, eventually settling on The Tonight Show after the seating of long-time host Johnny Carson in 1962. In later decades, network programmers, advertisers, and the show's announcers would refer to the show by including the name of the host; for example, it is currently announced as The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon. In 1957, the show briefly tried a more news-style format. It has otherwise remained a talk show throughout its run.\\r\\nThe Tonight Show began broadcasting in 1954. It has had seven official hosts, beginning with Steve Allen (1954ÿ57), followed by Jack Paar (1957ÿ62), Johnny Carson (1962ÿ92), Jay Leno (1992ÿ2009, 2010ÿ14), Conan O'Brien (2009ÿ10), and Jimmy Fallon (2014ÿpresent). It has had several recurring guest hosts, a practice especially common during the Paar and Carson eras.\\r\\nCarson is the longest-serving host to date. The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson aired for 30 seasons between October 1962 and May 1992. Leno, however, has the record of having hosted the greatest number of total televised episodes. Leno's record accounts for the fact that unlike Carson (who only produced new shows three days a week starting in the 1980s), Leno never used guest hosts (except Katie Couric, once) and produced new shows five days a week; Leno himself was also Carson's primary guest host for the last five years of Carson's tenure, giving him even more episodes to his credit. During Johnny Carson's first eighteen years, the show ran for ninety minutes. During Johnny's 1980 contract negotiations, the show was shortened to sixty minutes. NBC also broadcast The Best of Carson which were repeats of some of Johnny's popular older shows. Prior to the debut of Saturday Night Live in October 1975, NBC aired The Best of Carson on Saturday nights at 11:30 pm.\\r\\nOutside of its brief run as a news show in 1957, Conan O'Brien is the shortest-serving host. O'Brien hosted 146 episodes over the course of less than eight months. Current host Fallon took the helm on February 17, 2014. Fallon had previously hosted Late Night, and before Late Night he was a popular member of the cast of Saturday Night Live.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nFrom 1950 to 1951 NBC aired Broadway Open House, a nightly variety show hosted primarily by comic Jerry Lester. Broadway... demonstrated the audience potential for late-night network programming. The format of The Tonight Show can be traced to a nightly 40-minute local program in New York, hosted by Allen and originally titled The Knickerbocker Beer Show (after the sponsor). It was quickly retitled The Steve Allen Show. This premiered in 1953 on WNBT-TV, (now broadcasting as WNBC-TV), the local station affiliate in New York City. Beginning in September 1954, it was renamed Tonight! and began its historic run on the full NBC network.\\r\\nNotes for hosting history\\r\\nThe first Tonight announcer was Gene Rayburn. Allen's version of the show originated talk show staples such as an opening monologue, celebrity interviews, audience participation, and comedy bits in which cameras were taken outside the studio, as well as music including guest performers and a house band under Lyle \\"Skitch\\" Henderson.\\r\\nWhen the show became a success, Allen got a primetime Sunday comedy/variety show in June 1956, leading him to share Tonight hosting duties with Ernie Kovacs during the 1956ÿ57 season. To give Allen time to work on his Sunday evening show, Kovacs hosted Tonight on Monday and Tuesday nights with his own announcer (Bill Wendell) and bandleader.\\r\\nDuring the later Steve Allen years, regular audience member Lillian Miller became such an integral part that she was forced to join American Federation of Television and Radio Artists, the television/radio performers union.\\r\\nAllen and Kovacs departed Tonight in January 1957 after NBC ordered Allen to concentrate all his efforts on his Sunday-night variety program, hoping to combat CBS's The Ed Sullivan Show's dominance of the Sunday night ratings.[citation needed]\\r\\nUnlike the first installment of Johnny Carson's tenure, which is lost except for audio recordings, a kinescope recording of most of the very first Tonight Show under Allen survives. In this recording, Allen states during his opening monologue that \\"this show is going to go on forever\\"; although in context (and as part of a series of jokes) Allen refers to the fact the program is scheduled to run late into the night, his statement has come to refer to the longevity of the franchise.\\r\\nRather than continuing with the same format after Allen and Kovacs' departure from Tonight, NBC changed the show's format to a news and features show, similar to that of the network's popular morning program Today. The new show, renamed Tonight! America After Dark, was hosted first by Jack Lescoulie (also an announcer and long-time cast member on the Today morning program, 1952ÿ1967) and then by Al (\\"Jazzbo\\") Collins, with interviews conducted by Hy Gardner, and music provided by the Lou Stein Trio (later replaced by the Mort Lindsey Quartet, then the Johnny Guarnieri Quartet). This new version of the show was unpopular, resulting in a significant number of NBC affiliates dropping the show.[2]\\r\\nIn July 1957, NBC returned the program to a talk/variety show format once again, with Jack Paar (who left his role as morning show host on CBS to join NBC) becoming the new solo host of the show. Under Paar, most of the NBC affiliates that had dropped the show during the ill-fated run of Tonight! America After Dark began airing the show once again. Paar's era began the practice of branding the series after the host, and as such the program, though officially still called Tonight, was also marketed as The Jack Paar Show. A combo band conducted by Paar's Army buddy pianist Jose Melis filled commercial breaks and backed musical entertainers. [See music and announcers below.] Paar also introduced the idea of having guest hosts; one of these early hosts coincidentally was Johnny Carson. It was also one of the first regularly scheduled network shows to be telecast in color beginning sporadically in September 1957, with regular color broadcasts beginning in September 1960.\\r\\nCensored joke dropped from February 11, 1960 show\\r\\nOn February 11, 1960, Jack Paar walked off his show, most unexpectedly in the midst of the program?ÿ an absence that lasted almost a month?ÿ after NBC censors edited out a segment taped the night before about a joke involving a \\"WC\\" (\\"water closet\\", a polite term for a flush toilet) being confused for a \\"wayside chapel\\". As he left his desk, he said, \\"I am leaving The Tonight Show. There must be a better way of making a living than this\\". Paar's abrupt departure left his startled announcer to finish the late-night broadcast himself.[3]\\r\\nPaar returned to the show on March 7, 1960, strolled on stage after the opening credits, struck a pose, and said, \\". . . . As I was saying before I was interrupted?. . . \\"[3] After the audience erupted in applause, Paar continued: \\"when I walked off, I said there must be a better way of making a living. Well, I've looked? ÿ ÿ - and there isn't!\\"\\r\\nCiting that he would prefer to do one prime-time show per week rather than five late-night installments, Paar left the show in March 1962. The guests on the last show were Jack E. Leonard, Alexander King, Robert Merrill and Buddy Hackett. Among those appearing in taped farewell messages were Richard Nixon, Robert Kennedy, Billy Graham, Bob Hope and Jack Benny. Hugh Downs was the announcer, and Jose Melis led the band.The Jack Paar Show was moved to the evening's prime time (as The Jack Paar Program) and aired weekly on Friday nights through the 1965 season.\\r\\nJohnny Carson, (1925ÿ2005), was chosen as Paar's successor. Carson was host at the time of the weekday afternoon quiz show Who Do You Trust? on the newest and then lowest-rated radio and television network, the American Broadcasting Company (ABC, which, as the \\"Blue Network,\\" had been separated from NBC in 1943 owing to government pressure). Because Carson was under contract through September to ABC and producer Don Fedderson (who held him to his contract until the day it expired), he could not take over as host until October 1, 1962. The months between Paar and Carson were filled by a series of guest hosts including Art Linkletter (4 weeks), Merv Griffin (4 weeks), Hugh Downs (2 weeks), Joey Bishop (2 weeks), Bob Cummings, Jack Carter, Jan Murray, Peter Lind Hayes, Soupy Sales, Mort Sahl, Steve Lawrence, Jerry Lewis, Jimmy Dean, Florence Henderson, Arlene Francis, Jack E. Leonard, Groucho Marx, Hal March and Donald O'Connor, some of whom later noted they were being led to believe they were auditioning for the job. Griffin was so well received as a guest host that NBC gave him his own daytime talk show, the first of three he would host in his broadcasting career, which debuted the same day Carson took over the late night show.\\r\\nThe show was broadcast under the title The Tonight Show during this interregnum, with Skitch Henderson returning as bandleader. Hugh Downs remained as announcer/sidekick until taking over hosting duties on the Today Show in September, at which point he was replaced by Ed Herlihy.\\r\\nGroucho Marx introduced Carson as the new host on October 1, 1962. Ed McMahon was Carson's announcer. The Tonight Show orchestra was, for Carson's first four years, still led by Skitch Henderson. After a brief stint by Milton DeLugg, beginning in 1967 the \\"NBC Orchestra\\" was then headed by trumpeter Doc Severinsen who played in the band during the Henderson era. [See \\"Music and Announcers\\" below.] For all but a few months of its first decade on the air, Carson's Tonight Show was based in New York City. In 1972, the show moved to Burbank, California into Studio One of NBC Studios West Coast (although it was announced as coming from nearby Hollywood) for the remainder of his tenure. Carson often utilized guest hosts in his absence (and on Monday nights in his last decade as host), notably Leno, Garry Shandling, and Joan Rivers, who all (at one time or another) served under the designation of \\"Permanent Guest Host\\".\\r\\nDuring this 30-year span Carson's Tonight Show transformed the late night talk show format from simple insomnia relief to a major cultural force, with the topics of Carson's monologues becoming the water cooler subject du jour the following day. Examples include when he played the game Twister with Eva Gabor in 1966, which sent the relatively unknown game's sales skyrocketing. In December 1973, when Carson joked about an alleged shortage of toilet paper, panic buying and hoarding ensued across the United States as consumers emptied stores, causing a real shortage that lasted for weeks. Stores and toilet paper manufacturers had to ration supplies until the panic ended.\\r\\nCarson's ratings always substantially led his time slot, in spite of the fact he faced a litany of other late night competitors including Les Crane, Bill Dana, David Frost, Regis Philbin, Alan Thicke, Jerry Lewis, Joan Rivers, David Brenner, Pat Sajak, Ron Reagan, Dennis Miller, and most notably Steve Allen, Arsenio Hall, Joey Bishop, Merv Griffin, and Dick Cavett.\\r\\nAs primetime variety shows such as The Ed Sullivan Show faded in prominence over the course of the 1970s, Carson's Tonight emerged as a showcase for all kinds of talent, as well as continuing the tradition of a vaudeville-style variety show.[4][5] Carson's show launched the career of a number of comedians including David Letterman, Jay Leno, Jerry Seinfeld, Joan Rivers, Jeff Foxworthy, Ellen DeGeneres, David Brenner, Tim Allen, Drew Carey, and Roseanne Barr.\\r\\nJohnny Carson retired after three decades in the long-time hosts' chair behind the familiar iconic late-night desk on May 22, 1992, and was replaced by Jay Leno amid national and media controversy. David Letterman not only wanted to move into that earlier time slot from his Late Night spot (which had been broadcast following Carson's program) after The Tonight Show, but was considered personally by Carson (Johnny's opinion not revealed until several years later) and others as the natural successor[6] (despite Leno having been Carson's permanent guest host for several years).[7] Letterman, having had his heart set on the earlier time slot, left NBC (on Carson's advice) and joined rival network CBS. Their new program and entry into the late-night television universe, the Late Show with David Letterman, airing in the same slot, competed head to head against The Tonight Show with now Leno in the host's chair and behind that iconic desk, for the better part of two decades.[8]\\r\\nOn September 27, 2004, the 50th anniversary of the show's premiere, NBC announced that Jay Leno would be succeeded by Conan O'Brien in 2009. Leno explained that in yielding to Conan, he wanted to avoid repeating the hard feelings that developed between him and David Letterman, and called O'Brien \\"certainly the most deserving person for the job.\\" What was to be the final episode of The Tonight Show with Leno as host aired on Friday, May 29, 2009.\\r\\nIn the months prior to his impending Tonight Show retirement, Leno and NBC agreed to a new contract, which would result in Leno hosting a new prime-time talk show beginning in September 2009, entitled The Jay Leno Show, with a format almost identical to his Tonight Show. In a departure from network programming conventions of the time, the new show aired every weeknight at 10pm Eastern/Pacific, leading into affiliates' local news broadcasts and O'Brien's Tonight Show.\\r\\nConan O'Brien replaced Leno as host on The Tonight Show on Monday, June 1 from a newly constructed studio inside Stage 1 of the Universal Studios Hollywood back lot, temporarily ending an era (since 1972) of recording the show in Burbank.\\r\\nAfter a strong start, O'Brien's audience trailed off significantly within a few months; at one point he attracted two million fewer viewers than Letterman. Furthermore, Leno's 10 p.m. show was unpopular with NBC affiliates since it reduced the lead-in audience to their 11 p.m. local newscasts.[10]\\r\\nOn January 7, 2010, multiple media outlets reported that beginning March 1, 2010, Leno would move from his 10 p.m. weeknight time slot to 11:35?p.m. due to Leno and O'Brien's sagging ratings, as well as pressure from NBC affiliates.[11][12] Leno's show would be shortened from an hour to 30 minutes. This would move The Tonight Show to 12:05?a.m., a post-midnight time slot for the first time in its history.[13]\\r\\nOn January 10, NBC confirmed they would be moving Jay Leno out of primetime as of February 12 and intended to move him to late-night as soon as possible.[14][15] TMZ reported that O'Brien was given no advance notice of this change, and that NBC offered him a choice: an hour-long 12:05?a.m. time slot, or the option to leave the network.[16] On January 12, O'Brien issued a press release that stated he would not continue with Tonight if it was moved to a 12:05?a.m. time slot,[17] saying, \\"I believe that delaying The Tonight Show into the next day to accommodate another comedy program will seriously damage what I consider to be the greatest franchise in the history of broadcasting. The Tonight Show at 12:05 simply isn't The Tonight Show.\\"\\r\\nOn January 21, it was announced that NBC had struck a deal with O'Brien in which he would leave The Tonight Show and receive a $33 million payout. His staff of almost 200 would receive $12 million in their departure. O'Brien's final episode aired on Friday, January 22, ending his relationship with NBC after 22 years. Leno resumed hosting The Tonight Show on March 1, 2010.[18][19][20] O'Brien returned to late-night television on November 8, 2010 (after his non-compete agreement expired) hosting Conan on cable channel TBS.\\r\\nOn March 1, 2010, Jay Leno returned to The Tonight Show, with Wally Wingert as his announcer. On April 12, 2010, bandleader Kevin Eubanks announced his departure after 18 years (15 years as bandleader) on May 28.[21] He was replaced as bandleader by Rickey Minor on June 7.[22] On July 1, 2010, Variety reported that only six months into its second life, Jay Leno's Tonight Show posted its lowest ratings since 1992.[23] By September 2010, Leno's ratings had fallen below those of Conan O'Brien when he had hosted The Tonight Show.[24] NBC ratings specialist Tom Bierbaum commented that due to the host being out of late-night television for a period of time and the subsequent 2010 Tonight Show conflict, Leno's ratings fall was \\"not a surprise at all.\\"[25] In October 2010, David Letterman beat Leno's program in the ratings, for the first time since Leno returned to hosting The Tonight Show.[26][27] By May 2011, however, Leno regained the lead over Letterman and held it until leaving the show in February 2014.[28] In August 2012, The Los Angeles Times reported that The Tonight Show was in trouble for a number of reasons, notably that NBC was losing money.[29] The Times later elaborated, noting that advertising revenue from The Tonight Show had dropped more than 40% since 2007, from $255.9 million annually to $146.1 million.[30] Still, despite these problems, during 2012ÿ13, The Tonight Show with Jay Leno was consistently the highest-ranking late-night show, regularly achieving audiences of over 3.5 million, according to Nielsen ratings. Leno's audience became considerably smaller after its peak 2002ÿ03 season, when it routinely attracted 5.8 million viewers a night. This was partly due to the continuing fragmentation of the TV audience, with an increasing number of cable shows, such as The Daily Show with Jon Stewart, The Colbert Report and Conan O'Brien's new show on TBS,[31] in addition to competition with Letterman on CBS and since January 8, 2013, Jimmy Kimmel Live! on ABC.\\r\\nOn April 3, 2013, NBC announced that Jay Leno would retire in 2014, with Late Night host Jimmy Fallon taking over The Tonight Show after the conclusion of NBC's coverage of the 2014 Winter Olympics. It was Leno's suggestion to use NBC's coverage of the Olympics as a springboard for Fallon's tenure.[32] The date was later moved up a week to February 17, midway through the Olympics.[33]\\r\\nLeno's last Tonight Show aired on February 6, 2014, featuring guests Billy Crystal (Leno's first guest in 1992) and Garth Brooks. Leno gave a tearful goodbye at the end of the program, calling himself \\"the luckiest guy in the world\\", and reflecting on his time as host as \\"the greatest 22 years of my life.\\"[34]\\r\\nJimmy Fallon (who had hosted The Tonight Show's follow-up show, Late Night, since 2009) assumed The Tonight Show hosting role on February 17, 2014, with his initial guests being Will Smith and the rock band U2, plus an assortment of celebrity cameos, including an appearance by one of Fallon's direct broadcast competitors, Stephen Colbert, and another by former permanent guest host Joan Rivers, making her first appearance on Tonight since cutting ties with Carson in 1986. The show's opening sequence was directed by filmmaker Spike Lee.[35]\\r\\nAs part of the transition to Fallon, The Tonight Show would be brought back to New York City after 42 years in Southern California. Approximately $5 million was budgeted to renovate Studio 6B, where Fallon recorded Late Night.[36] The move also enabled NBC to take advantage of a newly enacted New York state tax credit for talk shows that are \\"filmed before a studio audience of at least 200, as long as they carry a production budget of at least $30 million and have been shot outside New York for at least five seasons.\\"[37] Studio 6B is also where Jack Paar hosted The Tonight Show.[citation needed] Johnny Carson hosted The Tonight Show there for ten years before the show was moved to Burbank in 1972.[citation needed] Lorne Michaels (the producer of Saturday Night Live, in which Fallon appeared prior to hosting Late Night) became executive producer of The Tonight Show.\\r\\nFallon's Tonight Show has gone on the road to produce episodes remotely in its first year, spending four days at Universal Orlando Resort in Florida in June 2014 to promote new attractions at NBCUniversal's theme parks there.[38] In February 2015, Fallon presented a special Sunday night show from Phoenix, Arizona airing after NBC's coverage of Super Bowl XLIX,[39] followed by four days of shows in Stage 1 at Universal Studios Hollywood in Los Angeles (where Conan O'Brien's version was produced).\\r\\nAside from the title change and a new set, Fallon's version of The Tonight Show is nearly identical to the format of Late Night he employed, as he imported many of his signature comedy bits and much of his Late Night staff, including house band The Roots and announcer Steve Higgins. Prior to the transition, Fallon said, \\"In our heads, we've been doing The Tonight Show for five years. We're just on at a later hour.\\"[40]\\r\\nMusic during the show's introduction and commercial segues is supplied by The Tonight Show Band. This ensemble was a jazz big band until the end of Johnny Carson's tenure. Skitch Henderson was the bandleader during the Steve Allen and early Carson years, followed briefly by Milton DeLugg (who had previously led the band on Broadway Open House and later became the musical director of The Gong Show). Gene Rayburn served as Allen's announcer and sidekick and also guest-hosted some episodes. The Lou Stein Trio originally provided musical accompaniment during the short run of Tonight! America After Dark, which ran for six months between the Steve Allen/Ernie Kovacs and Jack Paar eras of The Tonight Show, but was later replaced by the Mort Lindsey Quartet, which in turn, was replaced by the Johnny Guarnieri Quartet. Jos Melis led the band for Jack Paar, and, after a short while of using comic actor Franklin Pangborn, Hugh Downs was Paar's announcer. For most of Johnny Carson's run on the show, the show's band, then called \\"The NBC Orchestra\\" was led by Doc Severinsen, former trumpet soloist in Henderson's band for Steve Allen.\\r\\nWhen McMahon was away from the show, Severinsen was the substitute announcer and Tommy Newsom would lead the band. (Newsom also took over when Severinsen was absent from the show.) On the rare occasions that both McMahon and Severinsen were away, Newsom would take the announcer's chair and the band would be led by assistant musical director Shelly Cohen.\\r\\nSeverinsen's big band featured several accomplished sidemen in addition to saxophonist Newsom, including trumpeter Snooky Young, pianist Ross Tompkins, drummer Ed Shaughnessy, trumpeter John Audino, trumpeter Conte Candoli, saxophonist Pete Christlieb, and jazz trumpet legend Clark Terry. The band frequently appeared on camera in the \\"Stump the Band\\" segments, where an audience member would dare the band to play some obscure song title, and the band would comically improvise something appropriate. The routine was played for full comedy value and the band was not really expected to know the songs, but on two occasions the band did answer correctly, much to the maestro's surprise. Severinsen was heard to ask incredulously, \\"You mean we actually...?\\"\\r\\nWhen Carson's tenure ended in 1992, the orchestra was axed and replaced by a smaller ensemble. The first bandleader during Leno's tenure was Branford Marsalis. In 1992, The Tonight Show Band also welcomed its first female member, Vicki Randle.[41] In 1995, Marsalis was replaced by Kevin Eubanks, though the Marsalis-written theme was used throughout the Leno's first tenure. On March 29, 2004, Leno's long-time announcer Edd Hall was replaced by John Melendez from The Howard Stern Show.\\r\\nConan O'Brien announced on the February 18, 2009 episode of Late Night that The Max Weinberg 7 (rechristened as The Tonight Show Band, and adding a second percussionist), the house band on that program, would be accompanying him to The Tonight Show as his version's house band. It was announced February 23, 2009 that former Late Night sidekick Andy Richter would be O'Brien's announcer.

As more affiliates lengthened their local news programs to 30 minutes, the show began doing two openings, one for the affiliates that began at 11:15 and another for those who joined at 11:30. By early 1965, only 43 of the 190 affiliated stations carried the entire show.[42] After February 1965, Johnny Carson refused to appear until 11:30, and Ed McMahon \\"hosted\\" the 11:15 segment. Carson was not happy with this arrangement, and he finally insisted that the show's start time be changed to 11:30. As a result, the two-opening practice was eliminated in December 1966.[43]\\r\\nWhen the show began it was broadcast live. On January 12, 1959, the show began to be videotaped for broadcast later on the same day, although initially the Thursday night programs were kept live.[44][45] Color broadcasts began on September 19, 1960.[46]\\r\\nThe Tonight Show became the first American television program to broadcast with MTS stereo sound in 1984, at first sporadically. Regular use of MTS began in 1985. In September 1991, the show postponed its starting time by five minutes to 11:35, to give network affiliates the opportunity to sell more advertising on their local news. On April 26, 1999, the show started broadcasting in 1080i HDTV, becoming the first American nightly talk show to be shot in that format.\\r\\nOn March 19, 2009, The Tonight Show became the first late-night talk show in history to have the sitting President of the United States as a guest, when President Barack Obama visited.\\r\\nThroughout the years, the time when The Tonight Show aired and the length has changed multiple times.[47]\\r\\nNote that many NBC affiliates chose not to carry the first fifteen minutes of the show during this period, instead preferring to air a local newscast from 11 p.m. to 11:30?p.m. As of February 1965, Carson refused to host the first 15 minutes of the program, preferring to wait until the full network was in place before delivering his opening monologue; Ed McMahon hosted the program's first 15 minutes instead. This persisted for nearly two years, until the show's start time was finally adjusted to 11:30?p.m. in January 1967.\\r\\nFrom 1965 to 1975, until the advent of Saturday Night Live, weekend repeats of The Tonight Show were staples of the NBC schedule.

On the October 23, 1984, broadcast, guest Paul McCartney had this to say of the show's British run:\\r\\nCarson: (throwing to commercial) OK, we're gonna have to cut away. We're just gonna see a commercial. We sell things occasionally. It's not like the British telly, you know. You just go forever, ten or twelve [minutes].

The colours were taken from the coat of arms of the Duchy of Brabant, and the vertical design may be based on the flag of France. When flown, the black band is nearest the pole (at the hoist side). It has the unusual proportions of 13:15.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter the death of Charlemagne, the present-day territory of Belgium (except the County of Flanders) became part of Lotharingia, which had a flag of two horizontal red stripes separated by a white stripe.[1] The territory then passed into Spanish hands, and after the coronation of Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor yellow and red, the colours of Spain, were added. From the 16th century to the end of the 18th century, the colours of what is now Belgium were red, white and yellow.[1] Occasionally the red cross of Burgundy was placed on the white section of the flag.[1]\\r\\nDuring the period of Austrian rule, a number of different flags were tried, until the Austrian Emperor imposed the Austrian flag. The population of Brussels was opposed to this, and following the example of France, red, yellow and black cockades began to appear; those being the colours of Brabant.[1] The colours thus correspond to the red lion of Hainaut, Limburg and Luxembourg, the yellow lion of Brabant, and the black lion of Flanders and Namur.[1]\\r\\nOn 26 August 1830, the day after the rioting at the Brussels Opera and the start of the Belgian Revolution, the flag of France flew from the city hall of Brussels. The insurgents hastily replaced it with a tricolour of red, yellow and black horizontal stripes (similar to the one used during the Brabant Revolution[1] of 1789-1790 which had established the United States of Belgium) made at a nearby fabric store. As a result, Article 193 of the Constitution of Belgium describes the colours of the Belgian nation as Red, Yellow and Black instead of using the order shown in the official flag.[2]\\r\\nOn 23 January 1831, the stripes changed from horizontal to vertical, and on 12 October the flag attained its modern form, with the black placed at the hoist side of the flag.[1]\\r\\nThe official guide to protocol in Belgium states that the national flag measures 2.6?m (8.5?ft) tall for each 3?m (9.8?ft) wide,[1] giving it a ratio of 13:15. Each of the stripes is one-third of the width of the flag. The yellow is in fact yellow and not the darker gold of the flag of Germany, which is a somewhat similar black-red-gold tricolour.\\r\\nThe national flag has the unusual proportions of 13:15. The 2:3 flag is the civil ensign, the correct flag for use by civilians at sea.[4]\\r\\nThe naval ensign of Belgium has the three national colours in a saltire, on a white field, with a black crown above crossed cannons at the top and a black anchor at the bottom. It was created in 1950, shortly after the Belgian Navy was re-established, having been a section of the British Royal Navy during World War II, and it is reminiscent of the white ensign of the Royal Navy.[5]\\r\\nThere is also an official Belgian naval jack, which is the same as the national flag, except in a 1:1 ratio, making it square.[5]\\r\\nThe royal standard of Belgium is the personal standard of the current king, Philippe, and features his monogram, an 'F' (for the Dutch 'Filip'), crossed with a 'P' in the four corners. The designs of royal standards of past monarchs have been similar.[6]\\r\\nNotably, the flag of Belgium flown on the Royal Palace of Brussels and the Royal Castle of Laeken is in none of the proportions above. It has the irregular 4:3 ratio, making it taller than it is wide.[6] The stripes remain vertical. These proportions are explained as an aesthetic consideration, as the palaces are large, and the flags are thus viewed from far below, which makes them look more normal due to foreshortening.[6]\\r\\nThe flags are flown above the palaces when the king is in Belgium, not necessarily just in one of the palaces. The flags are not flown if the king is on a state visit to another country or on vacation outside Belgium,[6] There have been exceptions to this rule, but in general presence or absence of the flag is a reasonably reliable indicator of whether or not the king is in the country.\\r\\nAs Belgium is a federal state, the flag of Belgium and the flags of the communities or regions in principle occupy the same rank.[1] Nonetheless, when flags are raised and lowered or carried in a procession, the national flag takes precedence over all the others.[1]\\r\\nThe order of precedence is:[1]\\r\\nIf there is a visiting head of state, that country's flag may be set second in precedence, all other flags dropping a rank.[1]","input":"What country has a black yellow and orange flag?"},{"output":"Northeast Africa","context":"","input":"What region of the world is sudan in?"},{"output":"5 March 1824","context":"British victory\\r\\n British Empire\\r\\nThe First Anglo-Burmese War, also known as the First Burma War, (Burmese: ??? ????????? ?????? ???; [p?t??ma? ????lei? mj?m s??]; 5 March 1824 ÿ 24 February 1826) was the first of three wars fought between the British and Burmese empires in the 19th century. The war, which began primarily over the control of Northeastern India, ended in a decisive British victory, giving the British total control of Assam, Manipur, Cachar and Jaintia as well as Arakan Province and Tenasserim. The Burmese were also forced to pay an indemnity of one million pounds sterling, and sign a commercial treaty.[1][2]\\r\\nFifteen thousand European and Indian soldiers died, together with an unknown number of Burmese military and civilian casualties. The high cost of the campaign to the British, 5ÿ13?million pounds sterling (S386?million-S1?billion as of 2016),[3][4] contributed to a severe economic crisis in British India which cost the East India Company its remaining privileges.[5]\\r\\nFor the Burmese Empire, it was the beginning of the end of their independence. The Third Burmese Empire, for a brief time the terror of British India, was crippled and no longer a threat to the eastern frontier of British India.[4] The Burmese would be crushed for years to come by repaying the large indemnity of one million pounds (then US$5 million), a large sum at that time.[2] The British would wage two more wars against a much-weakened Burma, and swallow up the entire country by 1885.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nBy 1822, Burmese expansion into Manipur and Assam had created a long border between British India and the Burmese Empire. The British, based in Calcutta, supported rebels from Manipur, Assam and Arakan fleeing into British territory. Calcutta unilaterally declared Cachar and Jaintia British protectorates, and sent in troops.[6] Cross border raids into these newly acquired territories from British territories and spheres of influence vexed the Burmese. Convinced that war was inevitable, Burmese commander-in-chief, Maha Bandula, became a main proponent of offensive policy against the British. Bandula was part of the war party at Bagyidaw's court, which also included Queen Me Nu and her brother, the Lord of Salin.[4] Bandula believed that a decisive victory could allow Ava to consolidate its gains in its new western empire in Arakan, Manipur, Assam, Cachar and Jaintia, as well as take over eastern Bengal.[6]\\r\\nIn September 1823, the casus belli was Burma occupying Shalpuri Island near Chittagong, which was claimed by the East India Company.[7]\\r\\nIn January 1824, Burma sent one of their top generals, Thado Thiri Maha Uzana, into Cachar and Jaintia to disperse the rebels. The British sent in their own force to meet the Burmese in Cachar, resulting in the first clashes between the two. The war formally broke out on 5 March 1824, following border clashes in Arakan.\\r\\nThe British reason for the war was, in addition to expanding British Bengal's sphere of influence, the desire for new markets for British manufacturing.[8][9] The British were also anxious to deny the French the use of Burmese harbours and concerned about French influence at the Court of Ava, as the kingdom was still known to them.[10] British Ambassador Michael Symes's mission was equipped to gain as much knowledge as possible of the country for future British plans whereas previous envoys were concerned principally with trade concessions. AngloÿFrench rivalry had already played a role during Alaungpaya's endeavours of unifying the kingdom.[10] The Burmese in these wars were advancing into smaller states not ruled by the British or the subject of expansionary goals by the British before the war began, and the British were not so much preoccupied by the refugee problem initially as by the threat posed by the French until further incidents forced their hand.[10]\\r\\nThe commander in chief of the Burmese army, Maha Bandula, was supported by twelve of the country's best divisions, including one under his personal command, all totaling 10,000 men and 500 horses. His general staff included some of the country's most decorated soldiers, men like the Lord of Salay and the governors of Danyawaddy, Wuntho and Taungoo. Bandula's plan was to attack the British on two fronts: Chittagong from Arakan in the southeast, and Sylhet from Cachar and Jaintia in the north.[6] Bandula personally commanded the Arakan theatre while Uzana commanded Cachar and Jaintia theater.[4]\\r\\nEarly in the war, battle hardened Burmese forces were able to push back the British forces because the Burmese, who had been fighting in the jungles of Manipur and Assam for nearly a decade, were more familiar with the terrain which represented \\"a formidable obstacle to the march of a European force\\".[1] Uzana had already defeated the British units in Cachar and Jaintia in January 1824. In May, Burmese forces led by U Sa, Lord Myawaddy (about 4,000)[11] fought their way into Bengal, and defeated British troops at the Battle of Ramu, 10 miles east of Cox's Bazar on 17 May 1824.[12] Sa's column then joined Bandula's column on the march to defeat British forces at Gadawpalin, and went on to capture Cox's Bazar.[13] The Burmese success caused extreme panic in Chittagong and in Calcutta.[14] Across the eastern Bengal, the European inhabitants formed themselves into militia forces. And a large portion of the crews of the East India Company's ships were landed to assist in the defence of Calcutta.[15]\\r\\nBut Bandula, not wanting to overstretch, stopped U Sa from proceeding to Chittagong. Had Bandula marched on to Chittagong, which unbeknown to him was lightly held, he could have taken it and the way to Calcutta would have been open. Had they been able to threaten Calcutta, the Burmese could have obtained more favourable terms in the peace negotiations later on.[2]\\r\\nInstead of fighting in hard terrain, the British took the fight to the Burmese mainland. On 11 May 1824, a British naval force of over 10,000 men (5,000 British soldiers and over 5,000 Indian sepoys) entered the harbour of Yangon, taking the Burmese by surprise.[16][17] The Burmese, pursuing a scorched earth policy, left an empty city behind and chose to fortify positions along an east-west 10-mile arc outside the city. The British forces led by General Archibald Campbell took position inside the Shwedagon Pagoda compound, which was fortified. The British launched attacks on Burmese lines, and by July 1824, had successfully pushed the Burmese towards Kamayut, five miles from Shwedagon. Burmese efforts to retake Shwedagon in September failed.[18]\\r\\nKing Bagyidaw ordered a near complete withdrawal from the western frontBandula from Arakan and Bengal, and Uzana from Assam, Cachar and Jaintiaand meet the enemy in Yangon. In August, in the midst of monsoon season, Bandula and his army crossed the Arakan Yoma.[19] Moving tens of thousands of men over the 3,000-foot-high Arakan hills, or 10,000-foot-high Assamese ranges, heavily forested with only narrow footpaths and open to attack by tigers and leopards, would be difficult even in mild weather conditions. To do this at the height of the drenching monsoon season was a particularly difficult task. Yet Bandula (from Arakan) and Uzana (from Assam) in a testament to their generalship and logistical skills, managed to do just that. The King granted both Bandula and Uzana the title Agga Maha Thenapati, the highest possible military rank. Bandula was also made the governor of Sittaung.[18]\\r\\nBy November, Bandula commanded a force of 30,000 massed outside Yangon. Bandula believed that he could take on a well-armed British force of 10,000 head-on. Although the Burmese were numerically superior, only 15,000 of the 30,000 had muskets. The Burmese cannons fired only balls whereas the British cannons fired exploding shells.[16] Unbeknown to him, the British had just received the first shipment of the newest weapon in war that the Burmese had never seenCongreve rockets.[19][20] More ominous for the Burmese, the speedy march through the hilly regions of Rakhine Yoma and Assamese ranges had left their troops exhausted.\\r\\nOn 30 November, in what turned out be the biggest mistake of his career, Bandula ordered a frontal attack on British positions. The British, with far superior weaponry, withstood several Burmese charges at the Shwedagon fort, cutting down men by the thousands. By 7 December, the British troops, supported by rocket fire, had begun to gain the upper hand. On 15 December, the Burmese were driven out of their last remaining stronghold at Kokine.[20] In the end, only 7,000 of the 30,000 Burmese soldiers returned.[16]\\r\\nBandula fell back to his rear base at Danubyu, a small town not far from Yangon, in the Irrawaddy delta. Having lost experienced men in Yangon, the Burmese forces now numbered about 10,000, of mixed quality, including some of the king's best soldiers but also many untrained and barely armed conscripts. The stockade itself stretched a mile along the riverbank, and was made up of solid teak beams no less than 15 feet high.[20]\\r\\nIn March 1825, a four thousand strong British force supported by a flotilla of gun boats attacked Danubyu. The first British attack failed, and Bandula attempted a counter charge, with foot soldiers, cavalry and 17 fighting elephants. But the elephants were stopped by rocket fire and the cavalry found it impossible to move against the sustained British artillery fire.[20]\\r\\nOn 1 April, the British launched a major attack, pounding down on the town with their heavy guns and raining their rockets on every part of the Burmese line. Bandula was killed by a mortar shell. Bandula had walked around the fort to boost the morale of his men, in his full insignia under a glittering golden umbrella, discarding the warnings of his generals that he would prove an easy target for the enemy's guns. After Bandula's death, the Burmese evacuated Danubyu.[20]\\r\\nU Sa was left to command the remaining Burmese troops in Arakan after Bandula and the main battalions were ordered to withdraw from Arakan by Bagyidaw to meet the British invasion in Yangon in August 1824. Sa held on to Arakan throughout 1824 while the main focal point of the war played out in Yangon. After Gen. Archibald Campbell finally defeated Gen. Bandula in the Battle of Yangon in December 1824, the British turned their sights to Arakan. On 1 February 1825, an invasion force of 11,000 soldiers supported by a flotilla of gun boats and armed cruisers along the coast and a squadron of cavalry under the command of Gen. Morrison attacked Burmese positions in Arakan. Despite their superior numbers and firearms, the British had to fight depleted Burmese forces for nearly two months before they reached the main Burmese garrison at Mrauk-U, Arakan's capital. On 29 March 1825, the British launched their attack on Mrauk-U. (At the same time, Campbell also launched an attack on Bandula's positions in the Battle of Danubyu.) After a few days of fighting, the Burmese at Mrauk-U were defeated on April 1, coincidentally the same day Maha Bandula fell at Danubyu. Sa and the remaining Burmese forces evacuated and left Arakan. The British proceeded to occupy the rest of Arakan.[11]\\r\\nOn 17 September 1825, an armistice was concluded for one month. In the course of the summer, General Joseph Wanton Morrison had conquered the province of Arakan; in the north, the Burmese were expelled from Assam; and the British had made some progress in Cachar, though their advance was finally impeded by the thick forests and jungle.\\r\\nPeace negotiations that began in September broke down by early October after the Burmese would not agree to British terms. The British had demanded no less than the complete dismemberment of the Burmese western territories in Arakan, Assam, Manipur and the Tenasserim coast as well as two million pounds sterling of indemnity. The Burmese would not agree to give up Arakan and the large sum of indemnity.[21]\\r\\nIn November 1825, the Burmese decided to throw everything they had into last-ditch effort. Starting in mid-November, the Burmese forces, consisting mainly of Shan regiments led by their sawbwas, threatened Prome in a daring circular movement that almost surrounded the town and cut off communications lines to Yangon. In the end, the superior firepower of the British guns and missiles won out.[21] On 1 December, Gen. Campbell, with 2500 European and 1500 Indian sepoys, supported by a flotilla of gun boats, attacked the main Burmese position outside Prome. On 2 December, Maha Ne Myo was killed by a shell launched from the flotilla. After Maha Ne Myo's death, the British dislodged the Burmese by 5 December.[22]\\r\\nThe defeat in Prome effectively left the Burmese army in disarray. The Burmese army was in constant retreat from then on. On 26 December, they sent a flag of truce to the British camp. Negotiations having commenced, the Burmese were forced to accept the British terms to end the war, signing the Treaty of Yandabo in February 1826..\\r\\nThe British demanded and the Burmese agreed to:[1][2]\\r\\nThe first installment of indemnity was to be paid immediately, the second installment within the first 100 days from signing of the treaty, and the rest within two years. Until the second installment was paid, the British would not leave Yangon.[2]\\r\\nThe Treaty of Yandabo was signed by General Campbell from the British side and Governor of Legaing Maha Min Hla Kyaw Htin from the Burmese side on 24 February 1826.[23] The Burmese paid 250,000 pounds sterling in gold and silver bullion as the first installment of the indemnity, and also released British prisoners of war. The war was thus brought to an end, and the British army moved south. The British army remained in the territories surrendered to it under the treaty and in the territories such as the Rangoon area which were occupied for several years in guarantee of the financial terms of the treaty.\\r\\nThe treaty imposed a severe financial burden to the Burmese Kingdom, and effectively left it crippled. The British terms in the negotiations were strongly influenced by the heavy cost in lives and money which the war had entailed. Some 40,000 British and Indians troops had been involved of whom 15,000 had been killed. The cost to the British India's finances had been almost ruinous, amounting to approximately 13 million pounds sterling. The cost of war contributed to a severe economic crisis in India, which by 1833 had bankrupted the Bengal agency houses and cost the British East India Company its remaining privileges, including the monopoly of trade to China.[5]\\r\\nFor the Burmese, the treaty was a total humiliation and a long-lasting financial burden. A whole generation of men had been wiped out in battle. The world the Burmese knew, of conquest and martial pride, built on the back of impressive military success of the previous 75 years, had come crashing down.[24] The Court of Ava could not come to terms with the loss of the territories, and made unsuccessful attempts to get them back. An uninvited British resident in Ava was a daily reminder of the humiliating defeat.[5]\\r\\nIn addition, the burden of indemnity left the Burmese royal treasury bankrupt for years. The indemnity of one million pounds sterling was considered a large sum in Europe at that time. It appeared more daunting when converted to the Burmese kyat equivalent of 10 million. The cost of living of the average villager in Upper Burma in 1826 was one kyat per month.[2]\\r\\nThe British would wage two more less expensive wars against the weaker Burmese in 1852 and 1885, and annex Burma by 1885.","input":"When did the first anglo burmese war begin?"},{"output":"13.50%","context":"Poverty is a state of deprivation, lacking the usual or socially acceptable amount of money or material possessions.[1] The most common measure of poverty in the U.S. is the \\"poverty threshold\\" set by the U.S. government. This measure recognizes poverty as a lack of those goods and services commonly taken for granted by members of mainstream society.[2] The official threshold is adjusted for inflation using the consumer price index.\\r\\nMost Americans will spend at least one year below the poverty line at some point between ages 25 and 75.[3] Poverty rates are persistently higher in rural and inner city parts of the country as compared to suburban areas.[4][5]\\r\\nIn 2015, 13.5% (43.1 million) of Americans lived in poverty.[6] Starting in the 1930s, relative poverty rates have consistently exceeded those of other wealthy nations.[7] The lowest poverty rates are found in New Hampshire, Vermont, Minnesota and Nebraska, which have between 8.7% and 9.1% of their population living in poverty.[8]\\r\\nIn 2009 the number of people who were in poverty was approaching 1960s levels that led to the national War on Poverty.[9] In 2011 extreme poverty in the United States, meaning households living on less than $2 per day before government benefits, was double 1996 levels at 1.5 million households, including 2.8 million children.[10]\\r\\nIn 2012 the percentage of seniors living in poverty was 14% while 18% of children were.[11] The addition of Social Security benefits contributed more to reduce poverty than any other factor.[12]\\r\\nRecent census data shows that half the population qualifies as poor or low income,[13] with one in five Millennials living in poverty.[14] Academic contributors to The Routledge Handbook of Poverty in the United States postulate that new and extreme forms of poverty have emerged in the U.S. as a result of neoliberal structural adjustment policies and globalization, which have rendered economically marginalized communities as destitute \\"surplus populations\\" in need of control and punishment.[15]\\r\\nIn 2011, child poverty reached record high levels, with 16.7 million children living in food insecure households, about 35% more than 2007 levels.[16] A 2013 UNICEF report ranked the U.S. as having the second highest relative child poverty rates in the developed world.[17] According to a 2016 study by the Urban Institute, teenagers in low income communities are often forced to join gangs, save school lunches, sell drugs or exchange sexual favors because they cannot afford food.[18]\\r\\nThere were about 643,000 sheltered and unsheltered homeless people nationwide in January 2009. Almost two-thirds stayed in an emergency shelter or transitional housing program and the other third were living on the street, in an abandoned building, or another place not meant for human habitation. About 1.56 million people, or about 0.5% of the U.S. population, used an emergency shelter or a transitional housing program between October 1, 2008 and September 30, 2009.[19] Around 44% of homeless people are employed.[20]\\r\\nIn June 2016, the IMF warned the United States that its high poverty rate needs to be tackled urgently by raising the minimum wage and offering paid maternity leave to women to encourage them to enter the labor force.[21]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThere are two basic versions of the federal poverty measure: the poverty thresholds (which are the primary version); and the poverty guidelines. The Census Bureau issues the poverty thresholds, which are generally used for statistical purposes[22]for example, to estimate the number of people in poverty nationwide each year and classify them by type of residence, race, and other social, economic, and demographic characteristics. The Department of Health and Human Services issues the poverty guidelines for administrative purposesfor instance, to determine whether a person or family is eligible for assistance through various federal programs.[23]\\r\\nThe \\"Orshansky Poverty Thresholds\\" form the basis for the current measure of poverty in the U.S. Mollie Orshansky was an economist working for the Social Security Administration (SSA). Her work appeared at an opportune moment. Orshansky's article was published later in the same year that Johnson declared war on poverty. Since her measure was absolute (i.e., did not depend on other events), it made it possible to objectively answer whether the U.S. government was \\"winning\\" this war. The newly formed United States Office of Economic Opportunity adopted the lower of the Orshansky poverty thresholds for statistical, planning, and budgetary purposes in May 1965.\\r\\nThe Bureau of the Budget (now the Office of Management and Budget) adopted Orshansky's definition for statistical use in all Executive departments. The measure gave a range of income cutoffs, or thresholds, adjusted for factors such as family size, sex of the family head, number of children under 18 years old, and farm or non-farm residence. The economy food plan (the least costly of four nutritionally adequate food plans designed by the Department of Agriculture) was at the core of this definition of poverty.[24]\\r\\nAt the time of creating the poverty definition, the Department of Agriculture found that families of three or more persons spent about one third of their after-tax income on food. For these families, poverty thresholds were set at three times the cost of the economy food plan. Different procedures were used for calculating poverty thresholds for two-person households and persons living alone. Annual updates of the SSA poverty thresholds were based on price changes in the economy food plan, but updates do not reflect other changes (food is no longer one-third of the after-tax income). Two changes were made to the poverty definition in 1969. Thresholds for non-farm families were tied to annual changes in the Consumer Price Index rather than changes in the cost of the economy food plan. Farm thresholds were raised from 70 to 85% of the non-farm levels.\\r\\nIn 1981, further changes were made to the poverty definition. Separate thresholds for \\"farm\\" and \\"female-householder\\" families were eliminated. The largest family size category became \\"nine persons or more.\\"[24]\\r\\nApart from these changes, the U.S. government's approach to measuring poverty has remained static for the past forty years.\\r\\nThe poverty guideline figures are not the figures the Census Bureau uses to calculate the number of poor persons. The figures that the Census Bureau uses are the poverty thresholds. The Census Bureau provides an explanation of the difference between poverty thresholds and guidelines.[26] The Census Bureau uses a set of money income thresholds that vary by family size and composition to determine who is in poverty.[24] The 2010 figure for a family of 4 with no children under 18 years of age is $22,541, while the figure for a family of 4 with 2 children under 18 is $22,162.[27] For comparison, the 2011 HHS poverty guideline for a family of 4 is $22,350.\\r\\nAnother way of looking at poverty is in relative terms. \\"Relative poverty\\" can be defined as having significantly less income and wealth than other members of society. Therefore, the relative poverty rate is a measure of income inequality. When the standard of living among those in more financially advantageous positions rises while that of those considered poor stagnates, the relative poverty rate will reflect such growing income inequality and increase. Conversely, the relative poverty rate can decrease, with low income people coming to have less wealth and income if wealthier people's wealth is reduced by a larger percentage than theirs.\\r\\nSome critics[who?] argue that relying on income disparity to determine who is impoverished can be misleading. The Bureau of Labor Statistics data suggests that consumer spending varies much less than income. In 2008, the poorest one fifth of Americans households spent on average $12,955 per person for goods and services (other than taxes), the second quintile spent $14,168, the third $16,255, the fourth $19,695, while the richest fifth spent $26,644. The disparity of expenditures is much less than the disparity of income.[28][neutrality is disputed]\\r\\nAlthough the relative approach theoretically differs largely from the Orshansky definition, crucial variables of both poverty definitions are more similar than often thought. First, the so-called standardization of income in both approaches is very similar. To make incomes comparable among households of different sizes, equivalence scales are used to standardize household income to the level of a single person household. When compared to the US Census poverty line, which is based on a defined basket of goods, for the most prevalent household types both standardization methods show very similar results.\\r\\nIn addition to family status, race/ethnicity and age also correlate with high poverty rates in the United States. Although data regarding race and poverty are more extensively published and cross tabulated, the family status correlation is by far the strongest.\\r\\nAccording to the US Census, in 2007 5.8% of all people in married families lived in poverty,[33] as did 26.6% of all persons in single parent households[33] and 19.1% of all persons living alone.[33] More than 75% of all poor households are headed by women (2012).[34]\\r\\nAmong married couple families: 5.8% lived in poverty.[33] This number varied by race and ethnicity as follows:\\r\\n5.4% of all white persons (which includes white Hispanics),[35]\\r\\n10.7% of all black persons (which includes black Hispanics),[36] and\\r\\n14.9% of all Hispanic persons (of any race)[37] living in poverty.\\r\\nAmong single parent (male or female) families: 26.6% lived in poverty.[33] This number varied by race and ethnicity as follows:\\r\\n22.5% of all white persons (which includes white Hispanics),[35]\\r\\n44.0% of all black persons (which includes black Hispanics),[36] and\\r\\n33.4% of all Hispanic persons (of any race)[37] living in poverty.\\r\\nAmong individuals living alone: 19.1% lived in poverty.[33] This number varied by race and ethnicity as follows:\\r\\n18% of white persons (which includes white Hispanics)[38]\\r\\n28.9% of black persons (which includes black Hispanics)[37] and\\r\\n27% of Hispanic persons (of any race)[39] living in poverty.\\r\\nThe US Census declared that in 2014 14.8% of the general population lived in poverty:[40]\\r\\n10.1% of all white non-Hispanic persons\\r\\n12.0% of all Asian persons\\r\\n23.6% of all Hispanic persons (of any race)\\r\\n26.2% of all African American persons\\r\\n28.3% of Native Americans / Alaska Natives\\r\\nAs of 2010 about half of those living in poverty are non-Hispanic white (19.6 million).[40] Non-Hispanic white children comprised 57% of all poor rural children.[41]\\r\\nIn FY 2009, African American families comprised 33.3% of TANF families, non-Hispanic white families comprised 31.2%, and 28.8% were Hispanic.[42]\\r\\nPoverty is also notoriously high on Native American reservations (see Reservation poverty). 7 of the 11 poorest counties in per capita income, including the 2 poorest in the U.S., encompass Lakota Sioux reservations in South Dakota.[43] This fact has been cited by some critics as a mechanism that enables the \\"kidnapping\\" of Lakota children by the state of South Dakota's Department of Social Services. The Lakota People's Law Project,[44] among other critics, allege that South Dakota \\"inappropriately equates economic poverty with neglect?... South Dakota's rate of identifying 'neglect' is 18% higher than the national average?... In 2010, the national average of state discernment of neglect, as a percent of total maltreatment of foster children prior to their being taken into custody by the state, was 78.3%. In South Dakota the rate was 95.8%.\\"[45]\\r\\nPoverty in the Pine Ridge Reservation in particular has had unprecedented effects on its residents' longevity. \\"Recent reports state the average life expectancy is 45 years old while others state that it is 48 years old for men and 52 years old for women. With either set of figures, that's the shortest life expectancy for any community in the Western Hemisphere outside Haiti, according to The Wall Street Journal.\\"[46]\\r\\nThe US Census declared that in 2010 15.1% of the general population lived in poverty:\\r\\n22% of all people under age 18\\r\\n13.7% of all people 19ÿ21 and\\r\\n9% of all people ages 65 and older[40]\\r\\nThe Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) uses a different measure for poverty and declared in 2008 that child poverty in the US is 20% and poverty among the elderly is 23%.[47] The non-profit advocacy group Feeding America has released a study (May 2009) based on 2005ÿ2007 data from the U.S. Census Bureau and the Agriculture Department, which claims that 3.5 million children under the age of 5 are at risk of hunger in the United States. The study claims that in 11 states, Louisiana, which has the highest rate, followed by North Carolina, Ohio, Kentucky, Texas, New Mexico, Kansas, South Carolina, Tennessee, Idaho and Arkansas, more than 20 percent of children under 5 are allegedly at risk of going hungry. (Receiving fewer than 1,800 calories per day) The study was paid by ConAgra Foods, a large food company.[48]\\r\\nIn 2012, 16.1 million American children were living in poverty. Outside of the 49 million Americans living in food insecure homes, 15.9 million of them were children.[49] In 2013, child poverty reached record high levels in the U.S., with 16.7 million children living in food insecure households. Many of the neighborhoods these children live in lack basic produce and nutritious food. 47 million Americans depend on food banks, more than 30% above 2007 levels. Households headed by single mothers are most likely to be affected. 30 percent of low-income single mothers cannot afford diapers.[50] Inability to afford this necessity can cause a chain reaction, including mental, health, and behavioral problems. Some women are forced to make use of one or two diapers, using them more than once. This causes rashes and sanitation problems as well as health problems. Without diapers, children are unable to enter into daycare. The lack of childcare can be detrimental to single mothers, hindering their ability to obtain employment.[50] Worst affected are Oregon, Arizona, New Mexico, Florida, and the District of Columbia, while North Dakota, New Hampshire, Virginia, Minnesota and Massachusetts are the least affected.[16] 31 million low-income children received free or reduced-price meals daily through the National School lunch program during the 2012 federal fiscal year. Nearly 14 million children are estimated to be served by Feeding America with over 3 million being of the ages of 5 and under.[51]\\r\\nA 2014 report by the National Center on Family Homelessness states the number of homeless children in the U.S. has reached record levels, calculating that 2.5 million children, or one child in every 30, experienced homelessness in 2013. High levels of poverty, lack of affordable housing and domestic violence were cited as the primary causes.[52]\\r\\nPoverty affects individual access to quality education. The U.S. education system is often funded by local communities; therefore the quality of materials and teachers can reflect the affluence of community. That said, many communities address this by supplementing these areas with funds from other districts. Low income communities are often not able to afford the quality education that high income communities do. Poor perceptions, by teachers, of families and communities in poverty can manifest itself in teachers who will not put forth the effort to teach and students who are thought to be opposed to learning; in both cases poor students are thought to be incapable.[53] When a teacher assumes a child is linguistically deficient, they may look through a stigmatized lens when working with the student. This can create an atmosphere that can reify negative stereotypes and undermine student motivation.[54] By the teacher not looking through such a lens, they will be able to reinforce the idea that all their students have an opportunity to increase their learning abilities, which can result in more classroom engagement and student motivation.[55] Females in poverty are also likely to become pregnant at a young age, and with fewer resources to care for a child, young women often drop out of school.[56] A reason for the gap in access to education is due to the fact that reforms in the instruction programs have not been implemented well or at all in high poverty schools.[57] Due to these and other reasons the quality of education between the classes is not equal.[58]\\r\\nSome teachers will use the phrase culture of poverty as a taxonomy of lower socioeconomic students and will use child poverty as an excuse for why they are not successful with certain students.[59] The culture of poverty acknowledges the past factors of the initial condition of poverty were results of racial segregation and discrimination, and substandard housing and education, ignoring personal responsibility, yet puts the blame on the behaviors and attitudes of the poor, as the cause of present poverty.[60] This idea ignores the very fact that the current housing and education in poverty is still substandard and plays a large role in the cause of present poverty,.[60] Some people point out that poverty is a choice; that single parent families are more often to be below the poverty line.\\r\\nThere are multiple misconceptions in regards to poverty. Research has undermined the idea that parents of low socioeconomic status do not value education, when in truth they hold the same attitudes as wealthy families.[61] It is not an issue of value, but more so a problem of access.[62] A parent from a lower socioeconomic class is likely to have more factors than a parent from a wealthy socioeconomic class that may affect their involvement with their childs education. For instance a person living in poverty is more likely to work multiple jobs, as well as not having certain means of transportation, thus hindering their access to their childs education.[63] The teachers, faculty, and administrators of the schools have to take these real-life factors into consideration.\\r\\n89 percent of the American households were food secure throughout the entire year of 2002, meaning that they had access at all times to enough food for an active, healthy life for all of the household members. The remaining households were food insecure at least some time during that year. The prevalence of food insecurity rose from 10.7% in 2001 to 11.1% in 2002, and the prevalence of food insecurity with hunger rose from 3.3% to 3.5%.[64]\\r\\nIn 2007, 88.9% of American households were food secure throughout the entire year.[65] The number of American households that were food secure throughout the entire year dropped to 85.4% in 2008.[66] As of 2012, the prevalence of food insecurity has been essentially unchanged since 2008.[67]\\r\\nThere are numerous factors related to poverty in the United States.\\r\\nIn recent years, there have been a number of concerns raised about the official U.S. poverty measure. In 1995, the National Research Council's Committee on National Statistics convened a panel on measuring poverty. The findings of the panel were that \\"the official poverty measure in the United States is flawed and does not adequately inform policy-makers or the public about who is poor and who is not poor.\\"\\r\\nThe panel was chaired by Robert Michael, former Dean of the Harris School of the University of Chicago. According to Michael, the official U.S. poverty measure \\"has not kept pace with far-reaching changes in society and the economy.\\" The panel proposed a model based on disposable income:\\r\\nMany sociologists and government officials have argued that poverty in the United States is understated, meaning that there are more households living in actual poverty than there are households below the poverty threshold.[90] A recent NPR report states that as many as 30% of Americans have trouble making ends meet and other advocates have made supporting claims that the rate of actual poverty in the US is far higher than that calculated by using the poverty threshold.[90] A study taken in 2012 estimated that roughly 38% of Americans live \\"paycheck to paycheck.\\"[91]\\r\\nAccording to William H. Chafe, if one used a relative standard for measuring poverty (a standard that took into account the rising standards of living rather than an absolute dollar figure) then 18% of families were living in poverty in 1968, not 13% as officially estimated at that time.[92]\\r\\nAs far back as 1969, the Bureau of Labor Statistics put forward suggested budgets for adequate family living. 60% of working-class Americans lived below one of these budgets, which suggested that a far higher proportion of Americans lived in poverty than the official poverty line suggested. These findings were also used by observers on the left when questioning the long-established view that most Americans had attained an affluent standard of living in the two decades following the end of the Second World War.[93][94]\\r\\nUsing a definition of relative poverty (reflecting disposable income below half the median of adjusted national income), it was estimated that, between 1979 and 1982, 17.1% of Americans lived in poverty.[95]\\r\\nAs noted above, the poverty thresholds used by the US government were originally developed during the Johnson administration's War on Poverty initiative in 1963ÿ1964.[96][97] Mollie Orshansky, the government economist working at the Social Security Administration who developed the thresholds, based the threshold levels on the cost of purchasing what in the mid-1950s had been determined by the US Department of Agriculture to be the minimal nutritionally-adequate amount of food necessary to feed a family. Orshansky multiplied the cost of the food basket by a factor of three, under the assumption that the average family spent one third of its income on food.\\r\\nWhile the poverty threshold is updated for inflation every year, the basket of food used to determine what constitutes being deprived of a socially acceptable minimum standard of living has not been updated since 1955. As a result, the current poverty line only takes into account food purchases that were common more than 50 years ago, updating their cost using the Consumer Price Index. When methods similar to Orshansky's were used to update the food basket using prices for the year 2000 instead of from nearly a half century earlier, it was found that the poverty line should actually be 200% higher than the official level being used by the government in that year.[98]\\r\\nYet even that higher level could still be considered flawed, as it would be based almost entirely on food costs and on the assumption that families still spend a third of their income on food. In fact, Americans typically spent less than one tenth of their after-tax income on food in 2000.[99] For many families, the costs of housing, health insurance and medical care, transportation, and access to basic telecommunications take a much larger bite out of the family's income today than a half century ago; yet, as noted above,[96][97] none of these costs are considered in determining the official poverty thresholds. According to John Schwarz, a political scientist at the University of Arizona:\\r\\nThe issue of understating poverty is especially pressing in states with both a high cost of living and a high poverty rate such as California where the median home price in May 2006 was determined to be $564,430.[100] In the Monterey area, where the low-pay industry of agriculture is the largest sector in the economy and the majority of the population lacks a college education, the median home price was determined to be $723,790, requiring an upper middle class income only earned by roughly 20% of all households in the county.[100][101]\\r\\nSuch fluctuations in local markets are, however, not considered in the Federal poverty threshold and thus leave many who live in poverty-like conditions out of the total number of households classified as poor.\\r\\nIn 2011, the Census Bureau introduced a new supplemental poverty measure aimed at providing a more accurate picture of the true extent of poverty in the United States. The SPM extends the official poverty measure by taking account of many of the government programs designed to assist low-income families and individuals that are not included in the current official poverty measure.[8] According to this new measure, 16% of Americans lived in poverty in 2011, compared with the official figure of 15.2%. The new measure also estimated that nearly half of all Americans lived in poverty that year, defined as living within 200% of the federal poverty line.[102]\\r\\nDuke University Professor of Public Policy and Economics Sandy Darity, Jr. says, \\"There is no exact way of measuring poverty. The measures are contingent on how we conceive of and define poverty. Efforts to develop more refined measures have been dominated by researchers who intentionally want to provide estimates that reduce the magnitude of poverty.\\"[103]\\r\\nAccording to an 2017 academic study by MIT economist Peter Temin, Americans trapped in poverty live in conditions rivaling the developing world, and are forced to contend with substandard education, dilapidated housing, and few stable employment opportunities.[104] A 2017 study published in The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene found that hookworm, a parasite that thrives on extreme poverty, is flourishing in the Deep South. A report on the study in The Guardian stated:\\r\\nScientists in Houston, Texas, have lifted the lid on one of Americas darkest and deepest secrets: that hidden beneath fabulous wealth, the US tolerates poverty-related illness at levels comparable to the worlds poorest countries. More than one in three people sampled in a poor area of Alabama tested positive for traces of hookworm, a gastrointestinal parasite that was thought to have been eradicated from the US decades ago.[105]\\r\\nSome critics assert that the official U.S. poverty definition is inconsistent with how it is defined by its own citizens and the rest of the world, because the U.S. government considers many citizens statistically impoverished despite their ability to sufficiently meet their basic needs. According to a heavily criticised[106][107][108][109] 2011 paper by The Heritage Foundation research fellow Robert Rector, of the 43.6 million Americans deemed by the U.S. Census Bureau to be below the poverty level in 2009, the majority had adequate shelter, food, clothing and medical care. In addition, the paper stated that those assessed as below the poverty line in 2011 have a much higher quality of living than those who were identified by the census 40 years ago as being in poverty. For example, in 2005, 63.7% of those living in poverty had cable or satellite television. In some cases the report even said that people currently living in poverty were actually better off than middle class people of the recent past. For example, in 2005, 78.3% of households living in poverty had air conditioning, whereas in 1970, 36.0% of all households had air conditioning.[110][111]\\r\\nAccording to The Heritage Foundation, the federal poverty line also excludes income other than cash income, especially welfare benefits. Thus, if food stamps and public housing were successfully raising the standard of living for poverty stricken individuals, then the poverty line figures would not shift, since they do not consider the income equivalents of such entitlements.[112]\\r\\nA 1993 study of low income single mothers titled Making Ends Meet, by Kathryn Edin, a sociologist at the University of Pennsylvania, showed that the mothers spent more than their reported incomes because they could not \\"make ends meet\\" without such expenditures. According to Edin, they made up the difference through contributions from family members, absent boyfriends, off-the-book jobs, and church charity.\\r\\nAccording to Edin: \\"No one avoided the unnecessary expenditures, such as the occasional trip to the Dairy Queen, or a pair of stylish new sneakers for the son who might otherwise sell drugs to get them some money or something, or the Cable TV subscription for the kids home alone and you are afraid they will be out on the street if they are not watching TV.\\" However many mothers skipped meals or did odd jobs to cover those expenses. According to Edin, for \\"most welfare-reliant mothers food and shelter alone cost almost as much as these mothers received from the government. For more than one-third, food and housing costs exceeded their cash benefits, leaving no extra money for uncovered medical care, clothing, and other household expenses.\\"[113]\\r\\nIn the age of inequality, such anti-poverty policies are more important than ever, as higher inequality creates both more poverty along with steeper barriers to getting ahead, whether through the lack of early education, nutrition, adequate housing, and a host of other poverty-related conditions that dampen ones chances in life.\\r\\nThere have been many governmental and nongovernmental efforts to reduce poverty and its effects. These range in scope from neighborhood efforts to campaigns with a national focus. They target specific groups affected by poverty such as children, people who are autistic, immigrants, or people who are homeless. Efforts to alleviate poverty use a disparate set of methods, such as advocacy, education, social work, legislation, direct service or charity, and community organizing.\\r\\nRecent debates have centered on the need for policies that focus on both \\"income poverty\\" and \\"asset poverty.\\"[115] Advocates for the approach argue that traditional governmental poverty policies focus solely on supplementing the income of the poor through programs such as Aid to Families with Dependent Children (AFDC) and Food Stamps. According to the CFED 2012 Assets & Opportunity Scorecard, 27 percent of households ÿ nearly double the percentage that are income poor ÿ are living in \\"asset poverty.\\" These families do not have the savings or other assets to cover basic expenses (equivalent to what could be purchased with a poverty level income) for three months if a layoff or other emergency leads to loss of income. Since 2009, the number of asset poor families has increased by 21 percent from about one in five families to one in four families. In order to provide assistance to such asset poor families, Congress appropriated $24 million to administer the Assets for Independence Program under the supervision of the US Department for Health and Human Services. The program enables community-based nonprofits and government agencies to implement Individual Development Account or IDA programs, which are an asset-based development initiative. Every dollar accumulated in IDA savings is matched by federal and non-federal funds to enable households to add to their assets portfolio by buying their first home, acquiring a post-secondary education, or starting or expanding a small business.[116]\\r\\nAdditionally, the Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC or EIC) is a credit for people who earn low-to-moderate incomes. This credit allows them to get money from the government if their total tax outlay is less than the total credit earned, meaning it is not just a reduction in total tax paid but can also bring new income to the household. The Earned Income Tax Credit is viewed as the largest poverty reduction program in the United States. There is an ongoing debate in the U.S. about what the most effective way to fight poverty is, through the tax code with the EITC, or through the minimum wage laws.\\r\\nGovernment safety net programs put in place since the War on Poverty have helped reduce the poverty rate from 26% in 1967 to 16% in 2012, according to a Supplemental Poverty Model (SPM) created by Columbia University, while the official U.S. Poverty Rate has not changed, as the economy by itself has done little to reduce poverty. According to the 2013 Columbia University study which created the (SPM) method of measuring poverty, without such programs the poverty rate would be 29% today.[117] An analysis of the study by Kevin Drum suggests the American welfare state effectively reduces poverty among the elderly but provides relatively little assistance to the working-age poor.[118] A 2014 study by Pew Charitable Trusts shows that without social programs like food stamps, social security and the federal EITC, the poverty rate in the U.S. would be much higher.[119] Nevertheless, the U.S. has the weakest social safety net of all developed nations.[120][121][122] Sociologist Monica Prasad of Northwestern University argues that this developed because of government intervention rather than lack of it, which pushed consumer credit for meeting citizens' needs rather than applying social welfare policies as in Europe.[123]","input":"What is the poverty rate in the usa?"},{"output":"1 August 1973","context":"The Caribbean Community (CARICOM) is an organization of fifteen Caribbean nations and dependencies whose main objective is to promote economic integration and cooperation among its members, to ensure that the benefits of integration are equitably shared, and to coordinate foreign policy.[4] The organization was established in 1973.

The fourteen other heads of government sought to have Aristide fly from Africa to Jamaica and share his account of events with them, which infuriated the interim Haitian prime minister, Grard Latortue, who announced he would take steps to take Haiti out of CARICOM. CARICOM thus voted on suspending the participation of Haitian officials from the councils of CARICOM.[20] Following the presidential election of Ren Prval, Haitian officials were readmitted and Prval himself gave the opening address at the CARICOM Council of Ministers meeting in July.\\r\\n\\r\\nSince 2013 the CARICOM-bloc and with the Dominican Republic have been tied to the European Union via an Economic Partnership Agreements signed in 2008 known as CARIFORUM.[21]  The treaty grants all members of the European Union and CARIFORUM equal rights in terms of trade and investment. Under Article 234 of the agreement, the European Court of Justice handles dispute resolution between CARIFORUM and European Union states.[22]\\r\\n\\r\\nThousands of Caricom nationals live within other member states of the Community.\\r\\n\\r\\nAn estimated 30,000 Jamaicans legally reside in other CARICOM member states,[26] mainly in the Bahamas (5,600),[27] Antigua & Barbuda (estimated 12,000),[28] Barbados and Trinidad & Tobago).[26] Also, an estimated 150 Jamaicans live and work in Montserrat.[28] A November 21, 2013 estimated put 16,958 Jamaicans residing illegally in Trinidad & Tobago, as according to the records of the Office of the Chief Immigration Officer, their entry certificates would have since expired.[29] By October 2014, the estimated Jamaicans residing illegally in Trinidad and Tobago was 19,000 along with an estimated 7,169 Barbadians and 25,884 Guyanese residing illegally.[30] An estimated 8,000 Trinidadians and Tobagonians live in Jamaica.[31]\\r\\n\\r\\nBarbados hosts a large diaspora population of Guyanese, of whom (in 2005) 5,032 lived there permanently as citizens, permanent residents, immigrants (with immigrant status) and Caricom skilled nationals; 3,200 were residing in Barbados temporarily under work permits, as students, or with \\"reside and work\\" status. A further 2,000-3,000 Guyanese were estimated to be living illegally in Barbados at the time.[32] Migration between Barbados and Guyana has deep roots, going back over 150 years, with the most intense period of Barbadian migration to then-British Guiana occurring between 1863 and 1886, although as late as the 1920s and 1930s Barbadians were still leaving Barbados for British Guiana.[33]\\r\\n\\r\\nMigration between Guyana and Suriname also goes back a number of years. An estimated 50,000 Guyanese had migrated to Suriname by 1986[34][35] In 1987 an estimated 30-40,000 Guyanese were in Suriname.[36] Many Guyanese left Suriname in the 1970s and 1980s, either voluntarily by expulsion. Over 5,000 were expelled in January 1985 alone.[37] in the instability Suriname experienced following independence, both coups and civil war.[35] In 2013 an estimated 11,530 Guyanese had emigrated to Suriname and 4,662 Surinamese to Guyana.[38]\\r\\n\\r\\nCARICOM was instrumental in the formation of the Association of Caribbean States (ACS) on 24 July 1994. The original idea for the Association came from a recommendation of the West Indian Commission, established in 1989 by the CARICOM heads of state and government. The Commission advocated both deepening the integration process (through the CARICOM Single Market and Economy) and widening it through a separate regional organization encompassing all states in the Caribbean.[39]\\r\\n\\r\\nCARICOM accepted the commission's recommendations and opened dialogue with other Caribbean states, the Central American states and the Latin American nations of Colombia, Venezuela and Mexico which border the Caribbean, for consultation on the proposals of the West Indian Commission.[39]\\r\\n\\r\\nAt an October 1993 summit the heads of state and government of CARICOM and the presidents of the then-Group of Three (Colombia, Mexico and Venezuela) formally decided to create an association grouping all states of the Caribbean basin. A work schedule for its formation was adopted. The aim was to create the association in less than a year, an objective which was achieved with the formal creation of the ACS.[39]\\r\\n\\r\\nCARICOM was also involved in the formation of the Community of Latin American and Caribbean States (CELAC) on 3 December 2010. The idea for CELAC originated at the Rio GroupÿCaribbean Community Unity Summit on 23 February 2010 in Mexico.[40][41][42][43][44]\\r\\n\\r\\nSince 2013, the CARICOM-bloc and the Dominican Republic have been tied to the European Union via an Economic Partnership Agreements known as CARIFORUM signed in 2008.[21]  The treaty grants all members of the European Union and CARIFORUM equal rights in terms of trade and investment.  Within the agreement under Article 234, the European Court of Justice also carries dispute resolution mechanisms between CARIFORUM and the European Union states.[22]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn May 2016, Caricom's court of original jurisdiction, the CCJ, signed a  memorandum of understanding (MOU) with the ACP Legal Association based in Guadeloupe recognizing and supporting the goals of implementing a harmonized business law framework in the Caribbean through ACP Legal Association's OHADAC Project.[45]\\r\\n\\r\\nOHADAC is the acronym for the French \\"Organisation pour l'Harmonisation du Droit des Affaires en les Cara?bes\\", which translates into English as \\"Organisation for the Harmonization of Business Law in the Caribbean\\". The OHADAC Project takes inspiration from a similar organisation in Africa and aims to enhance economic integration across the entire Caribbean and facilitate increased trade and international investment through unified laws and alternative dispute resolution methods.[45]","input":"When did guyana became a member of caricom?"},{"output":"an anonymous Anglo-Saxon poet, referred to by scholars as the \\"Beowulf author\\"","context":"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nBeowulf (/?be??w?lf/;[2] Old English:?[?be?o?wulf]) is an Old English epic story consisting of 3,182 alliterative lines. It may be the oldest surviving long story in Old English and is commonly cited as one of the most important works of Old English literature. A date of composition is a matter of contention among scholars; the only certain dating pertains to the manuscript, which was produced between 975 and 1025.[3] The author was an anonymous Anglo-Saxon poet, referred to by scholars as the \\"Beowulf author\\".[4]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe story is set in Scandinavia. Beowulf, a hero of the Geats, comes to the aid of Hrothgar, the king of the Danes, whose mead hall in Heorot has been under attack by a monster known as Grendel. After Beowulf slays him, Grendel's mother attacks the hall and is then also defeated. Victorious, Beowulf goes home to Geatland (G?taland in modern Sweden) and later becomes king of the Geats. After a period of fifty years has passed, Beowulf defeats a dragon, but is mortally wounded in the battle. After his death, his attendants cremate his body and erect a tower on a headland in his memory.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe full story survives in the manuscript known as the Nowell Codex. It has no title in the original manuscript, but has become known by the name of the story's protagonist.[5] In 1731, the manuscript was badly damaged by a fire that swept through Ashburnham House in London that had a collection of medieval manuscripts assembled by Sir Robert Bruce Cotton.[6] The Nowell Codex is currently housed in the British Library.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe events in the poem take place over most of the sixth century, after the Anglo-Saxons had started migrating to England and before the beginning of the seventh century, a time when the Anglo-Saxons were either newly arrived or were still in close contact with their Germanic kinsmen in Northern Germany and southern Scandinavia. The poem may have been brought to England by people of Geatish origins.[7] Many suggest that Beowulf was first composed in the 7th century at Rendlesham in East Anglia, that the Sutton Hoo ship-burial also shows close connections with Scandinavia, and that the East Anglian royal dynasty, the Wuffingas, may have been descendants of the Geatish Wulfings.[8][9] Others have associated this poem with the court of King Alfred the Great or with the court of King Cnut the Great.[10]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe poem deals with legends, was composed for entertainment, and does not separate between fictional elements and historic events, such as the raid by King Hygelac into Frisia. Though Beowulf himself is not mentioned in any other Anglo-Saxon manuscript,[12] scholars generally agree that many of the other figures referred to in Beowulf also appear in Scandinavian sources. (Specific works are designated in the following section).[13] This concerns not only individuals (e.g., Healfdene, Hroegar, Halga, Hroeulf, Eadgils and Ohthere), but also clans (e.g., Scyldings, Scylfings and Wulfings) and certain events (e.g., the Battle on the Ice of Lake V?nern).\\r\\n\\r\\nIn Denmark, recent archaeological excavations at Lejre, where Scandinavian tradition located the seat of the Scyldings, i.e., Heorot, have revealed that a hall was built in the mid-6th century, exactly the time period of Beowulf.[14] Three halls, each about 50 metres (160?ft) long, were found during the excavation.[14]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe majority view appears to be that people such as King Hroegar and the Scyldings in Beowulf are based on historical people from 6th-century Scandinavia.[15] Like the Finnesburg Fragment and several shorter surviving poems, Beowulf has consequently been used as a source of information about Scandinavian figures such as Eadgils and Hygelac, and about continental Germanic figures such as Offa, king of the continental Angles.\\r\\n\\r\\n19th-century archaeological evidence may confirm elements of the Beowulf story. Eadgils was buried at Uppsala according to Snorri Sturluson. When the western mound (to the left in the photo) was excavated in 1874, the finds showed that a powerful man was buried in a large barrow, c. 575, on a bear skin with two dogs and rich grave offerings. The eastern mound was excavated in 1854, and contained the remains of a woman, or a woman and a young man. The middle barrow has not been excavated.[16][11]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe protagonist Beowulf, a hero of the Geats, comes to the aid of Hrothgar, king of the Danes, whose great hall, Heorot, is plagued by the monster Grendel. Beowulf kills Grendel with his bare hands and Grendel's mother with a giant's sword that he found in her lair.\\r\\n\\r\\nLater in his life, Beowulf becomes king of the Geats, and finds his realm terrorized by a dragon, some of whose treasure had been stolen from his hoard in a burial mound. He attacks the dragon with the help of his thegns or servants, but they do not succeed. Beowulf decides to follow the dragon to its lair at Earnan?s, but only his young Swedish relative Wiglaf, whose name means \\"remnant of valour\\",[a] dares to join him. Beowulf finally slays the dragon, but is mortally wounded in the struggle. He is cremated and a burial mound by the sea is erected in his honour.\\r\\n\\r\\nBeowulf is considered an epic poem in that the main character is a hero who travels great distances to prove his strength at impossible odds against supernatural demons and beasts. The poem also begins in medias res or simply, \\"in the middle of things,\\" which is a characteristic of the epics of antiquity. Although the poem begins with Beowulf's arrival, Grendel's attacks have been an ongoing event. An elaborate history of characters and their lineages is spoken of, as well as their interactions with each other, debts owed and repaid, and deeds of valour. The warriors form a kind of brotherhood linked by loyalty to their lord. What is unique about \\"Beowulf\\" is that the poem actually begins and ends with a funeral. At the beginning of the poem, the king, hero, Shield Shiefson dies (26ÿ45) and there is a huge funeral for him. At the end of the poem when Beowulf dies, there is also a massive funeral for Beowulf (3140ÿ3170).\\r\\n\\r\\nBeowulf begins with the story of Hrothgar, who constructed the great hall Heorot for himself and his warriors. In it, he, his wife Wealhtheow, and his warriors spend their time singing and celebrating. Grendel, a troll-like monster said to be descended from the biblical Cain, is pained by the sounds of joy.[19] Grendel attacks the hall and kills and devours many of Hrothgar's warriors while they sleep. Hrothgar and his people, helpless against Grendel, abandon Heorot.\\r\\n\\r\\nBeowulf, a young warrior from Geatland, hears of Hrothgar's troubles and with his king's permission leaves his homeland to assist Hrothgar.[20]\\r\\n\\r\\nBeowulf and his men spend the night in Heorot. Beowulf refuses to use any weapon because he holds himself to be the equal of Grendel.[21] When Grendel enters the hall, Beowulf, who has been feigning sleep, leaps up to clench Grendel's hand.[22] Grendel and Beowulf battle each other violently.[23] Beowulf's retainers draw their swords and rush to his aid, but their blades cannot pierce Grendel's skin.[24] Finally, Beowulf tears Grendel's arm from his body at the shoulder and Grendel runs to his home in the marshes where he dies.[25] Beowulf displays \\"the whole of Grendel's shoulder and arm, his awesome grasp\\" for all to see at Heorot. This display would fuel Grendel's mother's anger in revenge.[26]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe next night, after celebrating Grendel's defeat, Hrothgar and his men sleep in Heorot. Grendel's mother, angry that her son has been killed, sets out to get revenge. \\"Beowulf was elsewhere. Earlier, after the award of treasure, The Geat had been given another lodging\\"; his assistance would be absent in this battle.[27] Grendel's mother violently kills ?schere, who is Hrothgar's most loyal fighter, and escapes.\\r\\n\\r\\nHrothgar, Beowulf, and their men track Grendel's mother to her lair under a lake. Unferth, a warrior who had doubted him and wishes to make amends, presents Beowulf with his sword Hrunting. After stipulating a number of conditions to Hrothgar in case of his death (including the taking in of his kinsmen and the inheritance by Unferth of Beowulf's estate), Beowulf jumps into the lake, at the bottom of which he finds a cavern containing Grendel's body and the remains of men that the two have killed. Grendel's mother and Beowulf engage in fierce combat.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt first, Grendel's mother appears to prevail. Beowulf, finding that Hrunting cannot harm his foe, puts it aside in fury. Beowulf is again saved from his opponent's attack by his armour. Beowulf takes another sword from Grendel's mother and slices her head off with it. Travelling further into Grendel's mother's lair, Beowulf discovers Grendel's corpse and severs his head. The blade of Beowulf's sword touches Grendel's toxic blood, and instantly dissolves so that only the hilt remains. Beowulf swims back up to the rim of the pond where his men wait in growing despair.  Carrying the hilt of the sword and Grendel's head, he presents them to Hrothgar upon his return to Heorot.  Hrothgar gives Beowulf many gifts, including the sword N?gling, his family's heirloom. The events prompt a long reflection by the king, sometimes referred to as \\"Hrothgar's sermon\\", in which he urges Beowulf to be wary of pride and to reward his thegns.[28]\\r\\n\\r\\nBeowulf returns home and eventually becomes king of his own people. One day, fifty years after Beowulf's battle with Grendel's mother, a slave steals a golden cup from the lair of a dragon at Earnan?s. When the dragon sees that the cup has been stolen, it leaves its cave in a rage, burning everything in sight. Beowulf and his warriors come to fight the dragon, but Beowulf tells his men that he will fight the dragon alone and that they should wait on the barrow. Beowulf descends to do battle with the dragon, but finds himself outmatched. His men, upon seeing this and fearing for their lives, retreat into the woods. One of his men, Wiglaf, however, in great distress at Beowulf's plight, comes to his aid. The two slay the dragon, but Beowulf is mortally wounded. After Beowulf dies, Wiglaf remains by his side, grief-stricken. When the rest of the men finally return, Wiglaf bitterly admonishes them, blaming their cowardice for Beowulf's death. Afterward, Beowulf is ritually burned on a great pyre in Geatland while his people wail and mourn him, fearing that without him, the Geats are defenceless against attacks from surrounding tribes. Afterwards, a barrow, visible from the sea, is built in his memory (Beowulf lines 2712ÿ3182).[29]\\r\\n\\r\\nBeowulf was written in England, but is set in Scandinavia; its dating has attracted considerable scholarly attention. The poem has been dated to between the 8th and the early 11th centuries, with some recent scholarship offering what has been called \\"a cohesive and compelling case for Beowulf's early composition.\\"[30][31] However, opinion differs as to whether the composition of the poem is nearly contemporary with its transcription, whether it was first written in the 8th century, or if a proto-version of the poem was perhaps composed at an even earlier time (possibly as one of the Bear's Son Tales) and orally transmitted for many years, then transcribed in its present form at a later date. Albert Lord felt strongly that the manuscript represents the transcription of a performance, though likely taken at more than one sitting.[32] J. R. R. Tolkien believed that the poem retains too genuine a memory of Anglo-Saxon paganism to have been composed more than a few generations after the completion of the Christianisation of England around AD 700,[33] and Tolkien's conviction that the poem dates to the 8th century has been defended by Tom Shippey, Leonard Neidorf, Rafael J. Pascual, and R.D. Fulk, among others.[34][35][36]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe claim to an early 11th-century date depends in part on scholars who argue that, rather than the transcription of a tale from the oral tradition by an earlier literate monk, Beowulf reflects an original interpretation of an earlier version of the story by the manuscript's two scribes. On the other hand, some scholars argue that linguistic, palaeographical, metrical, and onomastic considerations align to support a date of composition in the first half of the eighth century;[31][37][38][39] in particular, the poem's regular observation of etymological length distinctions (Max Kaluza's law) has been thought to demonstrate a date of composition in the first half of the eighth century.[35][36] However, scholars disagree about whether the metrical phenomena described by Kaluza's Law prove an early date of composition or are evidence of a longer prehistory of the Beowulf meter;[40] B.R. Hutcheson, for instance, does not believe Kaluza's Law can be used to date the poem, while claiming that \\"the weight of all the evidence Fulk presents in his book[b] tells strongly in favour of an eighth-century date.\\"[41]\\r\\n\\r\\nBeowulf survives in a single manuscript dated on palaeographical grounds to the late 10th or early 11th century. The manuscript measures 245 G 185?mm.[42]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe poem is known only from a single manuscript, which is estimated to date from close to AD 1000, in which it appears with other works. The Beowulf manuscript is known as the Nowell Codex, gaining its name from 16th-century scholar Laurence Nowell. The official designation is \\"British Library, Cotton Vitellius A.XV\\" because it was one of Sir Robert Bruce Cotton's holdings in the Cotton library in the middle of the 17th century. Many private antiquarians and book collectors, such as Sir Robert Cotton, used their own library classification systems. \\"Cotton Vitellius A.XV\\" translates as: the 15th book from the left on shelf A (the top shelf) of the bookcase with the bust of Roman Emperor Vitellius standing on top of it, in Cotton's collection. Kevin Kiernan argues that Nowell most likely acquired it through William Cecil, 1st Baron Burghley, in 1563, when Nowell entered Cecil's household as a tutor to his ward, Edward de Vere, 17th Earl of Oxford.[43]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe earliest extant reference to the first foliation of the Nowell Codex was made sometime between 1628 and 1650 by Franciscus Junius (the younger).[44]:91 The ownership of the codex before Nowell remains a mystery.[44]:120\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Reverend Thomas Smith (1638ÿ1710) and Humfrey Wanley (1672ÿ1726) both catalogued the Cotton library (in which the Nowell Codex was held). Smith's catalogue appeared in 1696, and Wanley's in 1705.[45] The Beowulf manuscript itself is identified by name for the first time in an exchange of letters in 1700 between George Hickes, Wanley's assistant, and Wanley. In the letter to Wanley, Hickes responds to an apparent charge against Smith, made by Wanley, that Smith had failed to mention the Beowulf script when cataloguing Cotton MS. Vitellius A. XV. Hickes replies to Wanley \\"I can find nothing yet of Beowulph.\\"[46] Kiernan theorised that Smith failed to mention the Beowulf manuscript because of his reliance on previous catalogues or because either he had no idea how to describe it or because it was temporarily out of the codex.[47]\\r\\n\\r\\nIt suffered damage in the Cotton Library fire at Ashburnham House in 1731. Since then, parts of the manuscript have crumbled along with many of the letters. Rebinding efforts, though saving the manuscript from much degeneration, have nonetheless covered up other letters of the poem, causing further loss. Kevin Kiernan, in preparing his electronic edition of the manuscript, used fibre-optic backlighting and ultraviolet lighting to reveal letters in the manuscript lost from binding, erasure, or ink blotting.[48]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Beowulf manuscript was transcribed from an original by two scribes, one of whom wrote the prose at the beginning of the manuscript and the first 1939 lines before breaking off in mid sentence.  The first scribe made a point of carefully regularizing the spelling of the original document by using the common West Saxon language and by avoiding any archaic or dialectical features. The second scribe, who wrote the remainder, with a difference in handwriting noticeable after line 1939, seems to have written more vigorously and with less interest. As a result, the second scribe's script retains more archaic dialectic features which allow modern scholars to ascribe the poem a cultural context.[49] While both scribes appear to proofread their work, there are nevertheless many errors.[50] The second scribe was ultimately the more conservative copyist of the two as he did not modify the spelling of the text as he wrote but rather copied what he saw in front of him. In the way that it is currently bound, the Beowulf manuscript is followed by the Old English poem Judith. Judith was written by the same scribe that completed Beowulf as evidenced through similar writing style. Worm-holes found in the last leaves of the Beowulf manuscript that aren't present in the Judith manuscript suggest that at one point Beowulf ended the volume. The rubbed appearance of some leaves also suggest that the manuscript stood on a shelf unbound, as is known to have been the case with other Old English manuscripts.[49] From knowledge of books held in the library at Malmesbury Abbey and available as source works, and from the identification of certain words particular to the local dialect found in the text, the transcription may have taken place there.[51]\\r\\n\\r\\nIcelandic scholar Grmur J܇nsson Thorkelin made the first transcriptions of the manuscript in 1786 and published the results in 1815, working as part of a Danish government historical research commission. He made one himself, and had another done by a professional copyist who knew no Anglo-Saxon. Since that time, however, the manuscript has crumbled further, making these transcripts a prized witness to the text. While the recovery of at least 2000 letters can be attributed to them, their accuracy has been called into question,[c] and the extent to which the manuscript was actually more readable in Thorkelin's time is uncertain.\\r\\n\\r\\nA great number of translations and adaptations are available, in poetry and prose. Andy Orchard, in A Critical Companion to Beowulf, lists 33 \\"representative\\" translations in his bibliography,[53] while the Arizona Center for Medieval and Renaissance Studies published Marijane Osborn's annotated list of over 300 translations and adaptations in 2003.[54] Beowulf has been translated into at least 23 other languages.[55]\\r\\n\\r\\n19th century\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1805, the historian Sharon Turner translated selected verses into modern English.[56] This was followed in 1814 by John Josias Conybeare who published an edition \\"in English paraphrase and Latin verse translation.\\"[56] In 1815, Grmur J܇nsson Thorkelin published the first complete edition in Latin.[56] N. F. S. Grundtvig reviewed this edition in 1815 and created the first complete verse translation in Danish in 1820.[56] In 1837, John Mitchell Kemble created an important literal translation in English.[56] In 1895, William Morris & A. J. Wyatt published the ninth English translation.[56] Many retellings of Beowulf for children began appearing in the 20th century.[57]\\r\\n\\r\\n20th century\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1909, Francis Barton Gummere's full translation in \\"English imitative meter\\" was published,[56] and was used as the text of Gareth Hinds's graphic novel based on Beowulf in 2007.\\r\\n\\r\\nFirst published in 1928, Frederick Klaeber's Beowulf and The Fight at Finnsburg[58] (which included the poem in Old English, an extensive glossary of Old English terms, and general background information) became the \\"central source used by graduate students for the study of the poem and by scholars and teachers as the basis of their translations.\\"[59]\\r\\n\\r\\nFollowing research in the King's College London Archives, Carl Kears proposed that John Porter's translation, published in 1975 by Bill Griffiths' Pirate Press, was the first complete verse translation of the poem entirely accompanied by facing-page Old English.[60]\\r\\n\\r\\nSeamus Heaney's 1999 translation of the poem (referred to by Howell Chickering and many others as \\"Heaneywulf\\"[61]) was widely publicized.\\r\\n\\r\\n21st century\\r\\n\\r\\nR. D. Fulk, of Indiana University, published the first facing-page edition and translation of the entire Nowell Codex manuscript in the Dumbarton Oaks Medieval Library series in 2010.[62]\\r\\n\\r\\nTranslating Beowulf is one of the subjects of the 2012 publication Beowulf at Kalamazoo, containing a section with 10 essays on translation, and a section with 22 reviews of Heaney's translation (some of which compare Heaney's work with that of Anglo-Saxon scholar Roy Liuzza).[63]\\r\\n\\r\\nJ. R. R. Tolkien's long-awaited translation (edited by his son, Christopher) was published in 2014 as Beowulf: A Translation and Commentary.[64][65] This also includes Tolkien's own retelling of the story of Beowulf in his tale, Sellic Spell.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe question of whether Beowulf was passed down through oral tradition prior to its present manuscript form has been the subject of much debate, and involves more than simply the issue of its composition. Rather, given the implications of the theory of oral-formulaic composition and oral tradition, the question concerns how the poem is to be understood, and what sorts of interpretations are legitimate.\\r\\n\\r\\nScholarly discussion about Beowulf in the context of the oral tradition was extremely active throughout the 1960s and 1970s. The debate might be framed starkly as follows: on the one hand, we can hypothesise a poem put together from various tales concerning the hero (the Grendel episode, the Grendel's mother story, and the fire drake narrative). These fragments would have been told for many years in tradition, and learned by apprenticeship from one generation of illiterate poets to the next. The poem is composed orally and extemporaneously, and the archive of tradition on which it draws is oral, pagan, Germanic, heroic, and tribal. On the other hand, one might posit a poem which is composed by a literate scribe, who acquired literacy by way of learning Latin (and absorbing Latinate culture and ways of thinking), probably a monk and therefore profoundly Christian in outlook. On this view, the pagan references would be a sort of decorative archaising.[66][67] There is a third view that sees merit in both arguments above and attempts to bridge them, and so cannot be articulated as starkly as they can; it sees more than one Christianity and more than one attitude towards paganism at work in the poem; it sees the poem as initially the product of a literate Christian author with one foot in the pagan world and one in the Christian, himself perhaps a convert (or one whose forebears had been pagan), a poet who was conversant in both oral and literary composition and was capable of a masterful \\"repurposing\\" of poetry from the oral tradition.\\r\\n\\r\\nHowever, scholars such as D.K. Crowne have proposed the idea that the poem was passed down from reciter to reciter under the theory of oral-formulaic composition, which hypothesises that epic poems were (at least to some extent) improvised by whoever was reciting them, and only much later written down. In his landmark work, The Singer of Tales, Albert Lord refers to the work of Francis Peabody Magoun and others, saying \\"the documentation is complete, thorough, and accurate. This exhaustive analysis is in itself sufficient to prove that Beowulf was composed orally.\\"[68]\\r\\n\\r\\nExamination of Beowulf and other Old English literature for evidence of oral-formulaic composition has met with mixed response. While \\"themes\\" (inherited narrative subunits for representing familiar classes of event, such as the \\"arming the hero\\",[69] or the particularly well-studied \\"hero on the beach\\" theme[70]) do exist across Anglo-Saxon and other Germanic works, some scholars conclude that Anglo-Saxon poetry is a mix of oral-formulaic and literate patterns, arguing that the poems both were composed on a word-by-word basis and followed larger formulae and patterns.[71]\\r\\n\\r\\nLarry Benson argued that the interpretation of Beowulf as an entirely formulaic work diminishes the ability of the reader to analyse the poem in a unified manner, and with due attention to the poet's creativity. Instead, he proposed that other pieces of Germanic literature contain \\"kernels of tradition\\" from which Beowulf borrows and expands upon.[72][73] A few years later, Ann Watts argued against the imperfect application of one theory to two different traditions: traditional, Homeric, oral-formulaic poetry and Anglo-Saxon poetry.[73][74] Thomas Gardner agreed with Watts, arguing that the Beowulf text is of too varied a nature to be completely constructed from set formulae and themes.[73][75]\\r\\n\\r\\nJohn Miles Foley wrote, referring to the Beowulf debate,[76] that while comparative work was both necessary and valid, it must be conducted with a view to the particularities of a given tradition; Foley argued with a view to developments of oral traditional theory that do not assume, or depend upon, ultimately unverifiable assumptions about composition, and instead delineate a more fluid continuum of traditionality and textuality.[77][78][79][69]\\r\\n\\r\\nFinally, in the view of Ursula Schaefer, the question of whether the poem was \\"oral\\" or \\"literate\\" becomes something of a red herring.[80] In this model, the poem is created, and is interpretable, within both noetic horizons. Schaefer's concept of \\"vocality\\" offers neither a compromise nor a synthesis of the views which see the poem as on the one hand Germanic, pagan, and oral and on the other Latin-derived, Christian, and literate, but, as stated by Monika Otter: \\"...?a 'tertium quid', a modality that participates in both oral and literate culture yet also has a logic and aesthetic of its own.\\"[81]\\r\\n\\r\\nNeither identified sources nor analogues for Beowulf can be definitively proven, but many conjectures have been made. These are important in helping historians understand the Beowulf manuscript, as possible source-texts or influences would suggest time-frames of composition, geographic boundaries within which it could be composed, or range (both spatial and temporal) of influence (i.e. when it was \\"popular\\" and where its \\"popularity\\" took it).\\r\\n\\r\\nThere are Scandinavian sources, international folkloric sources, and Celtic sources.[d][82]\\r\\n\\r\\n19th century studies proposed that Beowulf was translated from a lost original Scandinavian work, but this idea was quickly abandoned. But Scandinavian works have continued to be studied as a possible source.[83] Proponents included Gregor Sarrazin?(de) writing in 1886 that an Old Norse original version of Beowulf must have existed,[84] but that view was later debunked by Carl Wilhelm von Sydow?(de) (1914) who pointed out that Beowulf is fundamentally Christian and written at a time when any Norse tale would have most likely been pagan.[85]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe epic's possible connection to Grettis saga was made early on by Guebrandur Vigf~sson (1878).[86]\\r\\n\\r\\nGrettis saga is a family saga, and a story about Grettir smundarson?(is), a great-grandson of an Icelandic settler, cannot be comparably as old as Beowulf. Axel Olrik (1903) claimed that on the contrary, this saga was a reworking of Beowulf, and others had followed suit.[84]\\r\\n\\r\\nHowever, Friedrich Panzer?(de) (1910) wrote a thesis in which both Beowulf and Grettis saga drew from a common folkloric source, and this encouraged even a detractor such W. W. Lawrence to reposition his view, and entertain the possibility that certain elements in the saga (such as the waterfall in place of the mere) retained an older form.[84]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe viability of this connection has enjoyed enduring support, and was characterized as one of the few Scandinavian analogues to receive a general consensus of potential connection by Theodore M. Andersson?(de) (1998).[87] But that same year, Magn~s Fjalldal published a volume challenging the perception that there is a close parallel, and that tangential similarities were being overemphasized as analogies.[88]\\r\\n\\r\\nAnother candidate for a cogener analogue or possible source is the story of Hrolf kraki and his servant, the legendary bear-shapeshifter Bodvar Bjarki. The story survives in Old Norse Hr܇lfs saga kraka and Saxo's Gesta Danorum. Hrolf kraki, one of the Skj?ldungs, even appears as \\"Hrothulf\\" in the Anglo-Saxon epic. Hence a story about him and his followers may have developed as early as the 6th century.[89]\\r\\n\\r\\nFriedrich Panzer (1910) wrote a thesis that the first part of Beowulf (the Grendel Story) incorporated preexisting folktale material, and that the folktale in question was of the Bear's Son Tale (B?rensohnm?rchen) type, which has surviving examples all over the world.[90][84]\\r\\n\\r\\nThis tale type was later catalogued as international folktale type 301, now formally entitled \\"The Three Stolen Princesses\\" type in Hans Uther's catalogue, although the \\"Bear's Son\\" is still used in Beowulf criticism, if not so much in folkloristic circles.[84]\\r\\n\\r\\nHowever, although this folkloristic approach was seen as a step in the right direction, \\"The Bear's Son\\" tale has later been regarded by many as not a close enough parallel to be a viable choice.[91] Later, Peter J?rgensen, looking for a more concise frame of reference, coined a \\"two-troll tradition\\" that covers both Beowulf and Grettis saga: \\"a Norse 'ecotype' in which a hero enters a cave and kills two giants, usually of different sexes\\";[92] which has emerged as a more attractive folk tale parallel, according to a 1998 assessment by Andersson?(Andersson|de).[93][94]\\r\\n\\r\\nSimilarity of the epic to the Irish folktale \\"The Hand and the Child\\" had already been noted by Albert S. Cook (1899), and others even earlier,[e][95][85][f] Swedish folklorist Carl Wilhelm von Sydow?(de) (1914) then made a strong argument for the case of parallelism in \\"The Hand and the Child\\", because the folktale type demonstrated a \\"monstrous arm\\" motif that corresponded with Beowulf wrenching off Grendel's arm. For no such correspondence could be perceived in the Bear's Son Tale or Grettis saga.[g][96][95]\\r\\n\\r\\nJames Carney and Martin Puhvel also agree with this \\"Hand and the Child\\" contextualisation.[h] Puhvel supported the \\"Hand and the Child\\" theory through such motifs as (in Andersson's words) \\"the more powerful giant mother, the mysterious light in the cave, the melting of the sword in blood, the phenomenon of battle rage, swimming prowess, combat with water monsters, underwater adventures, and the bear-hug style of wrestling.\\"[97]\\r\\n\\r\\nAttempts to find classical or Late Latin influence or analogue in Beowulf are almost exclusively linked with Homer's Odyssey or Virgil's Aeneid. In 1926, Albert S. Cook suggested a Homeric connection due to equivalent formulas, metonymies, and analogous voyages.[98] In 1930, James A. Work also supported the Homeric influence, stating that encounter between Beowulf and Unferth was parallel to the encounter between Odysseus and Euryalus in Books 7ÿ8 of the Odyssey, even to the point of both characters giving the hero the same gift of a sword upon being proven wrong in their initial assessment of the hero's prowess. This theory of Homer's influence on Beowulf remained very prevalent in the 1920s, but started to die out in the following decade when a handful of critics stated that the two works were merely \\"comparative literature\\",[99] although Greek was known in late 7th century England: Bede states that Theodore of Tarsus, a Greek, was appointed Archbishop of Canterbury in 668, and he taught Greek. Several English scholars and churchmen are described by Bede as being fluent in Greek due to being taught by him; Bede claims to be fluent in Greek himself.[100]\\r\\n\\r\\nFrederick Klaeber, among others, argued for a connection between Beowulf and Virgil near the start of the 20th century, claiming that the very act of writing a secular epic in a Germanic world represents Virgilian influence. Virgil was seen as the pinnacle of Latin literature, and Latin was the dominant literary language of England at the time, therefore making Virgilian influence highly likely.[101] Similarly, in 1971, Alistair Campbell stated that the apologue technique used in Beowulf is so rare in epic poetry aside from Virgil that the poet who composed Beowulf could not have written the poem in such a manner without first coming across Virgil's writings.[102]\\r\\n\\r\\nIt cannot be denied that Biblical parallels occur in the text, whether seen as a pagan work with \\"Christian colouring\\" added by scribes or as a \\"Christian historical novel, with selected bits of paganism deliberately laid on as 'local colour',\\" as Margaret E. Goldsmith did in \\"The Christian Theme of Beowulf,\\".[103] Beowulf channels the Book of Genesis, the Book of Exodus, and the Book of Daniel[104] in its inclusion of references to the Genesis creation narrative, the story of Cain and Abel, Noah and the flood, the Devil, Hell, and the Last Judgment.[103]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe poem mixes the West Saxon and Anglian dialects of Old English, though it predominantly uses West Saxon, as do other Old English poems copied at the time.[105]\\r\\n\\r\\nThere is a wide array of linguistic forms in the Beowulf manuscript. It is this fact that leads some scholars to believe that Beowulf has endured a long and complicated transmission through all the main dialect areas.[106] The poem retains a complicated mix of the following dialectical forms: Mercian, Northumbrian, Early West Saxon, Kentish and Late West Saxon.[44]:20ÿ21 There are in Beowulf more than 3100 distinct words, and almost 1300 occur exclusively, or almost exclusively, in this poem and in the other poetical texts. Considerably more than one-third of the total vocabulary is alien from ordinary prose use. There are, in round numbers, three hundred and sixty uncompounded verbs in Beowulf, and forty of them are poetical words in the sense that they are unrecorded or rare in the existing prose writings. One hundred and fifty more occur with the prefix ge- (reckoning a few found only in the past-participle), but of these one hundred occur also as simple verbs, and the prefix is employed to render a shade of meaning which was perfectly known and thoroughly familiar except in the latest Anglo-Saxon period. The nouns number sixteen hundred. Seven hundred of them, including those formed with prefixes, of which fifty (or considerably more than half) have ge-, are simple nouns, at the highest reckoning not more than one-quarter is absent in prose. That this is due in some degree to accident is clear from the character of the words, and from the fact that several reappear and are common after the Norman Conquest.[107]\\r\\n\\r\\nAn Old English poem such as Beowulf is very different from modern poetry. Anglo-Saxon poets typically used alliterative verse, a form of verse in which the first half of the line (the a-verse) is linked to the second half (the b-verse) through similarity in initial sound. In addition, the two halves are divided by a caesura: \\"Oft Scyld Scefing \\\\\\\\ sceatena treatum\\" (l. 4). This verse form maps stressed and unstressed syllables onto abstract entities known as metrical positions. There is no fixed number of beats per line: the first one cited has three (Oft SCYLD SCEFING, with ictus on the suffix -ING) whereas the second has two (SCEAtena TREATum).\\r\\n\\r\\nThe poet has a choice of epithets or formulae to use in order to fulfil the alliteration. When speaking or reading Old English poetry, it is important to remember for alliterative purposes that many of the letters are not pronounced in the same way as in modern English. The letter ?h?, for example, is always pronounced (Hroegar: [?hroegar]), and the digraph ?cg? is pronounced [d?], as in the word edge. Both ?f? and ?s? vary in pronunciation depending on their phonetic environment. Between vowels or voiced consonants, they are voiced, sounding like modern ?v? and ?z?, respectively. Otherwise they are unvoiced, like modern ?f? in fat and ?s? in sat. Some letters which are no longer found in modern English, such as thorn, ?t?, and eth, ?e? ÿ representing both pronunciations of modern English ?th?, as /Ĳ/ in thing and /e/ this ÿ are used extensively both in the original manuscript and in modern English editions. The voicing of these characters echoes that of ?f? and ?s?. Both are voiced (as in this) between other voiced sounds: oeer, latleas, sutern. Otherwise they are unvoiced (as in thing): tunor, sue, sotf?st.\\r\\n\\r\\nKennings are also a significant technique in Beowulf. They are evocative poetic descriptions of everyday things, often created to fill the alliterative requirements of the metre. For example, a poet might call the sea the \\"swan-road\\" or the \\"whale-road\\"; a king might be called a \\"ring-giver.\\" There are many kennings in Beowulf, and the device is typical of much of classic poetry in Old English, which is heavily formulaic. The poem also makes extensive use of elided metaphors.[108]\\r\\n\\r\\nJ. R. R. Tolkien argued in Beowulf: The Monsters and the Critics that the poem is not an epic, and while no conventional term exactly fits, the nearest would be elegy.[109]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe history of modern Beowulf criticism is often said to begin with J. R. R. Tolkien,[110] author and Merton professor of Anglo-Saxon at University of Oxford, who in his 1936 lecture to the British Academy criticised his contemporaries' excessive interest in its historical implications.[111][citation not found] He noted in Beowulf: The Monsters and the Critics that as a result the poem's literary value had been largely overlooked and argued that the poem \\"is in fact so interesting as poetry, in places poetry so powerful, that this quite overshadows the historical content...\\"[112]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn historical terms, the poem's characters would have been Norse pagans (the historical events of the poem took place before the Christianisation of Scandinavia), yet the poem was recorded by Christian Anglo-Saxons who had mostly converted from their native Anglo-Saxon paganism around the 7th century ÿ both Anglo-Saxon paganism and Norse paganism share a common origin as both are forms of Germanic paganism. Beowulf thus depicts a Germanic warrior society, in which the relationship between the lord of the region and those who served under him was of paramount importance.[113]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn terms of the relationship between characters in Beowulf to God, one might recall the substantial amount of paganism that is present throughout the work. Literary critics such as Fred C. Robinson argue that the Beowulf poet arguably tries to send a message to readers during the Anglo-Saxon time period regarding the state of Christianity in their own time. Robinson argues that the intensified religious aspects of the Anglo-Saxon period inherently shape the way in which the Poet alludes to paganism as presented in Beowulf. The Poet arguably calls on Anglo-Saxon readers to recognize the imperfect aspects of their supposed Christian lifestyles. In other words, the Poet is referencing their \\"Anglo-Saxon Heathenism.\\" In terms of the characters of the epic itself, Robinson argues that readers are \\"impressed\\" by the courageous acts of Beowulf and the speeches of Hrothgar (181). But one is ultimately left to feel sorry for both men as they are fully detached from supposed \\"Christian truth\\" (181). The relationship between the characters of Beowulf, and the overall message of the Poet, regarding their relationship with God is largely debated among readers and literary critics alike.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt the same time, Richard North argues that the Beowulf poet interpreted \\"Danish myths in Christian form\\" (as the poem would have served as a form of entertainment for a Christian audience), and states: \\"As yet we are no closer to finding out why the first audience of Beowulf liked to hear stories about people routinely classified as damned. This question is pressing, given... that Anglo-Saxons saw the Danes as 'heathens' rather than as foreigners.\\"[114] Grendel's mother and Grendel are described as descendants of Cain, a fact which some scholars link to the Cain tradition.[115]\\r\\n\\r\\nOther scholars disagree, however, as to the meaning and nature of the poem: is it a Christian work set in a Germanic pagan context? The question suggests that the conversion from the Germanic pagan beliefs to Christian ones was a prolonged and gradual process over several centuries, and it remains unclear the ultimate nature of the poem's message in respect to religious belief at the time it was written. Robert F. Yeager notes the facts that form the basis for these questions:\\r\\n\\r\\nThat the scribes of Cotton Vitellius A.XV were Christian beyond doubt, and it is equally sure that Beowulf was composed in a Christianised England since conversion took place in the sixth and seventh centuries. The only Biblical references in Beowulf are to the Old Testament, and Christ is never mentioned. The poem is set in pagan times, and none of the characters is demonstrably Christian. In fact, when we are told what anyone in the poem believes, we learn that they are pagans. Beowulf's own beliefs are not expressed explicitly. He offers eloquent prayers to a higher power, addressing himself to the \\"Father Almighty\\" or the \\"Wielder of All.\\" Were those the prayers of a pagan who used phrases the Christians subsequently appropriated? Or, did the poem's author intend to see Beowulf as a Christian Ur-hero, symbolically refulgent with Christian virtues?[116]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe location of the composition of the poem is also intensely disputed. In 1914, F.W. Moorman, the first professor of English Language at University of Leeds, claimed that Beowulf was composed in Yorkshire,[117] but E. Talbot Donaldson claims that it was probably composed more than twelve hundred years ago, during the first half of the eighth century, and that the writer was a native of what was then called West Mercia, located in the Western Midlands of England. However, the late tenth-century manuscript \\"which alone preserves the poem\\" originated in the kingdom of the West Saxons ÿ as it is more commonly known.[118] Donaldson wrote that \\"the poet who put the materials into their present form was a Christian and?... poem reflects a Christian tradition\\".[119]\\r\\n\\r\\nStanley B. Greenfield has suggested that references to the human body throughout Beowulf emphasise the relative position of thanes to their lord. He argues that the term \\"shoulder-companion\\" could refer to both a physical arm as well as a thane (Aeschere) who was very valuable to his lord (Hrothgar). With Aeschere's death, Hrothgar turns to Beowulf as his new \\"arm.\\"[120] Also, Greenfield argues the foot is used for the opposite effect, only appearing four times in the poem. It is used in conjunction with Unfere (a man described by Beowulf as weak, traitorous, and cowardly). Greenfield notes that Unfere is described as \\"at the king's feet\\" (line 499). Unfere is also a member of the foot troops, who, throughout the story, do nothing and \\"generally serve as backdrops for more heroic action.\\"[121]\\r\\n\\r\\nDaniel Podgorski has argued that the work is best understood as an examination of inter-generational vengeance-based conflict, or feuding.[122] In this context, the poem operates as an indictment of feuding conflicts as a function of its conspicuous, circuitous, and lengthy depiction of the Geatish-Swedish warscoming into contrast with the poem's depiction of the protagonist Beowulf as being disassociated from the ongoing feuds in every way.[122]","input":"Who transcribed (wrote down) the earliest known manuscript of beowulf?"},{"output":"The First Battle of Bull Run","context":"Political leaders:\\r\\nMilitary commanders:\\r\\nPolitical leaders:\\r\\nMilitary commanders:\\r\\nDepartment of Northeastern Virginia:\\r\\nDepartment of Pennsylvania:\\r\\nArmy of Northeastern Virginia:\\r\\nPatterson's Command:\\r\\nThe First Battle of Bull Run (the name used by Union forces), also known as the First Battle of Manassas[1] (the name used by Confederate forces), was fought on July 21, 1861 in Prince William County, Virginia, just north of the city of Manassas and about 25 miles west-southwest of Washington, D.C. It was the first major battle of the American Civil War. The Union's forces were slow in positioning themselves, allowing Confederate reinforcements time to arrive by rail. Each side had about 18,000 poorly trained and poorly led troops in their first battle. It was a Confederate victory, followed by a disorganized retreat of the Union forces.\\r\\nJust months after the start of the war at Fort Sumter, the Northern public clamored for a march against the Confederate capital of Richmond, Virginia, which was expected to bring an early end to the rebellion. Yielding to political pressure, Brig. Gen. Irvin McDowell led his unseasoned Union Army across Bull Run against the equally inexperienced Confederate Army of Brig. Gen. P. G. T. Beauregard camped near Manassas Junction. McDowell's ambitious plan for a surprise flank attack on the Confederate left was poorly executed by his officers and men; nevertheless, the Confederates, who had been planning to attack the Union left flank, found themselves at an initial disadvantage.\\r\\nConfederate reinforcements under Brig. Gen. Joseph E. Johnston arrived from the Shenandoah Valley by railroad, and the course of the battle quickly changed. A brigade of Virginians under the relatively unknown brigadier general from the Virginia Military Institute, Thomas J. Jackson, stood its ground, which resulted in Jackson receiving his famous nickname, \\"Stonewall\\". The Confederates launched a strong counterattack, and as the Union troops began withdrawing under fire, many panicked and the retreat turned into a rout. McDowell's men frantically ran without order in the direction of Washington, D.C.\\r\\nBoth armies were sobered by the fierce fighting and many casualties, and realized that the war was going to be much longer and bloodier than either had anticipated. The Battle of First Bull Run highlighted many of the problems and deficiencies that were typical of the first year of the war. Units were committed piecemeal, attacks were frontal, infantry failed to protect exposed artillery, tactical intelligence was nil, and neither commander was able to employ his whole force effectively. McDowell, with 35,000 men, was only able to commit about 18,000, and the combined Confederate forces, with about 32,000 men, committed only 18,000.[12]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nPres.\\r\\nAbraham Lincoln,\\r\\nUSA\\r\\nPres.\\r\\nJefferson Davis,\\r\\nCSA\\r\\nOn April 15, 1861, the day after South Carolina military forces attacked and captured Fort Sumter in Charleston Harbor, President Abraham Lincoln issued a proclamation declaring an insurrection against the laws of the United States. Earlier, South Carolina and seven other Southern states had declared their secession from the Union and formed the Confederate States of America.\\r\\nTo suppress the rebellion and restore Federal law in the Southern states, Lincoln called for 75,000 volunteers with ninety-day enlistments to augment the existing U.S. Army of about 15,000. He later accepted an additional 40,000 volunteers with three-year enlistments and increased the strength of the U.S. Army to almost 20,000. Lincoln's actions caused four more Southern states, including Virginia, to secede and join the Confederacy, and by 1 June the Confederate capital had been moved from Montgomery, Alabama, to Richmond, Virginia.\\r\\nIn Washington, D.C., as thousands of volunteers rushed to defend the capital, General in Chief Lt. Gen. Winfield Scott laid out his strategy to subdue the rebellious states. He proposed that an army of 80,000 men be organized and sail down the Mississippi River and capture New Orleans. While the Army \\"strangled\\" the Confederacy in the west, the U.S. Navy would blockade Southern ports along the eastern and Gulf coasts. The press ridiculed what they dubbed as Scott's \\"Anaconda Plan\\". Instead, many believed the capture of the Confederate capital at Richmond, only one hundred miles south of Washington, would quickly end the war.[13] By July 1861 thousands of volunteers were camped in and around Washington. Since General Scott was seventy-five years old and physically unable to lead this force, the administration searched for a more suitable field commander.[14]\\r\\nSecretary of the Treasury Salmon P. Chase championed fellow Ohioan, 42-year-old Maj. Irvin McDowell. Although McDowell was a West Point graduate, his command experience was limited. In fact, he had spent most of his career engaged in various staff duties in the Adjutant General's Office. While stationed in Washington he had become acquainted with Chase, a former Ohio governor and senator. Now, through Chase's influence, McDowell was promoted three grades to brigadier general in the Regular Army and on 27 May was assigned command (by President Abraham Lincoln) of the Department of Northeastern Virginia, which included the military forces in and around Washington (Army of Northeastern Virginia).[15] McDowell immediately began organizing what became known as the Army of Northeastern Virginia, 35,000 men arranged in five divisions. Under public and political pressure to begin offensive operations, McDowell was given very little time to train the newly inducted troops. Units were instructed in the maneuvering of regiments, but they received little or no training at the brigade or division level. He was reassured by President Lincoln, \\"You are green, it is true, but they are green also; you are all green alike.\\"[16] Against his better judgment, McDowell commenced campaigning.\\r\\nDuring the previous year, U.S. Army captain Thomas Jordan set up a pro-Southern spy network in Washington City, including Rose O'Neal Greenhow, a prominent socialite with a wide range of contacts.[17] He provided her with a code for messages.[18] After he left to join the Confederate Army, he gave her control of his network but continued to receive reports from her.[17] On July 9 and 16, 1861, Greenhow passed secret messages to Confederate General P.G.T. Beauregard containing critical information regarding military movements for what would be the First Battle of Bull Run, including the plans of Union general McDowell.[18][19]\\r\\nOn July 16, 1861, McDowell departed Washington with the largest field army yet gathered on the North American continent, about 35,000 men (28,452 effectives).[6] McDowell's plan was to move westward in three columns and make a diversionary attack on the Confederate line at Bull Run with two columns, while the third column moved around the Confederates' right flank to the south, cutting the railroad to Richmond and threatening the rear of the Confederate army. He assumed that the Confederates would be forced to abandon Manassas Junction and fall back to the Rappahannock River, the next defensible line in Virginia, which would relieve some of the pressure on the U.S. capital.[20] McDowell had hoped to have his army at Centreville by 17 July, but the troops, unaccustomed to marching, moved in starts and stops. Along the route soldiers often broke ranks to wander off to pick apples or blackberries or to get water, regardless of the orders of their officers to remain in ranks.[21]\\r\\nThe Confederate Army of the Potomac (21,883 effectives)[22] under Beauregard was encamped near Manassas Junction, approximately 25 miles (40?km) from the United States capital. McDowell planned to attack this numerically inferior enemy army. Union Maj. Gen. Robert Patterson's 18,000 men engaged Johnston's force (the Army of the Shenandoah at 8,884 effectives, augmented by Maj. Gen. Theophilus H. Holmes's brigade of 1,465[22]) in the Shenandoah Valley, preventing them from reinforcing Beauregard.\\r\\nAfter two days of marching slowly in the sweltering heat, the Union army was allowed to rest in Centreville. McDowell reduced the size of his army to approximately 31,000 by dispatching Brig. Gen. Theodore Runyon with 5,000 troops to protect the army's rear. In the meantime, McDowell searched for a way to outflank Beauregard, who had drawn up his lines along Bull Run. On July 18, the Union commander sent a division under Brig. Gen. Daniel Tyler to pass on the Confederate right (southeast) flank. Tyler was drawn into a skirmish at Blackburn's Ford over Bull Run and made no headway. Also on the morning of 18 July Johnston had received a telegram suggesting he go to Beauregard's assistance if possible. Johnston marched out of Winchester about noon, while Stuart's cavalry screened the movement from Patterson. Patterson was completely deceived. One hour after Johnston's departure Patterson telegraphed Washington, \\"I have succeeded, in accordance with the wishes of the General-in-Chief, in keeping General Johnston's force at Winchester.\\"[23]\\r\\nFor the maneuver to be successful McDowell felt he needed to act quickly. He had already begun to hear rumors that Johnston had slipped out of the valley and was headed for Manassas Junction. If the rumors were true, McDowell might soon be facing 34,000 Confederates, instead of 22,000. Another reason for quick action was McDowell's concern that the ninety-day enlistments of many of his regiments were about to expire. \\"In a few days I will lose many thousands of the best of this force\\", he wrote Washington on the eve of battle. In fact, the next morning two units of McDowell's command, their enlistments expiring that day, would turn a deaf ear to McDowell's appeal to stay a few days longer. Instead, to the sounds of battle, they would march back to Washington to be mustered out of service.[24]\\r\\nBecoming more frustrated, McDowell resolved to attack the Confederate left (northwest) flank instead. He planned to attack with Brig. Gen. Daniel Tyler's division at the Stone Bridge on the Warrenton Turnpike and send the divisions of Brig. Gens. David Hunter and Samuel P. Heintzelman over Sudley Springs Ford. From here, these divisions could march into the Confederate rear. The brigade of Col. Israel B. Richardson (Tyler's Division) would harass the enemy at Blackburn's Ford, preventing them from thwarting the main attack. Patterson would tie down Johnston in the Shenandoah Valley so that reinforcements could not reach the area. Although McDowell had arrived at a theoretically sound plan, it had a number of flaws: it was one that required synchronized execution of troop movements and attacks, skills that had not been developed in the nascent army; it relied on actions by Patterson that he had already failed to take; finally, McDowell had delayed long enough that Johnston's Valley force was able to board trains at Piedmont Station and rush to Manassas Junction to reinforce Beauregard's men.[25]\\r\\nOn July 19ÿ20, significant reinforcements bolstered the Confederate lines behind Bull Run. Johnston arrived with all of his army, except for the troops of Brig. Gen. Kirby Smith, who were still in transit. Most of the new arrivals were posted in the vicinity of Blackburn's Ford, and Beauregard's plan was to attack from there to the north toward Centreville. Johnston, the senior officer, approved the plan. If both of the armies had been able to execute their plans simultaneously, it would have resulted in a mutual counterclockwise movement as they attacked each other's left flank.[26]\\r\\nMcDowell was getting contradictory information from his intelligence agents, so he called for the balloon Enterprise, which was being demonstrated by Prof. Thaddeus S. C. Lowe in Washington, to perform aerial reconnaissance.\\r\\nBrig. Gen.\\r\\nIrvin McDowell, Army of Northeastern Virginia, (Commanding), USA\\r\\nBrig.

Johnston's forces was organized as follows:\\r\\nAbstract front field return, First Corps (Army of the Potomac), July 21, 1861.[7]\\r\\n[Dated September 25, 1861.]\\r\\nAbstract from monthly report of Brig. Gen. Joseph E. Johnston's division, or Army of the Shenandoah (C. S. A.), for June 30, 1861.[7]\\r\\nAggregate present for duty.\\r\\nOn the morning of July 21, 1861, McDowell sent the divisions of Hunter and Heintzelman (about 12,000 men) from Centreville at 2:30?a.m., marching southwest on the Warrenton Turnpike and then turning northwest toward Sudley Springs. Tyler's division (about 8,000) marched directly toward the Stone Bridge. The inexperienced units immediately developed logistical problems. Tyler's division blocked the advance of the main flanking column on the turnpike. The later units found the approach roads to Sudley Springs were inadequate, little more than a cart path in some places, and did not begin fording Bull Run until 9:30?a.m. Tyler's men reached the Stone Bridge around 6 a.m.[28]\\r\\nAt 5:15?a.m., Richardson's brigade fired a few artillery rounds across Mitchell's Ford on the Confederate right, some of which hit Beauregard's headquarters in the Wilmer McLean house as he was eating breakfast, alerting him to the fact that his offensive battle plan had been preempted. Nevertheless, he ordered demonstration attacks north toward the Union left at Centreville. Bungled orders and poor communications prevented their execution. Although he intended for Brig. Gen. Richard S. Ewell to lead the attack, Ewell, at Union Mills Ford, was simply ordered to \\"hold ... in readiness to advance at a moment's notice\\". Brig. Gen. D.R. Jones was supposed to attack in support of Ewell, but found himself moving forward alone. Holmes was also supposed to support, but received no orders at all.[29]\\r\\nAll that stood in the path of the 20,000 Union soldiers converging on the Confederate left flank were Col. Nathan \\"Shanks\\" Evans and his reduced brigade of 1,100 men.[32] Evans had moved some of his men to intercept the direct threat from Tyler at the bridge, but he began to suspect that the weak attacks from the Union brigade of Brig. Gen. Robert C. Schenck were merely feints. He was informed of the main Union flanking movement through Sudley Springs by Captain Edward Porter Alexander, Beauregard's signal officer, observing from 8 miles (13?km) southwest on Signal Hill. In the first use of wig-wag semaphore signaling in combat, Alexander sent the message \\"Look out for your left, your position is turned.\\"[33] Evans hastily led 900 of his men from their position fronting the Stone Bridge to a new location on the slopes of Matthews Hill, a low rise to the northwest of his previous position.[32]\\r\\nThe Confederate delaying action on Matthews Hill included a spoiling attack launched by Major Roberdeau Wheat's 1st Louisiana Special Battalion, \\"Wheat's Tigers\\". After Wheat's command was thrown back, and Wheat seriously wounded, Evans received reinforcement from two other brigades under Brig. Gen. Barnard Bee and Col. Francis S. Bartow, bringing the force on the flank to 2,800 men.[32] They successfully slowed Hunter's lead brigade (Brig. Gen. Ambrose Burnside) in its attempts to ford Bull Run and advance across Young's Branch, at the northern end of Henry House Hill. One of Tyler's brigade commanders, Col. William Tecumseh Sherman, crossed at an unguarded ford and struck the right flank of the Confederate defenders. This surprise attack, coupled with pressure from Burnside and Maj. George Sykes, collapsed the Confederate line shortly after 11:30?a.m., sending them in a disorderly retreat to Henry House Hill.[34]\\r\\n(Further map details, see: Additional Map 4, Additional Map 5, Additional Map 6 and Additional Map 7.)\\r\\nAs they retreated from their Matthews Hill position, the remainder of Evans's, Bee's, and Bartow's commands received some cover from Capt. John D. Imboden and his battery of four 6-pounder guns, who held off the Union advance while the Confederates attempted to regroup on Henry House Hill. They were met by generals Johnston and Beauregard, who had just arrived from Johnston's headquarters at the M. Lewis Farm, \\"Portici\\".[35] Fortunately for the Confederates, McDowell did not press his advantage and attempt to seize the strategic ground immediately, choosing to bombard the hill with the batteries of Capts. James B. Ricketts (Battery I, 1st U.S. Artillery) and Charles Griffin (Battery D, 5th U.S.) from Dogan's Ridge.[36]\\r\\nBrig. Gen Thomas J. Jackson's Virginia Brigade came up in support of the disorganized Confederates around noon, accompanied by Col. Wade Hampton and his Hampton's Legion, and Col. J.E.B. Stuart's cavalry. The Hampton Legion, some 600 men strong, managed to buy Jackson time to construct a defensive line on Henry House Hill by firing repeated volleys at Sherman's advancing brigade. Hampton had purchased about 400 British Enfield rifles to equip the men with, however it is not clear if his troops had them at Bull Run or if the weapons arrived after the battle. If so, they would have been the only foreign-made weapons on the field. The 79th New York was thoroughly decimated by Hampton's musket fire and began to disintegrate. Wade Hampton gestured towards their colonel, James Cameron, and remarked \\"Look at that brave officer trying to lead his men and they won't follow him.\\" Shortly afterwards, Cameron, the brother of US Senator Simon Cameron, was fatally wounded. It has been claimed that Hampton deliberately targeted officers of the 79th New York in revenge for the death of his nephew earlier in the day, although he had in fact been killed by soldiers of the 69th New York.\\r\\nJackson posted his five regiments on the reverse slope of the hill, where they were shielded from direct fire, and was able to assemble 13 guns for the defensive line, which he posted on the crest of the hill; as the guns fired, their recoil moved them down the reverse slope, where they could be safely reloaded.[37] Meanwhile, McDowell ordered the batteries of Ricketts and Griffin to move from Dogan's Ridge to the hill for close infantry support. Their 11 guns engaged in a fierce artillery duel across 300 yards (270?m) against Jackson's 13. Unlike many engagements in the Civil War, here the Confederate artillery had an advantage. The Union pieces were now within range of the Confederate smoothbores and the predominantly rifled pieces on the Union side were not effective weapons at such close ranges, with many shots fired over the head of their targets.[38]\\r\\nOne of the casualties of the artillery fire was Judith Carter Henry, an 85-year-old widow and invalid, who was unable to leave her bedroom in the Henry House. As Ricketts began receiving rifle fire, he concluded that it was coming from the Henry House and turned his guns on the building. A shell that crashed through the bedroom wall tore off one of the widow's feet and inflicted multiple injuries, from which she died later that day.[39]\\r\\n\\"The Enemy are driving us\\", Bee exclaimed to Jackson. Jackson, a former U.S. Army officer and professor at the Virginia Military Institute, is said to have replied, \\"Then, Sir, we will give them the bayonet.\\"[40] Bee exhorted his own troops to re-form by shouting, \\"There is Jackson standing like a stone wall. Let us determine to die here, and we will conquer. Rally behind the Virginians.\\"[41] This exclamation was the source for Jackson's (and his brigade's) nickname, \\"Stonewall\\". Bee was shot through the stomach shortly after speaking and died the next day, thus it is unclear exactly what he meant, moreover none of his subordinates wrote reports of the battle. Col. States Rights Gist, serving as Bee's aide-de-camp, took command of the brigade. Major Burnett Rhett, chief of staff to General Johnston, claimed that Bee was angry at Jackson's failure to come immediately to the relief of Bee's and Bartow's brigades while they were under heavy pressure. Those who subscribe to this opinion believe that Bee's statement was meant to be pejorative: \\"Look at Jackson standing there like a stone wall!\\"[42]\\r\\nArtillery commander Griffin decided to move two of his guns to the southern end of his line, hoping to provide enfilade fire against the Confederates. At approximately 3 p.m., these guns were overrun by the 33rd Virginia, whose men were outfitted in blue uniforms, causing Griffin's commander, Maj. William F. Barry, to mistake them for Union troops and to order Griffin not to fire on them. Close range volleys from the 33rd Virginia and Stuart's cavalry attack against the flank of the 11th New York Volunteer Infantry Regiment (Ellsworth's Fire Zouaves), which was supporting the battery, killed many of the gunners and scattered the infantry. Capitalizing on this success, Jackson ordered two regiments to charge Ricketts's guns and they were captured as well. As additional Federal infantry engaged, the guns changed hands several times.[43]\\r\\nThe capture of the Union guns turned the tide of battle. Although McDowell had brought 15 regiments into the fight on the hill, outnumbering the Confederates two to one, no more than two were ever engaged simultaneously. Jackson continued to press his attacks, telling soldiers of the 4th Virginia Infantry, \\"Reserve your fire until they come within 50 yards! Then fire and give them the bayonet! And when you charge, yell like furies!\\" For the first time, Union troops heard the disturbing sound of the Rebel yell. At about 4 p.m., the last Union troops were pushed off Henry House Hill by a charge of two regiments from Col. Philip St. George Cocke's brigade.[44]\\r\\nTo the west, Chinn Ridge had been occupied by Col. Oliver Otis Howard's brigade from Heintzelman's division. Also at 4 p.m., two Confederate brigades-Col. Jubal Early's, which had moved from the Confederate right, and Brig. Gen. Edmund Kirby Smith's (commanded by Col. Arnold Elzey after Smith was wounded), which had just arrived from the Shenandoah Valleycrushed Howard's brigade. Beauregard ordered his entire line forward. At 5 p.m. everywhere McDowell's army was disintegrating. Thousands, in large and small groups or as individuals, began to leave the battlefield and head for Centreville. McDowell rode around the field trying to rally regiments and groups of soldiers, but most had had enough. Unable to stop the mass exodus, McDowell gave orders for Porter's regular infantry battalion, near the intersection of the turnpike and Manassas-Sudley Road, to act as a rear guard as his army withdrew. The unit briefly held the crossroads, then retreated eastward with the rest of the army.[45]McDowell's force crumbled and began to retreat.[46]\\r\\n(Further map details, see: Additional Map 8, Additional Map 9, Additional Map 10, Additional Map 11 and Additional Map 12.)\\r\\nThe retreat was relatively orderly up to the Bull Run crossings, but it was poorly managed by the Union officers. A Union wagon was overturned by artillery fire on a bridge spanning Cub Run Creek and incited panic in McDowell's force. As the soldiers streamed uncontrollably toward Centreville, discarding their arms and equipment, McDowell ordered Col. Dixon S. Miles's division to act as a rear guard, but it was impossible to rally the army short of Washington. In the disorder that followed, hundreds of Union troops were taken prisoner. Wagons and artillery were abandoned, including the 30-pounder Parrott rifle, which had opened the battle with such fanfare. Expecting an easy Union victory, the wealthy elite of nearby Washington, including congressmen and their families, had come to picnic and watch the battle. When the Union army was driven back in a running disorder, the roads back to Washington were blocked by panicked civilians attempting to flee in their carriages.[47]\\r\\nSince their combined army had been left highly disorganized as well, Beauregard and Johnston did not fully press their advantage, despite urging from Confederate President Jefferson Davis, who had arrived on the battlefield to see the Union soldiers retreating. An attempt by Johnston to intercept the Union troops from his right flank, using the brigades of Brig. Gens. Milledge L. Bonham and James Longstreet, was a failure. The two commanders squabbled with each other and when Bonham's men received some artillery fire from the Union rear guard, and found that Richardson's brigade blocked the road to Centreville, he called off the pursuit.[48]\\r\\nIn Washington President Lincoln and members of the cabinet waited for news of a Union victory. Instead, a telegram arrived stating \\"General McDowell's army in full retreat through Centreville. The day is lost. Save Washington and the remnants of this army.\\" The tidings were happier in the Confederate capital. From the battlefield President Davis telegraphed Richmond, \\"We have won a glorious but dear-bought victory. Night closed on the enemy in full flight and closely pursued.\\"[49]\\r\\nFirst Bull Run was a clash between relatively large, ill-trained bodies of recruits, led by inexperienced officers. Neither army commander was able to deploy his forces effectively; although nearly 60,000 men were present at the battle, only 18,000 had actually been engaged. Although McDowell had been active on the battlefield, he had expended most of his energy maneuvering nearby regiments and brigades, instead of controlling and coordinating the movements of his army as a whole. Other factors contributed to McDowell's defeat: Patterson's failure to hold Johnston in the valley; McDowell's two-day delay at Centreville; allowing Tyler's division to lead the march on 21 July thus delaying the flanking divisions of Hunter and Heintzelman; and the 2 1/2-hour delay after the Union victory on Matthews' Hill, which allowed the Confederates to bring up reinforcements and establish a defensive position on Henry Hill. On Henry Hill Beauregard had also limited his control to the regimental level, generally allowing the battle to continue on its own and only reacting to Union moves. Johnston's decision to transport his infantry to the battlefield by rail played a major role in the Confederate victory. Although the trains were slow and a lack of sufficient cars did not allow the transport of large numbers of troops at one time, almost all of his army arrived in time to participate in the battle. After reaching Manassas Junction, Johnston had relinquished command of the battlefield to Beauregard, but his forwarding of reinforcements to the scene of fighting was decisive.[50]Jackson and Bee's brigades had done the largest share of fighting in the battle; Jackson's brigade had fought almost alone for four hours and sustained over 50% casualties.\\r\\nBull Run was the largest and bloodiest battle in United States history up to that point. Union casualties were 460 killed, 1,124 wounded, and 1,312 missing or captured; Confederate casualties were 387 killed, 1,582 wounded, and 13 missing.[51] Among the Union dead was Col. James Cameron, brother of President Lincoln's first Secretary of War, Simon Cameron.[52] Among the Confederate casualties was Col. Francis S. Bartow, who was the first Confederate brigade commander to be killed in the Civil War. General Bee was mortally wounded and died the following day.[53] Compared to later battles, casualties at First Bull Run had not been especially heavy. Both Union and Confederate killed, wounded, and missing were a little over one thousand seven hundred each.[54]Two Confederate brigade commanders, Jackson and Edmund Kirby-Smith, were wounded in the battle. No Union officers above the regimental level were killed; two division commanders (Samuel Heintzelman and David Hunter), and one brigade commander (Orlando Willcox) were wounded.\\r\\nUnion casualties at the battle of Bull Run, July 21, 1861.[8]\\r\\nUnion artillery lost in the battle of Bull Run, July 21, 1861.[55]\\r\\nConfederate casualties at the battle of Bull Run, July 21, 1861.[10]\\r\\nUnion forces and civilians alike feared that Confederate forces would advance on Washington, D.C., with very little standing in their way. On July 24, Prof. Thaddeus S. C. Lowe ascended in the balloon Enterprise to observe the Confederates moving in and about Manassas Junction and Fairfax. He saw no evidence of massing Confederate forces, but was forced to land in Confederate territory. It was overnight before he was rescued and could report to headquarters. He reported that his observations \\"restored confidence\\" to the Union commanders.[59]\\r\\nThe Northern public was shocked at the unexpected defeat of their army when an easy victory had been widely anticipated. Both sides quickly came to realize the war would be longer and more brutal than they had imagined. On July 22 President Lincoln signed a bill that provided for the enlistment of another 500,000 men for up to three years of service.[60] On July 25, eleven thousand Pennsylvanians who had earlier been rejected by the U.S. Secretary of War, Simon Cameron, for federal service in either Patterson's or McDowell's command arrived in Washington, D.C., and were finally accepted.[61]\\r\\nThree months after First Bull Run Union forces suffered another, smaller defeat at the Battle of Ball's Bluff, near Leesburg, Virginia. The perceived military incompetence at First Bull Run and Ball's Bluff led to the establishment of the Joint Committee on the Conduct of the War, a congressional body created to investigate Northern military affairs. Concerning the Battle of First Bull Run, the committee listened to testimony from a variety of witnesses connected with McDowell's army. Although the committee's report concluded that the principal cause of defeat was Patterson's failure to prevent Johnston from reinforcing Beauregard, Patterson's enlistment had expired a few days after the battle, and he was no longer in the service. The Northern public clamored for another scapegoat, and McDowell bore the chief blame. On 25 July 1861, he was relieved of army command and replaced by Maj. Gen. George B. McClellan, who was named general-in-chief of all the Union armies. McDowell was also present to bear significant blame for the defeat of Maj. Gen. John Pope's Army of Virginia by Gen. Robert E. Lee's Army of Northern Virginia thirteen months later, at the Second Battle of Bull Run.[54][62]\\r\\nThe reaction in the Confederacy was more muted. There was little public celebration as the Southerners realized that despite their victory, the greater battles that would inevitably come would mean greater losses for their side as well.[63] Once the euphoria of victory had worn off, Jefferson Davis called for 400,000 additional volunteers.[54]\\r\\nBeauregard was considered the Confederate hero of the battle and was promoted that day by C.S. President Davis to full general in the Confederate army.[64] Stonewall Jackson, arguably the most important tactical contributor to the victory, received no special recognition, but would later achieve glory for his 1862 Valley Campaign. Privately, Davis credited Greenhow with ensuring Confederate victory.[18] Jordan sent a telegram to Greenhow: \\"Our President and our General direct me to thank you. We rely upon you for further information. The Confederacy owes you a debt. (Signed) JORDAN, Adjutant-General.\\"[65]\\r\\nThe battle also had long-term psychological consequences. The decisive victory led to a degree of over-confidence on the part of Confederate forces, while prompting a determined organizational effort on the part of the Union. In hindsight commentators on both sides agreed that the one-sided outcome \\"proved the greatest misfortune that would have befallen the Confederacy\\". Although modern historians generally agree with this interpretation, James M. McPherson has argued that the esprit de corps attained by Confederate troops on the heels of their victory, together with a new sense of insecurity felt by northern commanders, also gave the Confederacy a military edge in the following months.[66]\\r\\nThe name of the battle has caused controversy since 1861. The Union Army frequently named battles after significant rivers and creeks that played a role in the fighting; the Confederates generally used the names of nearby towns or farms. The U.S. National Park Service uses the Confederate name for its national battlefield park, but the Union name (Bull Run) also has widespread currency in popular literature.[67]\\r\\nBattlefield confusion between the battle flags, especially the similarity of the Confederacy's \\"Stars and Bars\\" and the Union's \\"Stars and Stripes\\" when fluttering, led to the adoption of the Confederate Battle Flag, which eventually became the most popular symbol of the Confederacy and the South in general.[68]\\r\\nFirst Bull Run demonstrated that the war would not be won by one grand battle, and both sides began preparing for a long and bloody conflict. The battle also showed the need for adequately trained and experienced officers and men. One year later many of the same soldiers who had fought at First Bull Run, now combat veterans, would have an opportunity to test their skills on the same battlefield at the Second Battle of Bull Run/Manassas.[54]\\r\\nMap 1:\\r\\nSituation Mid-July 1861\\r\\nMap 2:\\r\\nBeauregard's defensive situation\\r\\n(Mid-July 1861)\\r\\nMap 3:\\r\\nSituation at 05:30-06:00\\r\\n(July 21, 1861)\\r\\nMap 4:\\r\\nSituation at 10:30-11:00\\r\\n(July 21, 1861)\\r\\nMap 5:\\r\\nSituation at 11:00-11:30\\r\\n(July 21, 1861)\\r\\nMap 6:\\r\\nSituation at 12:00-12:30\\r\\n(July 21, 1861)\\r\\nMap 7:\\r\\nSituation at 13:00\\r\\n(July 21, 1861)\\r\\nMap 8:\\r\\nSituation at 14:30-15:00\\r\\n(July 21, 1861)\\r\\nMap 9:\\r\\nSituation at 15:00\\r\\n(July 21, 1861)\\r\\nMap 10:\\r\\nSituation at 15:30\\r\\n(July 21, 1861)\\r\\nMap 11:\\r\\nSituation at 16:00\\r\\n(July 21, 1861)\\r\\nMap 12:\\r\\nSituation at 16:30-17:30\\r\\n(July 21, 1861)\\r\\nThe First Battle of Bull Run is mentioned in the novel Gods and Generals, but is depicted more fully in its film adaptation. The battle forms the climax of the film Class of '61. It also appears in the first episode of the second season of the mini-series North and South, in the second episode of the first season of the mini-series How the West Was Won and in the first episode of the mini-series The Blue and the Gray. Manassas (1999) is the first volume in the James Reasoner Civil War Series of historical novels. The battle is described in Rebel (1993), the first volume of Bernard Cornwell's The Starbuck Chronicles series of historical novels. The battle is described from the viewpoint of a Union infantryman in Upton Sinclair's novella Manassas, which also depicts the political turmoil leading up to the Civil War. The battle is also depicted in John Jakes's The Titans, the fifth novel in The Kent Family Chronicles, a series that explores the fictional Confederate cavalry officer Gideon Kent. The battle is the subject of the Johnny Horton song, \\"Battle of Bull Run\\". Shaman, second in the Cole family trilogy by Noah Gordon, includes an account of the battle. The battle is also depicted in the song \\"Yankee Bayonet\\" by indie-folk band The Decemberists. In Murder at 1600, Detective Harlan Regis (Wesley Snipes) has built a plan-relief of the battle which plays a certain role in the plot.\\r\\nPrince William County staged special events commemorating the 150th anniversary of the Civil War through 2011. Manassas was named the No. 1 tourist destination in the United States for 2011 by the American Bus Association for its efforts in highlighting the historical impact of the Civil War. The cornerstone of the commemoration event featured a reenactment of the battle on July 23ÿ24, 2011. Throughout the year, there were tours of the Manassas battlefield and other battlefields in the county and a number of related events and activities.[69]\\r\\nThe City of Manassas commemorated the 150th anniversary of the battle July 21ÿ24, 2011.[70]\\r\\nPart of the site of the battle is now Manassas National Battlefield Park. Located north of Manassas, in Prince William County, Virginia, it preserves the site of two major American Civil War battles: the First Battle of Bull Run on July 21, 1861, and the Second Battle of Bull Run which was fought between August 28 and August 30, 1862 (also known as the First Battle of Manassas and the Second Battle of Manassas, respectively). The peaceful Virginia countryside bore witness to clashes between the armies of the North (Union) and the South (Confederacy), and it was there that Confederate General Thomas J. Jackson acquired his nickname \\"Stonewall.\\"\\r\\nToday the National Battlefield Park provides the opportunity for visitors to explore the historic terrain where men fought and died more than a century ago. More than 900,000 people visit the battlefield each year. (In comparison, roughly 15 million people annually visit nearby Washington, DC.[71]) As a historic area under the National Park Service, the park was administratively listed on the National Register of Historic Places on October 15, 1966.","input":"What was the first actual battle of the civil war?"},{"output":"Japanese South Seas Detachment","context":"","input":"Who was involved in the kokoda trail campaign?"},{"output":"frame","context":"The buckle or clasp is a device used for fastening two loose ends, with one end attached to it and the other held by a catch in a secure but adjustable manner.[1] Often taken for granted, the invention of the buckle has been indispensable in securing two ends before the invention of the zipper. The basic buckle frame comes in a variety of shapes and sizes depending on the intended use and fashion of the era.[2] Buckles are as much in use today as they have been in the past. Used for much more than just securing ones belt, instead it is one of the most dependable devices in securing a range of items.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe word \\"buckle\\" enters Middle English via Old French and the Latin buccula or \\"cheek-strap,\\" as for a helmet. Some of the earliest buckles known are those used by Roman soldiers to strap their body armor together and prominently on the balteus and cingulum. Made out of bronze and expensive, these buckles were purely functional for their strength and durability vital to the individual soldier. The baldric was a later belt worn diagonally over the right shoulder down to the waist at the left carrying the sword, and its buckle therefore was as important as that on a Roman soldiers armor.[3]\\r\\nBronze Roman buckles came in various types. Not only used for practical purposes, these buckles were also decorated. A Type I Roman buckle was a buckle-plate either decorated or plain and consisted of geometric ornaments. Type IA Roman buckles were similar to Type I buckles but differed by being long and narrow, made of double sheet metal, and attached to small D-shaped buckles (primarily had dolphin-heads as decorations). Type IB buckle-loops were even more similar to Type IA buckles, only difference being that instead of dolphin-heads, they were adorned with horse-heads. There were also Type II buckles (Type IIA and Type IIB) used by Romans, but all types of Roman buckles could have served purposes for simple clothing as well, and predominantly, as a military purpose.[4]\\r\\nAside from the practical use found in Roman buckles, Scythian and Sarmatian buckles incorporated animal motifs that were characteristic to their respective decorative arts.[5] These motifs often represented animals engaged in mortal combat. These motifs were imported by many Germanic peoples and the belt buckles were evident in the graves of the Franks and Burgundies. And throughout the Middle Ages, the buckle was used mostly for ornamentation until the second half of the 14th century where the knightly belt and buckle took on its most splendid form.[6]\\r\\nBuckles remained exclusively for the wealthy until the 15th century where improved manufacturing techniques made it possible to easily produce a cheaper molded item available to the general population.[7]\\r\\nThe buckle essentially consists of four main components: the frame, chape, bar, and prong. The oldest Roman buckles are of a simple \\"D\\"-shaped frame, in which the prong or tongue extends from one side to the other. In the 14th century, buckles with a double-loop or \\"8\\"-shaped frame emerged. The prongs of these buckles attach to the center post. The appearance of multi-part buckles with chapes and removable pins, which were commonly found on shoes, occurred in the 17th century.\\r\\nThe frame is the most visible part of the buckle and holds the other parts of the buckle together. Buckle frames come in various shapes, sizes, and decorations. The shape of the frame could be a plain square or rectangle, but may be oval or made into a circular shape. A reverse curve of the frame indicated that the whole buckle was intended to be used for securing a thick material, such as leather. This reverse curve shape made it easier to thread the intended thick material end over the bar. But the shape of the frame is not limited to simply squares and ovals, the decoration of the frame itself defines the shape it will turn out to be. Since the frame is the largest part of the buckle, any and all decorations are placed on it. Decorations range from wedged shapes, picture references to people and animals, and insignia of a desired organization.[2]\\r\\nThe part of the frame that strap goes through prior to putting the tongue/prong through the hole is often referred to as the 'end bar'. The 'center bar' holds the tongue and the part (if present) that holds the tip of the strap in place is called the 'keeper' or 'keeper bar' these terms are used when additional information is needed to describe a buckle for measurements or design. Note that if a separate piece of leather or metal is attached to the strap for holding the tip of the belt/strap in place that is sometimes also called a 'keeper'.\\r\\nChapes or \\"caps\\" of various designs could be fitted to the bar to enable one strap end to be secured before fastening the other, adjustable end. This made buckles easily removable and interchangeable, leading to a significant advantage since buckles were expensive.[2] Unfortunately, the teeth or spikes on the semi-circular chapes damaged the straps or belts, making frequent repairs of the material necessary. Buckles fitted with \\"T\\"-, anchor-, or spade-shaped chapes avoided this problem but needed a slotted end in the belt to accommodate them.[8]\\r\\nThe belt buckle chapse are frequently made in a form of a plate, thus the name buckle plate.\\r\\nThe prong (also named pin) is typically made out of steel or other types of metal. In conventional belts, the prong fits through the buckle to secure the material at a pre-set length.[9]\\r\\nThe prong is usually referred to as the tongue of the buckle in America, as in 'lock-tongued buckle'. Prong is only used when the tongue is permanently fixed in position.[10]\\r\\nThe bar served to hold the chape and prong to the frame. When prongs and chapes are removed from the buckle design, the buckle incorporated a movable bar relying on the tension of the adjusted belt to keep it in place.[11]\\r\\nThe first known buckles to be used were made out of bronze for their strength and durability for military usage.[12][13]\\r\\nFor the last few hundred years, buckles have been made from brass (an alloy of copper and zinc). In the 18th century, brass buckles incorporated iron bars, chapes, and prongs due to the parts being made by different manufactures. Silver was also used in buckle manufacturing for its malleability and for being strong and durable with an attractive shine. White metal, any bright metallic compound, was also used in all styles of buckles; however, if iron was present, rust will form if it is allowed to be exposed and remain in damp conditions.[14]\\r\\nPearl buckles have been made from pearly shells and usually for ladies dresses. Since a reasonable size flat surface was needed to make a buckle, oyster was commonly used to make these types of buckles. The quality and color of course vary, ranging from layers of yellow and white to brown or grey.[15]\\r\\nWhen preferred materials were scarce during the Great Depression of the 1930s and the two World Wars, buckles became a low priority and manufactures needed to find ways to continue to produce them cheaply. Makers turned to wood as a cheap alternative since it was easily worked by hand or simple machinery by impressing the designs onto the wood. But there were problems using wood. Any attempt to brighten the woods dull appearance with painted designs or plasterwork embellishments immediately came off if the buckle were to be washed.[16]\\r\\nBuckles were not entirely made out of leather because a frame and bar of leather would not be substantial enough to carry a prong or the full weight of the belt and anything the belt and buckle intend to support. However, leather (or dyed suede, more common to match a ladys garment color) was used more as a cover-up for cheap materials to create a product worthy of buying.[17]\\r\\nBuckles were not made out of glass; rather the glass was used as a decorative feature that covered the entire frame of a metal buckle. One method of creating glass buckles was gluing individual discs of glass to the metal frame. Another more intricate method was to set a wire into the back of a glass disc, and then threading the wire through a hole in the fretted frame of the buckle. The glass was further secured by either bending it over the back of the frame or splayed out like a rivet.[18]\\r\\nCelluloid, a type of thermoplastic invented in 1869, was used sparingly and only for decoration until after World War I where it began to be produced on a wider commercial scale. After World War II, the chemical industry saw a great expansion where Celluloid and other plastics such as Casein and Bakelite formed the basis of the buckle-making industry.[19] Many thermoplastic polymers such as nylon are now used in snap-fit buckles for a wide variety of applications.\\r\\nAlthough any device that serves to secure two loose ends is casually called a buckle, if it consists of two separate pieces with one for a hook and the other for a loop, it should be called a clasp. Clasps became increasingly popular at the turn of the 19th century with one clear disadvantage: since each belt end was fixed to each clasp piece, the size of the belt was typically not adjustable unless an elastic panel was inserted.[20]\\r\\nA buckle without a chape or prongs is called a buckle trim or slide. It may have been designed this particular way or it may have lost its prongs through continuous use. This type was frequently used in home dress-making (belt end being secured with the simple hook-and-eye) and was purely used for decoration for items such as shoe fronts to conceal unattractive elastic fitting.[8]\\r\\nThe belt buckle is the conventional buckle with a frame, bar and prong gives the most reliable and easy-to-use closure for a belt. It is not meant, by design, to offer much space for decoration, but for its time-tested reliability.[8]\\r\\nA conventional buckle that is formed by a male buckle member (the hook end) and a female buckle member (the catch end). The male buckle member consists of a center guide rod forwardly extending from the front side with two spring arms equally spaced from the center rod. The two spring arms each have a retaining block that terminates at the front end. The female buckle member has a front open side and two side holes which hold and secure the two spring arms of the male buckle member.[21] This sort of buckle may be found on backpacks, belts, rifle slings, and boots. It is also known as the \\"parachute buckle\\".\\r\\nThe bottom part of the blimp, also known as a gondola, is called the buckle.\\r\\nSpur buckle is a term used to designate:","input":"What are the parts of a buckle called?"},{"output":"France","context":"","input":"What are all of italy's neighboring countries?"},{"output":"21,000 route miles","context":"CSX Transportation (reporting mark CSXT) is a Class I railroad operating in the eastern United States and the Canadian provinces of Ontario and Quebec. Headquartered in Jacksonville, Florida, the railroad operates approximately 21,000 route miles (34,000?km) of track.[1]\\r\\n\\r\\nCSX Transportation was formed on November 1, 1980, by combining the railroads of the former Chessie System with Seaboard Coast Line Industries, and finally with the Seaboard System Railroad in 1986.[2] The originator of the Seaboard System was the former Seaboard Air Line Railroad, which previously merged with the Atlantic Coast Line Railroad in 1967, and later with the Louisville & Nashville Railroad, as well as several smaller subsidiaries such as the Clinchfield Railroad, Atlanta & West Point Railroad, Monon Railroad and the Georgia Railroad.[2] The origin of the Chessie System was the former Chesapeake & Ohio Railway, which had merged with the Baltimore & Ohio Railroad, and the Western Maryland Railway.[2]b Despite the merger in 1980, CSX Transportation never had its own identity (meaning no CSX painted locomotives or rolling stock) as a common carrier railroad until 1986\\r\\n\\r\\nThe name came about during merger talks between Chessie System, Inc. and Seaboard System Railroad, Inc., commonly called \\"Chessie\\" and \\"Seaboard\\". The company chairmen said it was important for the new name to include neither of those names because it was a partnership. Employees were asked for suggestions, most of which consisted of combinations of the initials. At the same time a temporary shorthand name was needed for discussions with the Interstate Commerce Commission. \\"CSC\\" was chosen but belonged to a trucking company in Virginia. \\"CSM\\" (for \\"Chessie-Seaboard Merger\\") was also taken. The lawyers decided to use \\"CSX\\", and the name stuck. In the public announcement, it was said that \\"CSX is singularly appropriate. C can stand for Chessie, S for Seaboard, and X, which actually has no meaning.\\" However, an August 9, 2016, article on the Railway Age website stated that \\" ... the 'X' was for 'Consolidated' \\".[3] The T had to be added to CSX when used as a reporting mark because reporting marks that end in X means that the car is owned by a leasing company or private car owner. The company introduced its current slogan, \\"How Tomorrow Moves\\", in 2008.[4]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1995, CSX started a new liability insurance requirement of $200 million to introduce their official policy \\"No steam on its own wheels\\", banning the operation of steam locomotives and other antique rail equipment on their trackage due to serious business, safety concerns, and increased risk.[5][6]\\r\\n\\r\\nOn June 23, 1997, CSX and Norfolk Southern Railway (NS) filed a joint application with the Surface Transportation Board for authority to purchase, divide, and operate the assets of the 11,000-mile (18,000?km) Conrail, which had been created in 1976 by bringing together several ailing Northeastern railway systems into a government-owned corporation. On June 6, 1998, the STB approved the CSXÿNS application and set August 22, 1998, as the effective date of its decision. CSX acquired 42 percent of Conrail's assets, and NS received the remaining 58 percent. As a result of the transaction, CSX's rail operations grew to include some 3,800 miles (6,100?km) of the Conrail system (predominantly lines that had belonged to the former New York Central Railroad). CSX began operating its trains on its portion of the Conrail network on June 1, 1999. CSX now serves much of the Eastern United States, with a few routes into nearby Canadian cities.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 2014 Canadian Pacific Railway approached CSX with an offer to merge the two companies, but CSX declined, and in 2015 Canadian Pacific made an attempt to purchase and merge with Norfolk Southern,[7] but NS declined to do so as well.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 2017 CSX announced Hunter Harrison as its new chief executive; a settlement with activist investor Paul Hilal and Mantle Ridge.[8] CSX added five new directors to their board, including Harrison and Mantle Ridge founder Paul Hilal. Mantle Ridge owns 4.9 percent of CSX.[9] On December 14, 2017, CSX announced that Hunter Harrison was on medical leave. Two days after the announcement, Harrison died, one day after being hospitalized for complications of an ongoing illness. CSX initially saw a 10% drop in its stock price, but turned around to hit a new 52 week high less than a month later (January 2018).[citation needed]\\r\\n\\r\\nCSX operates two regions of five divisions each: the Northern, based in Calumet City, Illinois; and Southern, based in Jacksonville, Florida.\\r\\n\\r\\nOne line in the Northern Region travels into Canada:\\r\\n\\r\\nCSX operates the Juice Traina collective name for Train Nos. O823, Q740 and Q741, Q743, and Q745which consists of Tropicana cars that carry fresh orange juice between Bradenton, Florida, and the Greenville section of Jersey City, New Jersey. The train also runs from Bradenton to Fort Pierce, Florida, via the Florida East Coast Railway. In the 21st century, the Juice Train has been studied as a model of efficient rail transportation that can compete with trucks and other modes in the perishable-goods trade.[citation needed] All Tropicana Trains are now added to Intermodal Trains such as Q188 and Q124.\\r\\n\\r\\nCoke Express trains run between Pittsburgh and Chicago, and other places in the Rust Belt, carrying coke to industries, mainly steel mills.\\r\\n\\r\\nCSX also runs daily trash trains Q702 and Q703 from The Bronx to Philadelphia (via Selkirk Yard) and then Petersburg, Virginia, where they interchange with NS. These trains consist of 89-foot (27?m) flatcars loaded with four containers of trash. Another pair of trains, Q710 and Q711, originate in Kearny, New Jersey, and terminate in Russell, Kentucky.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnother style of unit train is a local trash train, D765, that runs between the Maryland towns of Derwood and Dickerson. The train runs daily except on Sundays; on holidays it sometimes runs twice a day. Trash is carried from Montgomery County's Shady Grove Transfer Station to a waste-to-energy plant located off the PEPCO lead to Mirant's Dickerson Generating Station. The trip is roughly 17 miles (27?km), and the train is made up of National Steel Car Company-built well cars, hauling 40-foot (12?m) containers. The first NEMX equipment was built when the D765 first started operations in 1995. In recent years, the fleet has been somewhat upgraded, repainted, and new cars have been constructed. In the early days, the locomotives powering the train were a GP40-2/RDMT slug set, but currently the train can be upwards of 47?cars. The locomotives that now routinely power the train are a pair of EMD SD50s.\\r\\n\\r\\nWorking with Union Pacific, CSX runs an extended haul perishables train, Q090. Known by the railroad as the \\"Apple Train\\" or \\"Salad Shooter\\", the train runs from Wallula, Washington, to Schenectady, New York. This train typically runs with three of Union Pacific's newest locomotives and has its extended haul inspection from Wallula to Schenectady at Cleveland-Collinwood Yard on CSX headed in both directions. On the return trip, the train is labeled Q091. CSX modified its Train Handling rule book to allow this train to use more power axles.[10] In early 2012 the \\"Salad Shooter\\" derailed just a few miles northwest of Greenwich, Ohio. No injuries were reported in the incident.[citation needed]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 2002, CSXT No. 8503, an EMD SD50 (that has since been downgraded to an SD50-2), was painted in the new yellow and blue YN3 scheme. More than 1,000 CSX locomotives have since been painted in the YN3 scheme.[11]\\r\\n\\r\\nCSX recently created a new paint scheme, known as YN3b, which updates YN3 with the most recent CSX logo. The first unit to wear this scheme was ES44AH 950. Currently, CSX's ES44AHs 950-999 and 3000ÿ3249 and the ET44AHs 3250-3474 wear the scheme, along with recently repainted older locomotives, the first of which was SD70AC CSXT 4719, which was repainted at the Huntington Locomotive Shops in September 2012. YN3b is also commonly found on the SD40-3 rebuilds.\\r\\n\\r\\nAll of the former-Conrail locomotives in active service have been repainted in a CSX livery.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the 1990s, CSXT began placing a lightning bolt decal below the road number on locomotives with AC traction and still continues this practice with the new GE ES44AH and ET44AH locomotives.\\r\\n\\r\\nCSX also has several locomotives with \\"spirit\\" stickers with a name of an important person or location in the CSX system.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 2016, CSX placed the logos of several predecessor railroads on some locomotives, in order to maintain legal control of the logos.\\r\\n\\r\\nFormer Conrail locomotives can be spotted by recognizing phase differences in engine models and numbering. Other spotting details can be inconsistent, but can include a number of the following: red marker lights, Leslie model RS3L or RS5T air horns (only a few original horns remain. Many have been replaced by K5LAs), former Conrail SD40-2s ride on Flexicoil \\"C\\" trucks and have anti-climbers, ditch lights mounted beneath the anti-climber, headlights above the cab (vs. CSX's standard practice of nose mounted headlights on all wide-nose GE units), and modified \\"Bright Future\\" paint with battery box faces painted yellow (instead of black or blue).\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 2015, CSX traded its 12 EMD SD80MACs for 12 SD40-2s from Norfolk Southern. They have all since been rebuilt as SD40-3s.\\r\\n\\r\\nCSX has been significant in rebuilding locomotives. CSX has 3 rebuilds of its 4 axle EMD Locomotives. The EMD GP38-2, GP40-2, and SD40-2 have all been rebuilt to then Dash 3 standards with updated Wabtec Electronically Controlled Air Brakes, Electronic bells, (E-Bell), electronic handbrakes with a mechanical backup, an airstarter on the motor with an electric start backup, a new designed crash safe cab, a new electronic control stand, YN3B paint job, and Positive Train Control (PTC) computers. They became EMD GP38-3s, GP40-3s, and SD40-3s respectively. Most are also Positive Stop Protection ( PSP ) equipped Remote Controlled Locomotives (RCL) and have amber strobe lights on each side of the cab, a Cattron Locomotive Control Unit computer, an Air Brake Transfer Valve ( that transfers brake control from manual to computer control), a speed transponder scanner on each end, and a GPS Receiver on the cab roof to pinpoint the engines location. The Dash 3 RCL can also have its handbrake applied by a Remote Control Operator (RCO) by holding the left and right Vigilance switches on the Operator Control Unit (OCU) remote box! CSX has rebuilt EMD GP35 and GP30 units as road slugs. CSX has also downgraded SD50 and GP40-2 units in order to decrease the wear and tear on the engines the EMD GP40-2s that were downgraded from 3,000 horsepower to 2,000 horsepower during this process are known as GP38-2S locomotives and CSXT 6044 is one of those that was derated. Among its EMD rebuilds, CSX has done rebuilding on many GE locomotives as well. CSX has re-powered most of its GE CW60AC and CW60AH locomotives with a GEVO-16 engine rated at 4,600?hp (3,430?kW), essentially making them an over-engined ES44AH called a CW46AH by CSX. Former Conrail GE B40-8 units have also been downgraded to 2,000?hp (1,491?kW) in an attempt to decrease wheel slip and low speeds. They were redesignated as B20-8s and CSX has since sold or stored most of these units including the 6 axle GE C40-8s. Another group of projects are the \\"heavy\\" units. CSX has modified some GE CW44AC and CW44AH units to heavy units by adding extra counterweights to the frame and in the nose of the unit she and new computers to increase tractive effort at low speeds, they are 432,000 pounds.\\r\\n\\r\\nCSX has also obtained a few EMD F40PHs that were retired from Amtrak for executive office car service and geometry trains.\\r\\n\\r\\nWith the arrival of Hunter Harrison, CSX has begun to store many locomotives. By the end of 2017, CSX plans to store or retire all of the GE CW40-8, CW40-9, CW60AC, CW60AH, CW46AH, EMD SD50, SD50-2, SD50-3, SD60M, SD60I, SD70M, SD70AC, and SD70AE (SD70ACe) units. Most of the GE C40-8, B40-8, and B20-8 units stored in Corbin, Kentucky have already been retired and sold off. Even with the passing of Harrison, his replacement, James Foote, confirmed the locomotives would still be retired.[12]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn hump yards, trains are slowly pushed over a small hill as cars are uncoupled at the crest of the hill and allowed to roll down the hump into the appropriate tracks for outbound trains.\\r\\n\\r\\nCSX also operates numerous trains to and from Oak Island Yard in Newark, New Jersey, which is operated by Conrail Shared Assets Operations (CRCX) on its and Norfolk Southern's behalf.

The eruption (a VEI 5 event) was the most significant volcanic eruption to occur in the contiguous 48 U.S. states since the 1915 eruption of Lassen Peak in California.[1] It has often been declared as the most disastrous volcanic eruption in United States history. The eruption was preceded by a two-month series of earthquakes and steam-venting episodes, caused by an injection of magma at shallow depth below the volcano that created a large bulge and a fracture system on the mountain's north slope.\\r\\nAn earthquake at 8:32:17?a.m. PDT (UTC?7) on Sunday, May 18, 1980, caused the entire weakened north face to slide away, creating the largest landslide ever recorded. This allowed the partly molten, high-pressure gas- and steam-rich rock in the volcano to suddenly explode northwards toward Spirit Lake in a hot mix of lava and pulverized older rock, overtaking the avalanching face.\\r\\nAn eruption column rose 80,000 feet (24?km; 15?mi) into the atmosphere and deposited ash in 11 U.S. states.[2] At the same time, snow, ice and several entire glaciers on the volcano melted, forming a series of large lahars (volcanic mudslides) that reached as far as the Columbia River, nearly 50 miles (80?km) to the southwest. Less severe outbursts continued into the next day, only to be followed by other large, but not as destructive, eruptions later that year. Thermal energy released during the eruption was equal to 26 megatons. [3]\\r\\nApproximately 57 people were killed directly, including innkeeper Harry R. Truman, photographers Reid Blackburn and Robert Landsburg, and geologist David A. Johnston.[4] Hundreds of square miles were reduced to wasteland, causing over a billion U.S. dollars in damage ($3.03 billion in 2017 dollars[5]), thousands of animals were killed, and Mount St. Helens was left with a crater on its north side. At the time of the eruption, the summit of the volcano was owned by the Burlington Northern Railroad, but afterward the land passed to the United States Forest Service.[6] The area was later preserved, as it was, in the Mount St. Helens National Volcanic Monument.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nMount St. Helens remained dormant from its last period of activity in the 1840s and 1850s until March 1980.[7] Several small earthquakes, apparently beginning on March 15, indicated that magma may have begun moving below the volcano.[8] On March 20, at 3:45?p.m. Pacific Standard Time (all times will be in PST or PDT), a shallow magnitude 4.2 earthquake (the initial reading was 4.1), centered below the volcano's north flank,[8] signaled the volcano's violent return from 123?years of hibernation.[9] A gradually building earthquake swarm saturated area seismographs and started to climax at about noon on March 25, reaching peak levels in the next two days, including an earthquake registering 5.1 on the Richter scale.[10] A total of 174 shocks of magnitude?2.6 or greater were recorded during those two days.[11]\\r\\nShocks of magnitude?3.2 or greater occurred at a slightly increasing rate during April and May with five earthquakes of magnitude?4 or above per day in early April, and eight?per?day the week before May 18.[9] Initially there was no direct sign of eruption, but small earthquake-induced avalanches of snow and ice were reported from aerial observations.\\r\\nAt 12:36?p.m. on March 27, phreatic eruptions (explosions of steam caused by magma suddenly heating groundwater) ejected and smashed rock from within the old summit crater, excavating a new crater 250 feet (75?m) wide[9] and sending an ash column about 7,000 feet (2,100?m) into the air.[11] By this date a 16,000-foot-long (4,900?m) eastward-trending fracture system had also developed across the summit area.[12] This was followed by more earthquake swarms and a series of steam explosions that sent ash 10,000 to 11,000 feet (3,000 to 3,400?m) above their vent.[9] Most of this ash fell between 3 and 12 miles (5 and 19?km) from its vent, but some was carried 150 miles (240?km) south to Bend, Oregon, or 285 miles (459?km) east to Spokane, Washington.[13]\\r\\nA second, new crater and a blue flame were observed on March 29.[13][14] The flame was visibly emitted from both craters and was probably created by burning gases. Static electricity generated from ash clouds rolling down the volcano sent out lightning bolts that were up to 2 miles (3?km) long.[13] Ninety-three separate outbursts were reported on March 30,[13] and increasingly strong harmonic tremors were first detected on April 1, alarming geologists and prompting Governor Dixy Lee Ray to declare a state of emergency on April 3.[14] Governor Ray issued an executive order on April 30 creating a \\"red zone\\" around the volcano; anyone caught in this zone without a pass faced a $500 fine or six months in jail.[15] This precluded many cabin owners from visiting their property.\\r\\nBy April 7 the combined crater was 1,700 feet long by 1,200?ft wide and 500?ft deep (520G370G150?m).[16] A USGS team determined in the last week of April that a 1.5-mile-diameter (2.4?km) section of St. Helens' north face was displaced outward by at least 270 feet (82?m).[12] For the rest of April and early May this bulge grew by 5 to 6 feet (1.5 to 1.8?m) per day, and by mid-May it extended more than 400 feet (120?m) north.[12] As the bulge moved northward, the summit area behind it progressively sank, forming a complex, down-dropped block called a graben. Geologists announced on April 30 that sliding of the bulge area was the greatest immediate danger and that such a landslide might spark an eruption. These changes in the volcano's shape were related to the overall deformation that increased the volume of the volcano by 0.03 cubic miles (0.13?km3) by mid-May.[17] This volume increase presumably corresponded to the volume of magma that pushed into the volcano and deformed its surface. Because the intruded magma remained below ground and was not directly visible, it was called a cryptodome, in contrast to a true lava dome exposed at the surface.\\r\\nOn May 7, eruptions similar to those in March and April resumed, and over the next days the bulge approached its maximum size.[18] All activity had been confined to the 350-year-old summit dome and did not involve any new magma. A total of about 10,000 earthquakes were recorded prior to the May 18 event, with most concentrated in a small zone less than 1.6 miles (2.6?km) directly below the bulge.[17] Visible eruptions ceased on May 16, reducing public interest and consequently the number of spectators in the area.[19] Mounting public pressure then forced officials to allow 50 carloads of property owners to enter the danger zone on May 17 to gather whatever property they could carry.[19] Another trip was scheduled for 10?a.m. the next day.[19] Because that next day was Sunday, more than 300 loggers would not be working in the area. By the time of the climactic eruption, dacite magma intruding into the volcano had forced the north flank outward nearly 500 feet (150?m) and heated the volcano's groundwater system, causing many steam-driven explosions (phreatic eruptions).\\r\\nAs May 18 dawned, Mount St. Helens' activity did not show any change from the pattern of the preceding month. The rate of bulge movement, sulfur dioxide emission, and ground temperature readings did not reveal any changes indicating a catastrophic eruption. USGS volcanologist David A. Johnston was on duty at an observation post approximately 6 miles (10?km) north of the volcano: as of 6?a.m., Johnston's measurements did not indicate any unusual activity.[6]\\r\\nSuddenly, at 8:32?a.m., a magnitude?5.1 earthquake centered directly below the north slope triggered that part of the volcano to slide,[20] approximately 7ÿ20?seconds (about 10?seconds seems most reasonable) after the shock.[6] The landslide, the largest in recorded history, travelled at 110 to 155 miles per hour (177 to 249?km/h) and moved across Spirit Lake's west arm. Part of it hit a 1,150-foot-high (350?m) ridge about 6 miles (10?km) north.[6] Some of the slide spilled over the ridge, but most of it moved 13 miles (21?km) down the North Fork Toutle River, filling its valley up to 600 feet (180?m) deep with avalanche debris.[20] An area of about 24 square miles (62?km2) was covered, and the total volume of the deposit was about 0.7 cubic miles (2.9?km3).[6]\\r\\nScientists were able to reconstruct the motion of the landslide from a series of rapid photographs by Gary Rosenquist, who was camping 11 miles (18?km) away from the blast.[6] Rosenquist, his party and his photographs survived because the blast was deflected by local topography 1 mile (1.6?km) short of his location.[21]\\r\\nMost of St. Helens' former north side became a rubble deposit 17 miles (27?km) long, averaging 150 feet (46?m) thick; the slide was thickest at 1 mile (1.6?km) below Spirit Lake and thinnest at its western margin.[6] Thousands of trees were torn from the surrounding hillside after the lake was sloshed 800 feet (240?m) up the hillside. All the water in Spirit Lake was temporarily displaced by the landslide, sending 600-foot-high (180?m) waves crashing into a ridge north of the lake,[22] adding 295 feet (90?m) of new avalanche debris above the old lakebed, and raising its surface level by about 200 feet.[6] As the water moved back into its basin, it pulled with it thousands of trees felled by a super-heated wall of volcanic gas and searing ash and rock that had overtaken the landslide seconds before. More than three decades after the eruption, mats of floating dead trees remain on Spirit Lake and nearby St. Helens Lake; the mats change position with the wind.\\r\\nThe landslide exposed the dacite magma in St. Helens' neck to much lower pressure, causing the gas-charged, partially molten rock and high-pressure steam above it to explode a few seconds after the landslide started. Explosions burst through the trailing part of the landslide, blasting rock debris northward. The resulting blast laterally directed the pyroclastic flow of very hot volcanic gases, ash and pumice formed from new lava, while the pulverized old rock hugged the ground, initially moving at 220 miles per hour (350?km/h) but quickly accelerating to 670?mph (1,080?km/h), and it might have briefly passed the speed of sound.[6][20]\\r\\nPyroclastic flow material passed over the moving avalanche and spread outward, devastating a fan-shaped area 23 miles across by 19 miles long (37?km?G 31?km).[20] In total about 230 square miles (600?km2) of forest was knocked down,[20] and extreme heat killed trees miles beyond the blow-down zone. At its vent the lateral blast probably did not last longer than about 30?seconds, but the northward-radiating and expanding blast cloud continued for about another minute.\\r\\nSuperheated flow material flashed water in Spirit Lake and North Fork Toutle River to steam, creating a larger, secondary explosion that was heard as far away as British Columbia,[23] Montana, Idaho, and Northern California. Yet many areas closer to the eruption (Portland, Oregon, for example) did not hear the blast. This so-called \\"quiet zone\\" extended radially a few tens of miles from the volcano and was created by the complex response of the eruption's sound waves to differences in temperature and air motion of the atmospheric layers and, to a lesser extent, local topography.[6]\\r\\nLater studies indicated that one-third of the 0.045 cubic miles (0.19?km3) of material in the flow was new lava, and the rest was fragmented, older rock.[23]\\r\\nEveryone in the quiet zone could see the huge ash cloud that was sent skyward from St. Helens' northern foot. The near-supersonic lateral blast, loaded with volcanic debris, caused devastation as far as 19 miles (31?km) from the volcano. The area affected by the blast can be subdivided into three roughly concentric zones:[6]\\r\\nBy the time this pyroclastic flow hit its first human victims, it was still as hot as 360?C (680?F) and filled with suffocating gas and flying angular material.[23] Most of the 57 people known to have died in that day's eruption succumbed to asphyxiation while several died from burns.[6] Lodge owner Harry R. Truman was buried under hundreds of feet of avalanche material. Volcanologist David A. Johnston was one of those killed, as was Reid Blackburn, a National Geographic photographer. Robert Landsburg, another photographer, was killed by the ash cloud. He was able to protect his film with his body, and the surviving photos provided geologists with valuable documentation of the historic eruption.[24]\\r\\nSubsequent outpourings of pyroclastic material from the breach left by the landslide consisted mainly of new magmatic debris rather than fragments of preexisting volcanic rocks. The resulting deposits formed a fan-like pattern of overlapping sheets, tongues and lobes. At least 17 separate pyroclastic flows occurred during the May 18 eruption, and their aggregate volume was about 0.05 cubic miles (210,000,000?m3).[6]\\r\\nThe flow deposits were still at about 300 to 420?C (572 to 788?F) two weeks after they erupted.[6] Secondary steam-blast eruptions fed by this heat created pits on the northern margin of the pyroclastic-flow deposits, at the south shore of Spirit Lake, and along the upper part of the North Fork Toutle River. These steam-blast explosions continued sporadically for weeks or months after the emplacement of pyroclastic flows, and at least one occurred a year later, on May 16, 1981.[6]\\r\\nAs the avalanche and initial pyroclastic flow were still advancing, a huge ash column grew to a height of 12 miles (19?km) above the expanding crater in less than 10?minutes and spread tephra into the stratosphere for 10 straight hours.[23] Near the volcano, the swirling ash particles in the atmosphere generated lightning, which in turn started many forest fires. During this time, parts of the mushroom-shaped ash-cloud column collapsed, and fell back upon the earth. This fallout, mixed with magma, mud and steam, sent additional pyroclastic flows speeding down St. Helens' flanks. Later, slower flows came directly from the new north-facing crater and consisted of glowing pumice bombs and very hot pumiceous ash. Some of these hot flows covered ice or water which flashed to steam, creating craters up to 65 feet (20?m) in diameter and sending ash as much as 6,500 feet (2,000?m) into the air.[25]\\r\\nStrong high-altitude wind carried much of this material east-northeasterly from the volcano at an average speed of about 60 miles per hour (97?km/h). By 9:45?a.m. it had reached Yakima, Washington, 90 miles (140?km) away, and by 11:45?a.m. it was over Spokane, Washington.[6] A total of 4 to 5 inches (100 to 130?mm) of ash fell on Yakima, and areas as far east as Spokane were plunged into darkness by noon where visibility was reduced to 10 feet (3.0?m) and 0.5 inches (13?mm) of ash fell.[23] Continuing eastward, St. Helens' ash fell in the western part of Yellowstone National Park by 10:15?p.m. and was seen on the ground in Denver, Colorado, the next day.[23] In time, ash fall from this eruption was reported as far away as Minnesota and Oklahoma, and some of the ash drifted around the globe within about 2?weeks.\\r\\nDuring the nine hours of vigorous eruptive activity, about 540,000,000 tons of ash fell over an area of more than 22,000 square miles (57,000?km2).[6] The total volume of the ash before its compaction by rainfall was about 0.3 cubic miles (1.3?km3).[6] The volume of the uncompacted ash is equivalent to about 0.05 cubic miles (210,000,000?m3) of solid rock, or about 7% of the amount of material that slid off in the debris avalanche.[6] By around 5:30?p.m. on May 18, the vertical ash column declined in stature, but less severe outbursts continued through the next several days.[26]\\r\\nGenerally, given that the way airborne ash is deposited after an eruption is strongly influenced by the meteorological conditions, a certain variation of the ash type will occur, as a function of distance to the volcano or time elapsed from eruption. The ash from Mount St. Helens is no exception, and hence the ash properties have large variations.[27]\\r\\nThe bulk chemical composition of the ash has been found to be approximately 65% silicon dioxide, 18% aluminium oxide, 5% ferric oxide, 4% each calcium oxide and sodium oxide and 2% magnesium oxide. Trace chemicals were also detected, their concentrations varying as shown: 0.05ÿ0.09% chlorine, 0.02ÿ0.03% fluorine, and 0.09ÿ0.3% sulphur.[27]\\r\\nThe index of refraction, a number used in physics to describe how light propagates through a particular substance, is an important property of volcanic ash. This number is complex having both real and imaginary parts, the real part indicating how light disperses and the imaginary part indicating how light is absorbed by the substance.\\r\\nIt is known that the silicate particles have a real index of refraction ranging between 1.5 and 1.6 for visible light. However, there is a spectrum of colors associated with samples of volcanic ash, from very light to dark gray. This makes for variations in the measured imaginary refractive index under visible light.[28]\\r\\nIn the case of Mount St. Helens, the ash settled in three main layers on the ground:[27]\\r\\nFor example, when comparing the imaginary part of the refractive index k of stratospheric ash from 15?km and 18?km from the volcano it has been discovered that they have similar values around 700?nm (around 0.009), while they differ significantly around 300?nm. Here, the 18?km (k was found to be around 0.009) sample was much more absorbent than the 15?km sample (k was found to be around 0.002).[28]\\r\\nThe hot, exploding material also broke apart and melted nearly all of the mountain's glaciers along with most of the overlying snow. As in many previous St. Helens' eruptions, this created huge lahars (volcanic mudflows) and muddy floods that affected three of the four stream drainage systems on the mountain,[25] and which started to move as early as 8:50?a.m.[22] Lahars travelled as fast as 90 miles per hour (140?km/h) while still high on the volcano but progressively slowed to about 3 miles per hour (4.8?km/h) on the flatter and wider parts of rivers.[6] Mudflows from the southern and eastern flanks had the consistency of wet concrete as they raced down Muddy River, Pine Creek and Smith Creek to their confluence at the Lewis River. Bridges were taken out at the mouth of Pine Creek and the head of Swift Reservoir, which rose 2.6 feet (0.79?m)[25] by noon to accommodate the nearly 18,000,000 cubic yards (14,000,000?m3) of additional water, mud and debris.[6]\\r\\nGlacier and snow melt mixed with tephra on the volcano's northeast slope to create much larger lahars. These mudflows traveled down the north and south forks of the Toutle River and joined at the confluence of the Toutle forks and the Cowlitz River near Castle Rock, Washington, at 1:00?p.m. Ninety minutes after the eruption, the first mudflow had moved 27 miles (43?km) upstream where observers at Weyerhaeuser's Camp Baker saw a 12-foot-high (4?m) wall of muddy water and debris pass.[22] Near the confluence of the Toutle's north and south forks at Silver Lake, a record flood stage of 23.5 feet (7.2?m) was recorded.[22]\\r\\nA large but slower-moving mudflow with a mortar-like consistency was mobilized in early afternoon at the head of the Toutle River north fork. By 2:30?p.m. the massive mudflow had destroyed Camp Baker,[22] and in the following hours seven bridges were carried away. Part of the flow backed up for 2.5 miles (4.0?km) soon after entering the Cowlitz River, but most continued downstream. After traveling 17 miles (27?km) further, an estimated 3,900,000 cubic yards (3,000,000?m3) of material were injected into the Columbia River, reducing the river's depth by 25 feet (8?m) for a 4-mile (6?km) stretch.[22] The resulting 13-foot (4.0?m) river depth temporarily closed the busy channel to ocean-going freighters, costing Portland, Oregon, an estimated five million US dollars.[26] Ultimately more than 65?million cubic yards (50?million cubic metres) of sediment were dumped along the lower Cowlitz and Columbia Rivers.[6]\\r\\nThe May 18, 1980, event was the most deadly and economically destructive volcanic eruption in the history of the United States.[6] Approximately fifty-seven people were killed directly from the blast and 200 houses, 47 bridges, 15 miles (24?km) of railways and 185 miles (298?km) of highway were destroyed; two people were killed indirectly in accidents that resulted from poor visibility, and two more suffered fatal heart attacks from shoveling ash.[29] U.S. President Jimmy Carter surveyed the damage and said it looked more desolate than a moonscape.[30][31] A film crew was dropped by helicopter on Mount St. Helens on May 23 to document the destruction. However, their compasses spun in circles and they quickly became lost.[32] A second eruption occurred the next day (see below), but the crew survived and were rescued two days after that. The eruption ejected more than 1 cubic mile (4.2?km3) of material.[33] A quarter of that volume was fresh lava in the form of ash, pumice and volcanic bombs while the rest was fragmented, older rock.[33] The removal of the north side of the mountain (13% of the cone's volume) reduced Mount St. Helens' height by about 1,280 feet (390?m) and left a crater 1 to 2 miles (2 to 3?km) wide and 2,100 feet (640?m) deep with its north end open in a huge breach.[33]\\r\\nMore than 4,000,000,000 board feet (9,400,000?m3) of timber was damaged or destroyed, mainly by the lateral blast.[6] At least 25% of the destroyed timber was salvaged after September 1980. Downwind of the volcano, in areas of thick ash accumulation, many agricultural crops, such as wheat, apples, potatoes and alfalfa, were destroyed. As many as 1,500 elk and 5,000 deer were killed, and an estimated 12 million[6] Chinook and Coho salmon fingerlings died when their hatcheries were destroyed. Another estimated 40,000 young salmon were lost when they swam through turbine blades of hydroelectric generators after reservoir levels were lowered along the Lewis River to accommodate possible mudflows and flood waters.[6]\\r\\nIn total Mount St. Helens released 24 megatons of thermal energy, 7 of which were a direct result of the blast. This is equivalent to 1,600 times the size of the atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima.[34]\\r\\nThere is a minor controversy in regard to the exact death toll. The figure most commonly cited is fifty-seven. However, there are two points of dispute.\\r\\nThe first point regards two officially listed victims, Paul Hiatt and Dale Thayer. They were reported missing after the explosion. In the aftermath, investigators were able to locate individuals named Paul Hiatt and Dale Thayer who were alive and well. However, they were unable to determine who reported Hiatt missing, and the person who was listed as reporting Thayer missing claimed she wasn't the one who had done so. Since the investigators could not thus verify that they were the same Hiatt and Thayer who were reported missing, the names remain listed among the presumed dead.[35][36]\\r\\nThe second point regards three missing people who are not officially listed as victims: Robert Ruffle, Steven Whitsett and Mark Melanson. Cowlitz County Emergency Services Management lists them as \\"Possibly Missing  Not on [the official] List\\". According to Melanson's brother, in October 1983, Cowlitz County officials told his family that Melanson \\"is believed [...] a victim of the May 18, 1980, eruption\\" and that after years of searching, the family eventually decided \\"he's buried in the ash\\".[36]\\r\\nTaking these two points of dispute into consideration, the direct death toll could be as low as fifty-five or as high as sixty. When combined with the four indirect victims mentioned earlier, those numbers range from fifty-nine to sixty-four.\\r\\nThe ash fall created some temporary major problems with transportation, sewage disposal, and water treatment systems. Visibility was greatly decreased during the ash fall, closing many highways and roads. Interstate 90 from Seattle to Spokane was closed for a week and a half.[6] Air travel was disrupted for between a few days and two weeks, as several airports in eastern Washington shut down because of ash accumulation and poor visibility. Over a thousand commercial flights were cancelled following airport closures.[6] Fine-grained, gritty ash caused substantial problems for internal-combustion engines and other mechanical and electrical equipment. The ash contaminated oil systems and clogged air filters, and scratched moving surfaces. Fine ash caused short circuits in electrical transformers, which in turn caused power blackouts.\\r\\nRemoving and disposing of the ash was a monumental task for some Eastern Washington communities. State and federal agencies estimated that over 2,400,000 cubic yards (1,800,000?m3) of ash, equivalent to about 900,000 tons in weight, were removed from highways and airports in Washington.[6] The ash removal cost $2.2 million and took 10 weeks in Yakima.[6] The need to remove ash quickly from transport routes and civil works dictated the selection of some disposal sites. Some cities used old quarries and existing sanitary landfills; others created dump sites wherever expedient. To minimize wind reworking of ash dumps, the surfaces of some disposal sites were covered with topsoil and seeded with grass. In Portland, the mayor eventually threatened businesses with fines if they failed to remove the ash from their parking lots.[37]\\r\\nA refined estimate of $1.1?billion ($2.74 billion in 2007 dollars[38]) was determined in a study by the International Trade Commission at the request of the United States Congress.[6] A supplemental appropriation of $951?million for disaster relief was voted by Congress, of which the largest share went to the Small Business Administration, U.S. Army Corps of Engineers and the Federal Emergency Management Agency.[6]\\r\\nThere were also indirect and intangible costs of the eruption. Unemployment in the immediate region of Mount St. Helens rose tenfold in the weeks immediately following the eruption, and then returned to near-normal levels once timber-salvaging and ash-cleanup operations were underway. Only a small percentage of residents left the region because of lost jobs owing to the eruption.[6] Several months after May 18, a few residents reported suffering stress and emotional problems, even though they had coped successfully during the crisis. Counties in the region requested funding for mental health programs to assist such people.[6]\\r\\nInitial public reaction to the May 18 eruption dealt a nearly crippling blow to tourism, an important industry in Washington. Not only was tourism down in the Mount St. HelensÿGifford Pinchot National Forest area, but conventions, meetings and social gatherings also were cancelled or postponed at cities and resorts elsewhere in Washington and neighboring Oregon not affected by the eruption. The adverse effect on tourism and conventioneering, however, proved only temporary. Mount St. Helens, perhaps because of its reawakening, has regained its appeal for tourists. The United States Forest Service and the State of Washington opened visitor centers and provided access for people to view the volcano's devastation.[6]\\r\\nSt. Helens produced an additional five explosive eruptions between May and October 1980. Through early 1990 at least 21 periods of eruptive activity had occurred. The volcano remains active, with smaller, dome-building eruptions continuing into 2008.\\r\\nAn eruption occurred on May 25, 1980, at 2:30?a.m. that sent an ash column 9 miles (14?km) into the atmosphere.[33] The eruption was preceded by a sudden increase in earthquake activity and occurred during a rainstorm. Erratic wind from the storm carried ash from the eruption to the south and west, lightly dusting large parts of western Washington and Oregon. Pyroclastic flows exited the northern breach and covered avalanche debris, lahars and other pyroclastic flows deposited by the May 18 eruption.[33]\\r\\nAt 7:05?p.m. on June 12, a plume of ash billowed 2.5 miles (4.0?km) above the volcano. At 9:09?p.m. a much stronger explosion sent an ash column about 10 miles (16?km) skyward.[39] This event caused the Portland area, previously spared by wind direction, to be thinly coated with ash in the middle of the annual Rose Festival.[40] A dacite dome then oozed into existence on the crater floor, growing to a height of 200 feet (61?m) and a width of 1,200 feet (370?m) within a week.[39]\\r\\nA series of large explosions on July 22 broke more than a month of relative quiet. The July eruptive episode was preceded by several days of measurable expansion of the summit area, heightened earthquake activity, and changed emission rates of sulfur dioxide and carbon dioxide. The first hit at 5:14?p.m. as an ash column shot 10 miles (16?km) and was followed by a faster blast at 6:25?p.m. that pushed the ash column above its previous maximum height in just 7.5?minutes.[39] The final explosion started at 7:01?p.m. and continued for over two hours.[39] When the relatively small amount of ash settled over eastern Washington, the dome built in June was gone.[41]\\r\\nSeismic activity and gas emission steadily increased in early August, and on August 7 at 4:26?p.m., an ash cloud slowly expanded 8 miles (13?km) into the sky.[41] Small pyroclastic flows came through the northern breach and a weaker outpouring of ash rose from the crater. This continued until 10:32?p.m. when a second large blast sent ash high into the air, proceeding due north.[41] A second dacite dome filled this vent a few days later.\\r\\nTwo months of repose were ended by an eruption lasting from October 16 to 18. This event obliterated the second dome, sent ash 10 miles (16?km) in the air and created small, red-hot pyroclastic flows.[41] A third dome began to form within 30?minutes after the final explosion on October 18, and within a few days, it was about 900 feet (270?m) wide and 130 feet (40?m) high. In spite of the dome growth next to it, a new glacier formed rapidly inside the crater.\\r\\nAll of the post-1980 eruptions were quiet dome-building events, beginning with the December 27, 1980, to January 3, 1981, episode. By 1987 the third dome had grown to be more than 3,000 feet (910?m) wide and 800 feet (240?m) high.[41]\\r\\nFurther eruptions occurred over a few months between 1989 and 1991.\\r\\nThe 2004ÿ08 volcanic activity of Mount St. Helens has been documented as a continuous eruption with a gradual extrusion of magma at the Mount St. Helens volcano. Starting in October 2004 there was a gradual building of a new lava dome. The new dome did not rise above the caldera created by the 1980 eruption. This activity lasted until January 2008.\\r\\nMay 18, 1980, eruption of Mount St. Helens\\r\\n?This article incorporates public domain material?from the?United States Geological Survey document:?\\"Eruptions of Mount St. Helens: Past, Present, and Future\\".

It is the largest amusement park company in the world, based on the number of properties owned, and is ranked seventh in terms of attendance.[4] The company maintains twenty five properties throughout North America including theme parks, thrill parks, water parks, and family entertainment centers. In 2017, Six Flags properties hosted 30.4?million guests.[4]\\r\\n\\r\\nSix Flags was founded in Texas and derived its name from its first property, Six Flags Over Texas. The company maintains a corporate office in Midtown Manhattan and its headquarters are in Grand Prairie, Texas. On June 13, 2009, the corporation filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection, which it successfully exited after restructuring on May 3, 2010.[5][6][7]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe name \\"Six Flags\\" refers to the flags of the six different nations that have governed Texas: Spain, France, Mexico, the Republic of Texas, the United States, and the Confederate States of America.[8] The original park was (and still is) split into separate regions, such as the Spain and Mexico section which featured Spanish-themed rides, attractions, and buildings.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Six Flags chain originated in 1957 with the creation of The Great Southwest Corporation by Angus G. Wynne and other investors. Construction of \\"Six Flags Over Texas\\" started in 1960, and the park was opened the next year for a short (45-day) season. The first park initially featured a Native American village, a gondola ride, a railroad, some Wild West shows, a stagecoach ride, and \\"Skull Island\\", a pirate-themed adventure attraction. There was also an excursion, inspired by the historical La Salle Expeditions in the late 1600s, called \\"LaSalle's River Adventure\\", aboard French riverboats through a wilderness full of animated puppets.[9][10] Over time, all of those attractions, except for the railroad, would be replaced by others, such as roller coasters, swing rides, log flumes, and shoot-the-chute rides, as well as an observation tower.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe original park, Six Flags Over Texas in Arlington (between Dallas and Fort Worth) was sold in 1966 to a subsidiary of the Pennsylvania Railroad, which was actively pursuing non-railroad investments in an effort to diversify its sources of income. (In 1968, the Pennsylvania Railroad merged with the New York Central Railroad to form Penn Central Corp.) With the new owners came a more abundant supply of capital for geographic expansion and park additions. Six Flags opened Six Flags Over Georgia in 1967 and Six Flags Over Mid-America in 1971, which would, along with Six Flags Over Texas, be the only three parks that would be constructed by the company.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe company continued to grow by acquiring independent parks. Six Flags purchased AstroWorld in Houston, Texas in 1975, Great Adventure in Jackson, New Jersey in 1977 and Magic Mountain in Valencia, California in 1979. These purchases were followed by Penn Central selling assets to Bally Manufacturing in 1982.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1984, the Great America theme park in Gurnee, Illinois was acquired from the Marriott hotel chain.\\r\\n\\r\\nAlso in 1984, as a result of its acquisition of Great America, Six Flags acquired the rights to Time Warner/Warner Bros.' Looney Tunes animated characters for use in Six Flags properties. Bally surrendered control of the chain to Wesray Capital Corporation in a 1987 leveraged buyout. Time Warner quickly began to gain more leverage in the company, gaining a 19.5% stake in Six Flags in 1990 and then 50% in 1991, with the remaining shares of the company being split by Blackstone Group and Wertheim Schroder & Company. Time Warner purchased the remaining stake in Six Flags in 1993, changing the company's name from Six Flags Corp. to Six Flags Theme Parks, Inc.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1996, Six Flags began to manage Fiesta Texas theme park in San Antonio, Texas and purchased the park from USAA in 1998.\\r\\n\\r\\nPremier Parks originally operated as the Tierco Group, Inc., an Oklahoma-based real estate company. The company purchased the Frontier City theme park in Oklahoma City in 1982 for $1.2?million, although Tierco had no intention of entering the amusement park business. Company officials described Frontier City as \\"beat up\\" and \\"run down\\"; they planned to demolish it, subdivide the land, and build a shopping center. However, given an oil bust in Oklahoma, developers lost interest in converting the park into a shopping center. In 1984 Tierco hired Gary Story as general manager of Frontier City and sunk about $13?million into improving the park. As the new head of Frontier City, he quadrupled the park's attendance and revenues. Under his leadership, two rides, a ticket booth, sales office, and a petting zoo were added to the park. Food service improved.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1988, Tierco shifted its strategic direction to amusement parks. It sold much of its property in the late 1980s, generating capital to reinvest in Frontier City. As this reinvestment paid off, more capital became available, creating further growth. By 1991, Tierco opened White Water waterpark in Oklahoma City (the name later became White Water Bay). The company realized the key to boosting a park's attendance was to add new and exciting rides, and make it family-friendly.\\r\\n\\r\\nTierco acquired the financially troubled Wild World in Largo, Maryland, in 1992 and later changed that park's name to Adventure World. With a $500,000 investment, Tierco expanded Wild World's kiddie section and remodeled its buildings to give the park a tropical look and feel. Story was promoted to executive vice president after the purchase of Wild World. In 1994, he was promoted again to president and chief operating officer (COO). More flat rides and two roller coasters were added to that park.\\r\\n\\r\\nSince Tierco was on its way to becoming a \\"premier\\" regional theme park operator, in 1994 it changed its name to Premier Parks, Inc. Kieran E. Burke, chairman and chief executive officer (CEO), noted that the new name signified the beginning of a new era for the company.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the second half of the 1990s, Premier picked up speed. In 1995, the company acquired these Funtime Parks, Inc. properties: Geauga Lake near Cleveland, Ohio, Wyandot Lake in Powell, Ohio, Darien Lake near Buffalo, New York, and Lake Compounce in Bristol, Connecticut. In 1996, Premier added to its portfolio, buying Elitch Gardens in Denver, Colorado, the Waterworld USA waterparks in Sacramento and Concord, California, Riverside Park in Agawam, Massachusetts, and Great Escape and Splashwater Kingdom in Lake George, New York. Premier immediately sold the Lake Compounce park to Kennywood in Pennsylvania.\\r\\n\\r\\nGeauga Lake, Wyandot Lake, and Adventure World included water parks, while Frontier City was 14.8 miles away from White Water Bay that required separate admission. Riverside added one just before being sold. Premier Parks, in 1995 and 1996, added water parks to Darien Lake, Lake Compounce (immediately before the Kennywood sale), Elitch Gardens, and Great Escape.\\r\\n\\r\\nPremier went public in 1996 and raised nearly $70 million through an initial offering at $18 per share. The company planned to use the money to expand its ten parks and acquire others. In 1997, Premier purchased Kentucky Kingdom in Louisville, and Marine World near San Francisco. A second public offering, at $29 per share, raised an additional $2 million.\\r\\n\\r\\nNearly 8.8?million people visited Premier's parks in 1996.\\r\\n\\r\\nPremier added amusement park rides and roller coasters to Marine World in 1998.\\r\\n\\r\\nSix Flags Theme Parks, Inc. was purchased in whole on April 1, 1998 from Time Warner by Premier Parks for $1.86?billion.[11] Premier began to apply the Six Flags name to several smaller parks that the company had already owned: Darien Lake, Elitch Gardens, Kentucky Kingdom, and Adventure World.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1999, Premier Parks purchased Warner Bros. Movie World Germany and the yet-to-be-built Warner Bros. Movie World Madrid from Warner Bros.. As part of the acquisition Premier Parks had the opportunity to open more European theme parks with Warner Bros. Movie World branding. Warner Bros. Movie World on the Gold Coast, Australia was not part of the deal. The same transaction saw Premier Parks obtain exclusive rights for Warner Bros. licensing in Europe and Latin America, in addition to their existing rights for the United States and Canada.[12]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 2000, Premier Parks assumed the Six Flags Theme Parks, Inc. name and continued re-branding its parks, including the Geauga Lake park into Six Flags Ohio and Riverside Park to Six Flags New England. Six Flags began a vigorous expansion, attempting to branch out internationally, acquiring numerous properties across the USA, plus the Walibi chain, and the historic Belgian park Bellewaerde in Europe, La Ronde in Montreal, Quebec, Canada, and Reino Aventura in Mexico. Three of those parks were re-branded as Six Flags parks: Walibi Flevo became Six Flags Holland, Walibi Wavre became Six Flags Belgium, and Reino Aventura became Six Flags Mexico.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 2001, Six Flags acquired the former SeaWorld Ohio from Anheuser-Busch, merged it with the adjacent Six Flags Ohio and re-branded the combined park as Six Flags Worlds of Adventure.[13] The park was positioned to compete against northern Ohio's Cedar Point.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 2004, Six Flags began to close and sell properties in an effort to help alleviate the company's growing debt. On March 10, Six Flags sold its European parks, with the exception of the Movie World park in Madrid, Spain, to Star Parks, a division of Palamon Capital Partners.[14] The Madrid park was sold back to Time Warner and renamed \\"Parque Warner Madrid\\".[15] In April, Six Flags determined that the investment required to keep Worlds of Adventure competitive with Cedar Point would be too great, leading to that park being sold to Cedar Fair.[16] These sales raised $345?million in an effort to relieve Six Flags' massive debt.[17]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 2005, Six Flags endured even more turmoil. Some of the company's largest investors, notably Bill Gates's Cascade Investments (which then owned about 11% of Six Flags) and Daniel Snyder's Red Zone, LLC (which owned 12%), demanded change. On August 17, 2005, Red Zone began a proxy battle to gain control of Six Flags' board of directors. On August 29, Six Flags New Orleans was severely damaged by Hurricane Katrina.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn September 12, Six Flags Chief Executive Officer Kieran Burke announced that Six Flags AstroWorld would be closed and demolished at the end of the 2005 season. The company cited issues such as the park's performance, and parking issues involving the Houston Texans football team, Reliant Stadium, and the Houston Livestock Show and Rodeo, leveraged with the estimated value of the property which included the park. Company executives were expecting to receive upwards of $150?million for the real estate, but ended up receiving $77?million when the bare property (which cost $20?million to clear) was sold to a development corporation in 2006.[18]\\r\\n\\r\\nOn November 22, Red Zone announced it had gained control of the board. Kieran Burke was removed on December 14 and replaced by Mark Shapiro, former executive vice president of programming at ESPN. Six Flags then named former Representative Jack Kemp, entertainment mogul Harvey Weinstein, and Michael Kassan, the former president of the Interpublic Group of Companies Incorporated, to their newly revamped board of directors.\\r\\n\\r\\nEven with the new management team, the sell-off would continue into 2006. On January 27, Six Flags announced the sale of Frontier City and White Water Bay after the 2006 operating season. At the same time, Six Flags announced it would close corporate offices in Oklahoma City, moving its headquarters to New York City. Six Flags CEO Mark Shapiro said he expected the parks to continue operation after the sale, a lesson the company learned after its public relations debacle with the closure of AstroWorld. In June, Six Flags announced it was considering closing or selling up to six of its parks, including Elitch Gardens, Darien Lake, WaterWorld in (Concord, California), Wild Waves and Enchanted Village in Federal Way, Washington, Splashtown in Houston, Texas and, most notably, Six Flags Magic Mountain.[19] In addition, Six Flags announced the sale of Wyandot Lake in Powell, Ohio to the neighboring Columbus Zoo and Aquarium.[20] Ultimately, Six Flags Magic Mountain was spared, with the remaining six parks sold on January 11, 2007 to CNL Lifestyle Properties for $312?million: $275?million cash and a note for $37?million.[21]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe company's cash flow had decreased by over $120 million annually during the Shapiro years. In October 2008, Six Flags was warned its stock value had fallen below the required minimums to remain listed on the New York Stock Exchange.[22] With the financial crisis of 2007ÿ2008 weighing both on consumer spending and the ability to access credit facilities, Six Flags was believed to be unable to make a payment to preferred stockholders due in August 2009.[23] Management saw the business as a sound one, noting that attendance across the company's parks increased slightly in 2008 compared to 2007.[22] Six Flags CEO Mark Shapiro said that the company's problem was the declining attendance and cash flow created by his new management initiatives.[22] If not resolved, the company warned in its 2008 annual report[24] that the situation might require a Chapter 11 bankruptcy filing, with Six Flags already retaining counsel should that occur.[23] The company stated at the time that it expected business to continue as normal in the event of such a filing,[22] although one analyst believed attendance at the company's parks would decrease by six percent, suggesting parents would be leery of letting their children ride a roller coaster operated by a bankrupt company.[23] In April 2009, the New York Stock Exchange announced it would delist Six Flags' stock on April 20, a decision that the company did not intend to appeal.[25] On June 1, 2009, Six Flags announced they would delay their $15?million debt payment further using a 30-day grace period. Less than two weeks later, on June 13, the firm filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection,[6][26] but issued a statement that the parks would continue to operate normally while the company restructured.[27] On August 21, 2009, Six Flags' Chapter 11 restructuring plan was announced in which lenders would control 92% of the company in exchange for cancelling $1.13?billion in debt.[28]\\r\\n\\r\\nOne component of the restructuring was negotiating a new lease agreement with the Kentucky State Fair Board, which owned much of the land and attractions for Six Flags Kentucky Kingdom.[29] Six Flags had asked to forgo rent payments for the remaining nine years of its current lease agreement in exchange for profit-sharing from the park's operations.[30] When it appeared that the offer had been rejected, Six Flags announced in February 2010 that it would not re-open the park.[29] However, the Kentucky State Fair Board stated at the time that they were still open to negotiating a revised lease agreement.[31]\\r\\n\\r\\nOn April 28, 2010, the company's bondholders reached an agreement on a reorganization plan.[32] Junior note holders, including hedge funds Stark Investments and Pentwater Capital Management,[7] assumed control of the company, while senior note holders were paid in cash.[32] Despite objections from some parties who stood to gain nothing,[32] the bankruptcy judge approved the plan on April 30, 2010.[33] As part of the settlement, chairman of the board Dan Snyder was removed, while chief executive officer Mark Shapiro briefly remained in his post.[33]\\r\\n\\r\\nSix Flags officially emerged from bankruptcy protection as Six Flags Entertainment Corp. on May 3, 2010, and announced plans to issue new stock on the New York Stock Exchange.[7]  Amid suspected disagreements regarding the future of the company with the board, Shapiro left the company and Al Weber, Jr. was brought in as interim president and CEO.[34]  The company announced their corporate headquarters would move from New York City to Grand Prairie, Texas.[35]\\r\\n\\r\\nSix Flags announced that Jim Reid-Anderson would replace Weber and become chairman, president and chief executive officer (CEO) on August 13, 2010.[36] John Duffey also joined the company in 2010,[37] taking the role of chief financial officer (CFO).[38] As of October 1, 2012, Al Weber, Jr. had retired as chief operating officer (COO) with no immediate successor.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn February 18, 2016, Six Flags announced that Jim Reid-Anderson had been promoted as executive chairman and John M. Duffey succeeded him as president and CEO.[37][38]\\r\\n\\r\\nOn January 11, 2016, Six Flags announced Six Flags Zhejiang, then named Six Flags Haiyan, in China. On the same day, a website was created along with concept art for the property.[39] A month later on February 2, 2016. Six Flags announced Six Flags Hurricane Harbor Oaxtepec.[40] The water park, originally named Parque Acuatico Oaxtepec, is a 76-acre park located in Morelos that went bankrupt in 2011.[41]\\r\\n\\r\\nOn March 21, 2016, Six Flags announced a partnership with NaVi Entertainment to build a Six Flags-branded theme park and a Six Flags Hurricane Harbor-branded water park in Vietnam.[42]\\r\\n\\r\\nOn March 29, 2016, Six Flags announced the revival of its previously cancelled Six Flags Dubai.  As part of the second phase of the Dubai Parks and Resorts project in Jebel Ali, the park is expected to open in 2019.[43]\\r\\n\\r\\nOn July 20, 2016, Six Flags announced an agreement with Riverside Investment Group Co. Ltd. for the development of a second Six Flags-branded theme park in China together with a water park. The two parks will be located in Bishan District, a district of Chongqing.[44]\\r\\n\\r\\nOn April 27, 2017, the company announced it would take over operations of Waterworld California in Concord, California making it Six Flags' 20th property.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn July 18, 2017, Six Flags announced that president and CEO John M. Duffey had retired from the company and Jim Reid-Anderson had re-assumed the roles of chairman, president, and CEO.[37][45]\\r\\n\\r\\nOn May 22, 2018, Six Flags announced the purchase of operating leases for five parks owned by EPR Properties. The parks are Darien Lake, Frontier City, Wet'n'Wild Phoenix, Wet'n'Wild SplashTown, and White Water Bay.[46]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 2004, although DC Comics and Looney Tunes as well as Scooby-Doo still had a major presence at the parks, Six Flags began a new series of commercials for the parks. The commercials introduced a new mascot: \\"Mr. Six\\", a seemingly feeble old man in a tuxedo and red bow tie. In many of the commercials, Mr. Six would slowly exit a multi-colored bus, only to start frenetically dancing to the Vengaboys' \\"We Like to Party\\". The commercials were an immediate hit and Mr. Six almost instantly became the de facto mascot, and his presence was felt for years after the character was retired. These ads have become widely parodied on the Internet, with faces from other Internet memes being superimposed over Mr. Six's face.\\r\\n\\r\\nFrom 2008 to 2010, Six Flags' TV ads consisted of a \\"Fun-O-Meter\\" in which the beginning of the ad showed something boring or embarrassing and a man's face judges it \\"One Flag!\\" or sometimes \\" Oh! Two Flags!\\" Then roller coasters and attractions of Six Flags are shown and says \\"Six Flags! More Flags, More Fun!\\" for Six Flags parks. However, the thick accent of the Asian man in the original commercials had drawn criticism for being an offensive caricature.[47] In 2009, the Mr. Six character came back from retirement and replaced the Asian man in Six Flags' ads, still using the Fun-O-Meter. In 2011, Six Flags' TV ads got a brand-new slogan \\"Go Big! Go Six Flags!\\" for its theme parks.\\r\\n\\r\\nSix Flags has licensed its name and its theme park creations to other companies, who have used these assets to create licensed products. One notable such example is the theme park simulation game Roller Coaster Tycoon 2, which featured recreations of Six Flags parks and rides that could be expanded and operated at the player's discretion.\\r\\n\\r\\nSix Flags has approximately 18 known partners. These partners include Dole, Armitron, Mike and Ike, Barcel, Good Humor, Nathans, Coca-Cola, Icee, Ortega, Cold Stone, J&J Snack Foods, Red Gold, Coppertone, Johnny Rockets, Samsung, Dasani, Mars chocolate and Tyson. These businesses help the park generate more income. Most importantly it provides more jobs for prospective employees. For example, Barcel USA has just expanded their partnership. This helps to import food and beverages to increase sponsorships within the U.S.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 2008, Six Flags partnered with Brash Entertainment to create a video game based on the Six Flags parks named Six Flags Fun Park.[citation needed] The game was first released on the Nintendo DS and PC in October 2008. The Wii version was delayed after Brash Entertainment went out of business and so the rights were taken over by Ubisoft and released the game on the Wii in March 2009. The game allows players to explore the themed areas and mini-games representative of a visit to a Six Flags park. In the game, players are tasked with quests that encourage them to explore the park's universe. After creating a unique custom character, Six Flags Fun Park patrons can win prizes, and compete with other players in 40 mini-games. Although the video game is called Six Flags Fun Park, it lacks any major reference of Six Flags outside of the names of the different areas. This caused some to speculate that the video game was created separately, then the rights to the name of the game were sold as a way to pay for the game's development.[citation needed] When the game was released, it eventually ended up getting abysmal ratings across the board. IGN gave the Wii version a 4.5 out of 10, saying \\"The quests are uninteresting and the game's '40 Thrilling Games' (as touted by the box) are far from entertaining.\\"[citation needed]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn recent years, Six Flags has created strategic partnerships with other companies who would feature their products inside the parks. On March 30, 2006, Six Flags announced that it will sell no other pizza besides Papa John's at its parks. In turn, Six Flags will receive an annual sponsorship and promotional opportunities from Papa John's, though financial details of the deal have not been disclosed. However, in the 2011 season, it was replaced by another pizza brand. Other recent partners have included Cold Stone Creamery, Johnny Rockets, Tyson Foods (chicken), Chrysler, and Nintendo, which added testing stations in several parks to show off its Wii console.[48]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn late 2010, Six Flags began the process of removing Non-WB licensed theming from attractions. They terminated licenses with Thomas the Tank Engine, The Wiggles, Tony Hawk, Evel Knievel, and Terminator.[49][50] However, since then there has been an expansion of licensing agreements with Warner Bros., with whom the company park has had a long-standing relationship with. The expansion lies specifically with Warner Bros. DC Comics brand, where the two teamed up to create the innovative Justice League: Battle for Metropolis as well as many other roller coasters and other rides.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn May 18, 2017, Six Flags and Riverside Group signed an agreement with Paws, Inc. to use Garfield in children's areas in Six Flags-branded theme parks in China.[51]\\r\\n\\r\\nOn June 19, 2007, Six Flags announced it had purchased 40% of Dick Clark Productions, which owns rights to American Bandstand and other shows and productions.[52]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 2012, Jim Reid-Anderson stated that the company would sell its stake in Dick Clark Productions.\\r\\n\\r\\nThese properties are listed in alphabetical order by the final name of the park while under Six Flags control.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis park includes Six Flags Splashwater Kingdom water park, which opened in 1992.\\r\\nIn February 2010, Six Flags announced it would close the park due to a dispute with the Kentucky State Fair Board, from which Six Flags leased much of the park's land area and attractions.[30] In 2014, Kentucky Kingdom reopened under new management.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was closed after severe damage from Hurricane Katrina in 2005. The city of New Orleans sued Six Flags in 2009 for not making progress to re-open and for not making required lease payments;[62] ultimately, the site was turned over to the city along with a cash payment.[63] In 2011, the city made plans to auction the site and all remaining rides and equipment.[64]","input":"Where is the first six flags amusement park?"},{"output":"macOS High Sierra","context":"macOS (/?m?ko???s/;[6] previously Mac OS X and later OS X) is the current series of Unix-based graphical operating systems developed and marketed by Apple Inc. designed to run on Apple's Macintosh computers (\\"Macs\\"). It has been preinstalled on all Macs since 2002. Within the market of desktop, laptop and home computers, and by web usage, it is the second most widely used desktop OS after Microsoft Windows.[7][8]\\r\\nLaunched in 2001 as Mac OS X, the series is the latest in the family of Macintosh operating systems. Mac OS X succeeded \\"classic\\" Mac OS, which was introduced in 1984, and the final release of which was Mac OS 9 in 1999. An initial, early version of the system, Mac OS X Server 1.0, was released in 1999. The first desktop version, Mac OS X 10.0, followed in March 2001. Releases were code named after big cats from the original release up until OS X 10.8 Mountain Lion. Beginning in 2013 with OS X 10.9 Mavericks, releases have been named after landmarks in California.[9] Apple changed the original name \\"Mac OS X\\" to \\"OS X\\" in 2012 and then to \\"macOS\\" in 2016, adopting the nomenclature that it uses for their other operating systems, iOS, watchOS, and tvOS. The latest version of macOS is macOS High Sierra, which was publicly released in September 2017.\\r\\nmacOS is based on technologies developed at NeXT between 1985 and 1997, when Apple acquired the company. The \\"X\\" in Mac OS X and OS X is pronounced \\"ten\\", as it is the Roman numeral for the number 10. The X was a prominent part of the operating system's brand identity, and was used to showcase its Unix compatibility; UNIX 03 certification was achieved for the Intel version of Mac OS X 10.5 Leopard[10] and all releases from Mac OS X 10.6 Snow Leopard up to the current version also have UNIX 03 certification.[11][12][13][14][15][16][17] macOS shares its Unix-based core, named Darwin, and many of its frameworks with iOS,[18] tvOS and watchOS. A heavily modified version of Mac OS X 10.4 Tiger was used for the first-generation Apple TV.[19]\\r\\nApple also used to have a separate line of releases of Mac OS X designed for servers. Beginning with Mac OS X 10.7 Lion, the server functions were made available as a separate package on the Mac App Store.\\r\\nReleases of Mac OS X from 1999 to 2005 can run only on the PowerPC-based Macs from the time period. After Apple announced that they were switching to Intel CPUs from 2006 onwards, a separate version of Mac OS X 10.4 Tiger was made and distributed exclusively with early Intel-based Macs; it included an emulator known as Rosetta, which allowed users to run most PowerPC applications on Intel-based Macs. Mac OS X 10.5 Leopard was released as a Universal binary, meaning the installer disc supported both Intel and PowerPC processors. In 2009, Apple released Mac OS X 10.6 Snow Leopard, which ran exclusively on Intel-based Macs. In 2011, Apple released Mac OS X 10.7 Lion, which no longer supported 32-bit Intel processors and also did not include Rosetta. All versions of the system released since then run exclusively on 64-bit Intel CPUs and do not support PowerPC applications.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe heritage of what would become macOS had originated at NeXT, a company founded by Steve Jobs following his departure from Apple in 1985. There, the Unix-like NeXTSTEP operating system was developed, and then launched in 1989. The kernel of NeXTSTEP is based upon the Mach kernel, which was originally developed at Carnegie Mellon University, with additional kernel layers and low-level user space code derived from parts of BSD. Its graphical user interface was built on top of an object-oriented GUI toolkit using the Objective-C programming language.\\r\\nThroughout the early 1990s, Apple had tried to create a \\"next-generation\\" OS to succeed its classic Mac OS through the Taligent, Copland and Gershwin projects, but all of them were eventually abandoned.[20] This led Apple to purchase NeXT in 1996, allowing NeXTSTEP, then called OPENSTEP, to serve as the basis for Apple's next generation operating system.[21] This purchase also led to Steve Jobs returning to Apple as an interim, and then the permanent CEO, shepherding the transformation of the programmer-friendly OPENSTEP into a system that would be adopted by Apple's primary market of home users and creative professionals. The project was first code named \\"Rhapsody\\" and then officially named Mac OS X.[22][23]\\r\\nMac OS X was originally presented as the tenth major version of Apple's operating system for Macintosh computers; current versions of macOS retain the major version number \\"10\\". Previous Macintosh operating systems (versions of the classic Mac OS) were named using Arabic numerals, e.g. Mac OS 8 and Mac OS 9. The letter \\"X\\" in Mac OS X's name refers to the number 10, a Roman numeral. It is therefore correctly pronounced \\"ten\\" /?t?n/ in this context.[24][25] However, it is also commonly pronounced like the letter \\"X\\" /??ks/.[26]\\r\\nThe first version of Mac OS X, Mac OS X Server 1.0, was a transitional product, featuring an interface resembling the classic Mac OS, though it was not compatible with software designed for the older system. Consumer releases of Mac OS X included more backward compatibility. Mac OS applications could be rewritten to run natively via the Carbon API; many could also be run directly through the Classic Environment with a reduction in performance.\\r\\nThe consumer version of Mac OS X was launched in 2001 with Mac OS X 10.0. Reviews were variable, with extensive praise for its sophisticated, glossy Aqua interface but criticizing it for sluggish performance.[27] With Apple's popularity at a low, the makers of several classic Mac applications such as FrameMaker and PageMaker declined to develop new versions of their software for Mac OS X.[28] Ars Technica columnist John Siracusa, who reviewed every major OS X release up to 10.10, described the early releases in retrospect as 'dog-slow, feature poor' and Aqua as 'unbearably slow and a huge resource hog'.[27][29][30]\\r\\nApple rapidly developed several new releases of Mac OS X.[31] Siracusa's review of version 10.3, Panther, noted \\"It's strange to have gone from years of uncertainty and vaporware to a steady annual supply of major new operating system releases.\\"[32] Version 10.4, Tiger, reportedly shocked executives at Microsoft by offering a number of features, such as fast file searching and improved graphics processing, that Microsoft had spent several years struggling to add to Windows with acceptable performance.[33]\\r\\nAs the operating system evolved, it moved away from the classic Mac OS, with applications being added and removed.[34] Considering music to be a key market, Apple developed the iPod music player and music software for the Mac, including iTunes and GarageBand.[35] Targeting the consumer and media markets, Apple emphasized its new \\"digital lifestyle\\" applications such as the iLife suite, integrated home entertainment through the Front Row media center and the Safari web browser. With increasing popularity of the internet, Apple offered additional online services, including the .Mac, MobileMe and most recently iCloud products. It later began selling third-party applications through the Mac App Store.\\r\\nNewer versions of Mac OS X also included modifications to the general interface, moving away from the striped gloss and transparency of the initial versions. Some applications began to use a brushed metal appearance, or non-pinstriped titlebar appearance in version 10.4.[36] In Leopard, Apple announced a unification of the interface, with a standardized gray-gradient window style.[37][38]\\r\\nIn 2006, the first Intel Macs released used a specialized version of Mac OS X 10.4 Tiger.[39] In 2007, Mac OS X 10.5 Leopard was the first to run on both PowerPC and Intel Macs with the use of universal binaries.[40] Mac OS X 10.6 Snow Leopard was the first version of OS X to drop support for PowerPC Macs.[41]\\r\\nA key development for the system was the announcement and release of the iPhone from 2007 onwards. While Apple's previous iPod media players used a minimal operating system, the iPhone used an operating system based on Mac OS X, which would later be called \\"iPhone OS\\" and then iOS. The simultaneous release of two operating systems based on the same frameworks placed tension on Apple, which cited the iPhone as forcing it to delay Mac OS X 10.5 Leopard.[42] However, after Apple opened the iPhone to third-party developers its commercial success drew attention to Mac OS X, with many iPhone software developers showing interest in Mac development.[43]\\r\\nIn two succeeding versions, Lion and Mountain Lion, Apple moved some applications to a highly skeuomorphic style of design inspired by contemporary versions of iOS, at the same time simplifying some elements by making controls such as scroll bars fade out when not in use.[29] This direction was, like brushed metal interfaces, unpopular with some users, although it continued a trend of greater animation and variety in the interface previously seen in design aspects such as the Time Machine backup utility, which presented past file versions against a swirling nebula, and the glossy translucent dock of Leopard and Snow Leopard.[44] In addition, with Mac OS X 10.7 Lion, Apple ceased to release separate server versions of Mac OS X, selling server tools as a separate downloadable application through the Mac App Store. A review described the trend in the server products as becoming \\"cheaper and simpler... shifting its focus from large businesses to small ones.\\"[45]\\r\\nIn 2012, with the release of OS X 10.8 Mountain Lion, the name of the system was shortened from Mac OS X to OS X. That year, Apple removed the head of OS X development, Scott Forstall, and design was changed towards a more minimal direction.[46] Apple's new user interface design, using deep color saturation, text-only buttons and a minimal, 'flat' interface, was debuted with iOS 7 in 2013. With OS X engineers reportedly working on iOS 7, the version released in 2013, OS X 10.9 Mavericks, was something of a transitional release, with some of the skeuomorphic design removed, while most of the general interface of Mavericks remained unchanged.[47] The next version, OS X 10.10 Yosemite, adopted a design similar to iOS 7 but with greater complexity suitable for an interface controlled with a mouse.[48]\\r\\nFrom 2012 onwards, the system has shifted to an annual release schedule similar to that of iOS. It also steadily cut the cost of updates from Snow Leopard onwards, before removing upgrade fees altogether from 2013 onwards.[49] Some journalists and third-party software developers have suggested that this decision, while allowing more rapid feature release, meant less opportunity to focus on stability, with no version of OS X recommendable for users requiring stability and performance above new features.[50] Apple's 2015 update, OS X 10.11 El Capitan, was announced to focus specifically on stability and performance improvements.[51]\\r\\nIn 2016, with the release of macOS 10.12 Sierra, the name was changed from OS X to macOS to streamline it with the branding of Apple's other primary operating systems: iOS, watchOS, and tvOS.[52]\\r\\nmacOS 10.12 Sierra's main features are the introduction of Siri to macOS, Optimized Storage, improvements to included applications, and greater integration with Apple's iPhone and Apple Watch. The Apple File System (APFS) was announced at the Apple Worldwide Developers Conference in 2016 as a replacement for HFS+, a highly criticized file system.[53]\\r\\nAt the 2017 Worldwide Developers Conference Apple previewed macOS 10.13 High Sierra. It uses APFS, rather than HFS+, on solid state drives.\\r\\nAt macOS's core is a POSIX compliant operating system built on top of the XNU kernel, with standard Unix facilities available from the command line interface. Apple has released this family of software as a free and open source operating system named Darwin. On top of Darwin, Apple layered a number of components, including the Aqua interface and the Finder, to complete the GUI-based operating system which is macOS.[54]\\r\\nWith its original introduction as Mac OS X, the system brought a number of new capabilities to provide a more stable and reliable platform than its predecessor, the classic Mac OS. For example, pre-emptive multitasking and memory protection improved the system's ability to run multiple applications simultaneously without them interrupting or corrupting each other.[55] Many aspects of macOS's architecture are derived from OPENSTEP, which was designed to be portable, to ease the transition from one platform to another. For example, NeXTSTEP was ported from the original 68k-based NeXT workstations to x86 and other architectures before NeXT was purchased by Apple,[56] and OPENSTEP was later ported to the PowerPC architecture as part of the Rhapsody project.\\r\\nPrior to macOS High Sierra, and on drives other than solid state drives (SSDs), the default file system is HFS+, which it inherited from the classic Mac OS. Operating system designer Linus Torvalds has criticized HFS+, saying it is \\"probably the worst file system ever\\", whose design is \\"actively corrupting user data\\". He criticized the case insensitivity of file names, a design made worse when Apple extended the file system to support Unicode.[57][58] Initially, HFS+ was designed for classic Mac OS, which runs on big-endian 68K and PowerPC systems. When Apple switched Macintosh to little-endian Intel processors, it continued to use big-endian byte order on HFS+ file systems. As a result, macOS on current Macs must do byte swap when it reads file system data.[59][60] These concerns are being addressed with the new Apple File System, which is used for file systems on SSDs in macOS High Sierra.\\r\\nThe Darwin subsystem in macOS is in charge of managing the file system, which includes the Unix permissions layer. In 2003 and 2005, two Macworld editors expressed criticism of the permission scheme; Ted Landau called misconfigured permissions \\"the most common frustration\\" in macOS, while Rob Griffiths suggested that some users may even have to reset permissions every day, a process which can take up to 15 minutes.[61] More recently, another Macworld editor, Dan Frakes, called the procedure of repairing permissions vastly overused.[62] He argues that macOS typically handles permissions properly without user interference, and resetting permissions should just be tried when problems emerge.[63]\\r\\nThe architecture of macOS incorporates a layered design:[64] the layered frameworks aid rapid development of applications by providing existing code for common tasks.[65] Apple provides its own software development tools, most prominently an integrated development environment called Xcode. Xcode provides interfaces to compilers that support several programming languages including C, C++, Objective-C, and Swift. For the AppleÿIntel transition, it was modified so that developers could build their applications as a universal binary, which provides compatibility with both the Intel-based and PowerPC-based Macintosh lines.[66] First and third-party applications can be controlled programatically using the AppleScript framework,[67] retained from the classic Mac OS,[68] or using the newer Automator application that offers pre-written tasks that do not require programming knowledge.[69]\\r\\nApple offered two main APIs to develop software natively for macOS: Cocoa and Carbon. Cocoa was a descendant of APIs inherited from OPENSTEP with no ancestry from the classic Mac OS, while Carbon was an adaptation of classic Mac OS APIs, allowing Mac software to be minimally rewritten in order to run natively on Mac OS X.\\r\\nThe Cocoa API was created as the result of a 1993 collaboration between NeXT Computer and Sun Microsystems. This heritage is highly visible for Cocoa developers, since the \\"NS\\" prefix is ubiquitous in the framework, standing variously for NeXTSTEP or NeXT/Sun. The official OPENSTEP API, published in September 1994, was the first to split the API between Foundation and ApplicationKit and the first to use the \\"NS\\" prefix.[56] Traditionally, Cocoa programs have been mostly written in Objective-C, with Java as an alternative. However, on July 11, 2005, Apple announced that \\"features added to Cocoa in Mac OS X versions later than 10.4 will not be added to the Cocoa-Java programming interface.\\"[79] macOS also used to support the Java Platform as a \\"preferred software package\\"in practice this means that applications written in Java fit as neatly into the operating system as possible while still being cross-platform compatible, and that graphical user interfaces written in Swing look almost exactly like native Cocoa interfaces. Since 2014, Apple has promoted its new programming language Swift as the preferred language for software development on Apple platforms.\\r\\nApple's original plan with macOS was to require all developers to rewrite their software into the Cocoa APIs. This caused much outcry among existing Mac developers, who threatened to abandon the platform rather than invest in a costly rewrite, and the idea was shelved.[23][80] To permit a smooth transition from Mac OS 9 to Mac OS X, the Carbon Application Programming Interface (API) was created.[23] Applications written with Carbon were initially able to run natively on both classic Mac OS and Mac OS X, although this ability was later dropped as Mac OS X developed. Carbon was not included in the first product sold as Mac OS X: the little-used original release of Mac OS X Server 1.0, which also did not include the Aqua interface.[81] Apple limited further development of Carbon from the release of Leopard onwards, announcing Carbon applications would not receive the ability to run at 64-bit.[80] As of 2015, a small number of older Mac OS X apps with heritage dating back to the classic Mac OS still used Carbon, including Microsoft Office. Early versions of macOS could also run some classic Mac OS applications through the Classic Environment with performance limitations; this feature was removed from 10.5 onwards and all Macs using Intel processors.\\r\\nBecause macOS is POSIX compliant, many software packages written for the other Unix-like systems such as Linux can be recompiled to run on it, including much scientific and technical software.[82] Third-party projects such as Homebrew, Fink, MacPorts and pkgsrc provide pre-compiled or pre-formatted packages. Apple and others have provided versions of the X Window System graphical interface which can allow these applications to run with an approximation of the macOS look-and-feel.[83][84][85] The current Apple-endorsed method is the open-source XQuartz project; earlier versions could use the X11 application provided by Apple, or before that the XDarwin project.[86]\\r\\nApplications can be distributed to Macs and installed by the user from any source and by any method such as downloading (with or without code signing, available via an Apple developer account) or through the Mac App Store, a marketplace of software maintained by Apple by way of a process requiring the company's approval. Apps installed through the Mac App Store run within a sandbox, restricting their ability to exchange information with other applications or modify the core operating system and its features. This has been cited as an advantage, by allowing users to install apps with confidence that they should not be able to damage their system, but also as a disadvantage, by blocking the Mac App Store's use by professional applications that require elevated privileges.[87][88] Applications without any code signature cannot be run by default except from a computer's administrator account.[89][90]\\r\\nApple produces macOS applications, some of which are included and some sold separately. This includes iWork, Final Cut Pro, Logic Pro, iLife, and the database application FileMaker. Numerous other developers also offer software for macOS.\\r\\nTools such as XPostFacto and patches applied to the installation media have been developed by third parties to enable installation of newer versions of macOS on systems not officially supported by Apple. This includes a number of pre-G3 Power Macintosh systems that can be made to run up to and including Mac OS X 10.2 Jaguar, all G3-based Macs which can run up to and including Tiger, and sub-867?MHz G4 Macs can run Leopard by removing the restriction from the installation DVD or entering a command in the Mac's Open Firmware interface to tell the Leopard Installer that it has a clock rate of 867?MHz or greater. Except for features requiring specific hardware (e.g. graphics acceleration or DVD writing), the operating system offers the same functionality on all supported hardware.\\r\\nAs most Mac hardware components, or components similar to those, since the Intel transition are available for purchase,[94] some technology-capable groups have developed software to install macOS on non-Apple computers. These are referred to as Hackintoshes, a portmanteau of the words \\"hack\\" and \\"Macintosh\\". This violates Apple's EULA (and is therefore unsupported by Apple technical support, warranties etc.), but communities that cater to personal users, who do not install for resale and profit, have generally been ignored by Apple.[95][96][97] These self-made computers allow more flexibility and customization of hardware, but at a cost of leaving the user more responsible for their own machine, such as on matter of data integrity or security.[98] Psystar, a business that attempted to profit from selling macOS on non-Apple certified hardware, was sued by Apple in 2008.[99]\\r\\nIn April 2002, eWeek announced a rumor that Apple had a version of Mac OS X code-named Marklar, which ran on Intel x86 processors. The idea behind Marklar was to keep Mac OS X running on an alternative platform should Apple become dissatisfied with the progress of the PowerPC platform.[100] These rumors subsided until late in May 2005, when various media outlets, such as The Wall Street Journal[101] and CNET,[102] announced that Apple would unveil Marklar in the coming months.[103][104][105]\\r\\nOn June 6, 2005, Steve Jobs announced in his keynote address at the annual Apple Worldwide Developers Conference that Apple would be making the transition from PowerPC to Intel processors over the following two years, and that Mac OS X would support both platforms during the transition. Jobs also confirmed rumors that Apple had versions of Mac OS X running on Intel processors for most of its developmental life. Intel-based Macs would run a new recompiled version of OS X along with Rosetta, a binary translation layer which enables software compiled for PowerPC Mac OS X to run on Intel Mac OS X machines.[106] The system was included with Mac OS X versions up to version 10.6.8.[107] Apple dropped support for Classic mode on the new Intel Macs. Third party emulation software such as Mini vMac, Basilisk II and SheepShaver provided support for some early versions of Mac OS. A new version of Xcode and the underlying command-line compilers supported building universal binaries that would run on either architecture.[108]\\r\\nPowerPC-only software is supported with Apple's official emulation software, Rosetta, though applications eventually had to be rewritten to run properly on the newer versions released for Intel processors. Apple initially encouraged developers to produce universal binaries with support for both PowerPC and Intel.[109] There is a performance penalty when PowerPC binaries run on Intel Macs through Rosetta. Moreover, some PowerPC software, such as kernel extensions and System Preferences plugins, are not supported on Intel Macs at all. Some PowerPC applications would not run on macOS at all. Plugins for Safari need to be compiled for the same platform as Safari, so when Safari is running on Intel, it requires plug-ins that have been compiled as Intel-only or universal binaries, so PowerPC-only plug-ins will not work.[110] While Intel Macs are able to run PowerPC, Intel, and universal binaries; PowerPC Macs support only universal and PowerPC builds.\\r\\nSupport for the PowerPC platform was dropped following the transition. In 2009, Apple announced at its Worldwide Developers Conference that Mac OS X 10.6 Snow Leopard would drop support for PowerPC processors and be Intel-only.[111] Rosetta continued to be offered as an optional download or installation choice in Snow Leopard before it was discontinued with Mac OS X 10.7 Lion.[112][112] In addition, new versions of Mac OS X first- and third-party software increasingly required Intel processors, including new versions of iLife, iWork, Aperture and Logic Pro.\\r\\nOne of the major differences between the classic Mac OS and the current macOS was the addition of Aqua, a graphical user interface with water-like elements, in the first major release of Mac OS X. Every window element, text, graphic, or widget is drawn on-screen using spatial anti-aliasing technology.[113] ColorSync, a technology introduced many years before, was improved and built into the core drawing engine, to provide color matching for printing and multimedia professionals.[114] Also, drop shadows were added around windows and isolated text elements to provide a sense of depth. New interface elements were integrated, including sheets (dialog boxes attached to specific windows) and drawers, which would slide out and provide options.\\r\\nThe use of soft edges, translucent colors, and pinstripes, similar to the hardware design of the first iMacs, brought more texture and color to the user interface when compared to what Mac OS 9 and Mac OS X Server 1.0's \\"Platinum\\" appearance had offered. According to John Siracusa, an editor of Ars Technica, the introduction of Aqua and its departure from the then conventional look \\"hit like a ton of bricks.\\"[115] Bruce Tognazzini (who founded the original Apple Human Interface Group) said that the Aqua interface in Mac OS X 10.0 represented a step backwards in usability compared with the original Mac OS interface.[116][117] Third-party developers started producing skins for customizable applications and other operating systems which mimicked the Aqua appearance. To some extent, Apple has used the successful transition to this new design as leverage, at various times threatening legal action against people who make or distribute software with an interface the company says is derived from its copyrighted design.[118]\\r\\nApple has continued to change aspects of the macOS appearance and design, particularly with tweaks to the appearance of windows and the menu bar. Since 2012, Apple has sold many of its Mac models with high-resolution Retina displays, and macOS and its APIs have extensive support for resolution-independent development on supporting high-resolution displays. Reviewers have described Apple's support for the technology as superior to that on Windows.[119][120][121]\\r\\nThe human interface guidelines published by Apple for macOS are followed by many applications, giving them consistent user interface and keyboard shortcuts.[122] In addition, new services for applications are included, which include spelling and grammar checkers, special characters palette, color picker, font chooser and dictionary; these global features are present in every Cocoa application, adding consistency. The graphics system OpenGL composites windows onto the screen to allow hardware-accelerated drawing. This technology, introduced in version 10.2, is called Quartz Extreme, a component of Quartz. Quartz's internal imaging model correlates well with the Portable Document Format (PDF) imaging model, making it easy to output PDF to multiple devices.[114] As a side result, PDF viewing and creating PDF documents from any application are built-in features.[123] Reflecting its popularity with design users, macOS also has system support for a variety of professional video and image formats and includes an extensive pre-installed font library, featuring many prominent brand-name designs.[124]\\r\\nThe Finder is a file browser allowing quick access to all areas of the computer, which has been modified throughout subsequent releases of macOS.[125][126] Quick Look is part of the Finder since version 10.5. It allows for dynamic previews of files, including videos and multi-page documents without opening any other applications. Spotlight, a file searching technology which has been integrated into the Finder since version 10.4, allows rapid real-time searches of data files; mail messages; photos; and other information based on item properties (metadata) and/or content.[127][128] macOS makes use of a Dock, which holds file and folder shortcuts as well as minimized windows.\\r\\nApple added \\"Expos\\" in version 10.3 (called Mission Control since version 10.7), a feature which includes three functions to help accessibility between windows and desktop. Its functions are to instantly display all open windows as thumbnails for easy navigation to different tasks, display all open windows as thumbnails from the current application, and hide all windows to access the desktop.[129] Also, FileVault was introduced, which is an optional encryption of the user's files with the 128-bit Advanced Encryption Standard (AES-128).[130]\\r\\nFeatures introduced in version 10.4 include Automator, an application designed to create an automatic workflow for different tasks;[131] Dashboard, a full-screen group of small applications called desktop widgets that can be called up and dismissed in one keystroke;[132] and Front Row, a media viewer interface accessed by the Apple Remote.[133] Moreover, the Sync Services were included, which is a system that allows applications to access a centralized extensible database for various elements of user data, including calendar and contact items. The operating system then managed conflicting edits and data consistency.[134]\\r\\nAll system icons are scalable up to 512G512 pixels as of version 10.5 to accommodate various places where they appear in larger size, including for example the Cover Flow view, a three-dimensional graphical user interface included with iTunes, the Finder, and other Apple products for visually skimming through files and digital media libraries via cover artwork. That version also introduced Spaces, a virtual desktop implementation which enables the user to have more than one desktop and display them in an Expos-like interface;[135] an automatic backup technology called Time Machine, which provides the ability to view and restore previous versions of files and application data;[136] and Screen Sharing was built in for the first time.[137]\\r\\nIn more recent releases, Apple has developed support for emoji characters by including the proprietary Apple Color Emoji font.[138][139] Apple has also connected macOS with social networks such as Twitter and Facebook through the addition of share buttons for content such as pictures and text.[140] Apple has brought several applications and features that originally debuted in iOS, its mobile operating system, to macOS in recent releases, notably the intelligent personal assistant Siri, which was introduced in version 10.12 of macOS.[141][142]\\r\\nThere are 34 system languages available in macOS for the user at the moment of installation; the system language is used throughout the entire operating system environment.[5] Input methods for typing in dozens of scripts can be chosen independently of the system language.[143] Recent updates have added increasing support for Chinese characters and interconnections with popular social networks in China.[144][145][146][147]\\r\\n\\r\\nmacOS can be updated using the Mac App Store application[148] or the softwareupdate command line utility. Until OS X 10.8 Mountain Lion, a separate Software Update application performed this functionality. In Mountain Lion and later, this was merged into the Mac App Store application, although the underlying update mechanism remains unchanged and is fundamentally different than the download mechanism used when purchasing an App Store application.\\r\\nWith the exception of Mac OS X Server 1.0 and the original public beta, OS X versions were named after big cats until OS X 10.9 Mavericks, when Apple switched to using California locations. Prior to its release, Mac OS X 10.0 was code named \\"Cheetah\\" internally at Apple, and Mac OS X 10.1 was code named internally as \\"Puma\\". After the immense buzz surrounding Mac OS X 10.2, codenamed \\"Jaguar\\", Apple's product marketing began openly using the code names to promote the operating system. Mac OS X 10.3 was marketed as \\"Panther\\", Mac OS X 10.4 as \\"Tiger\\", Mac OS X 10.5 as \\"Leopard\\", Mac OS X 10.6 as \\"Snow Leopard\\", Mac OS X 10.7 as \\"Lion\\", OS X 10.8 as \\"Mountain Lion\\", and OS X 10.9 as \\"Mavericks\\".\\r\\n\\"Panther\\", \\"Tiger\\" and \\"Leopard\\" are registered as trademarks of Apple,[167][168][169] but \\"Cheetah\\", \\"Puma\\" and \\"Jaguar\\" have never been registered. Apple has also registered \\"Lynx\\" and \\"Cougar\\" as trademarks, though these were allowed to lapse.[170][171] Computer retailer Tiger Direct sued Apple for its use of the name \\"Tiger\\". On May 16, 2005 a US federal court in the Southern District of Florida ruled that Apple's use did not infringe on Tiger Direct's trademark.[172]\\r\\nOn September 13, 2000, Apple released a $29.95[173] \\"preview\\" version of Mac OS X internally codenamed Kodiak in order to gain feedback from users.\\r\\nThe \\"PB\\" as it was known marked the first public availability of the Aqua interface and Apple made many changes to the UI based on customer feedback. Mac OS X Public Beta expired and ceased to function in Spring 2001.[174]\\r\\nOn March 24, 2001, Apple released Mac OS X 10.0 (internally codenamed Cheetah).[175] The initial version was slow,[176] incomplete,[177] and had very few applications available at the time of its launch, mostly from independent developers.[178] While many critics suggested that the operating system was not ready for mainstream adoption, they recognized the importance of its initial launch as a base on which to improve.[177] Simply releasing Mac OS X was received by the Macintosh community as a great accomplishment,[177] for attempts to completely overhaul the Mac OS had been underway since 1996, and delayed by countless setbacks. Following some bug fixes, kernel panics became much less frequent.[citation needed]\\r\\nLater that year on September 25, 2001, Mac OS X 10.1 (internally codenamed Puma) was released. It featured increased performance and provided missing features, such as DVD playback. Apple released 10.1 as a free upgrade CD for 10.0 users, in addition to the US$129 boxed version for people running Mac OS 9. It was discovered that the upgrade CDs were full install CDs that could be used with Mac OS 9 systems by removing a specific file; Apple later re-released the CDs in an actual stripped-down format that did not facilitate installation on such systems.[179] On January 7, 2002, Apple announced that Mac OS X was to be the default operating system for all Macintosh products by the end of that month.[180]\\r\\nOn August 23, 2002,[181] Apple followed up with Mac OS X 10.2 Jaguar, the first release to use its code name as part of the branding.[182] It brought great raw performance improvements, a sleeker look, and many powerful user-interface enhancements (over 150, according to Apple[183] ), including Quartz Extreme for compositing graphics directly on an ATI Radeon or Nvidia GeForce2 MX AGP-based video card with at least 16?MB of VRAM, a system-wide repository for contact information in the new Address Book, and an instant messaging client named iChat.[184] The Happy Mac which had appeared during the Mac OS startup sequence for almost 18 years was replaced with a large grey Apple logo with the introduction of Mac OS X v10.2.[185]\\r\\nMac OS X v10.3 Panther was released on October 24, 2003. In addition to providing much improved performance, it also incorporated the most extensive update yet to the user interface. Panther included as many or more new features as Jaguar had the year before, including an updated Finder, incorporating a brushed-metal interface, Fast user switching, Expos (Window manager), FileVault, Safari, iChat AV (which added videoconferencing features to iChat), improved Portable Document Format (PDF) rendering and much greater Microsoft Windows interoperability.[186] Support for some early G3 computers such as \\"beige\\" Power Macs and \\"WallStreet\\" PowerBooks was discontinued.[187]\\r\\nMac OS X 10.4 Tiger was released on April 29, 2005. Apple stated that Tiger contained more than 200 new features.[188] As with Panther, certain older machines were no longer supported; Tiger requires a Mac with 256?MB and a built-in FireWire port.[93] Among the new features, Tiger introduced Spotlight, Dashboard, Smart Folders, updated Mail program with Smart Mailboxes, QuickTime 7, Safari 2, Automator, VoiceOver, Core Image and Core Video. The initial release of the Apple TV used a modified version of Tiger with a different graphical interface and fewer applications and services. On January 10, 2006, Apple released the first Intel-based Macs along with the 10.4.4 update to Tiger. This operating system functioned identically on the PowerPC-based Macs and the new Intel-based machines, with the exception of the Intel release dropping support for the Classic environment.[189]\\r\\nMac OS X 10.5 Leopard was released on October 26, 2007. It was called by Apple \\"the largest update of Mac OS X\\". It brought more than 300 new features.[190] Leopard supports both PowerPC- and Intel x86-based Macintosh computers; support for the G3 processor was dropped and the G4 processor required a minimum clock rate of 867?MHz, and at least 512?MB of RAM to be installed. The single DVD works for all supported Macs (including 64-bit machines). New features include a new look, an updated Finder, Time Machine, Spaces, Boot Camp pre-installed,[191] full support for 64-bit applications (including graphical applications), new features in Mail and iChat, and a number of new security features. Leopard is an Open Brand UNIX 03 registered product on the Intel platform. It was also the first BSD-based OS to receive UNIX 03 certification.[10][192] Leopard dropped support for the Classic Environment and all Classic applications.[193] It was the final version of Mac OS X to support the PowerPC architecture.[194]\\r\\nMac OS X 10.6 Snow Leopard was released on August 28, 2009. Rather than delivering big changes to the appearance and end user functionality like the previous releases of Mac OS X, Snow Leopard focused on \\"under the hood\\" changes, increasing the performance, efficiency, and stability of the operating system. For most users, the most noticeable changes were: the disk space that the operating system frees up after a clean install compared to Mac OS X 10.5 Leopard, a more responsive Finder rewritten in Cocoa, faster Time Machine backups, more reliable and user friendly disk ejects, a more powerful version of the Preview application, as well as a faster Safari web browser. Snow Leopard only supported machines with Intel CPUs, required at least 1?GB of RAM, and dropped default support for applications built for the PowerPC architecture (Rosetta could be installed as an additional component to retain support for PowerPC-only applications).[195]\\r\\nSnow Leopard also featured new 64-bit technology capable of supporting greater amounts of RAM, improved support for multi-core processors through Grand Central Dispatch, and advanced GPU performance with OpenCL.[196]\\r\\nAn update introduced support for the Mac App Store, Apple's digital distribution platform for macOS applications.[197]\\r\\nMac OS X 10.7 Lion was released on July 20, 2011. It brought developments made in Apple's iOS, such as an easily navigable display of installed applications called Launchpad and a greater use of multi-touch gestures, to the Mac. This release removed Rosetta, making it incompatible with PowerPC applications.[112]\\r\\nChanges made to the GUI include auto-hiding scrollbars that only appear when they are being used, and Mission Control which unifies Expos, Spaces, Dashboard, and full-screen applications within a single interface.[198] Apple also made changes to applications: they resume in the same state as they were before they were closed, similar to iOS. Documents auto-save by default.[199]\\r\\nOS X 10.8 Mountain Lion was released on July 25, 2012.[161] Following the release of Lion the previous year, it was the first of the annual rather than two-yearly updates to OS X (and later macOS), which also closely alined with the annual iOS operating system updates. It incorporates some features seen in iOS 5, which include Game Center, support for iMessage in the new Messages messaging application, and Reminders as a to-do list app separate from iCal (which is renamed as Calendar, like the iOS app). It also includes support for storing iWork documents in iCloud.[200] Notification Center, which makes its debut in Mountain Lion, is a desktop version similar to the one in iOS 5.0 and higher. Application pop-ups are now concentrated on the corner of the screen, and the Center itself is pulled from the right side of the screen. Mountain Lion also includes more Chinese features including support for Baidu as an option for Safari search engine, QQ, 163.com and 126.com services for Mail, Contacts and Calendar, Youku, Tudou and Sina Weibo are integrated into share sheets.[147]\\r\\nStarting with Mountain Lion, Apple software updates (including the OS) are distributed via the App Store.[201] This updating mechanism replaced the Apple Software Update utility.[202]\\r\\nOS X 10.9 Mavericks was released on October 22, 2013. It was a free upgrade to all users running Snow Leopard or later with a 64-bit Intel processor.[203] Its changes include the addition of the previously iOS-only Maps and iBooks applications, improvements to the Notification Center, enhancements to several applications, and many under-the-hood improvements.[204]\\r\\nOS X 10.10 Yosemite was released on October 16, 2014. It features a redesigned user interface similar to that of iOS 7, intended to feature a more minimal, text-based 'flat' design, with use of translucency effects and intensely saturated colors.[205] Apple's showcase new feature in Yosemite is Handoff, which enables users with iPhones running iOS 8.1 or later to answer phone calls, receive and send SMS messages, and complete unfinished iPhone emails on their Mac. As of OS X 10.10.3, Photos replaced iPhoto and Aperture.[206]\\r\\nOS X 10.11 El Capitan was released on September 30, 2015. Similar to Mac OS X 10.6 Snow Leopard, Apple described this release as containing \\"refinements to the Mac experience\\" and \\"improvements to system performance\\" rather than new features. Refinements include public transport built into the Maps application, GUI improvements to the Notes application, adopting San Francisco as the system font for clearer legibility, and the introduction of System Integrity Protection. The Metal API, first introduced in iOS 8, was also included in this operating system for \\"all Macs since 2012\\".[207]\\r\\nmacOS 10.12 Sierra was released to the public on September 20, 2016. New features include the addition of Siri, Optimized Storage, and updates to Photos, Messages, and iTunes.[208][209]\\r\\nThe fall release of macOS 10.13 High Sierra was announced on June 5, 2017 at Apple's WWDC event.[210] On September 12, 2017 at Apple's iPhone event, they announced its release to be September 25, 2017.[211] Like OS X El Capitan and OS X Mountain Lion, High Sierra is a refinement-based update having very few new features.[212] High Sierra uses the new Apple File System and includes enhancements to Safari, Photos, and Mail, among other changes.[210]\\r\\nAs of July 2016, macOS is the second-most-active general-purpose desktop client operating system in use on the World Wide Web following Microsoft Windows, with a 4.90% usage share according to statistics compiled by the Wikimedia Foundation. It is the most successful Unix-like desktop operating system on the web, estimated at approximately 5 times the usage of Linux (which has 1.01%). Usage share generally continues to shift away from the desktop and toward mobile operating systems such as iOS and Android.[213]\\r\\nIn its earlier years, Mac OS X enjoyed a near-absence of the types of malware and spyware that have affected Microsoft Windows users.[214][215][216] macOS has a smaller usage share compared to Windows,[217] but it also has traditionally more secure Unix roots. Worms, as well as potential vulnerabilities, were noted in 2006, which led some industry analysts and anti-virus companies to issue warnings that Apple's Mac OS X is not immune to malware.[218] Increasing market share coincided with additional reports of a variety of attacks.[219] In early 2011, Mac OS X experienced a large increase in malware attacks,[220] and malware such as Mac Defender, MacProtector, and MacGuard were seen as an increasing problem for Mac users. At first, the malware installer required the user to enter the administrative password, but later versions were able to install without user input.[221] Initially, Apple support staff were instructed not to assist in the removal of the malware or admit the existence of the malware issue, but as the malware spread, a support document was issued. Apple announced an OS X update to fix the problem. An estimated 100,000 users were affected.[222][223] Apple releases security updates for macOS regularly.[224]\\r\\nAs a devices company, most large-scale Apple promotion for macOS has been part of the sale of Macs, with promotion of macOS updates generally focused on existing users, promotion at Apple Store and other retail partners, or through events for developers. In larger scale advertising campaigns, Apple specifically promoted macOS as better for handling media and other home-user applications, and comparing Mac OS X (especially versions Tiger and Leopard) with the heavy criticism Microsoft received for the long-awaited Windows Vista operating system.[225][226]","input":"What is the latest version of imac os?"},{"output":"Jawaharlal Nehru","context":"The Minister of External Affairs (or simply foreign minister) is the head of the Ministry of External Affairs of the Government of India.

Viacom is owner of Paramount Pictures, the distributor of Forrest Gump. The Bubba Gump restaurant is named after the film's characters Benjamin Buford \\"Bubba\\" Blue and Forrest Gump. In the film, Bubba suggested getting in the shrimping business and, ultimately, Forrest pursued the idea after Bubba's death in the Vietnam War.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1995, Paramount Pictures approached Rusty Pelican Restaurants Inc. with a desire to create a restaurant based on a theme from Paramount's 1994 film Forrest Gump. The Bubba Gump Shrimp Co. was created as a result. Within a year the Bubba Gump Shrimp Co. created a concept idea for the restaurant chain which was then licensed by Paramount Licensing, Inc. In 1996, the first Bubba Gump Shrimp Co. restaurant was opened in Monterey, California; its success led to its franchising on an international scale.[2]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn November 2010, Landry's, Inc. acquired Bubba Gump Shrimp Co. for an undisclosed amount.[3] The Bubba Gump Shrimp Co. purchase also included a lone Rusty Pelican in Newport Beach, California.\\r\\n\\r\\nLike the name suggests, Bubba Gump Shrimp Co.'s menu consists mostly of shrimp dishes and other seafood, as well as Southern and Cajun cuisine. The restaurant offers dishes named after characters in the movie, like Jennys Catch and the restaurants bestseller Forrests Seafood Feast.[4][5] Restaurants display movie memorabilia throughout the restaurant. Guests can play Forrest Gump movie trivia and can signal their waiter with a Stop, Forrest, Stop sign.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 2013, a former Bubba Gump employee claimed that the social media policy in the company's employee handbook had a restrictive effect on employees rights by prohibiting them from discussing their jobs online.[7] In 2015, a National Labor Relations Board administrative law judge ruled that Bubba Gump did not violate employees rights as they did not explicitly prohibit employees from discussing job-related subjects, but only expected them to do so in a civil manner.

Later, message board posters began reporting that Craig had been cast in the role of Morgan despite no official confirmation from ABC.[5] On April 17, 2013, after months of speculation from fans, a rep from the show confirmed the news that Bryan Craig had been cast in the role of Morgan. Craig began taping his first scenes on April 15.[6] Though no official airdate was announced, Craig's first appearance was slated for May 2013 on a contractual basis.[7] Craig later revealed to Soap Opera Digest that he was hesitant to do a soap. However, the role of Morgan changed his mind about daytime. It was his parents who convinced him to sign a three-year contract.[8] Angela Durrell of TV Source described the character of Morgan as \\"[s]ensitive and emotionally wounded.\\" Morgan craves \\"strong ties\\" and stability.[9] Mara Levinsky described Craig's Morgan as \\"impulsive\\" and \\"imperfect.\\"[8] Michael Logan described Craig's Morgan as a \\"marvelous muddle of puppy awkwardness and testy testosterone.\\"[10] When asked about his character's \\"casual and low-key,\\" wardrobe, despite his family being filthy rich, Craig said Morgan is all about quick cash, but \\"far from snooty.\\" He is the kind of guy that sleeps all day, and eats pizza for breakfast. His sense of style reflects his laid back personality.[11] Susan Hornik described Craig's Morgan as a \\"Prince Harry-esque, bad boy.\\"[12] Since taking on the role of Morgan, Craig has been nominated at the Daytime Emmy Awards in the category of Outstanding Younger Actor in a Drama Series, and won the award in 2016.[13][14] On September 15, 2016, Craig announced via instagram that he had decided to exit the series.[15]\\r\\nCraig was previously engaged to his former General Hospital co-star Kelly Thiebaud.[12][16][17][18][19] They have broken up as of 2016.","input":"Who is the actor who plays morgan corinthos?"},{"output":"August 23, 1998","context":"That '70s Show is an American television period sitcom that originally aired on Fox from August 23, 1998 to May 18, 2006. The series focused on the lives of a group of six teenage friends living in fictional Point Place, Wisconsin from May 17, 1976 to December 31, 1979.[1]\\r\\nThe main teenage cast members were Topher Grace, Mila Kunis, Ashton Kutcher, Danny Masterson, Laura Prepon and Wilmer Valderrama. The main adult cast members were Debra Jo Rupp, Kurtwood Smith, Don Stark, Tommy Chong and Tanya Roberts.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe creators had wanted the show to have a 1970s \\"feel\\" from the beginning, so opted to set the series later in the decade, when trends and political ideologies had become firmly established and disseminated. The idea that the duration of the series would carry sociopolitical undertones also necessitated a chain of social events which could influence the characters. Thus, 1976 was chosen, which allowed episodes set within a short time frame to address streaking, the sexual revolution, the Equal Rights Amendment, the 1973 oil crisis, and the presidencies of Richard Nixon and Gerald Ford, all of which were culturally influential events that occurred in the earlier years of the 1970s. The shift to 1977 during the last half of the first season also allowed the inclusion of the first Star Wars movie, which premiered in May 1977.\\r\\nThroughout the first two seasons, episodes opened with title cards showing the season/month and year (example: Late Spring, 1977 or June 1977). These, however, were largely abandoned after season 2, with few subsequent episodes using them. However, they were used again in the final episode, showing \\"December 31, 1979 10:45 a.m.\\" From the premiere onward, the episode's year could be determined by the registration tags on Eric's Vista Cruiser at the end of the opening and closing credits. The final episode's closing credits showed an \\"80\\" year tag.\\r\\nThe show was set in May 1976 in the August 23, 1998 premiere. After 12 episodes, the series transitioned to 1977. The 23rd episode, \\"Grandma's Dead\\", was also set in 1976, because it was supposed to be the season finale of season 1. The show remained in 1977 for the next two seasons. Near the end of the third season, the series transitioned to 1978 until early in the sixth season. The remaining episodes took place in 1979, and the series finale abruptly ends during a New Year's Eve party as the characters reach \\"one\\" during a countdown to January 1, 1980.\\r\\nThe show's unexpected longevity (it was the only series to debut on Fox in 1998 to survive cancellation) combined with the first season jump to 1977 necessitated a slow-down of the series' timeline. Over time, this proved problematic from a narrative standpoint, as nearly every year featured a Thanksgiving and/or Christmas episode, and the teen-aged actors playing high-school student characters all aged into their mid-20s by the time their characters graduated from high school after five seasons (except Mila Kunis, who was not quite 20). As the series timeline sped up and slowed down with more rapidity near the series' climax, the timeline necessitated that several major events depicted as having occurred months apart would have in fact happened within weeks or even days of one another.\\r\\nThe timeline issues experienced on the show were not unprecedented, as other period-specific TV series have had similar issues. Most notably, M*A*S*H aired for 11 seasons despite the Korean War only lasting three years. Additionally, many TV series over the years that take place in the present time have characters age faster than normal while other characters age naturally.\\r\\nThe character of Eric Forman was written out of the series at the end of the seventh season, as Topher Grace wanted to move on with his career.[2] Ashton Kutcher switched to a recurring guest role when he also chose to depart following the seventh season.[2] However, Kelso had not been written out yet, so to give better closure to the character, Kutcher appeared in the first four episodes of the eighth season (credited as a special guest star) and later returned for the finale. Tommy Chong (who began reappearing by late season 7 after a long absence) became a regular again to help fill Kelso's role as the dimwit of the group. Eric was originally supposed to be replaced by his new friend Charlie, played by Bret Harrison, as an \\"innocent character\\", who proved fairly popular with audiences, but the character was killed off after Harrison was offered a lead role in the series The Loop.[3] Another new character named Randy Pearson, played by Josh Meyers, was introduced to take the place of both Eric and, to a lesser extent, Charlie.[4] Another new character, Samantha, a stripper played by Judy Tylor, was added as Hyde's wife for nine episodes. The location of the show's introductory theme song was changed from the Vista Cruiser to the circle. Both Eric and Kelso returned for the series' final episode, although Topher Grace was uncredited.\\r\\nThe eighth season was announced as the final season of the show on January 17, 2006,[5] and \\"That '70s Finale\\" was filmed a month later on February 17, 2006, first airing on May 18, 2006.[6]\\r\\nThe working titles for the show were Teenage Wasteland (named after the lyric from The Who's \\"Baba O'Riley\\"), The Kids Are Alright (named after The Who's song of the same name), Feelin' All Right, and Reeling in the Years (named after Steely Dan's song of the same name). However, due to the denials of these three songs from the 1970s (including Pete Townshend's denial of using his two songs for each of the two titles), and Fox Network's decision that Feelin' All Right was not too memorable, co-creator Bonnie Turner suggested that the show should be titled That '70s Show, which became the official title.[7]\\r\\nThe show usually opens with the theme song, \\"In the Street\\", written by Alex Chilton and Chris Bell of the band Big Star. The original version of the song appeared on Big Star's 1972 debut album #1 Record. In 2000, Chilton confirmed that he was paid $70 in royalties each time the show aired, an amount he thought ironic, given the show's title.[8]\\r\\nBig Star's original version of the song was not used on the show. Instead, a cover version sung by Todd Griffin was used as the theme song for the show's first season. Beginning in the second season, the theme song was performed by the band Cheap Trick. Unlike previous versions of the song, Cheap Trick ended the song with the repeated phrase \\"We're all alright!\\" quoting the ending of their 1978 hit song \\"Surrender\\".[9]\\r\\nBoth versions of the song (Todd Griffin and Cheap Trick) used on the show end with somebody yelling \\"Hello, Wisconsin!\\" In Griffin's version, Masterson is the one yelling \\"Hello, Wisconsin!\\"[10] while it is unknown who yells it in Cheap Trick's version during the opening. On the soundtrack, That '70s Album (Rockin'), Cheap Trick's lead singer Robin Zander yells \\"Hello, Wisconsin!\\"[11] Alternate holiday versions of the theme song were arranged for Halloween and Christmas specials, using organ music and bells, respectively.\\r\\nOpening credits for seasons 1ÿ7 showed members of the cast driving in Eric's car singing the theme song together. At the conclusion of the opening, a shot of a 1970s-style Wisconsin license plate (black letters/numbers on a yellow background) is seen, showing the year in which the episode was taking place in the bottom right corner. During the first season's opening, a single shot of the group is used; beginning with season 2, numerous alternating shots were used of the cast in various groupings (including the adult cast members, who had not appeared in the first season's opening).\\r\\nAfter Topher Grace and Ashton Kutcher left the series, the opening credits were reworked for season 8 to feature close-up shots of each of the actors singing (or mouthing) a line of the theme song in the Circle (for example, Mila Kunis \\"Hanging Out...;\\" Danny Masterson \\"Down the Street\\"). The only actors to not say or do anything in the new opening credits were Kurtwood Smith and Tommy Chong, with the exception of the first episode of season 8, when Chong sings the last \\"We're all alright\\". Smith looks at the camera frowning and rolls his eyes. Chong looks around the room, confused as he hears \\"Hello, Wisconsin!\\" The final episode omits most of the opening sequence and instead only shows the license plate shot.\\r\\nThe show addressed social issues of the 1970s such as sexism, sexual attitudes, generational conflict, the economic hardships of the 1970s recession, mistrust of the American government by blue-collar workers, and underage drinking, including teenage drug use. The series also highlighted developments in the entertainment industry, including the television remote (\\"the clicker\\"), reruns, VCR, and cable TV; the video games Pong and Space Invaders; the cassette tape and Disco; MAD magazine; and Eric's obsession with Star Wars.[12] The show has been compared to Happy Days, which was similarly set 20 years before the time in which it aired.[13]\\r\\nBeginning with the second season, the show focused less on the sociopolitical aspects of the story. For example, the dynamic of the relationship between Eric and Donna was altered in later seasons to more closely resemble the relationships of other \\"power couples\\" on teen dramas. Likewise, the first season of the show featured a recurring, more dramatic storyline in which the Formans were in danger of losing their home due to Red's hours being cut back at the auto parts plant where he worked. Storylines in later seasons were generally presented more comically and less dramatically.\\r\\nThe show also featured guest-starring actors from 1970s TV shows, such as Mary Tyler Moore, Valerie Harper and Betty White (The Mary Tyler Moore Show), Tom Poston and Jack Riley (The Bob Newhart Show), Pamela Sue Martin (The Hardy Boys/Nancy Drew Mysteries), Tim Reid and Howard Hesseman (WKRP in Cincinnati), Eve Plumb, Barry Williams and Christopher Knight (The Brady Bunch), Tom Bosley and Marion Ross (Happy Days), Monty Hall (Let's Make A Deal), Gavin MacLeod (The Love Boat and The Mary Tyler Moore Show), Don Knotts, Richard Kline and Jenilee Harrison (Three's Company), and Danny Bonaduce and Shirley Jones (The Partridge Family). Series recurring cast member Tanya Roberts also starred in a popular show in the 1970s (Charlie's Angels).\\r\\nBeginning with season 5, each episode in the series is named after a song by a rock band that was famous in the 1970s: Led Zeppelin (season 5), The Who (Season 6), The Rolling Stones (season 7), and Queen (season 8, except for the finale, titled \\"That '70s Finale\\").[14]\\r\\nOne device in the show is to present a split screen in which two pairs of characters speak. One character is usually seeking advice on a problem with a character in the second pairing and the other character advises them. Although the conversations appear to mirror each other, notable differences often occur. It is most often used by the couples of the show, with each member of the couple being advised on the relationship. For example, in the episode \\"Who Wants It More?\\", Donna and Eric tell Jackie and Hyde that they have been holding out on each other sexually for three days and that maybe they should cave. Both Jackie and Hyde tell Donna and Eric not to cave or the \\"caver\\" will be owned by the other.\\r\\nThe show includes character daydream sequences, some of which refer to or parody fads and films of the time, such as Star Wars, Rocky, and Grease.\\r\\nThe character picturing the dream sometimes also narrates it, but regardless, the other characters present see the same dream. In the episode \\"Stone Cold Crazy\\", Jackie mentioned she liked the song playing in Fez's dream sequence. The sequences are usually introduced by a wobbling screen transition. Sometimes, the transition is absent when the characters who imagine the scene believe they are real (for example, Eric's dream about Donna in \\"Eric's Birthday\\" or Jackie's dream about Hyde proposing in \\"It's All Over Now\\").\\r\\nIn the 100th episode, \\"That '70s Musical\\", all singing scenes were Fez's dream sequences.\\r\\nIn the circle, a group of characters, usually the teenagers, sit in a circle (generally in Eric's basement, though occasionally elsewhere), as the camera pans, stopping at each character as he or she speaks. It was usually apparent that the characters are under the influence of marijuana. Thick clouds of smoke, frequent coughing and an extreme wide-angle lens added to the \\"drug-induced\\" feel, although the audience never saw anyone actually smoking the drug. Also, no visible drug-related paraphernalia were seen, such as bongs or joint papers. Characters never spoke the word \\"marijuana\\" while in the circle (except in one episode \\"Reefer Madness\\"), often referring to it as \\"stuff\\" or a \\"stash\\". In the episode \\"Bye-Bye Basement\\", Theo (Leo's cousin) refers to \\"weed\\"; in \\"The Relapse\\", Kelso tells Fez that the concrete wall behind the gym is used mostly for \\"smoking weed and beating up freshmen;\\" in \\"Ski Trip\\" Kitty asks Eric why he is taking so much oregano to Jackie's ski lodge; in \\"Eric's Burger Job\\", Kelso blames his \\"roach clip\\" when the water bed pops on which he is sitting at a party; in two episodes (\\"That Wrestling Show\\" and \\"Hyde Moves In\\") Eric and Hyde can be seen wearing shirts with the words \\"Cannabis Sativa\\" written on a Campbell's soup can; and in \\"The Pill\\" Red, referring to Kelso, exclaims, \\"That kid's on dope!\\" A gimmick related to the circle and the marijuana smoking was Eric watching the kitchen wall moving erratically, although this technique was also used to show that Eric was drunk.\\r\\nAs the series progressed, the circle became one of the series' recurring features. The only four episodes where the whole gang is in the circle are \\"Class Picture\\", \\"I'm A Boy\\", \\"Substitute\\", and in the series finale. During the eighth and final season, the circle sans smoke replaced the Vista Cruiser as the setting of the opening credits.\\r\\nThe stupid helmet refers to a replica of a Green Bay Packers helmet that a character is forced to wear after having done or said something deemed stupid by the rest of the gang. Eric had to wear it when he said he wanted to propose to Donna and Fez wore it when he started banging his head on the table after trying to help Kelso keep Jackie. The helmet can be seen in the Forman basement on a shelf behind the cast. When the series concluded in 2006, the last one up the staircase had to call Red a \\"dumbass\\", something he always called the kids. Since Kelso was the last one up, he grabbed the helmet.\\r\\nIn many episodes, the teenaged characters often hang out on a local water tower. At the end of several water tower segments, at least one character falls off (usually Kelso). When Charlie Richardson (played by Bret Harrison) fell off and died in season 8, the water tower was renamed in his honor.\\r\\nAfter Charlie's death, Kelso fell off again, but survived, leading him to believe he was \\"invincible\\". In the \\"Water Tower episode\\", the gang painted a marijuana leaf on the tower, but it looked more like a green hand giving the finger. In the episode \\"The Immigrant Song (a.k.a. Fez Gets Busted)\\" Kelso paints Jackie and his names on the tower to annoy Hyde just before falling and ending up in the hospital. During this episode, Fez paints his manhood on the tower but only gets as far as drawing a circle when the police arrive to arrest him. Kelso was known to fall off the water tower once in every grade since middle school. Jackie and Fez share their first official kiss on the tower in the show's finale.\\r\\nIn the first season, scene transitions (also known as bumpers) consisted of animated smiley buttons[15] or still images of faces from the 1970s with only the mouth moving using Syncro-Vox, usually yelling, in a rock form, \\"Yeahhh!\\" or something similar (ex. Farrah Fawcett saying \\"Yeah!\\" or Richard Nixon saying \\"Are you ready to rock and roll?\\") The smiley buttons were removed for re-runs and home video, replaced with flowers likewise exploding, replicating, deflating or bouncing around. Sometimes they would be visuals of lava lamps with the show's logo plummeting to the bottom of the screen in front of it.\\r\\nBeginning in season 2, transitions featured the characters doing something in front of a colorful, psychedelic, lava lamp-like background. These transitions featured the most prominent characters of the episode usually dancing, falling or making facial expressions. The music accompanying these colorful sequences would match the tone of the episode and characters.\\r\\nBy the show's final season, new transitions were created to accommodate cast changes (e.g. Donna's hair color, Leo continuing as a series regular and the insertion of Randy).\\r\\n\\"Nobody's Fault But Mine (2)\\" is the only episode where Laurie Forman is featured in a transition. Tanya Roberts is the only regular actor not to be featured in a transition.\\r\\nMany of the show's episodes featured Eric and the rest of the kids in or around Eric's \\"Aztec Gold\\" 1969 Oldsmobile Vista Cruiser, handed down to Eric by Red. For the first seven seasons of the show, the show's introduction showed the cast inside the Vista Cruiser.\\r\\nThe show's pronunciation of \\"Vista Cruiser\\", with emphasis on \\"Cruiser\\" conflicted with the pronunciation of author George Plimpton in the Oldsmobile television advertisement for the 1969 Vista Cruiser, where he pronounced the two words with the emphasis on \\"Vista\\".[16]\\r\\nThat particular station wagon was bought by Wilmer Valderrama at the show's conclusion from Carsey-Werner for US$500.[17]\\r\\nIn August 2009, the show's Vista Cruiser was named third-greatest television car ever by MSN Autos.[18]\\r\\nIn one of the show's major running gags, Red often threatens to punish Eric with many variations of catchphrase, \\"kicking your ass\\". For example, in \\"Kitty and Eric's Night Out\\", Red mistakenly thinks Eric offended Kitty, so Red says, \\"I swear I'll kick his ass!\\" In \\"Eric's Hot Cousin\\", Eric tries to get out of something by claiming he's sleepwalking and Red says, \\"And I'm about to be sleep-kicking your ass\\", and, in \\"Prank Day\\", when Red gets covered in oatmeal, Eric tries to explain that it was just a prank that had gone \\"horribly, horribly wrong\\" Red says, \\"Well, I have a prank, too. One where my foot doesn't plow through your ass. Let's hope it doesn't go horribly, horribly wrong!\\" Several of the running gags were shown in edited clips for the series finale.\\r\\nSome other notable running gags and catchphrases are:\\r\\nIn 1999, the show was remade by the ITV network in the United Kingdom as Days Like These using almost verbatim scripts with minor changes to cultural references.[28]\\r\\nThat '70s Show was released on DVD in Regions 1, 2 and 4 by Fox Home Entertainment at an increment of two seasons per year between 2004 and 2008 and a complete series release on October 14, 2008. Mill Creek Entertainment released all eight seasons between 2011 and '13 and released a complete series set on May 14, 2013. On March 6, 2012, Mill Creek released the first season on Blu-ray and season two on October 16, 2012. On November 3, 2015, Mill Creek Entertainment released That '70s Show The Complete Series on Blu-ray 1080p with 5.1 DTS-HD Master Audio and 1.78:1 widescreen aspect ratio.[29]\\r\\nSeveral prominent songs from the decade can be heard on the series, and two soundtracks were released in 1999. The first is a collection of funk, soul, and disco, called That '70s Album (Jammin'). The second is a collection of album-oriented rock songs, called That '70s Album (Rockin'). AllMusic gave both albums 3 out of 5 stars in their reviews.[30][31]\\r\\nOver the course of its run, the series was a consistent performer for Fox, becoming one of their flagship shows. Its eight seasons, consisting of 200 episodes, made it Fox's second-longest-running live-action sitcom ever behind Married... with Children, though That '70s Show did not have the same ratings success.\\r\\nOver the course of its run, the series was nominated for a substantial number of awards, including 16 Primetime Emmy Awards. The only win for the series at this event came in 1999, when Melina Root was awarded the Emmy for Outstanding Costume Design for a Series for \\"That Disco Episode\\". Additionally, the show was nominated for a large number of Teen Choice Awards, with both Ashton Kutcher and Wilmer Valderrama winning on three occasions.\\r\\n Media related to That '70s Show at Wikimedia Commons\\r\\n? does not include 1966 or 1967 NFL championships","input":"When did the first that 70 show air?"},{"output":"December 15, 2017","context":"Star Wars: The Last Jedi (also known as Star Wars: Episode VIII ÿ The Last Jedi) is a 2017 American epic space opera film written and directed by Rian Johnson. It is the second installment of the Star Wars sequel trilogy and the eighth main installment of the Star Wars franchise, following Star Wars: The Force Awakens (2015). It is produced by Lucasfilm and distributed by Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures. The cast includes Mark Hamill, Carrie Fisher, Adam Driver, Daisy Ridley, John Boyega, Oscar Isaac, Andy Serkis, Lupita Nyong'o, Domhnall Gleeson, Anthony Daniels, and Gwendoline Christie in returning roles, with Kelly Marie Tran, Laura Dern, and Benicio del Toro joining the cast. The film features the final film performance by Fisher, who died in December 2016, and is dedicated to her memory. The plot follows Rey as she receives Jedi training from Luke Skywalker, in hopes of turning the tide for the Resistance in the fight against Kylo Ren and the First Order.\\r\\nThe Last Jedi was part of a new trilogy of films announced after Disney's acquisition of Lucasfilm in October 2012. It was produced by Lucasfilm President Kathleen Kennedy and Ram Bergman, with Force Awakens director J. J. Abrams as an executive producer. John Williams, composer for the previous films, returned to compose the score. Scenes that required shooting at Skellig Michael in Ireland were filmed during pre-production in September 2015, with principal photography beginning at Pinewood Studios in England in February 2016 and ending in July 2016. Post-production wrapped in September 2017.\\r\\nThe Last Jedi had its world premiere in Los Angeles on December 9, 2017, and was released in the United States on December 15, 2017. It has grossed over $1?billion worldwide, making it the third-highest-grossing film of 2017, the 22nd-highest-grossing film of all time, and the second highest-grossing film in the Star Wars franchise, and received largely positive reviews. Critics praised it for its plot, ensemble cast, action, effects, score and emotional weight; some considered it the best Star Wars film since The Empire Strikes Back.[6][7][8][9][10] A sequel, provisionally titled Star Wars: Episode IX, is scheduled for release on December 20, 2019.[11]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nResistance fighters led by General Leia Organa evacuate their base when a First Order fleet arrives. Following an effective but costly counterattack led by Poe Dameron, Resistance fighters manage to destroy a First Order dreadnought, before the Resistance vessels jump into hyperspace to escape, but the First Order pursues them using a tracking device. Kylo Ren, Leia's son, destroys the Resistance support fighters, but hesitates to fire at the lead Resistance ship, after sensing his mother's presence. However, TIE fighters destroy the bridge of the ship, killing several Resistance leaders and incapacitating Leia, who only survives by using the Force. Command falls to Vice Admiral Holdo. Disapproving of Holdo's passive strategy, Poe, Finn, BB-8, and mechanic Rose Tico embark on a secret plan to disable the tracking device.\\r\\nMeanwhile, Rey has arrived on remote Ahch-To, with Chewbacca and R2-D2 aboard the Millennium Falcon, to recruit Luke Skywalker to the Resistance. Disillusioned by the failures of the Jedi and under self-imposed exile from the Force, Luke refuses, even after he learns from Rey of Han Solo's death. Unknown to Luke, Rey and Kylo begin communicating through telepathic visions. Prompted by R2-D2, Luke agrees to teach Rey the ways of the Force. Luke and Kylo give Rey differing accounts of the incident that turned Kylo to the dark side; Luke confesses that he momentarily contemplated killing Kylo upon sensing that Supreme Leader Snoke had corrupted him, causing Kylo to destroy Luke's emergent Jedi Order in retaliation. Convinced that Kylo can be redeemed, Rey leaves Ahch-To to confront Kylo without Luke. Luke prepares to burn down the Ahch-To Jedi temple and library, but Yoda's Force ghost destroys the temple himself and encourages Luke to learn from his failure.\\r\\nHoldo reveals her plan to discreetly evacuate the remaining Resistance members using small transports. Believing her actions cowardly and risky, Poe instigates a mutiny. Finn, Rose and BB-8 travel to the Canto Bight casino and acquire the help of the hacker DJ, who says he can help them disable the tracking device. They infiltrate Snoke's ship but are captured by Captain Phasma, though BB-8 escapes. Meanwhile, Rey lands on the ship, and Kylo brings her to Snoke, who reveals that he facilitated the mental connection between her and Kylo as part of a plan to destroy Luke. Ordered to kill Rey, Kylo instead kills Snoke and works together with Rey to kill Snoke's elite guards. Kylo invites Rey to rule the galaxy with him, but Rey refuses. Using the Force, they struggle for possession of Anakin Skywalker's lightsaber, which splits in two.\\r\\nLeia recovers and stuns Poe, allowing the evacuation to begin. Holdo remains on the ship to mislead Snoke's fleet as the others flee to a nearby old Rebel Alliance base on Crait. DJ reveals the Resistance's plan to the First Order, and the evacuation transports are targeted with heavy losses; Holdo sacrifices herself by ramming Snoke's fleet at lightspeed to stop the barrage, bisecting all of the First Order ships and inflicting massive casualties on the First Order troops. Rey escapes in the chaos, while Kylo declares himself Supreme Leader. BB-8 frees Finn and Rose, who escape after defeating Captain Phasma, and join the survivors of the evacuation on Crait. When the First Order arrives, Poe, Finn, and Rose lead a charge with old speeders. Rey draws the TIE fighters away with the Falcon, while Rose prevents Finn from completing a suicide run against the enemy siege cannon, which blasts a hole in the Resistance fortress.\\r\\nLuke appears and confronts the First Order so the surviving Resistance fighters can escape. Kylo orders the First Order forces to fire on Luke to no effect, then engages Luke in a lightsaber duel. Kylo strikes Luke but realizes he has been fighting Luke's Force projection. Luke tells Kylo he will not be the last Jedi, while Rey uses the Force to help the Resistance fighters escape via the Falcon. On Ahch-To, an exhausted Luke vanishes into the Force. Leia reassures everyone that the rebellion has all it needs to rise again. In a short glimpse on the Falcon, it is revealed that Rey has taken the books from the Jedi temple with her. On Canto Bight, one of the children who helped Finn and Rose escape grabs a broom with the Force and gazes into space.\\r\\nJoonas Suotamo appears as Chewbacca, taking over the role from Peter Mayhew after previously serving as his body double for The Force Awakens.[24] Mayhew, who was 73 years old and suffering from chronic knee and back pain,[25] is credited as \\"Chewbacca consultant.\\" Billie Lourd, Mike Quinn, and Timothy D.

BB-8 is controlled by puppeteers Dave Chapman and Brian Herring,[29] with initial voice work by Ben Schwartz and final sound effects voiced by Bill Hader modulated through a synthesizer.[30] Jimmy Vee portrays R2-D2.[31][32] Veronica Ng? portrays Rose's sister Paige Tico,[22] a Resistance gunner who sacrifices her life to destroy a First Order dreadnought.\\r\\nJustin Theroux plays the master codebreaker, while Lily Cole plays his companion.[33] Joseph Gordon-Levitt has a voice cameo as Slowen Lo.[34] Warwick Davis plays Wodibin.[35] Gareth Edwards, director of the Star Wars Anthology film Rogue One,[36] has a cameo appearance as a Resistance Soldier, as does Gary Barlow.[37] Directors Edgar Wright and Joe Cornish also cameo in the film. Hermione Corfield appears as Tallie Lintra, a Resistance A-Wing pilot and squad leader. Noah Segan and Jamie Christopher appear as Resistance pilots Starck and Tubbs.[38] Hamill's children, Griffin, Nathan, and Chelsea, cameo as Resistance soldiers. Prince William, Duke of Cambridge and Prince Harry filmed cameo appearances as stormtroopers.[39] Tom Hardy also filmed an appearance as a stormtrooper, but his cameo was ultimately dropped from the final cut.[40]\\r\\nIn October 2012, Star Wars creator George Lucas sold his production company Lucasfilm, and with it the Star Wars franchise, to The Walt Disney Company. Disney announced a new trilogy of Star Wars films.[41] J. J. Abrams was named director of the first episode in the trilogy, The Force Awakens, in January 2013.[42][43] In June 2014, director Rian Johnson was reported to be in talks to write and direct its sequel, dubbed Episode VIII, and to write a treatment for the third film, Episode IX, with Ram Bergman producing both films.[44][45] Johnson confirmed in August 2014 that he would direct Episode VIII.[46] In September, filmmaker Terry Gilliam asked Johnson about what it felt like to take over something that was made famous by another filmmaker, to which Johnson responded:\\r\\nI'm just starting into it, but so far, honestly, it's the most fun I've ever had writing. It's just joyous. But also for me personally, I grew up not just watching those movies but playing with those toys, so as a little kid, the first movies I was making in my head were set in this world.

She said that Abrams was collaborating with Johnson and that Johnson would in turn work with (then) Episode IX director Colin Trevorrow to ensure a smooth transition.[49] Abrams is an executive producer along with Jason McGatlin and Tom Karnowski.[50] Lucasfilm announced the film's title, Star Wars: The Last Jedi, on January 23, 2017.[51]\\r\\nIn September 2015, Disney shortlisted the female cast members to Gina Rodriguez, Tatiana Maslany, and Olivia Cooke.[52] Later that month, Benicio del Toro confirmed that he would play the villain in the film,[53] and Mark Hamill was also confirmed.[12] In October 2015, Gugu Mbatha-Raw was rumored to have been cast in the film.[54] In November, Jimmy Vee was cast as R2-D2.[31] In November, Kennedy announced at the London premiere for The Force Awakens that the entire cast would return for Episode VIII, along with \\"a handful\\" of new cast members.[13] In February 2016, at the start of filming, it was confirmed that Laura Dern and Kelly Marie Tran had been cast in unspecified roles.[2] In April 2017, at Star Wars Celebration Orlando, Lucasfilm announced that Tran plays Resistance maintenance worker Rose Tico, which Johnson described as the film's largest new role.[20][21] To keep Frank Oz's return as Yoda a secret, producers excluded Oz's name in the billing for the film's marketing and ensured that Oz stayed on set during filming.[23]\\r\\nSecond unit photography began during pre-production at Skellig Michael in Ireland on September 14, 2015, due to the difficulties of filming at that location during other seasons.

Ultimately 125 sets were created on 14 sound stages at Pinewood Studios.[73]\\r\\nAccording to creature designer Neal Scanlan, The Last Jedi uses more practical effects than any Star Wars film, with 180 to 200 creatures created with practical effects, some cut from the final edit.[74] For Yoda's appearance in the film as a Force ghost, the character was created using puppetry, as was done in the original Star Wars trilogy (as opposed to computer-generated imagery, which was used to create Yoda in most of the prequel trilogy).[75]\\r\\nThe film's Canto Bight sequence contains a reference to the 1985 Terry Gilliam film Brazil, in which Finn and Rose are arrested for committing parking violation 27B/6.[76]\\r\\nIn July 2013, Kennedy announced at Star Wars Celebration Europe that John Williams would return to score the Star Wars sequel trilogy.[1][77] Williams confirmed his assignment for The Last Jedi at a Tanglewood concert in August 2016,[78] stating he would begin recording the score \\"off and on\\" in December 2016 until March or April 2017.[79] On February 21, 2017, it was confirmed that recording was underway, with both Williams and William Ross conducting the sessions.[80][81]\\r\\nIn lieu of a traditional spotting session with Johnson, Williams was provided a temp track of music from his previous film scores as a reference for scoring The Last Jedi.[82] The score briefly quotes \\"Aquarela do Brasil\\" by Ary Barroso in its \\"Canto Bight\\" track as another reference to the film Brazil. It also contains a brief quote of Williams's own theme for The Long Goodbye (co-composed by Johnny Mercer) during Finn and Rose's escape, although this quote is not heard in the official soundtrack release.[83]\\r\\nThe official soundtrack album was released by?Walt Disney Records?on December 15, 2017 in?digipak?CD, digital formats, and streaming services.[84]\\r\\nIn January 2015, Disney CEO Bob Iger stated that Episode VIII would be released in 2017,[85] and in March, Lucasfilm announced a release date of May 26, 2017.[86][87] In January 2016, The Last Jedi was rescheduled for December 15, 2017 in 3D and IMAX 3D.[50][88] On January 23, 2017, the film's title was announced as Star Wars: The Last Jedi.[51] Similarly to The Empire Strikes Back, Return of the Jedi and The Force Awakens, \\"Episode VIII\\" was included in the film's opening crawl, although not in its official title.[89]\\r\\nThe Last Jedi had its world premiere in Los Angeles on December 9, 2017.[90] The European premiere was held at London's Royal Albert Hall on December 12, 2017, with a red carpet event.[91]\\r\\nA set of eight promotional postage stamps were released on October 12, 2017 in the UK by the Royal Mail with artwork by Malcolm Tween.[92] On September 19, 2017, Australia Post released a set of stamp packs.[93] Tie-in promotional campaigns were done with Nissan Motors and Bell Media, among others.

It was the first newspaper printed in Asia, and was published for two years, before the East India Company seized the newspaper's types and printing press. Founded by James Augustus Hicky, a highly eccentric Irishman who had previously spent two years in jail for debt, the newspaper was a strong critic of the administration of the Governor General Warren Hastings. The newspaper was important for its provocative journalism well before its time and its fight for free expression in India.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nHicky began publication of Hicky's Bengal Gazette on January 29, 1780, having first printed a prospectus announcing that he would begin printing a newspaper. The idea of printing a newspaper in India had been first floated twelve years earlier by the Dutch Adventurer William Bolts, but Hicky was to execute the concept.\\r\\nHicky first maintained a neutral editing policy (his slogan was \\"Open to all Parties, but Influenced by None\\") but after he learned that competitors with ties to the East India Company were intending to launch a rival newspaper,The India Gazette, he changed his editorial stance. Hicky accused an East India Company employee, Simeon Droz, of supporting the India Gazette as punishment for Hicky's refusal to pay a bribe to Droz and Marian Hastings, Warren Hastings' wife. In retaliation for Hicky's accusation, Hastings' Supreme Council forbid Hicky from mailing his newspaper through the post office.\\r\\nHicky claimed Hastings' order violated his right to free expression, and accused Hastings of corruption, tyranny, and even erectile dysfunction. Hicky also accused other British leaders in Calcutta of corruption, including the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of Judicature at Fort William, Elijah Impey of taking bribes, and the leader of the Protestant Mission, Johann Zacharias Kiernander of stealing from an orphaned children's fund. Hicky's editorial independence was short lived as Hastings and Kiernander sued him for libel. After four dramatic trials in June 1781, the Supreme Court found Hicky guilty and sentenced him to jail.\\r\\nHicky continued to print his newspaper from jail, and continued to accuse Hastings and others of corruption. He was finally suppressed when Hastings instituted fresh law suits against him. Hicky's Bengal Gazette ceased publication on March 23, 1782 when its types were seized by an order of the Supreme Court.\\r\\nHicky's Bengal Gazette was known for its sarcastic and provocative writing style. Unlike many newspapers of its time, the newspaper discussed taboo topics like female masturbation, and proto-class consciousness, arguing for the rights of the poor and the right to taxation with representation. It was strongly anti-war and anti-colonial and routinely ridiculed East India Company leadership for their expansionist and imperialist objectives.\\r\\nThe memoirist William Hickey (who, confusingly, was not in fact related to the paper's founder) describes its establishment shortly after he had succeeded (in his capacity as an attorney-at-law) in having James Hicky released from debtor's jail:\\r\\n\\"At the time I first saw Hicky he had been about seven years in India. During his confinement he met with a treatise upon printing, from which he collected sufficient information to commence [as a] printer, there never having been a press in Calcutta ... it occurred to Hicky that great benefit might arise from setting on foot a public newspaper, nothing of that kind ever having appeared. Upon his types &c., therefore reaching him, he issued proposals for printing a weekly paper, which, meeting with extraordinary encouragement, he speedily issued his first work. As a novelty every person read it, and was delighted. Possessing a fund of low wit, his paper abounded with proof of that talent. He had also a happy knack at applying appropriate nicknames and relating satirical anecdotes\\".[1]\\r\\nHicky benefited little from the paper, as William Hickey further tells us that he allowed it \\"to become the channel of personal invective, and the most scurrilous abuse of individuals of all ranks, high and low, rich and poor, many were attacked in the most wanton and cruel manner ... His utter ruin was the consequence\\".[2]\\r\\nHicky's Bengal Gazette was the first English-language newspaper, and indeed the first printed newspaper, to be published in both the Indian sub-continent and Asia as a whole. The newspaper became very famous not only among the British soldiers posted in India at that time but also inspired the Indians to write newspapers of their own.\\r\\nFive archives are known to have copies (all incomplete) of Hicky's Bengal Gazette:","input":"Which is the first english newspaper in india?"},{"output":"three","context":"Beverly Hills Cop is a series of American action comedy films and an unaired television pilot based on characters created by Daniel Petrie, Jr. and Danilo Bach. The films star Eddie Murphy as Axel Foley, a street-smart Detroit cop who travels to Beverly Hills, California to investigate crimes, even though it is out of his jurisdiction. There, he meets Detective Billy Rosewood (Judge Reinhold), Sergeant John Taggart (John Ashton), and Lieutenant Andrew Bogomil (Ronny Cox). Ashton and Cox do not appear in Beverly Hills Cop III. Murphy, Reinhold, and Gil Hill, who plays Axel's boss, Inspector Todd, are the only actors who appear in all three films. Harold Faltermeyer produced the now famous \\"Axel F\\" theme song heard throughout the series. The series as a whole have been distributed by Paramount Pictures. The films have made a total of $735,534,503[citation needed] at the worldwide box office.\\r\\nFollowing a failed attempt at a television series based on the films, Paramount decided to produce another film with a currently unknown release date.[4][5]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCBS ordered a pilot with Brandon T. Jackson starring as Axel Foley's son, Aaron.[6] The hour long crime drama was produced by the critically acclaimed writer Shawn Ryan who created The Shield and The Chicago Code.[7]\\r\\nIn January 2013, Ryan stated, \\"It's going to be a CBS procedural. We're going to solve a case every week, but we're going to do it with a lot of humor and a lot of fun. And I would say the stealth thing I would like to get in is, in a day and age when income inequality and class inequities dominate a lot of the country, this is going to be an opportunity to put a young working-class kid in Detroit in the middle of Beverly Hills, you can do a lot of stealth social commentary. My approach is to update it and make it feel modern and 2013. The pilot opens with a 4-5 minute sequence which I think is really harrowing and really dangerous, that would be something that you might have seen on Chicago Code or The Shield. I want it to feel grounded in that way. There'll be some opportunities for laughs after that. It's not a laughs come first show.\\"[8]\\r\\nIn February 2013, Kevin Pollak was cast as Rodney Daloof, an irritating and incredibly risk-averse in-house attorney for the Beverly Hills Police Department.[9] David Denman was cast as Brad, an honest and likable but socially awkward detective, formerly a baseball player and a musician.[10] Director Barry Sonnenfeld agreed to both direct the Beverly Hills Cop pilot and serve as an executive producer.[11] In May 2013, CBS decided to pass on the Beverly Hills Cop TV series.[12] In August 2013, Brandon T. Jackson give his reason about the pass:\\r\\nI think we were very edgy for CBS. I think we were the edgiest as you could've went for CBS. It would have been like a 'Fresh Prince' thing on CBS, like the edgiest you can go on network TV. But it doesn't agree to our franchise man.\\"[13]\\r\\nIn February 2015, Eddie Murphy stated that his cameo appearance in the pilot ironically doomed the show's chances: \\"I was gonna be in the pilot, and they thought I should be recurring. Im not gonna do Beverly Hills Cop on TV. I remember when they tested it  they had this little knob that you turn if you like it or you dont like it. So when Axel shows up in the pilot, some people turned the knob so much, they broke it. So the network decided 'if he isnt recurring, then this isnt gonna happen.' So it didnt happen.\\"[14]\\r\\nIn a January 2016 interview, Shawn Ryan blamed personality clashes with the network: \\"The official answer is they decided they liked other pilots better. If you look at what pilots they picked up that year, I think that's kind of incredible. I would say there were a lot of 400 lb. gorillas involved in the show and sometimes the gorillas dont always get along.\\". He also said that he was very proud of the pilot and loved working with Murphy.[15]\\r\\nDuring late Summer 2013, after CBS decided to pass on the TV series, Paramount decided to move forward with the fourth film.\\r\\nThere is a recurring instrumental theme throughout the film series called \\"Axel F\\", which was composed by Harold Faltermeyer.[16] The theme became popular with audiences, and has been remixed by Crazy Frog.[17] A new version of the theme was created for Beverly Hills Cop III, with Faltermeyer not returning for the film.[18]\\r\\nA fourth entry in the series was initially announced for release in the mid-1990s, under the production of Eddie Murphy's own production company \\"Eddie Murphy Productions\\", though production later fizzled out.[19] It was re-announced in 2006, when producer Jerry Bruckheimer announced his intention to resurrect the film series, though he eventually gave up his option to produce the film, instead passing production duties to Lorenzo di Bonaventura.[20][21] In September 2006 a script, an amalgamation of several earlier drafts, was presented to Murphy who was reported to be \\"very happy\\" with the outline which was described as an attempt to recapture the \\"feel of the original\\".[22][23] Murphy admitted one of his motivations for making a fourth Beverly Hills Cop film was to make up for the fact that the third film was \\"horrible\\" and that \\"he didn't want to leave (the series) like that\\".[24][25]\\r\\nIn May 2008, Rush Hour director Brett Ratner was officially named director, who promised the film would return under the series' standard \\"R\\" rating, rather than as a rumored watered down PG-13.[26][27] Michael Brandt and Derek Haas were hired as screenwriters to improve on the existing script in July 2008[28] and completed a new script, under the working title Beverly Hills Cop 2009, which would see Foley return to Beverly Hills to investigate the murder of his friend Billy Rosewood.[19] The script was eventually rejected, leaving Ratner to work on a new idea. In an interview with Empire magazine, Ratner stated \\"I'm working very hard on the fourth. It's very difficult, especially since there were three before. We're trying to figure out some important things, like where do we start? Is Axel retired? Is he in Beverly Hills? Is he on vacation? Does Judge Reinhold return as the loveable Billy Rosewood? Many questions to figure out, but I'm hoping to have a script before film disappears from our existence.\\"[19] Although Murphy himself committed to the project, it was unconfirmed whether the series' other principal actors, Judge Reinhold, John Ashton, Ronny Cox or Bronson Pinchot would also return,[29] though Ratner stated in late 2009 that he was trying to convince Reinhold and Ashton to reprise their roles.[30] Harold Faltermeyer's \\"Axel F\\", however, would definitely be returning for the proposed fourth installment, with Ratner quoted as saying \\"It'll be back but it'll be a whole new interpretation.\\"[31] On November 15, 2010, Ratner stated in an interview with MTV that there was still a possibility that they will make a fourth film, but that it wouldn't be \\"anytime soon.\\"[32]\\r\\nIn October 2011, Murphy discussed a possible fourth film, stating, \\"They're not doing it. What I'm trying to do now is produce a TV show starring Axel Foley's son, and Axel is the chief of police now in Detroit. I'd do the pilot, show up here and there. None of the movie scripts were right; it was trying to force the premise. If you have to force something, you shouldn't be doing it. It was always a rehash of the old thing. It was always wrong.\\"[33]\\r\\nDuring late Summer 2013, after CBS decided to pass on the TV series, Paramount decided to move forward with the fourth film. On September 13, 2013, Jerry Bruckheimer, stated he was in talks to produce. On December 6, 2013, it was announced that Eddie Murphy will again reprise the role of Axel Foley and Brett Ratner will direct.[34] On May 2, 2014, Deadline announced that screenwriters Josh Appelbaum and Andre Nemec would be penning the screenplay.[5]\\r\\nOn June 27, 2014, in an interview with Rolling Stone, Murphy discussed returning to the edgier type character of Axel Foley after years of making family friendly films. \\"I haven't done a street guy, working class, blue-collar character in ages so maybe it's like, 'Oh, wow, I didn't remember he was able to do that,'\\" Murphy said. According to studio reports on the film's plot, Foley will return to Detroit after leaving his job in Beverly Hills and he will be faced with the coldest winter on record to navigate the new rules and old enemies of one of America's most tenacious cities. The state of Michigan approved $13.5 million in film incentives, based on an estimated $56.6 million of filmmaker spending in the state. The film will be shot in and around Detroit and is estimated to provide jobs for 352 workers. The film was originally scheduled for a March 25, 2016 release,[35] but on May 6, 2015, Paramount Pictures pulled Beverly Hills Cop IV from its release schedule, due to script concerns.[36][37] On June 14, 2016, Deadline.com reported that Adil El Arbi and Bilall Fallah, directors of the Belgian drama Black, would direct the film.[38]\\r\\nIn January 2017, it was revealed that a new entry in the franchise will commence filming in June 2017 with Eddie Murphy reprising his role as Axel Foley, and Adil El Arbi and Bilall Fallah as directors.[39][40]","input":"How many beverly hills cops movies are there?"},{"output":"Chile Eboe-Osuji from Nigeria","context":"The Presidency of the International Criminal Court is the organ responsible for the proper administration of the Court (apart from the Office of the Prosecutor).[1] The Presidency oversees the activities of the Registry and organises the work of the judicial divisions.

It derives from functionalist theories of crime and was developed by Ivan Nye (1958), who proposed that there were four types of control:\\r\\n\\r\\nSocial control theory proposes that people's relationships, commitments, values, norms, and beliefs encourage them not to break the law. Thus, if moral codes are internalized and individuals are tied into and have a stake in their wider community, they will voluntarily limit their propensity to commit deviant acts. The theory seeks to understand the ways in which it is possible to reduce the likelihood of criminality developing in individuals. It does not consider motivational issues, simply stating that human beings may choose to engage in a wide range of activities, unless the range is limited by the processes of socialization and social learning. The theory derives from a Hobbesian view of human nature as represented in Leviathan, i.e. that all choices are constrained by implicit social contracts, agreements and arrangements among people. Thus, morality is created in the construction of social order, assigning costs and consequences to certain choices and defining some as evil, immoral and/or illegal.[1]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe earliest form of the theory (or at least the earliest recorded) was proposed by Edward A. Ross in 1901, who defined social control as \\"the more that the smooth running of social machinery implies the frequent breaking off or turning aside of individual activities, the more perfect is the social order.\\"[2]  Hence, the more perfect that the social order is, the more social control is achieved.  His best-known work, Social Control (1901), deals with the reasons for and the means of societal limitation of the individual.[3]\\r\\n\\r\\nAnother early form of the theory was proposed by Reiss (1951: 196) who defined delinquency as, \\"...behavior consequent to the failure of personal and social controls.\\"  Personal control was defined as, \\"...the ability of the individual to refrain from meeting needs in ways which conflict with the norms and rules of the community\\" while social control was, \\"...the ability of social groups or institutions to make norms or rules effective.\\" Reiss' version did not specify the sources of such \\"abilities\\" nor the specific control mechanisms leading to conformity, but he did assert that the failure of primary groups such as the family to provide reinforcement for non-delinquent roles and values was crucial to the explanation of delinquency.\\r\\nReiss also wrote extensively on the application of his work to criminology.[4]\\r\\n\\r\\nJackson Toby (1957),[5] argued that \\"the uncommitted adolescent is a candidate for gang socialization.\\"[6] acknowledging \\"gang socialization\\" as part of the causal, motivational dynamic leading to delinquency, but introduced the concept of stakes in conformity to explain \\"candidacy\\" for such learning experiences. He believed that all could be tempted into delinquency, but most refused because they considered that they had too much to lose. The young who had few stakes or investments in conformity were more likely to be drawn into gang activity. The notion of stakes in conformity fits very well with concepts invoked in later versions of social control theory.\\r\\n\\r\\nIvan Nye (1958)[7] not only elaborated a social control theory of delinquency, but specified ways to \\"operationalize\\" (measure) control mechanisms and related them to self-reports of delinquent behavior. He formulated the theory after interviewing 780 young people in Washington State. The sample was criticized because it did not represent any urban environments, and those selected might have been more apt to describe their families unfavorably. Some were concerned that criminal activity was only mentioned in two of the questions, so the extrapolations to crime in general were considered unsafe. Like Reiss, he focused on the family as a source of control. Moreover, Nye specified three different types of control:\\r\\n\\r\\nYouth may be directly controlled through constraints imposed by parents, limiting the opportunity for delinquency, as well as through parental rewards and punishments. However, they may be constrained when free from direct control by their anticipation of parental disapproval (indirect control), or through the development of a conscience, an internal constraint on behavior. The focus on the family as a source of control was in marked contrast to the emphasis on economic circumstances as a source of criminogenic motivation at the time.[8] Although he acknowledged motivational forces by stating that, \\"...some delinquent behavior results from a combination of positive learning and weak and ineffective social control\\" (1958: 4), he adopted a control-theory position when he proposed that, \\"...most delinquent behavior is the result of insufficient social control...\\"\\r\\n\\r\\nWalter Reckless (1961)[9] developed containment theory by focusing on a youth's self-conception or self-image of being a good person as an insulator against peer pressure to engage in delinquency.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis inner containment through self-images is developed within the family and is essentially formed by about the age of twelve. Outer containment was a reflection of strong social relationships with teachers and other sources of conventional socialization within the neighborhood. The basic proposition is there are \\"pushes\\" and \\"pulls\\" that will produce delinquent behavior unless they are counteracted by containment. The motivations to deviate as pushes are:\\r\\n\\r\\nand the pulls are:\\r\\n\\r\\nAn analysis of 'neutralization' was developed by Sykes and Matza (1957)[11] who believed that there was little difference between delinquents and non-delinquents, with delinquents engaging in non-delinquent behavior most of the time. They also asserted that most delinquents eventually opt out of the delinquent lifestyle as they grow older, suggesting that there is a basic code of morality in place but that the young are able to deviate by using techniques of neutralization, i.e. they can temporarily suspend the applicability of norms by developing attitudes \\"favorable to deviant behavior\\". The five common techniques were:\\r\\n\\r\\nLater Matza (1964) developed his theory of \\"drift\\" which proposed that people used neutralization to drift in and out of conventional behaviour, taking a temporary break from moral restraints. Matza based his \\"drift\\" theory upon four observations which were:\\r\\n\\r\\nAlthough this theory of drift has not been widely supported by empirical tests, it remains a key idea in criminology despite not answering why some conform and others don't.\\r\\n\\r\\nTravis Hirschi adopted Toby's concept of an investment in conventionality or \\"stake in conformity\\". He stressed the rationality in the decision whether to engage in crime and argued that a person was less likely to choose crime if they had strong social bonds.\\r\\n\\r\\nHirschi has since moved away from his bonding theory, and in co-operation with Michael R. Gottfredson, developed a general theory or \\"self-control theory\\" in 1990. Akers (1991) argued that a major weakness of this new theory was that Gottfredson and Hirschi did not define self-control and the tendency toward criminal behavior separately. By not deliberately operationalizing self-control traits and criminal behavior or criminal acts individually, it suggests that the concepts of low self-control and propensity for criminal behavior are the same. Hirschi and Gottfredson (1993) rebutted Akers argument by suggesting it was actually an indication of the consistency of general theory. That is, the theory is internally consistent by conceptualizing crime and deriving from that a concept of the offender's traits. The research community remains divided on whether the general theory is sustainable but there is emerging confirmation of some of its predictions (e.g. LaGrange & Silverman: 1999)\\r\\n\\r\\nGibbs (1989)[13] has redefined social control and applied it to develop a control theory of homicide. Any attempt to get an individual to do or refrain from doing something can be considered an attempt at control. To qualify as 'social' control, such attempts must involve three parties. One or more individuals intends to manipulate the behavior of another by or through a third party. Gibbs' third party can be an actual person or a reference to \\"society\\", \\"expectations\\" or \\"norms\\". For example, if one party attempts to influence another by threatening to refer the matter to a third party assumed to have authority, this is referential social control. If one party attempts to control another by punishing a third (e.g. general deterrence), it is a form of vicarious social control. The presence of the third party distinguishes social control from mere external behavioral control, simple interpersonal responses, or issuing orders for someone to do something. This definition clearly distinguishes social control from mere \\"reactions to deviance\\" and from deviant behavior itself.\\r\\n\\r\\nGibbs argues that \\"Homicide can be described either as control or as resulting from control failure\\" (1989: 35), and proposes that the homicide rate is a function not just of the sheer volume of disputes, but also of the frequency of recourse to a third party for peaceful dispute settlement (p37). When one person fails to control the actions of another through the third party, murder represents another violent attempt at direct control. People resort to self-help when forms of social control are unavailable or fail. Gibbs is critical of Hirschi's Social Control Theory because it merely assumes that social relationships, personal investments and beliefs that discourage delinquency are social controls (which is one reason why Hirschi's theory is often referred to as a Social Bond Theory).\\r\\n\\r\\nMuch of the early research on social control theory is based on self-reporting studies. Critics of self-report data note that there may be various motives for disclosing information, and that questions may be interpreted differently by individual participants. Nevertheless, many of the conclusions are intuitively convincing, e.g. that individuals will not engage in crime if they think that this will sacrifice the affection or respect of significant others, or cause them to lose employment or their autonomy if they face imprisonment. Davies (1994 and 2004), reports that in late-nineteenth century Britain, crime rates fell dramatically, as did drug and alcohol abuse, and illegitimacy became less common. All of these indexes of deviance were fairly steady between World War I and 1955. After 1955, they all rose to create a U-curve of deviance, over the period from 1847 to 1997. He attributes the initial shift to adoption of a culture in which the assumptions of Protestant Christianity were taken for granted. Everyone at the time believedat least somewhatin a moral code of helping others. This belief was rooted in religion. The same social norms for the defense of the person and property that informed the law before 1955 remain the policy norms. Furthermore, the concept that people are uncontrollable and may offend against those norms in social interactions, cannot be explained by simply counting how many people practice the golden rule (see the general discussion in Braithwaite: 1989[14]).","input":"Who came up with the social control theory?"},{"output":"acrosome reaction","context":"During fertilization, a sperm must first fuse with the plasma membrane and then penetrate the female egg in order to fertilize it. Fusing to the egg usually causes little problem, whereas penetrating through the egg's hard shell or extracellular matrix can present more of a problem to the sperm. Therefore, sperm cells go through a process known as the acrosome reaction which is the reaction that occurs in the acrosome of the sperm as it approaches the egg. The acrosome is a cap-like structure over the anterior half of the sperm's head.\\r\\nAs the sperm approaches the zona pellucida of the egg, which is necessary for initiating the acrosome reaction, the membrane surrounding the acrosome fuses with the plasma membrane of the sperm's head, exposing the contents of the acrosome. The contents include surface antigens necessary for binding to the egg's cell membrane, and numerous enzymes which are responsible for breaking through the egg's tough coating and allowing fertilization to occur.[1]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThere are considerable species variations in the morphology and consequences of the acrosome reaction. In several species the trigger for the acrosome reaction has been identified in a layer that surrounds the egg.\\r\\nIn some lower animal species a protuberance (the acrosomal process) forms at the apex of the sperm head, supported by a core of actin microfilaments. The membrane at the tip of the acrosomal process fuses with the egg's plasma membrane.\\r\\nIn some echinoderms, including starfish and sea urchins, a major portion of the exposed acrosomal content contains a protein that temporarily holds the sperm on the egg's surface.\\r\\nIn mammals the acrosome reaction releases hyaluronidase and acrosin; their role in fertilization is not yet clear. The acrosomal reaction does not begin until the sperm comes into contact with the oocyte's zona pellucida. Upon coming into contact with the zona pellucida, the acrosomal enzymes begin to dissolve and the actin filament comes into contact with the zona pellucida. Once the two meet, a calcium influx occurs, causing a signaling cascade(need references). The cortical granules inside the oocyte then fuse to the outer membrane and a transient fast block reaction occurs.\\r\\nIt also alters a patch of pre-existing sperm plasma membrane so that it can fuse with the egg plasma membrane(need references).\\r\\nA sperm penetration assay includes an acrosome reaction test that assesses how well a sperm is able to perform during the fertilization process. Sperm that are unable to properly go through the acrosome reaction will not be able to fertilize an egg. However, this problem only occurs in about 5% of men that have the test done. This test is rather expensive and provides limited information on a man's fertility.[2]\\r\\nIn other cases, such as in the wood mouse Apodemus sylvaticus, premature acrosome reactions have been found to cause increased motility in aggregates of spermatozoa promoting fertilization.[3]\\r\\nThe acrosomal reaction normally takes place in the ampulla of the fallopian tube (site of fertilization) when the sperm penetrates the secondary oocyte. A few events precede the actual acrosome reaction. The sperm cell acquires a \\"hyperactive motility pattern\\" by which its flagellum produces vigorous whip-like movements that propel the sperm through the cervical canal and uterine cavity, until it reaches the isthmus of the fallopian tube. The sperm approaches the ovum in the ampulla of the fallopian tube with the help of various mechanisms, including chemotaxis. Glycoproteins on the outer surface of the sperm then bind with glycoproteins on the zona pellucida of the ovum.\\r\\nSperm that did not initiate the acrosome reaction prior to reaching to the zona pellucida are unable to penetrate the zona pellucida. Since the acrosome reaction has already occurred, sperm are then able to penetrate the zona pellucida due to mechanical action of the tail, not because of the acrosome reaction itself.[4]\\r\\nThe first stage is the penetration of corona radiata, by releasing hyaluronidase from the acrosome to digest cumulus cells surrounding the oocyte and exposing acrosin attached to the inner membrane of the sperm. The cumulus cells are embedded in a gel-like substance made primarily of hyaluronic acid, and developed in the ovary with the egg and support it as it grows. It is necessary for the acrosome reaction to occur before the sperm cell reaches the zona pellucida.[4]\\r\\nAcrosin digests the zona pellucida and membrane of the oocyte. Part of the sperm's cell membrane then fuses with the egg cell's membrane, and the contents of the head sink into the egg. In the mouse it has been demonstrated that ZP3, one of the proteins that make up the zona pellucida, binds to a partner molecule (to the 1,4-galactosyl transferase receptors) on the sperm. This lock-and-key type mechanism is species-specific and prevents the sperm and egg of different species from fusing. The zona pellucida also releases Ca granules to prevent additional sperm from binding. There is some evidence that this binding is what triggers the acrosome to release the enzymes that allow the sperm to fuse with the egg. It is likely that a similar mechanism occurs in other mammals, but the diversity of zona proteins across species means that the relevant protein and receptor may differ.\\r\\nAs the sperm arrive at the egg, it is the egg that chooses the sperm and pulls it towards her.[5] The selected sperm actually tries to swim away from the egg but is tethered to the egg by female hormones. The membrane around the egg literally opens up and swallows the sperm.[6]\\r\\nUpon penetration, if all is occurring normally, the process of egg-activation occurs and the oocyte is said to have become activated. This is thought to be induced by a specific protein phospholipase c zeta. It undergoes its secondary meiotic division, and the two haploid nuclei (paternal and maternal) fuse to form a zygote. In order to prevent polyspermy and minimise the possibility of producing a triploid zygote, several changes to the egg's cell membranes renders them impenetrable shortly after the first sperm enters the egg.\\r\\nThe aforementioned process describes the physiologically relevant events. One should however bear in mind that a certain percentage of sperm cells will undergo a spontaneous acrosome reaction without the presence of the ovum. Those cells are not able to fertilise the egg, even if they do reach it later. Other cells will spontaneously shed their acrosome during the process of apoptosis/necrosis.\\r\\nWhen using intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) for IVF, the implantation rate is higher in oocytes injected with spermatozoa that have undergone acrosome reaction (~40%) vs. those injected with nonreacted spermatozoa (~10%). The implantation rate is ~25% in when injected with both reacted and nonreacted spermatozoa. The delivery rate per cycle follows the same trend.[7]\\r\\nThe acrosome reaction can be stimulated in vitro by substances a sperm cell may encounter naturally such as progesterone or follicular fluid, as well as the more commonly used calcium ionophore A23187.\\r\\nBirefringence microscopy,[7] flow cytometry[8] or fluorescence microscopy can be used for assessing the shedding of the acrosome or \\"acrosome reaction\\" of a sperm sample. Flow cytometry and fluorescence microscopy are usually done after staining with a fluoresceinated lectin such as FITC-PNA, FITC-PSA, FITC-ConA, or fluoresceinated antibody such as FITC-CD46.[9] The antibodies/lectins have a high specificity for different parts of the acrosomal region, and will only bind to a specific site (acrosomal content/ inner/outer membrane). If bound to a fluorescent molecule, regions where these probes have bound can be visualised. Sperm cells with artificially induced acrosome reactions may serve as positive controls.\\r\\nFor fluorescence microscopy a smear of washed sperm cells are made, airdried, permealized and then stained. Such a slide is then viewed under light of a wavelength that will cause the probe to fluoresce if it is bound to the acrosomal region. At least 200 cells are viewed in an arbitrary fashion and classified as either acrosome intact (fluorescing bright green) or acrosome reacted (no probe present, or only on the equatorial region). It is then expressed as a percentage of the counted cells.\\r\\nFor assessment with flow cytometry the washed cells are incubated with the chosen probe, (possibly washed again) and then sampled in a flow cytometer. After gating the cell population according to forward- and side-scatter the resulting data can be analysed (E.g. mean fluorescences compared). With this technique a probe for viability, like propidium iodide (PI) could also be included in order to exclude dead cells from the acrosome assessment, since many sperm cells will spontaneously lose their acrosome when they die.","input":"How does the sperm cell penetrate an egg?"},{"output":"the acquittal of former St. Louis police officer Jason Stockley in the Shooting of Anthony Lamar Smith","context":"[1]\\r\\nBeginning with the afternoon of September 15, 2017, a series of protests took place in St. Louis, Missouri, following the acquittal of former St. Louis police officer Jason Stockley in the Shooting of Anthony Lamar Smith, an African American man.[2] Over 160 people have been arrested during the first three days of demonstrations, with largely peaceful protests ongoing. There has been significant criticism around the police and governmental response to protests, resulting in lawsuits from the ACLU.[11]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nProtests began in downtown St. Louis near the courthouse, with an estimated 200ÿ300 people protesting.[12] The protests were mostly peaceful. A couple of individuals jumped on a police vehicle, breaking its windshield, and attempted to block a bus full of police in riot gear, some throwing bottles. Police responded with mace, driving protesters back.[13] Protests in downtown later moved to the Central West End neighborhood with the protest growing to about 1000 people. They were peaceful until about 9:45?pm, when protesters made their way to the home of mayor Lyda Krewson. One agitator threw a rock at Krewson's house, and another threw red paint on the home.[12][6] The mayor did not appear to be home at the time. Protesters continued to head through town, clashing with police repeatedly and shattering the windows of a Subway, a public library and a Culpeppers location.[5][better?source?needed] Throughout the day, a total of 33 people,[14] 32 of whom were local,[14] were arrested and charged with crimes ranging from peace disturbance to destruction of property.[14] US Justice Department announces that no federal investigation will take place.[15]\\r\\nOn the afternoon of September 16, protesters marched through a shopping center in the St. Louis suburb of Des Peres and blocked a road.[16] Later, a peaceful march was held in the St. Louis suburb of University City, but violence erupted as night fell, as demonstrators threw projectiles at police and smashed windows down the street, damaging 23 businesses[17]. The demonstrators also damaged a police vehicle.[18] Police made nine arrests.[16]\\r\\nAbout 1,000 people protested outside police headquarters in downtown St. Louis. The event was peaceful until a small group of protesters started smashing the windows of a Marriott hotel and other businesses. Police arrested 123 people.[19][20][21] Police also said unknown chemical substances were thrown at them and that a officer on bike was taken to the hospital for non-life threatening injuries.[9] Among those arrested included an undercover St. Louis police officer, a Getty Images photojournalist, and an Air Force lieutenant.[22]\\r\\nProtestors gathered outside the downtown St. Louis jail.[23]\\r\\nPolice in Richmond Heights shut down the St Louis Galleria after a group of protesters blocked the intersection of Brentwood Boulevard and Galleria Parkway.[24] Protests start outside Busch Stadium in downtown St Louis, as a Billy Joel concert takes place.[25]\\r\\nProtesters marched through the Saint Louis Galleria in Richmond Heights before St. Louis County Police said it ordered the demonstrators to disperse.[26] Police made 22 people arrests.[26] One officer and two protesters were injured during the incident.

It is the smallest of the five federal service academies and provides education to future Coast Guard officers in one of eight major fields of study. Unlike the other service academies, however, admission to the Coast Guard Academy does not require a congressional nomination.\\r\\nStudents are officers-in-training and are referred to as cadets. Tuition for cadets is fully funded by the Coast Guard in exchange for an obligation of five years active duty service upon graduation.[2] This obligation increases if the cadet chooses to go to flight school or graduate school. Approximately 250 cadets enter the academy each summer, with about 200 graduating. Graduates are commissioned as ensigns. The academic program grants a Bachelor of Science degree in one of eight majors, with a curriculum that grades cadets' performance upon a holistic education of academics, physical fitness, character, and leadership.\\r\\nCadets are required to adhere to the academy's \\"Honor Concept,\\" \\"Who lives here reveres honor, honors duty,\\" which is emblazoned in the halls of the academy's entrance. The academy's motto is Scienti? cedit mare, which is Latin for \\"the sea yields to knowledge\\".\\r\\nThe Academy is accredited by the New England Association of Schools and Colleges, ABET, and AACSB for its various programs.[3]{\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe roots of the academy lie in the School of Instruction of the Revenue Cutter Service, the school of the Revenue Cutter Service. The School of Instruction was established near New Bedford, Massachusetts in 1876 and used the USRC Dobbin for its exercises. Captain John Henriques served as superintendent from founding until 1883. The one civilian instructor was Professor Edwin Emery, who taught mathematics, astronomy, English composition, French, physics, theoretical steam engineering, history, international law, and revenue law, among other subjects.[4] The School was a two-year apprenticeship, in essence, supplemented by minimal classroom work. The student body averaged five to ten cadets per class. With changes to new training vessels, the school moved to Curtis Bay, Maryland in 1900 and to Fort Trumbull in 1910, a Revolutionary Warÿera Army installation in New London, Connecticut. In 1914, the school became the Revenue Cutter Academy, and it became the Coast Guard Academy in 1915 with the merger of the Revenue Cutter Service and the Life Saving Service.\\r\\nLand was purchased in New London on 31 July 1930 for the construction of the Coast Guard Academy. The 40-acre site was made up of two parcels from the Allyn and Payne estates and was purchased for $100,000. The $100,000 was not raised through a bond issue, as originally planned, but with a bank loan based on uncollected back taxes.[5] The contract was awarded to Murch Brothers Construction Company of St. Louis and ground was broken on January 1931 by Jean Hamlet, daughter of RADM Harry G. Hamlet, Academy Superintendent from 1928ÿ1932. On 15 May 1931, Treasury Secretary Andrew W. Mellon visited New London to lay the cornerstone of Hamilton Hall. Construction proceeded relatively on schedule and cadets moved in to the new buildings on 20 September 1932.[5]\\r\\nIn 1946, the academy received the barque Horst Wessel as a war reparation from Germany, a 295-foot tall ship which was renamed the USCGC Eagle. It remains the main training vessel for cadets at the academy as well as for officer candidates as the Coast Guard's Officer Candidate School, which is located on the grounds of the USCGA.\\r\\nThe academy was racially integrated in 1962 at the request of President Kennedy.[6] The academy began admitting women in 1976 at the request of Congress.[7]\\r\\nSuperintendent of the academy Vice Admiral Harry G. Hamlet composed the academy's mission statement in 1929. All entering cadets must memorize the statement during their first few days of Swab Summer, the indoctrination period for new cadets.\\r\\nThe mission of the United States Coast Guard Academy is to graduate young men and women with sound bodies, stout hearts and alert minds, with a liking for the sea and its lore, and with that high sense of Honor, Loyalty and Obedience which goes with trained initiative and leadership; well-grounded in seamanship, the sciences and the amenities, and strong in the resolve to be worthy of the traditions of commissioned officers in the United States Coast Guard, in the service of their country and humanity.[8]\\r\\nUnlike the other service academies, admission to the USCGA does not require a congressional nomination. This is due to the fervent objections of Captain John A. Henriques, the first Superintendent of the Revenue Cutter School of Instruction (later the Revenue Cutter Academy). His objection stemmed from years of poor political appointments in the U.S. Revenue Cutter Service's bureaucracy.\\r\\nThe academy is regularly cited as being one of the most difficult American institutions of higher education in which to gain entrance.[9] Each year more than 2,000 students apply and appointments are offered until the number accepting appointments to the incoming class numbers reaches approximately 400; the average entering class size is 300 cadets.[10] Those who have accepted appointments as cadets report to the USCGA in late June or early July for \\"Swab Summer\\", a basic military training program designed to prepare them for the rigors of their Fourth Class year. After four years of study and training, approximately 200 of those cadets will graduate. About 35 percent of cadets are women.\\r\\nAll graduating cadets earn commissions as ensigns in the United States Coast Guard, as well as Bachelor of Science degrees. For that reason the academy maintains a core curriculum of science and professional development courses in addition to major-specific courses. Each cadet takes two semesters of classes during the school year and then spends the majority of the summer in military training to produce officers of character with the requisite professional skills. Among these are courses in leadership, ethics, organizational behavior, and nautical science. The majority of cadets report to their first units after graduating, which are either afloat units, shore units, or basic flight training as student naval aviators, with the training conducted under the auspices of the U.S. Navy. Those that are assigned afloat serve as either deck watch officers or student engineers. Professional maritime studies courses help prepare cadets in piloting, voyage planning, deck seamanship, and all aspects of shiphandling, as well as Coast Guard leadership and administrative duties.\\r\\nAcademics at the USCGA stress the sciences and engineering, but different courses of study are available. In addition, several of the majors offer tracks of specialization (for example, Marine and Environmental Science majors can choose to focus on biology, chemistry, or geophysics). Cadets sometimes opt to take elective courses with Connecticut College (adjacent the academy's campus) as part of an open exchange agreement.\\r\\nThe academy offers eight majors:[11]\\r\\nEach summer, cadets participate in training programs according to their class. The summers are organized as follows:[12]\\r\\nEach week during the school year cadets participate in Regimental Review, a formal military drill. In addition, cadets perform a variety of military duties at the academy. Like all cadets and midshipmen at the United States service academies, Coast Guard cadets are on active duty in the military and wear uniforms at all times. Cadets receive a monthly stipend to pay for books, uniforms, and other necessities. Cadets receive monthly pay of $1,017.00, as of 2015.[13] From this amount, pay is automatically deducted for the cost of uniforms, books, supplies, services, and other miscellaneous expenses. Cadets only receive a portion of their total pay in cash. Fourth-class to second-class receive monthly stipends of $100, $200, $300, respectively. First-class receive the difference between the pay and outstanding expenses.\\r\\nThe Corps is organized as one regiment divided into eight companies, each of which is composed of about 120 cadets of all classes. Although the Corps of Cadets is supervised directly by the Commandant of Cadets (a Coast Guard officer with the rank of captain), the academy operates on the concept of \\"the Corps leading the Corps.\\"\\r\\nThe Corps of Cadets is largely a self-directed organization that follows a standard military chain of command:[14]\\r\\nThe highest-ranking cadet in each company is the Company Commander, a first-class cadet (\\"firstie\\"), equivalent to a senior. Although each company has some leeway in their standards and practices, every company commander reports to the Regimental Staff who plan and oversee all aspects of cadet life. At the top of the cadet chain of command is the Regimental Commander, the highest ranking cadet. Command positions, both in companies and on Regimental Staff, are highly competitive, and a cadet's overall class rank is often a deciding factor in who is awarded the position.\\r\\nThe eight companies are named for the first eight letters of the NATO phonetic alphabet. Each has a special focus in administering day-to-day affairs: Alpha company is in charge of health and wellness. Bravo company is in charge of training. Charlie company is in charge of administering the honor system, Delta company is in charge of drill and ceremonies. Echo company is in charge of transportation and logistics. Foxtrot is in charge of operating the cadet conduct system, organizing the watch rotations, and making the regulations. Golf company is in charge of supplies for cleaning and repairing damaged rooms within the corps. Hotel company is in charge of morale events, and so forth. To accomplish these missions, each company is divided, along shipboard lines, into three departments, each of which is divided into a variety of divisions. Divisions are the most basic unit at the Coast Guard Academy, and each has a very specific duty. Each division is commanded by a firstie and contains several members of each other class.\\r\\nThis organizational structure is designed to give every cadet a position of leadership and to emulate the structure of a Coast Guard cutter, in which the division officer and department head positions are filled by junior officers. Third-class cadets directly mentor the fourth-class in their division, just as junior petty officers would be responsible for the most junior enlisted personnel (non-rates). Second-class cadets act as non-commissioned officers, and ensure that the regulations and accountability are upheld. Firsties (like junior officers) are in supervisory roles, and are responsible for carrying out the mission of their divisions and ensuring the well-being of those under their command. Exchange cadets from the other federal service academies are also a part of the Corps, and take part in many activities alongside their USCGA counterparts.[15]\\r\\nThe USCGA Athletic Department offers 24 intercollegiate sports for cadets. The academy's athletics teams generally compete in Division III of the National Collegiate Athletic Association. Cadets devote two hours per academic day to athletic activities, either on varsity teams, club teams, or other sports pursuits. The academy nickname is the Bears, after the USRC Bear, which made a dramatic rescue in Alaska in 1897, shortly after the opening of the academy.\\r\\nNon-athletic activities also abound. Principal among them are the musical activities, centered on Leamy Hall. Regimental Band, Windjammers Drum & Bugle Corps, various pep bands, and the NiteCaps Jazz Band are some of the instrumental programs. Chapel Choirs, Glee Club, the Fairwinds all-female a cappella group, and The Idlers all-male sea shanty group are some of the vocal programs.\\r\\nThe academy's Model UN team was started in 2004, and has since been successfully competing around North America, and at the World Model UN Conference.\\r\\nMultiple clubs are offered to students at the Academy, such as the Judo Club, to help assist them in networking with others. All clubs are non-discriminating and offer insight into many cultures or sports based on the club theme.\\r\\nFor years it has been a United States Coast Guard Academy tradition for fourth-class cadets (freshman) to hide the chain links that sit outside the cadet library, also known as Waesche Hall. The chain links are historic: they were used during the Revolutionary War to prevent ships from transiting up the Hudson River and attacking West Point. When Benedict Arnold betrayed the United States, the chain links were one of the secrets that he revealed to the British. The family that originally forged the chain donated the links to the United States Coast Guard Academy. Since the donation, the fourth class is challenged each year at the annual homecoming football game to outwit the second class (juniors) and keep the chain hidden until half-time. If the fourth class is successful in hiding the links until the end of the second quarter, it is granted some sort of reward such as carry-on (this allows the fourth class to have privileges of the upper upperclassman for a day).\\r\\nCaptain-Commandant;

It took place in Uruguay from 13 to 30 July 1930. FIFA, football's international governing body, selected Uruguay as host nation, as the country would be celebrating the centenary of its first constitution, and the Uruguay national football team had successfully retained their football title at the 1928 Summer Olympics. All matches were played in the Uruguayan capital, Montevideo, the majority at the Estadio Centenario, which was built for the tournament.\\r\\n\\r\\nThirteen teams (seven from South America, four from Europe and two from North America) entered the tournament. Only a few European teams chose to participate because of the difficulty of travelling to South America. The teams were divided into four groups, with the winner of each group progressing to the semi-finals. The first two World Cup matches took place simultaneously, and were won by France and the United States, who defeated Mexico 4ÿ1 and Belgium 3ÿ0, respectively. Lucien Laurent of France scored the first goal in World Cup history, while US goalkeeper Jimmy Douglas posted the first official \\"clean sheet\\" in the tournament.\\r\\n\\r\\nArgentina, Uruguay, the United States and Yugoslavia each won their respective groups to qualify for the semi-finals. In the final, hosts and pre-tournament favourites Uruguay defeated Argentina 4ÿ2 in front of a crowd of 68,346?people, and became the first nation to win the World Cup.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe first World Cup was the only one without qualification. Every country affiliated with FIFA was invited to compete, and given a deadline of 28 February 1930 to accept. Plenty of interest was shown by nations in the Americas; Argentina, Brazil, Bolivia, Chile, Mexico, Paraguay, Peru and the United States all entered. A total of seven South American teams participated, more than in any subsequent World Cup Finals. However, because of the long and costly trip by ship across the Atlantic Ocean, and the length of absence required for players,[2] very few European teams were inclined to take part. Some refused to countenance travel to South America in any circumstances,[3] and no European entries were received before the February deadline. In an attempt to gain some European participation, the Uruguayan Football Association sent a letter of invitation to The Football Association, even though the British Home Nations (England, Northern Ireland, Scotland and Wales) had resigned from FIFA at the time. This was rejected by the FA Committee on 18 November 1929.[4] Two months before the start of the tournament, no team from Europe had officially entered.[5]\\r\\nFIFA president Jules Rimet intervened, and eventually four European teams made the trip by sea: Belgium, France, Romania, and Yugoslavia. The Romanians, managed by Constantin R?dulescu and coached by their captain Rudolf Wetzer and Octav Luchide, entered the competition following the intervention of newly crowned King Carol?II. He selected the squad personally, and negotiated with employers to ensure that the players would still have jobs upon their return.[6] The French entered at the personal intervention of Rimet, but neither France's star defender Manuel Anatol nor the team's regular coach Gaston Barreau could be persuaded to make the trip.[7] The Belgians participated at the instigation of German-Belgian FIFA vice-president Rodolphe Seeldrayers.[8]\\r\\n\\r\\nLucien Laurent[9]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Romanians boarded the SS Conte Verde at Genoa, the French were picked up at Villefranche-sur-Mer on 21 June 1930;[10] and the Belgians embarked at Barcelona.[11] The Conte Verde carried Rimet, the trophy and the three designated European referees: the Belgians Jean Langenus and Henri Christophe, along with Thomas Balway, a Parisian who may have been English. The Brazilian team were picked up when the boat docked in Rio de Janeiro on 29 June before arriving in Uruguay on 4 July.[5] Yugoslavia travelled via the mail steamship Florida from Marseille.[11]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the Kingdom of Yugoslavia there were doubts about their participation at first. Since the Croatians decided to boycott the national team, King Alexander I did not want to finance the whole idea, but in the end they found a solution. Belgrade football association officials decided to round up only domestic (Serbian) star players, mainly from two rival Belgrade clubs, BSK and SK Jugoslavija, with an additional three Serbs who played for French clubs (Ivan Bek among them). \\r\\nTherefore, the Yugoslavia team was exclusively made up of Serbian players; and with the two biggest stars of the team, Blagoje Marjanovi? (\\"Mo?a\\") and Aleksandar Tirnani? (\\"Tirke\\"), both from BSK, they were ready for a trip to South America to represent Yugoslavia in the World Cup. The Yugoslavians were the youngest team in the World Cup; with an average age of 21 years and 258 days. After their first match, against Brazil, they received a new nickname \\"The Ich-es\\" or \\"Ichachos\\" (in Spanish) by the Uruguayan press; referring to most of the player's surnames that ended up with the \\"-i?\\" or \\"-vi?\\" suffix, which is quite common for Serbian last names. They achieved the jointÿbiggest success in both Yugoslav and Serbian subsequent World Cup footballing history, by earning fourth place, a result that would be repeated in 1962.[12]\\r\\n\\r\\nItaly, Sweden, the Netherlands, Spain, Hungary and Uruguay all lodged applications to host the event.[2][13] Uruguay's bid became the clear selection after all the other countries withdrew their bids.\\r\\n\\r\\nAll matches took place in Montevideo. Three stadiums were used: Estadio Centenario, Estadio Pocitos, and Estadio Parque Central. The Estadio Centenario was built both for the tournament and as a celebration of the centenary of Uruguayan independence. Designed by Juan Scasso,[14] it was the primary stadium for the tournament, referred to by Rimet as a \\"temple of football\\".[15] With a capacity of 90,000, it was the largest football stadium outside the British Isles.[8] The stadium hosted 10 of the 18?matches, including both semi-finals and the final. However, a rushed construction schedule and delays caused by the rainy season meant the Centenario was not ready for use until five days into the tournament.[16] Early matches were played at smaller stadiums usually used by Montevideo football clubs Nacional and Pe?arol, the 20,000 capacity Parque Central and the Pocitos.\\r\\n\\r\\nFifteen referees participated in the tournament: four Europeans ÿ two Belgians (Henri Christophe and John Langenus), a Frenchman, and a Romanian (Constantin R?dulescu, also the Romanian team coach),[17] and eleven from the Americas ÿ among them six Uruguayans. In order to eliminate differences in the application of the Laws of the Game, the referees were invited to one short meeting to iron out the most conflicting issues arising from the game.[18]\\r\\n\\r\\nOf all the refereeing appointments, the two that attracted most attention were that of Gilberto de Almeida Rgo in the match between Argentina and France, in which the Brazilian referee blew for full-time six minutes early, and that of the Bolivian Ulises Saucedo's in the Argentina and Mexico encounter, which Argentina won 6ÿ3. During the game Saucedo, who was also the coach of Bolivia,[17] awarded three penalties.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe following is the list of officials to serve as referees and linesmen. Officials in italics were only employed as linesmen during the tournament.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe 13 teams were drawn into four groups, with Group 1 containing four teams, and the others containing  three. Each group played a round-robin format, with the four group winners progressing to the knockout semi-final stage.\\r\\n\\r\\nUruguay, Argentina, Brazil, and the United States were seeded, and were kept apart in the draw,[19] which took place in Montevideo once all the teams arrived.[20]\\r\\n\\r\\nSince there were no qualifying games, the opening two matches of the tournament were the first World Cup games ever played, taking place simultaneously on 13 July 1930; France beat Mexico 4ÿ1 at the Estadio Pocitos, while the United States defeated Belgium 3ÿ0 at the same time at the Estadio Gran Parque Central. France's Lucien Laurent was the scorer of the first World Cup goal.[21]\\r\\n\\r\\nLucien Laurent[9]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe first group was the only one to contain four teams: Argentina, Chile, France and Mexico. Two days after France's victory over Mexico, they faced group favourites Argentina. Injuries hindered France; goalkeeper Alex Thpot had to leave the field after 20?minutes, and Laurent, after a fierce tackle by Luis Monti, spent most of the match limping. However, they held out for most of the match, only succumbing to an 81st-minute goal scored from a Monti free kick.[22] The game featured an officiating controversy when referee Almeida Rgo erroneously blew the final whistle six minutes early, with Frenchman Marcel Langiller clear on goal; play only resumed after protests from the French players.[23] Although France had played twice in 48 hours, Chile had yet to play their first match. They faced Mexico the following day, gaining a comfortable 3ÿ0 win.[24]\\r\\n\\r\\nFrance's final match, against Chile, featured the first penalty kick of the World Cup . The first goalkeeper to save a penalty was Alex Thpot of France on 19 July 1930, saving from Chile's Carlos Vidal in the 30th minute of the match.[25] In Argentina's second match, against Mexico, three penalty kicks were awarded. During the same match on 19 July 1930 Mexico's Oscar Bonfiglio Martnez saved another penalty at the 23rd minute of the match against Argentina's Fernando Paternoster.[25] Guillermo Stbile scored a hat-trick in his international debut[26] as Argentina won 6ÿ3, despite the absence of their captain Manuel Ferreira, who had returned to Buenos Aires to take a law exam.[27] Qualification was decided by the group's final match, contested by Argentina and Chile, who had beaten France and Mexico, respectively. The game was marred by a brawl sparked by a foul on Arturo Torres by Monti.[23] Argentina won 3ÿ1 against their neighbours and advanced to the semi-finals.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe second group contained Brazil, Bolivia and Yugoslavia. Brazil, the group seeds, were expected to progress, but in the group's opening match, unexpectedly lost 2ÿ1 to Yugoslavia.[28] Going into the tournament Bolivia had never previously won an international match. For their opener they paid tribute to the hosts by wearing shirts each emblazoned with a single letter, spelling \\"Viva Uruguay\\" as the team lined up.[29] Both of Bolivia's matches followed a similar pattern, a promising start gradually transforming into heavy defeat. Against Yugoslavia, they held out for an hour before conceding, but were four goals down by the final whistle.[24] Misfortune played its part; several Bolivian goals were disallowed.[29] Against Brazil, when both teams had only pride to play for, the score was 1ÿ0 to Brazil at half-time. Brazil added three more in the second half, two of them scored by the multi-sportsman Preguinho.[30] Yugoslavia qualified for the semi-finals.\\r\\n\\r\\nHosts Uruguay were in a group with Peru and Romania. The opening match in this group saw the first player expulsion in the competition, when Plcido Galindo of Peru was dismissed against Romania. The Romanians made their man advantage pay; their 3ÿ1 win included two late goals. This match had the smallest crowd of any in World Cup history. The official attendance was 2,459, but the actual figure is generally accepted to be around 300.[31]\\r\\n\\r\\nBecause of construction delays at Estadio Centenario, Uruguay's first match was not played until five days into the tournament. The first to be held at the Centenario, it was preceded by a ceremony in honour of the Uruguayan centenary celebrations. The Uruguayan team spent the four weeks preceding the match in a training camp, at which strict discipline was exercised. Goalkeeper Andrs Mazali was dropped from the squad for breaking a curfew to visit his wife.[32] One hundred years to the day of the creation of Uruguay's first constitution, the hosts won a tight match against Peru 1ÿ0.[33] Spectators praised Peru's defense, and this turned out to be the only tournament match in which Uruguay scored only one goal.[34] The result was viewed as a poor performance by the Uruguayan press, but lauded in Peru.[33] Uruguay subsequently defeated Romania with ease, scoring four first half goals to win 4ÿ0.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe fourth group contained Belgium, Paraguay and The United States. The American team, which contained a significant number of new caps, were reputedly nicknamed \\"the shot-putters\\" by an unnamed source in the French contingent.[13] They beat their first opponents, Belgium, 3ÿ0. The ease of the victory was unexpected; Uruguayan newspaper Imparcial wrote that \\"the large score of the American victory has really surprised the experts\\".[35] Belgian reports bemoaned the state of the pitch and refereeing decisions, claiming that the second goal was offside.[35] The group's second match, played in windy conditions,[36] witnessed the first tournament hat-trick, scored by Bert Patenaude of the United States against Paraguay. Until 10 November 2006, the first hat-trick that FIFA acknowledged had been scored by Guillermo Stbile of Argentina, two days after Patenaude; however, in 2006 FIFA announced that Patenaude's claim to being the first hat-trick scorer was valid, as a goal previously assigned to teammate Tom Florie was reattributed to Patenaude.[37][38] With the United States having secured qualification, the final match in the group was a dead rubber. Paraguay beat Belgium by a 1ÿ0 margin.[24]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe four group winners, Argentina, Yugoslavia, Uruguay and the United States, moved to the semi-finals. The two semi-final matches saw identical scores. The first semi-final was played between the US and Argentina on a rain-drenched pitch. The United States team, which featured six British-born players, lost midfielder Raphael Tracy after ten minutes to a broken leg as the match became violent.[39] A Monti goal halfway through the first half gave Argentina a 1ÿ0 half-time lead. In the second half, the strength of the United States team was overwhelmed by the pace of the Argentinian attacks, the match finishing 6ÿ1 to Argentina.[40]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the second semi-final there were shades of the 1924 Summer Olympics match between Yugoslavia and Uruguay. Here, though, Yugoslavia took a surprise lead through Vujadinovi?. Uruguay then took a 2ÿ1 lead. Then shortly before half-time Yugoslavia had a goal disallowed by a controversial offside decision.[28] The hosts scored three more in the second half to win 6ÿ1, Pedro Cea completing a hat-trick.[40]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe now-traditional third place play-off was not established until 1934, so the format of the 1930 World Cup is unique in not distinguishing between the third and fourth placed teams. Occasional sources, notably a FIFA Bulletin from 1984, incorrectly imply that a third-place match occurred and was won 3ÿ1 by Yugoslavia.[41] Accounts differ as to whether a third-place match was originally scheduled. According to a 2009 book by Hyder Jawad, Yugoslavia refused to play a third-place match because they were upset with the refereeing in their semi-final against Uruguay.[42]\\r\\n\\r\\nAt the end of the championship, the captains of the United States team (Tom Florie)[43] and Yugoslavia (Milutin Ivkovi?)[44] both received bronze medals. Yet a FIFA technical committee report on the 1986 World Cup included full retrospective rankings of all teams at all previous World Cup finals; this report ranked the United States third and Yugoslavia fourth, due to a better goal difference on otherwise identical records,[45] a practice since continued by FIFA.[46] In 2010, the son of Kosta Had?i, the chief of Yugoslav delegation at the 1930 World Cup and the vice-president of the Football Association of Yugoslavia at the time, claimed that Yugoslavia, as a team, has been awarded one bronze medal, which has been kept by Had?i himself and his family for the following 80 years. According to this source, Yugoslavia was placed third because of the semi-finals loss to the eventual champions, Uruguay.[47][48]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe resounding wins for Uruguay and Argentina in the semi-finals meant the final was a repeat of the matchup in the 1928 Olympic final, which Uruguay had won 2ÿ1 after a replay.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe final was played at the Estadio Centenario on 30 July. Feelings ran high around the La Plata Basin as the Argentine supporters crossed the river with the war cry Victoria o muerte (\\"victory or death\\"), dispelling any uncertainty as to whether the tournament had captured the imagination of the public. The ten boats earmarked to carry Argentine fans from Buenos Aires to Montevideo proved inadequate,[28] and any number of assorted craft attempted the crossing. An estimated 10ÿ15,000 Argentinians made the trip, but the port at Montevideo was so overwhelmed that many did not even make landfall before kick-off, let alone reach the stadium.[49] At the stadium, supporters were searched for weapons.[50] The gates were opened at eight o'clock, six hours before kick-off, and at noon the ground was full,[28] the official attendance 93,000.[51] A disagreement overshadowed the build-up to the match as the teams failed to agree on who should provide the match ball, forcing FIFA to intervene and decree that the Argentine team would provide the ball for the first half and the Uruguayans would provide their own for the second.[13] Uruguay made one change from their semi-final line-up. Castro replaced Anselmo, who missed out due to illness.[40] Monti played for Argentina despite receiving death threats on the eve of the match. The referee was Belgian John Langenus, who only agreed to officiate a few hours before the game, having sought assurances for his safety.[52] One of his requests was for a boat to be ready at the harbour within one hour of the final whistle, in case he needed to make a quick escape.[53]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe hosts scored the opening goal through Pablo Dorado, a low shot from a position on the right.[54] Argentina, displaying superior passing ability, responded strongly. Within eight minutes they were back on level terms; Carlos Peucelle received a Ferreira through-ball, beat his marker and equalised.[54] Shortly before half-time leading tournament goalscorer Guillermo Stbile gave Argentina a 2ÿ1 lead. Uruguay captain Nasazzi protested, maintaining that Stbile was offside, but to no avail.[52] In the second half Uruguay gradually became ascendant. Shortly after Monti missed a chance to make the score 3ÿ1, Uruguay attacked in numbers, and Pedro Cea scored an equaliser.[54] Ten minutes later a goal by Santos Iriarte gave Uruguay the lead, and just before full-time Castro made it 4ÿ2 to seal the win.[52] Langenus ended the match a minute later, and Uruguay thus added the title World Cup winners to their mantle of Olympic champions. Jules Rimet presented the World Cup Trophy, which was later named for him, to the head of the Uruguayan Football Association, Ra~l Jude.[55] The following day was declared a national holiday in Uruguay;[51] in the Argentinian capital, Buenos Aires, a mob threw stones at the Uruguayan consulate.[56] Francisco Varallo (who played as a forward for Argentina) was the last player of the final to die, on 30 August 2010.[57]\\r\\n\\r\\nFrance, Yugoslavia and the United States all played friendlies in South America following the competition. Brazil played France on 1 August, Yugoslavia on 10 August and the United States on 17 August,[58] while Argentina hosted Yugoslavia on 3 August.[59]\\r\\n\\r\\nUruguay's aggregate goal difference of +12 over four games, at an average of +3 per match, remains the highest average goal difference per match of any World Cup champion, and the second highest of any World Cup Finals participant, after Hungary in 1954.\\r\\n\\r\\nWith eight goals, Guillermo Stbile was the top scorer in the tournament. In total, 70 goals were scored by 36 players, with only one of them credited as an own goal.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1986, FIFA published a report that ranked all teams in each World Cup up to and including 1986, based on progress in the competition, overall results and quality of the opposition.[45][12] The rankings for the 1930 tournament were as follows:\\r\\n\\r\\nThe last surviving player from Uruguay's World Cup-winning side was Ernesto Mascheroni, who died on 3 July 1984 at the age of 76. He was outlived by reserve defender Emilio Recoba who died on 12 September 1992 (aged 87), but did not play any matches in the tournament. However, many other players who participated in the tournament were still alive by this stage and the last surviving player from the tournament was Argentina's Francisco Varallo, who died on 30 August 2010 at the age of 100 ÿ eighty years after the tournament.[69] Lucien Laurent, the scorer of the first ever World Cup Goal was the last surviving Member of the France Squad and was invited in 1998 Final seeing France lifting its first ever World Cup win also as the only France member. He died in 2005 at the age of 97.","input":"Where was the first ever world cup held?"},{"output":"Thomas Alva Edison","context":"Thomas Alva Edison (February 11, 1847?ÿ October 18, 1931) was an American inventor and businessman, who has been described as America's greatest inventor.[1] He developed many devices that greatly influenced life around the world, including the phonograph, the motion picture camera, and the long-lasting, practical electric light bulb. Dubbed \\"The Wizard of Menlo Park\\",[2] he was one of the first inventors to apply the principles of mass production and large-scale teamwork to the process of invention, and because of that, he is often credited with the creation of the first industrial research laboratory.[3]\\r\\nEdison was a prolific inventor, holding 1,093 US patents in his name, as well as many patents in the United Kingdom, France, and Germany. More significant than the number of Edison's patents was the widespread impact of his inventions: electric light and power utilities, sound recording, and motion pictures all established major new industries worldwide. Edison's inventions contributed to mass communication and, in particular, telecommunications. These included a stock ticker, a mechanical vote recorder, a battery for an electric car, electrical power, recorded music and motion pictures. His advanced work in these fields was an outgrowth of his early career as a telegraph operator. Edison developed a system of electric-power generation and distribution[4] to homes, businesses, and factories ÿ a crucial development in the modern industrialized world. His first power station was on Pearl Street in Manhattan, New York.[4]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThomas Edison was born in Milan, Ohio, and grew up in Port Huron, Michigan. He was the seventh and last child of Samuel Ogden Edison Jr. (1804ÿ1896, born in Marshalltown, Nova Scotia) and Nancy Matthews Elliott (1810ÿ1871, born in Chenango County, New York).[5] His father, the son of a Loyalist refugee, had moved as a boy with the family from Nova Scotia, settling in southwestern Ontario (then called Upper Canada), in a village known as Shewsbury, later Vienna, by 1811. Samuel Jr. eventually fled Ontario, because he took part in the unsuccessful Mackenzie Rebellion of 1837.[6] His father, Samuel Sr., had earlier fought in the War of 1812 as captain of the First Middlesex Regiment. By contrast, Samuel Jr.'s struggle found him on the losing side, and he crossed into the United States at Sarnia-Port Huron. Once across the border, he found his way to Milan, Ohio. His patrilineal family line was Dutch by way of New Jersey; the surname had originally been \\"Edeson.\\"[7]\\r\\nEdison only attended school for a few months and was instead taught by his mother.[8] Much of his education came from reading R.G. Parker's School of Natural Philosophy and The Cooper Union for the Advancement of Science and Art.[9]\\r\\nEdison developed hearing problems at an early age. The cause of his deafness has been attributed to a bout of scarlet fever during childhood and recurring untreated middle-ear infections. Around the middle of his career, Edison attributed the hearing impairment to being struck on the ears by a train conductor when his chemical laboratory in a boxcar caught fire and he was thrown off the train in Smiths Creek, Michigan, along with his apparatus and chemicals. In his later years, he modified the story to say the injury occurred when the conductor, in helping him onto a moving train, lifted him by the ears.[10][11]\\r\\nEdison's family moved to Port Huron, Michigan, after the railroad bypassed Milan in 1854 and business declined.[12] Edison sold candy and newspapers on trains running from Port Huron to Detroit, and sold vegetables. He briefly worked as a telegraph operator in 1863 for the Grand Trunk Railway at the railway station in Stratford, Ontario, at age 16. He was held responsible for a near collision. He also studied qualitative analysis and conducted chemical experiments on the train until he left the job.[13][14]\\r\\nEdison obtained the exclusive right to sell newspapers on the road, and, with the aid of four assistants, he set in type and printed the Grand Trunk Herald, which he sold with his other papers.[14] This began Edison's long streak of entrepreneurial ventures, as he discovered his talents as a businessman. These talents eventually led him to found 14 companies, including General Electric, which is still one of the largest publicly traded companies in the world.[15][16]\\r\\nEdison became a telegraph operator after he saved three-year-old Jimmie MacKenzie from being struck by a runaway train. Jimmie's father, station agent J. U. MacKenzie of Mount Clemens, Michigan, was so grateful that he trained Edison as a telegraph operator. Edison's first telegraphy job away from Port Huron was at Stratford Junction, Ontario, on the Grand Trunk Railway.[17]\\r\\nIn 1866, at the age of 19, Edison moved to Louisville, Kentucky, where, as an employee of Western Union, he worked the Associated Press bureau news wire. Edison requested the night shift, which allowed him plenty of time to spend at his two favorite pastimesreading and experimenting. Eventually, the latter pre-occupation cost him his job. One night in 1867, he was working with a leadÿacid battery when he spilled sulfuric acid onto the floor. It ran between the floorboards and onto his boss's desk below. The next morning Edison was fired.[18]\\r\\nOne of his mentors during those early years was a fellow telegrapher and inventor named Franklin Leonard Pope, who allowed the impoverished youth to live and work in the basement of his Elizabeth, New Jersey, home. Some of Edison's earliest inventions were related to telegraphy, including a stock ticker. His first patent was for the electric vote recorder, U.S. Patent 90,646, which was granted on June 1, 1869.[19]\\r\\nOn December 25, 1871, Edison married 16-year-old Mary Stilwell (1855ÿ1884), whom he had met two months earlier; she was an employee at one of his shops. They had three children:\\r\\nMary Edison died at age 29 on August 9, 1884, of unknown causes: possibly from a brain tumor[23] or a morphine overdose. Doctors frequently prescribed morphine to women in those years to treat a variety of causes, and researchers believe that her symptoms could have been from morphine poisoning.[24]\\r\\nEdison generally preferred spending time in the laboratory to being with his family.[25]\\r\\nOn February 24, 1886, at the age of thirty-nine, Edison married the 20-year-old Mina Miller (1865ÿ1947) in Akron, Ohio.[26] She was the daughter of the inventor Lewis Miller, co-founder of the Chautauqua Institution, and a benefactor of Methodist charities. They also had three children together:\\r\\nMina outlived Thomas Edison, dying on August 24, 1947.[30][31]\\r\\nEdison began his career as an inventor in Newark, New Jersey, with the automatic repeater and his other improved telegraphic devices, but the invention that first gained him wider notice was the phonograph in 1877.[32] This accomplishment was so unexpected by the public at large as to appear almost magical. Edison became known as \\"The Wizard of Menlo Park,\\" New Jersey.[2]\\r\\nHis first phonograph recorded on tinfoil around a grooved cylinder. Despite its limited sound quality and that the recordings could be played only a few times, the phonograph made Edison a celebrity. Joseph Henry, president of the National Academy of Sciences and one of the most renowned electrical scientists in the US, described Edison as \\"the most ingenious inventor in this country... or in any other\\".[33] In April 1878, Edison traveled to Washington to demonstrate the phonograph before the National Academy of Sciences, Congressmen, Senators and US President Hayes.[34] The Washington Post described Edison as a \\"genius\\" and his presentation as \\"a scene... that will live in history\\".[35] Although Edison obtained a patent for the phonograph in 1878,[36] he did little to develop it until Alexander Graham Bell, Chichester Bell, and Charles Tainter produced a phonograph-like device in the 1880s that used wax-coated cardboard cylinders.\\r\\nEdison's major innovation was the establishment of an industrial research lab. It was built in Menlo Park, a part of Raritan Township, Middlesex County, New Jersey (today named Edison in his honor), with the funds from the sale of Edison's quadruplex telegraph. After his demonstration of the telegraph, Edison was not sure that his original plan to sell it for $4,000 to $5,000 was right, so he asked Western Union to make a bid. He was surprised to hear them offer $10,000 ($211,700 in today's dollars.[37]), which he gratefully accepted.[38] The quadruplex telegraph was Edison's first big financial success, and Menlo Park became the first institution set up with the specific purpose of producing constant technological innovation and improvement. Edison was legally attributed with most of the inventions produced there, though many employees carried out research and development under his direction. His staff was generally told to carry out his directions in conducting research, and he drove them hard to produce results.\\r\\nWilliam Joseph Hammer, a consulting electrical engineer, started working for Edison and began his duties as a laboratory assistant in December 1879. He assisted in experiments on the telephone, phonograph, electric railway, iron ore separator, electric lighting, and other developing inventions. However, Hammer worked primarily on the incandescent electric lamp and was put in charge of tests and records on that device (see Hammer Historical Collection of Incandescent Electric Lamps). In 1880, he was appointed chief engineer of the Edison Lamp Works. In his first year, the plant under General Manager Francis Robbins Upton turned out 50,000 lamps. According to Edison, Hammer was \\"a pioneer of incandescent electric lighting\\".[39] Frank J. Sprague, a competent mathematician and former naval officer, was recruited by Edward H. Johnson and joined the Edison organization in 1883. One of Sprague's contributions to the Edison Laboratory at Menlo Park was to expand Edison's mathematical methods. Despite the common belief that Edison did not use mathematics, analysis of his notebooks reveal that he was an astute user of mathematical analysis conducted by his assistants such as Francis Robbins Upton, for example, determining the critical parameters of his electric lighting system including lamp resistance by an analysis of Ohm's Law, Joule's Law and economics.[40]\\r\\nNearly all of Edison's patents were utility patents, which were protected for a 17-year period and included inventions or processes that are electrical, mechanical, or chemical in nature. About a dozen were design patents, which protect an ornamental design for up to a 14-year period. As in most patents, the inventions he described were improvements over prior art. The phonograph patent, in contrast, was unprecedented as describing the first device to record and reproduce sounds.[41]\\r\\nIn just over a decade, Edison's Menlo Park laboratory had expanded to occupy two city blocks. Edison said he wanted the lab to have \\"a stock of almost every conceivable material\\".[42] A newspaper article printed in 1887 reveals the seriousness of his claim, stating the lab contained \\"eight thousand kinds of chemicals, every kind of screw made, every size of needle, every kind of cord or wire, hair of humans, horses, hogs, cows, rabbits, goats, minx, camels?... silk in every texture, cocoons, various kinds of hoofs, shark's teeth, deer horns, tortoise shell?... cork, resin, varnish and oil, ostrich feathers, a peacock's tail, jet, amber, rubber, all ores?...\\" and the list goes on.[43]\\r\\nOver his desk, Edison displayed a placard with Sir Joshua Reynolds' famous quotation: \\"There is no expedient to which a man will not resort to avoid the real labor of thinking.\\"[44] This slogan was reputedly posted at several other locations throughout the facility.\\r\\nWith Menlo Park, Edison had created the first industrial laboratory concerned with creating knowledge and then controlling its application.[45] Edison's name is registered on 1,093 patents.[25]\\r\\nIn 1876, Edison began work to improve the microphone for telephones (at that time called a \\"transmitter\\") by developing a carbon microphone that used a button of carbon that would change resistance with the pressure of sound waves. Up to that point, microphones, such as the ones developed by Johann Philipp Reis and Alexander Graham Bell, worked by generating a weak current. Edison was one of many inventors working on the problem of creating a usable microphone for telephony by having it modulate an electrical current passed through it.[46] His work was concurrent with Emile Berliner's loose-contact carbon transmitter (who lost a later patent case against Edison over the carbon transmitters invention[47]) and David Edward Hughes study and published paper on the physics of loose-contact carbon transmitters (work that Hughes did not bother to patent).[46][48]\\r\\nEdison used the carbon microphone concept in 1877 to create an improved telephone for Western Union.[47] In 1886, Edison found a way to improve a Bell Telephone microphone, one that used loose-contact ground carbon, with his discovery that it worked far better if the carbon was roasted. This type was put in use in 1890[47] and was used in all telephones along with the Bell receiver until the 1980s.\\r\\nIn 1878, Edison began working on a system of electrical illumination, something he hoped could compete with gas and oil based lighting.[49] He began by tackling the problem of creating a long-lasting incandescent lamp, something that would be needed for indoor use. Many earlier inventors had previously devised incandescent lamps, including Alessandro Volta's demonstration of a glowing wire in 1800 and inventions by Henry Woodward and Mathew Evans. Others who developed early and commercially impractical incandescent electric lamps included Humphry Davy, James Bowman Lindsay, Moses G. Farmer,[50] William E. Sawyer, Joseph Swan, and Heinrich G?bel. Some of these early bulbs had such flaws as an extremely short life, high expense to produce, and high electric current drawn, making them difficult to apply on a large scale commercially.[51]:217ÿ218 Edison realized that to connect a series of electric lights to an economically manageable size and using the necessary thickness of copper wire, he would have to develop a lamp that used a low amount of current. This lamp must have high resistance and use relatively low voltage (around 110 volts).[52]\\r\\nAfter many experiments, first with carbon filaments and then with platinum and other metals, Edison returned to a carbon filament.[53] The first successful test was on October 22, 1879;[51]:186[54][55][25] it lasted 13.5 hours.[56] Edison continued to improve this design and on November 4, 1879, filed for U.S. patent 223,898 (granted on January 27, 1880) for an electric lamp using \\"a carbon filament or strip coiled and connected to platina contact wires\\".[57] This was the first commercially practical incandescent light.[58]\\r\\nAlthough the patent described several ways of creating the carbon filament including \\"cotton and linen thread, wood splints, papers coiled in various ways\\",[57] it was not until several months after the patent was granted that Edison and his team discovered a carbonized bamboo filament that could last over 1,200?hours. The idea of using this particular raw material originated from Edison's recalling his examination of a few threads from a bamboo fishing pole while relaxing on the shore of Battle Lake in the present-day state of Wyoming, where he and other members of a scientific team had traveled so that they could clearly observe a total eclipse of the sun on July 29, 1878, from the Continental Divide.[59]\\r\\nIn 1878, Edison formed the Edison Electric Light Company in New York City with several financiers, including J. P. Morgan, Spencer Trask,[60] and the members of the Vanderbilt family. Edison made the first public demonstration of his incandescent light bulb on December 31, 1879, in Menlo Park. It was during this time that he said: \\"We will make electricity so cheap that only the rich will burn candles.\\"[61]\\r\\nHenry Villard, president of the Oregon Railroad and Navigation Company, attended Edison's 1879 demonstration. Villard was impressed and requested Edison install his electric lighting system aboard Villard's company's new steamer, the Columbia. Although hesitant at first, Edison agreed to Villard's request. Most of the work was completed in May 1880, and the Columbia went to New York City, where Edison and his personnel installed Columbia's new lighting system. The Columbia was Edison's first commercial application for his incandescent light bulb. The Edison equipment was removed from Columbia in 1895.[62][63][64][65]\\r\\nLewis Latimer joined the Edison Electric Light Company in 1884. Latimer had received a patent in January 1881 for the \\"Process of Manufacturing Carbons\\", an improved method for the production of carbon filaments for light bulbs. Latimer worked as an engineer, a draftsman and an expert witness in patent litigation on electric lights.[66]\\r\\nGeorge Westinghouse's company bought Philip Diehl's competing induction lamp patent rights (1882) for $25,000, forcing the holders of the Edison patent to charge a more reasonable rate for the use of the Edison patent rights and lowering the price of the electric lamp.[67]\\r\\nOn October 8, 1883, the US patent office ruled that Edison's patent was based on the work of William E. Sawyer and was, therefore, invalid. Litigation continued for nearly six years, until October 6, 1889, when a judge ruled that Edison's electric light improvement claim for \\"a filament of carbon of high resistance\\" was valid.[68] To avoid a possible court battle with Joseph Swan, whose British patent had been awarded a year before Edison's, he and Swan formed a joint company called Ediswan to manufacture and market the invention in Britain.\\r\\nMahen Theatre in Brno (in what is now the Czech Republic), opened in 1882, and was the first public building in the world to use Edison's electric lamps. Francis Jehl, Edison's assistant in the invention of the lamp, supervised the installation.[69] In September 2010, a sculpture of three giant light bulbs was erected in Brno, in front of the theatre.[70]\\r\\nAfter devising a commercially viable electric light bulb on October 21, 1879, Edison developed an electric \\"utility\\" to compete with the existing gas light utilities.[71] On December 17, 1880, he founded the Edison Illuminating Company, and during the 1880s, he patented a system for electricity distribution. The company established the first investor-owned electric utility in 1882 on Pearl Street Station, New York City. On September 4, 1882, Edison switched on his Pearl Street generating station's electrical power distribution system, which provided 110 volts direct current (DC) to 59 customers in lower Manhattan.[72]\\r\\nIn January 1882, Edison switched on the first steam-generating power station at Holborn Viaduct in London. The DC supply system provided electricity supplies to street lamps and several private dwellings within a short distance of the station. On January 19, 1883, the first standardized incandescent electric lighting system employing overhead wires began service in Roselle, New Jersey.\\r\\nAs Edison expanded his direct current (DC) power delivery system, he received stiff competition from companies installing alternating current (AC) systems. From the early 1880s AC arc lighting systems for streets and large spaces had been an expanding business in the US. With the development of transformers in Europe and by Westinghouse Electric in the US in 1885ÿ1886, it became possible to transmit AC long distances over thinner and cheaper wires, and \\"step down\\" the voltage at the destination for distribution to users. This allowed AC to be used in street lighting and in lighting for small business and domestic customers, the market Edison's patented low voltage DC incandescent lamp system was designed to supply.[73] Edison's DC empire suffered from one of its chief drawbacks: it was suitable only for the high density of customers found in large cities. Edison's DC plants could not deliver electricity to customers more than one mile from the plant, and left a patchwork of unsupplied customers between plants. Small cities and rural areas could not afford an Edison style system at all, leaving a large part of the market without electrical service. AC companies expanded into this gap.\\r\\nEdison expressed views that AC was unworkable and the high voltages used were dangerous. As George Westinghouse installed his first AC systems in 1886, Thomas Edison struck out personally against his chief rival stating, \\"Just as certain as death, Westinghouse will kill a customer within six months after he puts in a system of any size. He has got a new thing and it will require a great deal of experimenting to get it working practically.\\"[74] Many reasons have been suggested for Edison's anti-AC stance. One notion is that the inventor could not grasp the more abstract theories behind AC and was trying to avoid developing a system he did not understand. Edison also appeared to have been worried about the high voltage from misinstalled AC systems killing customers and hurting the sales of electric power systems in general.[75] Primary was the fact that Edison Electric based their design on low voltage DC and switching a standard after they had installed over 100 systems was, in Edison's mind, out of the question. By the end of 1887, Edison Electric was losing market share to Westinghouse, who had built 68 AC-based power stations to Edison's 121 DC-based stations. To make matters worse for Edison, the Thomson-Houston Electric Company of Lynn, Massachusetts (another AC-based competitor) built 22 power stations.[76]\\r\\nParallel to expanding competition between Edison and the AC companies was rising public furor over a series of deaths in the spring of 1888 caused by pole mounted high voltage alternating current lines. This turned into a media frenzy against high voltage alternating current and the seemingly greedy and callous lighting companies that used it.[77][78] Edison took advantage of the public perception of AC as dangerous, and joined with self-styled New York anti-AC crusader Harold P. Brown in a propaganda campaign, aiding Brown in the public electrocution of animals with AC, and supported legislation to control and severely limit AC installations and voltages (to the point of making it an ineffective power delivery system) in what was now being referred to as a \\"battle of currents\\". The development of the electric chair was used in an attempt to portray AC as having a greater lethal potential than DC and smear Westinghouse at the same time via Edison colluding with Brown and Westinghouse's chief AC rival, the Thomson-Houston Electric Company, to make sure the first electric chair was powered by a Westinghouse AC generator.\\r\\nThomas Edison's staunch anti-AC tactics were not sitting well with his own stockholders. By the early 1890s, Edison's company was generating much smaller profits than its AC rivals, and the War of Currents would come to an end in 1892 with Edison forced out of controlling his own company. That year, the financier J.P. Morgan engineered a merger of Edison General Electric with Thomson-Houston that put the board of Thomson-Houston in charge of the new company called General Electric. General Electric now controlled three-quarters of the US electrical business and would compete with Westinghouse for the AC market.[79][80]\\r\\nEdison is credited with designing and producing the first commercially available fluoroscope, a machine that uses X-rays to take radiographs. Until Edison discovered that calcium tungstate fluoroscopy screens produced brighter images than the barium platinocyanide screens originally used by Wilhelm R?ntgen, the technology was capable of producing only very faint images.\\r\\nThe fundamental design of Edison's fluoroscope is still in use today, although Edison abandoned the project after nearly losing his own eyesight and seriously injuring his assistant, Clarence Dally. Dally made himself an enthusiastic human guinea pig for the fluoroscopy project and was exposed to a poisonous dose of radiation. He later died of injuries related to the exposure. In 1903, a shaken Edison said: \\"Don't talk to me about X-rays, I am afraid of them.\\"[81]\\r\\nThe key to Edison's fortunes was telegraphy. With knowledge gained from years of working as a telegraph operator, he learned the basics of electricity. This allowed him to make his early fortune with the stock ticker, the first electricity-based broadcast system. On August 9, 1892, Edison received a patent for a two-way telegraph.\\r\\nEdison was also granted a patent for the motion picture camera or \\"Kinetograph\\". He did the electromechanical design while his employee W.?K.?L. Dickson, a photographer, worked on the photographic and optical development. Much of the credit for the invention belongs to Dickson.[51] In 1891, Thomas Edison built a Kinetoscope or peep-hole viewer. This device was installed in penny arcades, where people could watch short, simple films. The kinetograph and kinetoscope were both first publicly exhibited May 20, 1891.[83]\\r\\nIn April 1896, Thomas Armat's Vitascope, manufactured by the Edison factory and marketed in Edison's name, was used to project motion pictures in public screenings in New York City. Later, he exhibited motion pictures with voice soundtrack on cylinder recordings, mechanically synchronized with the film.\\r\\nOfficially the kinetoscope entered Europe when the rich American Businessman Irving T. Bush (1869ÿ1948) bought from the Continental Commerce Company of Frank Z. Maguire and Joseph D. Baucus a dozen machines. Bush placed from October 17, 1894, the first kinetoscopes in London. At the same time, the French company Kintoscope Edison Michel et Alexis Werner bought these machines for the market in France. In the last three months of 1894, the Continental Commerce Company sold hundreds of kinetoscopes in Europe (i.e. the Netherlands and Italy). In Germany and in Austria-Hungary, the kinetoscope was introduced by the Deutsche-?sterreichische-Edison-Kinetoscop Gesellschaft, founded by the Ludwig Stollwerck[84] of the Schokoladen-Ssswarenfabrik Stollwerck & Co of Cologne.\\r\\nThe first kinetoscopes arrived in Belgium at the Fairs in early 1895. The Edison's Kintoscope Fran?ais, a Belgian company, was founded in Brussels on January 15, 1895, with the rights to sell the kinetoscopes in Monaco, France and the French colonies. The main investors in this company were Belgian industrialists.[85]\\r\\nOn May 14, 1895, the Edison's Kintoscope Belge was founded in Brussels. The businessman Ladislas-Victor Lewitzki, living in London but active in Belgium and France, took the initiative in starting this business. He had contacts with Leon Gaumont and the American Mutoscope and Biograph Co. In 1898, he also became a shareholder of the Biograph and Mutoscope Company for France.[85]\\r\\nEdison's film studio made close to 1,200 films. The majority of the productions were short films showing everything from acrobats to parades to fire calls including titles such as Fred Ott's Sneeze (1894), The Kiss (1896), The Great Train Robbery (1903), Alice's Adventures in Wonderland (1910), and the first Frankenstein film in 1910. In 1903, when the owners of Luna Park, Coney Island announced they would execute Topsy the elephant by strangulation, poisoning, and electrocution (with the electrocution part ultimately killing the elephant), Edison Manufacturing sent a crew to film it, releasing it that same year with the title Electrocuting an Elephant.\\r\\nAs the film business expanded, competing exhibitors routinely copied and exhibited each other's films.[86] To better protect the copyrights on his films, Edison deposited prints of them on long strips of photographic paper with the U.S. copyright office. Many of these paper prints survived longer and in better condition than the actual films of that era.[87]\\r\\nIn 1908, Edison started the Motion Picture Patents Company, which was a conglomerate of nine major film studios (commonly known as the Edison Trust). Thomas Edison was the first honorary fellow of the Acoustical Society of America, which was founded in 1929.\\r\\nEdison said his favorite movie was The Birth of a Nation. He thought that talkies had \\"spoiled everything\\" for him. \\"There isn't any good acting on the screen. They concentrate on the voice now and have forgotten how to act. I can sense it more than you because I am deaf.\\"[88] His favorite stars were Mary Pickford and Clara Bow.[89]\\r\\nStarting in the late 1870s, Thomas Edison became interested and involved with mining. High-grade iron ore was scarce on the east coast of the United States and Edison tried to mine low-grade ore. Edison developed a process using rollers and crushers that could pulverize rocks up to 10 tons. The dust was then sent between three giant magnets that would pull the iron ore from the dust. Despite the failure of his mining company, the Edison Ore Milling Company, Edison used some of the materials and equipment to produce cement.[90]\\r\\nIn 1901, Edison visited an industrial exhibition in the Sudbury area in Ontario, Canada and thought nickel and cobalt deposits there could be used in his production of electrical equipment. He returned as a mining prospector and is credited with the original discovery of the Falconbridge ore body. His attempts to mine the ore body were not successful, and he abandoned his mining claim in 1903.[91] A street in Falconbridge, as well as the Edison Building, which served as the head office of Falconbridge Mines, are named for him.\\r\\nThe Edison Storage Battery Company was founded in 1901. With this company Edison exploited his invention of the accumulator. In 1904 already 450 people worked at the company. The first accumulators were produced for electric cars. But there were several defects. Several Customers were complaining about the products. When the capital of the company was spent Edison paid for the company with his private money. Not until 1910 Edison showed a mature product: A Nickel-Iron-Battery with Lye as liquid.\\r\\nEdison became concerned with America's reliance on foreign supply of rubber and was determined to find a native supply of rubber. He joined Harvey Firestone and Henry Ford (each contributing $25,000) to create the Edison Botanic Research Corp. in 1927 and constructed a laboratory in Fort Myers, Florida the following year. Edison did the majority of the research and planting, sending results and sample rubber residues to his West Orange Lab. Edison employed a two-part Acid-base extraction, to derive latex from the plant material after it was dried and crushed to a powder.[92] After testing 17,000 plant samples, he eventually found an adequate source in the Goldenrod plant.\\r\\nEdison moved from Menlo Park after the death of his first wife, Mary, in 1884, and purchased a home known as \\"Glenmont\\" in 1886 as a wedding gift for his second wife, Mina, in Llewellyn Park in West Orange, New Jersey. In 1885, Thomas Edison bought property in Fort Myers, Florida, and built what was later called Seminole Lodge as a winter retreat. Edison and Mina spent many winters at their home in Fort Myers, and Edison tried to find a domestic source of natural rubber.[93]\\r\\nDue to the security concerns around World War I, Edison suggested forming a science and industry committee to provide advice and research to the US military, and he headed the Naval Consulting Board in 1915.[94]\\r\\nEdison's work on rubber took place largely at his botanic research laboratory in Fort Myers, which has been designated as a National Historic Chemical Landmark.[95] The laboratory was built after Thomas Edison, Henry Ford, and Harvey Firestone pulled together $75,000 to form the Edison Botanical Research Corporation. Initially, only Ford and Firestone were to contribute funds to the project while Edison did all the research. Edison, however, wished to contribute $25,000 as well. After testing over 17,000 plant species, Edison decided on Solidago leavenworthii, also known as Leavenworth's Goldenrod. The plant, which normally grows roughly 3ÿ4 feet tall with a 5% latex yield, was adapted by Edison through cross-breeding to produce plants twice the size and with a latex yield of 12%.[96]\\r\\nHenry Ford, the automobile magnate, later lived a few hundred feet away from Edison at his winter retreat in Fort Myers. Ford once worked as an engineer for the Edison Illuminating Company of Detroit and met Edison at a convention of affiliated Edison illuminating companies in Brooklyn, NY in 1896. Edison was impressed with Ford's internal combustion engine automobile and encouraged its developments. They were friends until Edison's death. Edison and Ford undertook annual motor camping trips from 1914 to 1924. Harvey Firestone and John Burroughs also participated.\\r\\nIn 1928, Edison joined the Fort Myers Civitan Club. He believed strongly in the organization, writing that \\"The Civitan Club is doing thingsbig thingsfor the community, state, and nation, and I certainly consider it an honor to be numbered in its ranks.\\"[97] He was an active member in the club until his death, sometimes bringing Henry Ford to the club's meetings.\\r\\nEdison was active in business right up to the end. Just months before his death, the Lackawanna Railroad inaugurated suburban electric train service from Hoboken to Montclair, Dover, and Gladstone, New Jersey. Electrical transmission for this service was by means of an overhead catenary system using direct current, which Edison had championed. Despite his frail condition, Edison was at the throttle of the first electric MU (Multiple-Unit) train to depart Lackawanna Terminal in Hoboken in September 1930, driving the train the first mile through Hoboken yard on its way to South Orange.[98]\\r\\nThis fleet of cars would serve commuters in northern New Jersey for the next 54 years until their retirement in 1984. A plaque commemorating Edison's inaugural ride can be seen today in the waiting room of Lackawanna Terminal in Hoboken, which is presently operated by New Jersey Transit.[98]\\r\\nEdison was said to have been influenced by a popular fad diet in his last few years; \\"the only liquid he consumed was a pint of milk every three hours\\".[51] He is reported to have believed this diet would restore his health. However, this tale is doubtful. In 1930, the year before Edison died, Mina said in an interview about him, \\"correct eating is one of his greatest hobbies.\\" She also said that during one of his periodic \\"great scientific adventures\\", Edison would be up at 7:00, have breakfast at 8:00, and be rarely home for lunch or dinner, implying that he continued to have all three.[88]\\r\\nEdison became the owner of his Milan, Ohio, birthplace in 1906. On his last visit, in 1923, he was reportedly shocked to find his old home still lit by lamps and candles.[citation needed]\\r\\nEdison died of complications of diabetes on October 18, 1931, in his home, \\"Glenmont\\" in Llewellyn Park in West Orange, New Jersey, which he had purchased in 1886 as a wedding gift for Mina. He is buried behind the home.[99][100]\\r\\nEdison's last breath is reportedly contained in a test tube at The Henry Ford museum near Detroit. Ford reportedly convinced Charles Edison to seal a test tube of air in the inventor's room shortly after his death, as a memento.[101] A plaster death mask and casts of Edison's hands were also made.[102] Mina died in 1947.\\r\\nHistorian Paul Israel has characterized Edison as a \\"freethinker\\".[51] Edison was heavily influenced by Thomas Paine's The Age of Reason.[51] Edison defended Paine's \\"scientific deism\\", saying, \\"He has been called an atheist, but atheist he was not. Paine believed in a supreme intelligence, as representing the idea which other men often express by the name of deity.\\"[51] In an October 2, 1910, interview in the New York Times Magazine, Edison stated:\\r\\nNature is what we know. We do not know the gods of religions. And nature is not kind, or merciful, or loving. If God made me? the fabled God of the three qualities of which I spoke: mercy, kindness, love? He also made the fish I catch and eat. And where do His mercy, kindness, and love for that fish come in? No; nature made us? nature did it all? not the gods of the religions.[103]\\r\\nEdison was accused of being an atheist for those remarks, and although he did not allow himself to be drawn into the controversy publicly, he clarified himself in a private letter:\\r\\nYou have misunderstood the whole article, because you jumped to the conclusion that it denies the existence of God. There is no such denial, what you call God I call Nature, the Supreme intelligence that rules matter. All the article states is that it is doubtful in my opinion if our intelligence or soul or whatever one may call it lives hereafter as an entity or disperses back again from whence it came, scattered amongst the cells of which we are made.[51]\\r\\nHe also stated, \\"I do not believe in the God of the theologians; but that there is a Supreme Intelligence I do not doubt.\\"[104]\\r\\nNonviolence was key to Edison's moral views, and when asked to serve as a naval consultant for World War I, he specified he would work only on defensive weapons and later noted, \\"I am proud of the fact that I never invented weapons to kill.\\" Edison's philosophy of nonviolence extended to animals as well, about which he stated: \\"Nonviolence leads to the highest ethics, which is the goal of all evolution. Until we stop harming all other living beings, we are still savages.\\"[105][106] He was a vegetarian[107] but not a vegan in actual practice, at least near the end of his life.[51]\\r\\nIn 1920, Edison set off a media sensation when he told B. C. Forbes of American Magazine that he was working on a \\"spirit phone\\" to allow communication with the dead, a story which other newspapers and magazines repeated.[108] Edison later disclaimed the idea, telling the New York Times in 1926 that \\"I really had nothing to tell him, but I hated to disappoint him so I thought up this story about communicating with spirits, but it was all a joke.\\"[109]\\r\\nThomas Edison was an advocate for monetary reform in the United States. He was ardently opposed to the gold standard and debt-based money. Famously, he was quoted in the New York Times stating \\"Gold is a relic of Julius Caesar, and interest is an invention of Satan.\\"[110]\\r\\nIn the same article, he expounded upon the absurdity of a monetary system in which the taxpayer of the United States, in need of a loan, can be compelled to pay in return perhaps double the principal, or even greater sums, due to interest. His basic point was that, if the Government can produce debt-based money, it could equally as well produce money that was a credit to the taxpayer.[110]\\r\\nHe thought at length about the subject of money in 1921 and 1922. In May 1922, he published a proposal, entitled \\"A Proposed Amendment to the Federal Reserve Banking System\\".[111] In it, he detailed an explanation of a commodity-backed currency, in which the Federal Reserve would issue interest-free currency to farmers, based on the value of commodities they produced. During a publicity tour that he took with friend and fellow inventor, Henry Ford, he spoke publicly about his desire for monetary reform. For insight, he corresponded with prominent academic and banking professionals. In the end, however, Edison's proposals failed to find support and were eventually abandoned.[112][113]\\r\\nThe President of the Third French Republic, Jules Grvy, on the recommendation of his Minister of Foreign Affairs, Jules Barthlemy-Saint-Hilaire, and with the presentations of the Minister of Posts and Telegraphs, Louis Cochery, designated Edison with the distinction of an Officer of the Legion of Honour (Lgion d'honneur) by decree on November 10, 1881;[114] Edison was also named a Chevalier in the Legion in 1879, and a Commander in 1889.[115]\\r\\nIn 1887, Edison won the Matteucci Medal. In 1890, he was elected a member of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences.\\r\\nThe Philadelphia City Council named Edison the recipient of the John Scott Medal in 1889.[115]\\r\\nIn 1899, Edison was awarded the Edward Longstreth Medal of The Franklin Institute.[116]\\r\\nHe was named an Honorable Consulting Engineer at the Louisiana Purchase Exposition World's fair in 1904.[115]\\r\\nIn 1908, Edison received the American Association of Engineering Societies John Fritz Medal.[115]\\r\\nIn 1915, Edison was awarded Franklin Medal of The Franklin Institute for discoveries contributing to the foundation of industries and the well-being of the human race.[117]\\r\\nIn 1920, the United States Navy department awarded him the Navy Distinguished Service Medal.[115]\\r\\nIn 1923, the American Institute of Electrical Engineers created the Edison Medal and he was its first recipient.[115]\\r\\nIn 1927, he was granted membership in the National Academy of Sciences.[115]\\r\\nOn May 29, 1928, Edison received the Congressional Gold Medal.[115]\\r\\nIn 1983, the United States Congress, pursuant to Senate Joint Resolution 140 (Public Law 97198), designated February 11, Edison's birthday, as National Inventor's Day.[118]\\r\\nLife magazine (USA), in a special double issue in 1997, placed Edison first in the list of the \\"100 Most Important People in the Last 1000 Years\\", noting that the light bulb he promoted \\"lit up the world\\". In the 2005 television series The Greatest American, he was voted by viewers as the fifteenth greatest.\\r\\nIn 2008, Edison was inducted in the New Jersey Hall of Fame.\\r\\nIn 2010, Edison was honored with a Technical Grammy Award.\\r\\nIn 2011, Edison was inducted into the Entrepreneur Walk of Fame and named a Great Floridian by the Florida Governor and Cabinet.[119]\\r\\nSeveral places have been named after Edison, most notably the town of Edison, New Jersey. Thomas Edison State University, nationally known for adult learners, is in Trenton, New Jersey. Two community colleges are named for him: Edison State College (now Florida SouthWestern State College) in Fort Myers, Florida, and Edison Community College in Piqua, Ohio.[120] There are numerous high schools named after Edison (see Edison High School) and other schools including Thomas A. Edison Middle School. Footballer Pel's father originally named him Edson, as a tribute to the inventor of the light bulb, but the name was incorrectly listed on his birth certificate as \\"Edison\\".[121]\\r\\nThe small town of Alva just east of Fort Myers took Edison's middle name.\\r\\nIn 1883, the City Hotel in Sunbury, Pennsylvania was the first building to be lit with Edison's three-wire system. The hotel was renamed The Hotel Edison upon Edison's return to the city on 1922.[122]\\r\\nLake Thomas A Edison in California was named after Edison to mark the 75th anniversary of the incandescent light bulb.[123]\\r\\nEdison was on hand to turn on the lights at the Hotel Edison in New York City when it opened in 1931.[124]\\r\\nThree bridges around the United States have been named in Edison's honor: the Edison Bridge in New Jersey,[125] the Edison Bridge in Florida,[126] and the Edison Bridge in Ohio.[127]\\r\\nIn space, his name is commemorated in asteroid 742 Edisona.\\r\\nIn West Orange, New Jersey, the 13.5 acres (5.5 hectares) Glenmont estate is maintained and operated by the National Park Service as the Edison National Historic Site, as is his nearby laboratory and workshops including the reconstructed \\"Black Maria\\"the world's first movie studio.[128] The Thomas Alva Edison Memorial Tower and Museum is in the town of Edison, New Jersey.[129] In Beaumont, Texas, there is an Edison Museum, though Edison never visited there.[130] The Port Huron Museum, in Port Huron, Michigan, restored the original depot that Thomas Edison worked out of as a young news butcher. The depot has been named the Thomas Edison Depot Museum.[131] The town has many Edison historical landmarks, including the graves of Edison's parents, and a monument along the St. Clair River. Edison's influence can be seen throughout this city of 32,000.\\r\\nIn Detroit, the Edison Memorial Fountain in Grand Circus Park was created to honor his achievements. The limestone fountain was dedicated October 21, 1929, the fiftieth anniversary of the creation of the lightbulb.[132] On the same night, The Edison Institute was dedicated in nearby Dearborn.\\r\\nHe was inducted into the Automotive Hall of Fame in 1969.\\r\\nA bronze statue of Edison was placed in the National Statuary Hall Collection at the United States Capitol in 2016, with the formal dedication ceremony held on September 20 of that year. The Edison statue replaced one of 19th-century state governor William Allen that had been one of Ohio's two allowed contributions to the collection.[133]\\r\\nThe Edison Medal was created on February 11, 1904, by a group of Edison's friends and associates. Four years later the American Institute of Electrical Engineers (AIEE), later IEEE, entered into an agreement with the group to present the medal as its highest award. The first medal was presented in 1909 to Elihu Thomson. It is the oldest award in the area of electrical and electronics engineering, and is presented annually \\"for a career of meritorious achievement in electrical science, electrical engineering or the electrical arts.\\"\\r\\nIn the Netherlands, the major music awards are named the Edison Award after him. The award is an annual Dutch music prize, awarded for outstanding achievements in the music industry, and is one of the oldest music awards in the world, having been presented since 1960.\\r\\nThe American Society of Mechanical Engineers concedes the Thomas A. Edison Patent Award to individual patents since 2000.[134]\\r\\nThe United States Navy named the USS Edison (DD-439), a Gleaves class destroyer, in his honor in 1940. The ship was decommissioned a few months after the end of World War II.[135] In 1962, the Navy commissioned USS Thomas A. Edison (SSBN-610), a fleet ballistic missile nuclear-powered submarine.[citation needed][136]\\r\\nThomas Edison has appeared in popular culture as a character in novels, films, comics and video games. His prolific inventing helped make him an icon and he has made appearances in popular culture during his lifetime down to the present day. Edison is also portrayed in popular culture as an adversary of Nikola Tesla.\\r\\n\\"Camping with Henry and Tom\\", a fictional play based on Edison's camping trips with Henry Ford, written by Mark St.Gemain. First presented at Lucille Lortel Theatre, New York, February 20, 1995.[citation needed]\\r\\nOn February 11, 2011, on what would have been Thomas Edison's 164th birthday, Google's homepage featured an animated Google Doodle commemorating his many inventions. When the cursor was hovered over the doodle, a series of mechanisms seemed to move, causing a lightbulb to glow.[137]\\r\\nThe following is a list of people who worked for Thomas Edison in his laboratories at Menlo Park or West Orange or at the subsidiary electrical businesses that he supervised.\\r\\nLocations\\r\\nInformation and media","input":"Who was the scientist that invented electric bulb?"},{"output":"highest (or final) court of appeal","context":"A supreme court is the highest court within the hierarchy of courts in many legal jurisdictions.  Other descriptions for such courts include court of last resort, apex court, and highest (or final) court of appeal.  Broadly speaking, the decisions of a supreme court are not subject to further review by any other court. Supreme courts typically function primarily as appellate courts, hearing appeals from decisions of lower trial courts, or from intermediate-level appellate courts.[1]\\r\\n\\r\\nHowever, not all highest courts are named as such. Civil law states tend not to have a single highest court. Additionally, the highest court in some jurisdictions is not named the \\"Supreme Court\\", for example, the High Court of Australia; this is because decisions by the High Court could formerly be appealed to the Privy Council. On the other hand, in some places the court named the \\"Supreme Court\\" is not in fact the highest court; examples include the New York Supreme Court, the Supreme Courts of several Canadian provinces/territories and the former Supreme Court of Judicature of England and Wales and Supreme Court of Judicature of Northern Ireland, which are all subordinate to higher courts of appeal.\\r\\n\\r\\nSome countries have multiple \\"supreme courts\\" whose respective jurisdictions have different geographical extents, or which are restricted to particular areas of law.  Some countries with a federal system of government may have both a federal supreme court (such as the Supreme Court of the United States), and supreme courts for each member state (such as the Supreme Court of Nevada), with the former having jurisdiction over the latter only to the extent that the federal constitution extends federal law over state law. However, other federations, such as Canada, may have a supreme court of general jurisdiction, able to decide any question of law.  Jurisdictions with a civil law system often have a hierarchy of administrative courts separate from the ordinary courts, headed by a supreme administrative court as is the case in the Netherlands.  A number of jurisdictions also maintain a separate constitutional court (first developed in the Czechoslovak Constitution of 1920), such as Austria, France, Germany, Luxembourg, Portugal, Russia, Spain and South Africa. Within the former British Empire, the highest court within a colony was often called the \\"Supreme Court\\", even though appeals could be made from that court to the United Kingdom's Privy Council (based in London).  A number of Commonwealth jurisdictions retain this system, but many others have reconstituted their own highest court as a court of last resort, with the right of appeal to the Privy Council being abolished.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn jurisdictions using a common law system, the doctrine of stare decisis applies, whereby the principles applied by the supreme court in its decisions are binding upon all lower courts; this is intended to apply a uniform interpretation and implementation of the law.  In civil law jurisdictions the doctrine of stare decisis is not generally considered to apply, so the decisions of the supreme court are not necessarily binding beyond the immediate case before it; however, in practice the decisions of the supreme court usually provide a very strong precedent, or jurisprudence constante, for both itself and all lower courts.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Supreme Court of Bangladesh is created by the provisions of the Constitution of Bangladesh, 1972. There are two Divisions of the Supreme Court, i.e. (a) Appellate Division and (b) High Court Division. Appellate Division is the highest Court of Appeal and usually does not exercise the powers of a court of first instance. Whereas, the High Court Division is a Court of first instance in writ/judicial review, company and admiralty matters.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Supreme Court of Canada was established in 1875 but only became the highest court in the country in 1949 when the right of appeal to the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council was abolished.  This court hears appeals from the courts of appeal from the provinces and territories, and also appeals from the Federal Court of Appeal.  The Supreme Court is a \\"General Court of Appeal.\\"[2]  It can decide any question of law considered by the lower courts, including constitutional law, federal law, and provincial law. The court's decisions are final and binding on the federal courts and the courts from all provinces and territories. The title \\"Supreme\\" can be confusing because, for example, the Supreme Court of British Columbia does not have the final say and controversial cases heard there often get appealed in higher courts - it is in fact one of the lower courts in such a process.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn Hong Kong, the Supreme Court of Hong Kong (now known as the High Court of Hong Kong) was the final court of appeal during its colonial times which ended with transfer of sovereignty in 1997. The final adjudication power, as in any other British Colonies, rested with the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council (JCPC) in London, United Kingdom. Now the power of final adjudication is vested in the Court of Final Appeal created in 1997. Under the Basic Law, its constitution, the territory remains a common law jurisdiction. Consequently, judges from other common law jurisdictions (including England and Wales) can be recruited and continue to serve in the judiciary according to Article 92 of the Basic Law. On the other hand, the power of interpretation of the Basic Law itself is vested in the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress (NPCSC) in Beijing (without retroactive effect), and the courts are authorised to interpret the Basic Law when trying cases, in accordance with Article 158 of the Basic Law. This arrangement became controversial in light of the right of abode issue in 1999, raising concerns for judicial independence.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn India, the Supreme Court of India was created on January 28, 1950 after adoption of the Constitution.\\r\\nArticle 141 of the Constitution of India states that the law declared by Supreme Court is to be binding on all Courts within the territory of India. It is the highest court in India and has ultimate judicial authority to interpret the Constitution and decide questions of national law (including local bylaws). The Supreme Court is also vested with the power of judicial review to ensure the application of the rule of law.\\r\\n\\r\\nNote that within the constitutional framework of India, Jammu and Kashmir (J&K) has a special status vis-a-vis the other states of India. Article 370 of the Constitution of India carves out certain exceptions for J&K. However, the Constitution (Application to Jammu and Kashmir) Order 1954 makes Article 141 applicable to the state of J&K and hence law declared by the Supreme Court of India is equally applicable to all courts of J&K including the High Court.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Supreme Court is the highest court in the Republic of Ireland. It has authority to interpret the constitution, and strike down laws and activities of the state that it finds to be unconstitutional. It is also the highest authority in the interpretation of the law. Constitutionally it must have authority to interpret the constitution but its further appellate jurisdiction from lower courts is defined by law. The Irish Supreme Court consists of its presiding member, the Chief Justice, and seven other judges. Judges of the Supreme Court are appointed by the President in accordance with the binding advice of the Government. The Supreme Court sits in the Four Courts in Dublin.\\r\\n\\r\\nIsrael's Supreme Court is at the head of the court system in the State of Israel. It is the highest judicial instance. The Supreme Court sits in Jerusalem. The area of its jurisdiction is the entire State. A ruling of the Supreme Court is binding upon every court, other than the Supreme Court itself.  The Israeli supreme court is both an appellate court and the high court of justice.  As an appellate court, the Supreme Court considers cases on appeal (both criminal and civil) on judgments and other decisions of the District Courts. It also considers appeals on judicial and quasi-judicial decisions of various kinds, such as matters relating to the legality of Knesset elections and disciplinary rulings of the Bar Association.  As the High Court of Justice (Hebrew: Beit Mishpat Gavoha Le'Zedek ??? ???? ???? ????; also known by its initials as Bagatz ??\\"?), the Supreme Court rules as a court of first instance, primarily in matters regarding the legality of decisions of State authorities: Government decisions, those of local authorities and other bodies and persons performing public functions under the law, and direct challenges to the constitutionality of laws enacted by the Knesset. The court has broad discretionary authority to rule on matters in which it considers it necessary to grant relief in the interests of justice, and which are not within the jurisdiction of another court or tribunal. The High Court of Justice grants relief through orders such as injunction, mandamus and Habeas Corpus, as well as through declaratory judgments.  The Supreme Court can also sit at a further hearing on its own judgment. In a matter on which the Supreme Court has ruled - whether as a court of appeals or as the High Court of Justice - with a panel of three or more justices, it may rule at a further hearing with a panel of a larger number of justices. A further hearing may be held if the Supreme Court makes a ruling inconsistent with a previous ruling or if the Court deems that the importance, difficulty or novelty of a ruling of the Court justifies such hearing.  The Supreme Court also holds the unique power of being able to order \\"trial de novo\\" (a retrial).\\r\\n\\r\\nIn Nauru, there is no single highest court for all types of cases. The Supreme Court has final jurisdiction on constitutional matters, but any other case may be appealed further to the Appellate Court. In addition, an agreement between Nauru and Australia in 1976 provides for appeals from the Supreme Court of Nauru to the High Court of Australia in both criminal and civil cases, with the notable exception of constitutional cases.[3][4]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn New Zealand, the right of appeal to the Privy Council was  abolished following the passing of the Supreme Court Act (2003). A right of appeal to the Privy Council remains for criminal cases which were decided before the Supreme Court was created, but it is likely that the successful appeal by Mark Lundy to the Privy Council in 2013 will be the last appeal to the Board from New Zealand.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe new Supreme Court of New Zealand was officially established at the beginning of 2004, although it did not come into operation until July. The High Court of New Zealand was until 1980 known as the Supreme Court. The Supreme Court has a purely appellate jurisdiction and hears appeals from the Court of Appeal of New Zealand. In some cases, an appeal may be removed directly to the Supreme Court from the High Court.  For certain cases, particularly cases which commenced in the District Court, a lower court (typically the High Court or the Court of Appeal) may be the court of final jurisdiction.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Supreme Court has been the apex court for Pakistan since the declaration of the republic in 1956 (previously the Privy Council had that function). The Supreme Court has the final say on matters of constitutional law, federal law or on matters of mixed federal and provincial competence. It can hear appeals on matters of provincial competence only if a matter of a constitutional nature is raised.\\r\\n\\r\\nWith respect to Pakistan's territories (i.e. FATA, Azad Kashmir, Northern Areas and Islamabad Capital Territory (ICT)) the Supreme Court's jurisdiction is rather limited and varies from territory to territory; it can hear appeals only of a constitutional nature from FATA and Northern Areas, while ICT generally functions the same as provinces. Azad Kashmir has its own courts system and the constitution of Pakistan does not apply to it as such; appeals from Azad Kashmir relate to its relationship with Pakistan.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe provinces have their own courts system, with the High Court as the apex court, except insofar as where an appeal can go to the Supreme Court as mentioned above.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Supreme Court of the United Kingdom is the ultimate court for criminal and civil matters in England, Wales and Northern Ireland and for civil matters in Scotland. (The supreme court for criminal matters in Scotland is the High Court of Justiciary.) The Supreme Court was established by the Constitutional Reform Act 2005 with effect from 1 October 2009, replacing and assuming the judicial functions of the House of Lords. Devolution issues under the Scotland Act 1998, Government of Wales Act and Northern Ireland Act were also transferred to the new Supreme Court by the Constitutional Reform Act, from the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn respect of Community Law the Supreme Court is subject to the decisions of the European Court of Justice. Since there can be no appeal from the Supreme Court, there is an interlocutory procedure by which the Supreme Court may refer to the European Court questions of European law which arise in cases before it, and obtain a definitive ruling before the Supreme Court gives its judgment.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Supreme Court shares its members and accommodation at the Middlesex Guildhall in London with the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council which hears final appeals from certain smaller Commonwealth countries, admiralty cases, and certain appeals from the ecclesiastical courts and statutory private jurisdictions, such as professional and academic bodies.\\r\\n\\r\\n(The Constitutional Reform Act also renamed the Supreme Court of Judicature of Northern Ireland to the Court of Judicature, and the rarely cited Supreme Court of Judicature for England and Wales as the Senior Courts of England and Wales).\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Supreme Court was set up in 2009; until then the House of Lords was the ultimate court in addition to being a legislative body, and the Lord Chancellor, with legislative and executive functions, was also a senior judge in the House of Lords.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Supreme Court of the United States, established in 1789, is the highest federal court in the United States, with powers of judicial review first asserted in Calder v. Bull (1798) in Justice Iredell's dissenting opinion.  The power was later given binding authority by Justice Marshall in Marbury v. Madison (1803). There are currently nine seats on the US Supreme Court.\\r\\n\\r\\nEach U.S. state has its own state supreme court, which is the highest authority interpreting that state's law and administering that state's judiciary.  Two states, Oklahoma and Texas, each have two separate highest courts that hear criminal and civil appellate matters.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn Texas, the state's Court of Criminal Appeals hears criminal appeals and has sole authority to grant the writ of habeas corpus to a person who has been convicted of a felony, but the Texas Supreme Court also hears appeals in juvenile delinquency matters in additional to civil cases as conventionally defined. Although juvenile cases fall under the Texas Family Code and are classified as civil proceedings, they are \\"quasi-criminal\\" in nature. In re M.A.F., 966 S.W.2d 448, 450 (Tex. 1998); see In re L.D.C., 400 S.W.3d 572, 574 (Tex. Crim. App. 2013). \\r\\n\\r\\nAlthough Delaware has a specialized court, the Court of Chancery, which hears cases in equity and many disputes involving corporate governance because many corporations chose to incorporate in Delaware regardless of where in the United States their operations and head office may be located, it is not a supreme court because the Delaware Supreme Court has appellate jurisdiction over it.[5]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe official names of state supreme courts vary, as do the titles of its members, which can cause confusion between jurisdictions because one state may use a name for its highest court that another uses for a lower court.  In New York, Maryland, and the District of Columbia the highest court is called the Court of Appeals, a name used by many states for their intermediate appellate courts.  Further, trial courts of general jurisdiction in New York are called the Supreme Court, and the intermediate appellate court is called the Supreme Court, Appellate Division.  In West Virginia, the highest court of the state is the  Supreme Court of Appeals.  In Maine and Massachusetts the highest court is styled the \\"Supreme Judicial Court\\"; the last is the oldest appellate court of continuous operation in the Western Hemisphere. Even within the same jurisdiction, the titles for judicial officeholders can cause confusion. In Texas the members of the Supreme Court and of the 14 intermediate courts of appeals are Justices, while the members of the Court of Criminal Appeals carry the title Judge, which is also used generically. Judges at the lowest trial-court level are called Justices of the Peace or JPs.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Roman law and the Corpus Juris Civilis are generally held to be the historical model for civil law. From the late 18th century onwards, civil law jurisdictions began to codify their laws, most of all in civil codes.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Supreme Court functions as a last resort tribunal. Its rulings cannot be appealed. It also decides on cases dealing with the interpretation of the constitution (for example, it can overturn a law passed by Congress if it deems it unconstitutional).\\r\\n\\r\\nIn Austria, the Austrian Constitution of 1920 (based on a draft by Hans Kelsen) introduced judicial review of legislative acts for their constitutionality. This function is performed by the Constitutional Court (Verfassungsgerichtshof), which is also charged with the review of administrative acts on whether they violate constitutionally guaranteed rights.\\r\\nOther than that, administrative acts are reviewed by the Administrative Court (Verwaltungsgerichtshof).  The Supreme Court (Oberste Gerichtshof (OGH)), stands at the top of Austria's system of \\"ordinary courts\\" (ordentliche Gerichte) as the final instance in issues of private law and criminal law.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn Brazil, the Supreme Federal Tribunal (Supremo Tribunal Federal) is the highest court. It is both the constitutional court and the court of last resort in Brazilian law. It only reviews cases that may be unconstitutional or final habeas corpus pleads for criminal cases. It also judges, in original jurisdiction, cases involving members of congress, senators, ministers of state, members of the high courts and the President and Vice-President of the Republic.  The Superior Court of Justice (Tribunal Superior de Justi?a) reviews State and Federal Circuit courts decisions for civil law and criminal law cases, when dealing with federal law or conflicting rulings. The Superior Labour Tribunal (Tribunal Superior do Trabalho) reviews cases involving labour law. The Superior Electoral Tribunal (Tribunal Superior Eleitoral) is the court of last resort of electoral law, and also oversees general elections. The Superior Military Tribunal (Tribunal Superior Militar) is the highest court in matters of federal military law.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn Croatia, the supreme jurisdiction is given to the Supreme Court, which secures a uniform application of laws.  The Constitutional Court exists to verify  constitutionality of laws and regulations, as well as decide on individual complaints on decisions on governmental bodies. It also decides on jurisdictional disputes between the legislative, executive and judicial branches.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn Denmark, all ordinary courts have original jurisdiction to hear all types of cases, including cases of a constitutional or administrative nature. As a result, there exists no special constitutional court, and therefore final jurisdiction is vested with the Danish Supreme Court (H?jesteret) which was established 14 February 1661 by king Frederik III.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn France, supreme appellate jurisdiction is divided among three judicial bodies:\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen there is jurisdictional dispute between judicial and administrative courts: the Court of Arbitration (Tribunal des conflits), which is empanelled half from the Court of Cassation and half from the Council of State and presided over by the Minister of Justice, is called together to settle the dispute or hand down a final decision.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe High Court (Haute Cour) exists only to impeach the President of the French Republic in case of \\"breach of his duties patently incompatible with his continuing in office\\". Since a constitutional amendment of 2007, the French Constitution states that the High Court is composed of all members of both Houses of Parliament. As of 2012, it has never been convened.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn Germany, there is no de jure single supreme court. Instead, cases are handled by numerous federal courts, depending on their nature.\\r\\n\\r\\nFinal interpretation of the German Constitution, the Grundgesetz, is the task of the Bundesverfassungsgericht (Federal Constitutional Court), which is the de facto highest German court, as it can declare both federal and state legislation ineffective, and has the power to overrule decisions of all other federal courts, despite not being a regular court of appeals on itself in the German court system. It is also the only court possessing the power and authority to outlaw political parties.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen it comes to civil and criminal cases, the Bundesgerichtshof (Federal Court of Justice) is at the top of the hierarchy of courts. The other branches of the German judicial system each have their own appellate systems, each topped by a high court; these are the Bundessozialgericht (Federal Social Court) for matters of social security, the Bundesarbeitsgericht (Federal Labour Court) for employment and labour, the Bundesfinanzhof (Federal Fiscal Court) for taxation and financial issues, and the Bundesverwaltungsgericht (Federal Administrative Court) for administrative law. The so-called Gemeinsamer Senat der Obersten Gerichtsh?fe (Joint Senate of the Supreme Courts) is not a supreme court in itself, but an ad-hoc body that is convened in only when one supreme court intends to diverge from another supreme court's legal opinion or when a certain case exceeds the authority of one court.  As the courts have well-defined areas of responsibility, situations like these are rather rare and so, the Joint Senate gathers very infrequently, and only to consider matters which are mostly definitory.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Supreme Court of Iceland (Icelandic: H?stirttur slands, lit. Highest Court of Iceland) was founded under Act No. 22/1919 and held its first session on 16 February 1920. The Court holds the highest judicial power in Iceland, where the court system has two levels.[6]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Supreme Court of India, also known colloquially as the 'apex court', is the highest judicial body in the Republic of India. Any decision taken by it is final and binding, and can only be modified in some cases (death sentence, etc.) by the President of India. It has several jurisdiction like \\r\\n1. Original\\r\\n2.Appellate \\r\\n3. Advisory\\r\\n\\r\\nIt is also known as court of records,  i. e.  all judgements are recorded and printed. These are cited in lower courts as case - law in various cases.\\r\\n\\r\\nItaly follows the French system of different supreme courts.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Italian court of last resort for most disputes is the Corte Suprema di Cassazione.  There is also a separate constitutional court, the Corte costituzionale, which has a duty of judicial review, and which can strike down legislation as being in conflict with the Constitution.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn Japan, the Supreme Court of Japan is called Iԃѭ~ (Saik-Saibansho; called Iԃ Saik-Sai for short), located in Chiyoda, Tokyo, and is the highest court in Japan. It has ultimate judicial authority within Japan to interpret the Constitution and decide questions of national law (including local by laws). It has the power of judicial review (i.e., it can declare Acts of Diet and Local Assembly, and administrative actions, unconstitutional).\\r\\n\\r\\nIn Luxembourg, challenges on the conformity of the law to the Constitution are brought before the Cour Constitutionnelle (Constitutional Court).  The most used and common procedure to present these challenges is by way of the \\"question prjudicielle\\" (prejudicial question).  The Court of last resort for civil and criminal proceedings is the \\"Cour de Cassation\\".\\r\\nFor administrative proceedings the highest court is the \\"Cour Administrative\\" (Administrative Court).\\r\\n\\r\\nThe supreme court of Macau is the Court of Final Appeal (Portuguese: Tribunal de ~ltima Instancia; Chinese: ˋܰ??).\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Supreme Court of Justice of the Nation (Spanish: Suprema Corte de Justicia de la Naci܇n) is the highest court in Mexico.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the Netherlands, the Supreme Court of the Netherlands is the highest court. Its decisions, known as \\"arresten\\", are absolutely final. The court is banned from testing legislation against the constitution, pursuant to the principle of the sovereignty of the States-General; the court can, however, test legislation against some treaties. Also, the ordinary courts in the Netherlands, including the Hoge Raad, do not deal with administrative law, which is dealt with in separate administrative courts, the highest of which is the Council of State (Raad van State)\\r\\n\\r\\nWhile the Philippines is generally considered a civil law nation, its Supreme Court is heavily modelled after the American Supreme Court. This can be attributed to the fact that the Philippines was colonized by both Spain and the United States, and the system of laws of both nations strongly influenced the development of Philippine laws and jurisprudence. Even as the body of Philippine laws remain mostly codified, the Philippine Civil Code expressly recognizes that decisions of the Supreme Court \\"form part of the law of the land\\", belonging to the same class as statutes. The 1987 Philippine Constitution also explicitly grants to the Supreme Court the power of judicial review over laws and executive actions.  The Supreme Court is composed of 1 Chief Justice and 14 Associate Justices. The court sits either en banc or in divisions, depending on the nature of the case to be decided.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the judicial system of mainland China the highest court of appeal is the Supreme People's Court. This supervises the administration of justice by all subordinate \\"local\\" and \\"special\\" people's courts,  and is the court of last resort for the whole People's Republic of China except for Macau and Hong Kong\\r\\n\\r\\nIn Portugal, there are several supreme courts, each with a specific jurisdiction:\\r\\n\\r\\nUntil 2003, a fifth supreme court also existed for the military jurisdiction, this being the Supreme Military Court (Supremo Tribunal Militar). Presently, in time of peace, the supreme court for military justice matters is the Supreme Court of Justice, which now includes four military judges.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the Republic of China (Taiwan), there are three different courts of last resort:\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Council of Grand Justices, consisting of 15 justices and mainly dealing with constitutional issues, is the counterpart of constitutional courts in some countries.\\r\\n\\r\\nAll three courts are directly under the Judicial Yuan, whose president also serves as Chief Justice in the Council of Grand Justices.\\r\\n\\r\\nFounded by papal bull in 1532, the Court of Session is the supreme civil court of Scotland, and the High Court of Justiciary is the supreme criminal court. However, the absolute highest court (excluding criminal matters) is the Supreme Court of the United Kingdom.\\r\\n\\r\\nSpanish Supreme Court is the highest court for all cases in Spain (both private and public). Only those cases related to human rights can be appealed at the Constitutional Court (which also decides about acts accordance with Spanish Constitution). \\r\\nIn Spain, high courts cannot create binding precedents;[7] however, lower rank courts usually observe Supreme Court interpretations. In most private law cases, two Supreme Court judgements supporting a claim are needed to appeal at the Supreme Court.[8]\\r\\nFive sections form the Spanish Supreme court:\\r\\n\\r\\nIn Sweden, the Supreme Court and the Supreme Administrative Court respectively function as the highest courts of the land. The Supreme Administrative Court considers cases concerning disputes between individuals and administrative organs, as well as disputes among administrative organs, while the Supreme Court considers all other cases. The judges are appointed by the Government. In most cases, the Supreme Courts will only grant leave to appeal a case (pr?vningstillst?nd) if the case involves setting a precedent in the interpretation of the law. Exceptions are issues where the Supreme Court is the court of first instance. Such cases include an application for a retrial of a criminal case in the light of new evidence, and prosecutions made against an incumbent minister of the Government for severe neglect of duty. If a lower court has to try a case which involves a question where there is no settled interpretation of the law, it can also refer the question to the relevant Supreme Court for an answer.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn Switzerland, the Federal Supreme Court of Switzerland[9] is the final court of appeals. Due to Switzerland's system of direct democracy, it has no authority to review the constitutionality of federal statutes, but the people can strike down a proposed law by referendum. According to settled case law, however, the Court is authorised to review the compliance of all Swiss law with certain categories of international law, especially the European Convention of Human Rights.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn Sri Lanka, the Supreme Court of Sri Lanka was created in 1972 after the adoption of a new Constitution. The Supreme Court is the highest and final superior court of record and is empowered to exercise its powers, subject to the provisions of the Constitution. The court rulings take precedence over all lower Courts. The Sri Lanka judicial system is complex blend of both common-law and civil-law. In some cases such as capital punishment, the decision may be passed on to the President of the Republic for clemency petitions. However, when there is 2/3 majority in the parliament in favour of president (as with present), the supreme court and its judges' powers become nullified as they could be fired from their positions according to the Constitution, if the president wants. Therefore, in such situations, Civil law empowerment vanishes.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn South Africa, a \\"two apex\\" system existed from 1994 to 2013. The Supreme Court of Appeal (SCA) was created in 1994 and replaced the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of South Africa as the highest court of appeal in non-constitutional matters. The SCA is subordinate to the Constitutional Court, which is the highest court in matters involving the interpretation and application of the Constitution. But in August 2013 the Constitution was amended to make the Constitutional Court the country's single apex court, superior to the SCA in all matters, both constitutional and non-constitutional.\\r\\n\\r\\nHistorically, citizens appealed directly to the King along his route to places out of the Palace. A Thai King would adjudicate all disputes. During the reign of King Chulalongkorn, an official department for appeals was set up, and, after Thailand adopted a western-styled government, Thai Supreme Court was established in 1891.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt present, the Supreme Court of Thailand retains the important status as the highest court of justice in the country. Operating separately from the Administrative Court and the Constitutional Court, the judgement of the Supreme Court is considered as final.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the United Arab Emirates, the Federal Supreme Court of the United Arab Emirates was created in 1973 after the adoption of the Constitution. The Supreme Court is the highest and final superior court of record and is empowered to exercise its powers, subject to the provisions of the Constitution. The court rulings take precedence over all lower Courts. The Emirati  judicial system is complex blend of both Islamic law and civil law. In some cases such as capital punishment, the decision may be passed on to the President of the country (currently Khalifa bin Zayed Al Nahyan).[10]\\r\\n\\r\\nLaw of Indonesia at the national level is based on a combination of civil law from the tradition of Roman-Dutch law and customary law from the tradition of Adat.[11] Law in regional jurisdictions can vary from province to province, including even Sharia law,[12] for example Islamic criminal law in Aceh, though even at the national level, individual justices can cite sharia or other forms of non-Dutch law in their legal opinions.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Supreme Court of Indonesia is the main judicial arm of the state, functioning as the final court of appeal as well as a means to re-open cases previously closed. The Supreme Court, which consists of a total of 51 justices, also oversees the regional high courts. It was founded at the country's independence in 1945.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Constitutional Court of Indonesia, on the other hand, is a part of the judicial branch tasked with review of bills and government actions for constitutionality, as well as regulation of the interactions between various arms of the state. The constitutional amendment to establish the court was passed in 2001, and the court itself was established in 2003.[13] The Constitutional Court consists of nine justices serving nine year terms, and they're appointed in tandem by the Supreme Court, the President of Indonesia and the People's Representative Council.[14]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn most nations with constitutions modelled after the Soviet Union, the legislature was given the power of being the court of last resort.  In the People's Republic of China, the final power to interpret the law is vested in the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress (NPCSC). This power includes the power to interpret the basic laws of Hong Kong and Macau, the constitutional documents of the two special administrative regions which are common law and Portuguese-based legal system jurisdictions respectively.  This power is a legislative power and not a judicial one in that an interpretation by the NPCSC does not affect cases which have already been decided.","input":"What kind of court is the supreme court?"},{"output":"December 22, 2006","context":"The Michigan Civil Rights Initiative (MCRI), or Proposal 2 (Michigan 06-2), was a ballot initiative in the U.S. state of Michigan that passed into Michigan Constitutional law by a 58% to 42% margin on November 7, 2006, according to results officially certified by the Michigan Secretary of State. By Michigan law, the Proposal became law on December 22, 2006. MCRI was a citizen initiative aimed at stopping discrimination based on race, color, sex, or religion in admission to colleges, jobs, and other publicly funded institutions ÿ effectively prohibiting affirmative action by public institutions based on those factors.[1] The Proposal's constitutionality was challenged in federal court, but its constitutionality was ultimately upheld by the Supreme Court of the United States.[2]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nOn 21 March 2008, Judge David M. Lawson of the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Michigan dismissed a case filed by plaintiffs challenging the constitutionality of Proposal 2. Judge Lawson held that Proposal 2 does not violate the United States Constitution.[3]\\r\\nThe United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit overturned MCRI on July 1, 2011.[4] Judges R. Guy Cole Jr. and Martha Craig Daughtrey said that \\"Proposal 2 reorders the political process in Michigan to place special burdens on minority interests.\\" Michigan Attorney General Bill Schuette said he would appeal the court ruling.[5]\\r\\nBill Schuette, Attorney General for the State of Michigan announced his appeal of the Sixth Circuit's decision on July 28, 2011. The MCRI stood in effect until this appeal was complete.[6]\\r\\nOn November 16, 2012, the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals, sitting en banc, upheld the earlier ruling that the MCRI was unconstitutional. Schuette then announced his intention to appeal to the Supreme Court.[7] The Supreme Court of the United States granted certiorari in Schuette v. Coalition to Defend Affirmative Action on March 25, 2013. The Court heard arguments in the case on October 15, 2013, and the Court ruled on April 22, 2014 \\"that there is no authority...for the judiciary to set aside Michigan laws that commit to the voters the determination whether racial preferences may be considered in governmental decisions, in particular with respect to school decisions.\\" Thereby upholding the Constitutionality of the amendment.[8]\\r\\nThe ballot initiative amended the Michigan Constitution to include a new section (Section 26 of Article I):[9]\\r\\n\\r\\nAffirmative action programs.\\r\\nThe subject of the proposal has been hotly debated, with the very definition of what it encompasses at the center of the controversy. Proponents argue that it bans programs in public hiring, public employment, and public education that \\"give preferential treatment to\\" or \\"discriminate against\\" individuals on the basis of race, gender, ethnicity, or national origin. Opponents argue that Proposal 2 bans all affirmative action programs in the operation of public employment, education, or contracting.\\r\\nProponents cite the 1964 Civil Rights Act and the \\"Equal Protection\\" clause of the 14th Amendment that forbids the United States or any state from denying \\"equal protection of the law\\" to any citizen as models for the proposal. It is a near copy of similar initiatives passed in California (Proposition 209) and Washington (Initiative 200).\\r\\nIn 2004, When the first attempt was made to place the measure on the ballot, Gregory Creswell was MCRI spokesperson, volunteer coordinator, and an organizer.[10] In a pre-kick-off announcement, he articulated some reasons he was working for the amendment: \\"I believe it is wrong for the government and politicians to dictate to an employer who they must or must not hire, just as I believe Jim Crow is immoral and just as I believe apartheid in South Africa was immoral,\\" said Creswell.[11]\\r\\nAt the petition kick-off meeting affirmative action advocate Rev. Horace Sheffield III clashed with Creswell after being denied entry to the event.[12] Creswells rivalry with Sheffield dated back to 2000 when Creswell criticized a protest outside the Detroit Police headquarters, following a couple shootings of suspects by police.[13]\\r\\nAfter some early court challenges, a state appeals court permitted MCRI petitioners to continue gathering signatures, but the effort was postponed till the 2006 cycle due to time constraints.[14]\\r\\nDuring the early debate about the proposal shortly following the collection of signatures (508,282 submitted January 6, 2005), the Michigan Civil Rights Commission, a governmental body charged with investigating civil rights violations in the state of Michigan, concluded an investigation of MCRI and asserted that supporters of the MCRI had committed widespread and systematic racially targeted fraud in their petition campaign to secure ballot access.[15][16] The proponents of the initiative issued a multi-page refutation of the report, including a notation that it was never signed by the Commission and alleging misconduct by the Commission itself.[17]\\r\\nIn September 2006, after opponents filed a federal lawsuit against the MCRI alleging fraud in the collection of petition signatures, a federal judge in Detroit found that some voter fraud had in fact taken place but denied an injunction to have the initiative barred.[18][19]\\r\\nOral arguments in a federal lawsuit charging MCRI and the State of Michigan with violating the Voting Rights Act of 1965 were heard on August 17, 2006 with attorneys presenting their closing arguments on the morning of August 18, 2006. The case was heard by U.S. District Court Judge Arthur Tarnow, who promised to rule on the matter by September 8, 2006, to give officials enough time to print up the ballot. During the first day of the hearing, hundreds of protesters picketed outside the courthouse chanting among other things, \\"Racist fraud, hell no! MCRI has got to go!\\"[20][21] The lawsuit was filed by Operation King's Dream, Detroit Mayor Kwame Kilpatrick, Detroit City Council, American-Arab Anti Discrimination Committee, Michigan Legislative Black Caucus, Keep the Vote No Takeover, AFSCME Locals 207, 312, and 2920, and UAW 2200 as well as several individual voters.[22] Michigan Governor Jennifer Granholm submitted an amicus brief in support of the plaintiffs.[23]\\r\\nOn August 29, 2006, the case was decided with Judge Tarnow, a Democratic judicial appointee, refusing to remove the initiative from the ballot.[19] However, Judge Tarnow declared that \\"MCRI engaged in systematic voter fraud by telling voters that were signing a petition supporting affirmative action.\\" However, because the case was not decided on these grounds, this statement is legally characterized as \\"dicta\\"judicial commentary that is not relevant to the outcome of a case. Tarnow also found the testimony of Jennifer Gratz (MCRI's executive director) in the court to be evasive and misleading. His stated reason for refusing an injunction to remove the MCRI from the ballot was the MCRI \\"targeted all Michigan voters for deception without regard to race.\\" He ruled that the Voting Rights Act was not violated because it \\"is not a general anti-voter fraud statute, but rather prohibits practices which result in unequal access to the political process because of race.\\"\\r\\nLuke Massie, national co-chair of the Coalition to Defend Affirmative Action, Integration, and Immigrant Rights & Fight for Equality By Any Means Necessary (BAMN) announced that the plaintiffs would appeal Tarnow's decision to the U.S. 6th Circuit Court of Appeals, saying \\"It makes no sense to conclude there was fraud and allow the vote to go forward.\\" The 6th Circuit rejected the appeal in mid-September.[24]\\r\\nOn November 27, 2006, Proposal 2 was certified officially by the Michigan Secretary of State to have passed by a margin of 58% to 42% (2,141,010 \\"Yes\\" votes to 1,555,691 \\"No\\" votes).[25] The last reported poll of October 15, by The Detroit News, showed MCRI to have up to a 50ÿ41% lead. In another Free PressLocal 4 Michigan poll conducted by Selzer & Co. Inc. of Des Moines between October 8 to October 11 of 643 likely voters, it was shown that 41% were in favor of the MCRI, while 44% opposed the measure, and 15% of the voter poll were undecided. The poll had a margin of error of 3.9% making the poll a statistical dead-heat. Another poll, from mid-September 2006, showed MCRI was up 48ÿ37 with 15% undecided, with the pollster admitting that his previous polls had not used the exact language of the proposal until the Sept. poll. The entire polling process highlighted an ongoing debate about the scientific value of modern phone polling on questions of race or controversial social issues where the polled members of the public may be \\"embarrassed\\" by social desirability bias to give a truthful response about their intended vote for fear that they will be identified. The effect, which was predicted by several Michigan political consultants and even some pollsters themselves, represents a new concern in polling accuracy.\\r\\nIn July 2005, the Michigan State Board of Canvassers declined to certify the MCRI proposal for Michigan's November 2006 ballot after hearing allegations that a significant number of signatures were obtained by telling supporters of affirmative action that the petition was likewise, in support of affirmative action. Counter-allegations were made by MCRI supporters that the allegations were fabricated and that the Board of Canvassers' decision-process itself was being improperly influenced by politics because Michigan Democratic Party Chairman Mark Brewer was \\"giving orders\\" to the two Democrat-appointed members of the Board, and backed up by the linked videotape shot by MCRI Treasurer and publisher Chetly Zarko.[26] Despite the deadlocked vote by the Canvassers and their inability to certify the petition as a result, in October of the same year the Michigan Court of Appeals ordered the board to certify the petitions.\\r\\nOn December 14, 2005, in Lansing, Michigan, while attempting to comply with that court order to certify the petitions, the board's four members were scheduled to make the final vote to certify the petitions for the November ballot. However, the meeting attended by hundreds of Detroit high school students. The crowd began to shout \\"No voter fraud,\\" until they became so loud that the members left the room adjourning until 2pm. Chanting, \\"They say Jim Crow! We say hell no!,\\" the emotion-surged crowd of students continued until a table was overturned in the commotion and the Lansing police came in to control the situation. Opponents of MCRI labeled their own conduct \\"civil disobedience\\" while proponents argued it crossed the line into outright violence and intentional intimidation.[27] Video of the situation can be seen here.[28]\\r\\nAfter the protest, the election panel again failed to certify the petitions with a vote of 2ÿ1, falling short of the required three votes. Republican board members Katherine Degrow and Lyn Banks voted in favor with Democrats Paul Mitchell voting no and Doyle O'Connor not voting.\\r\\nThe meeting received considerable media attention because of the protest. In the months following the controversial board meeting, Mitchell resigned from the board and O'Connor was charged with contempt of court; however the charges were dismissed after O'Connor sought disclosure of improper communications between the chief judge and the Republican leadership of the Legislature.[29] O'Connor later testified against the MCRI at the August 17 federal court hearing, relaying how he had witnessed two African-American women circulating the anti-affirmative action petition in Detroit telling signers that it was in support of affirmative action.\\r\\nProponents of the MCRI claim that the initiative will make illegal only those programs and policies, affecting university admissions, public employment, and contracting, that grant \\"preferential treatment\\" based on gender, race, or ethnicity. These claims were disputed by some opponents who cite California's Proposition 209, alleging that the language of that proposal outlawed \\"all affirmative action policies\\" and programs, and MCRI's language is nearly identical. Proponents counter this argument by arguing that while MCRI is nearly identical to California's amendment, neither MCRI or 209 outlawed \\"all\\" or any \\"affirmative action.\\" They point to programs such as California's use of socio-economic indicators, outreach targeted at the 150 lowest scoring high schools, and traditional anti-discrimination enforcement as some among many race-neutral types of \\"affirmative action\\". On March 7, 2007, however, the Michigan Civil Rights Commission, which had previously fought against Proposal 2, issued a report at the behest of the Governor, taking the position that Proposal 2 did not eliminate \\"all\\" affirmative action. In their summary of a 63-page report, Linda Parker, chair of the Commission, now agreed with Proposal 2 advocates, \\"With this Report, the Commission and Department confirm that Proposal 2 does not mean the end of equal opportunity or diversity in Michigan,\\".[30] The Report explicitly cites the difference between \\"preferential treatment\\" and \\"affirmative action\\". Proponent of Proposal 2, Chetly Zarko, argued that this \\"flip-flop\\" [31] by the Commission not only proved MCRI was correct all along about the legal issues and difference, but that it disproved the Commission's report alleging \\"fraud\\" in signature-collection since the Commission had previously alleged in its June 2006 fraud-allegation report that petitioners should have used the words \\"affirmative action\\" in their presentation..[citation needed]\\r\\nAlthough the people of the state of Michigan banned all preferential programs based on race, nationality or gender by a significant majority, several groups have challenged the rule of this binding constitutional legislation.\\r\\nOn November 8, 2006, BAMN called a press conference announcing that they had launched a second lawsuit against Proposal 2 in conjunction with United for Equality and Affirmative Action and Rainbow/PUSH Coalition, claiming that it violates both the Equal Protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment and the First Amendment as affirmed by the Supreme Court decision, Grutter v. Bollinger.[32]\\r\\nThat same day, about 2,000 students gathered on the diag at the University of Michigan where University President Mary Sue Coleman gave a speech in which she promised U-M would go to court to defend its efforts to promote diversity, even though the people of Michigan had voted against affirmative action. Two weeks later, on November 21, Grand Rapids Mayor George Heartwell said he was considering having the city file a federal lawsuit to overturn Proposal 2.[citation needed]\\r\\nOn December 19, U.S. District Court Judge David Lawson ruled that the state's three largest public universitiesthe University of Michigan, Michigan State University, and Wayne State Universitycould delay implementation of Proposal until July 1, 2007.[33] The universities had filed a lawsuit seeking the delay, charging fairness in admissions, in response to BAMN's lawsuit in which all three universities were named as defendants. The Center for Individual Rights has asked the U.S. Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals to overturn Judge Lawson's ruling and force the universities to adhere to the ban on affirmative action immediately.[34]\\r\\nOn December 29, a 3-judge panel of the 6th US Circuit Court of Appeals lifted Judge Lawson's injunction granting the 3 universities the July 1 implementation delay and ordered them to implement Proposal 2 immediately.[35]\\r\\nThe city of Lansing has also filed a lawsuit to delay implementation of Prop 2 until July 2007.[36] In Detroit, Matt Allen, a spokesman for Mayor Kwame Kilpatrick said the city illegally \\"will continue doing business as it has been\\" in spite of the statewide ban on affirmative action.[37]\\r\\nAnother lawsuit has been filed in federal court by the NAACP and the ACLU to block the ban on affirmative action.[38]\\r\\nOn January 4, 2007, the Center for Individual Rights filed a lawsuit in Washtenaw Circuit Court, asking a judge to order the University of Michigan to immediately comply with Proposal 2, and abandon their affirmative action programs.[39] The case was resolved on January 29 when Eric Russell, whom the Center for Individual Rights was representing voluntarily withdrew the lawsuit.[40]\\r\\nJan. 9ÿ10: BAMN held a press conference at Cass Tech High School in Detroit announcing that their appeal of the Federal Appeals Court decision overturning the delay of the ban on affirmative action. The next day, after placing holds on admissions, the University of Michigan announced that they will comply with the ban on affirmative action. Hours later, Supreme Court Justice John Paul Stevens responded to BAMN's appeal of the 6th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals decision overturning the delay of Proposal 2's implementation and ordered all briefs due by January 17. U-M, Wayne State, MSU, and Michigan Governor Jennifer Granholm all filed briefs in support. Michigan Attorney General Mike Cox urged Stevens to deny the injunction. On January 19, the Supreme Court denied BAMN's appeal without comment.[citation needed]\\r\\nOn Thursday, February 15, BAMN submitted 2,000 petitions to the Board of Regents of the University of Michigan demanding that there be no drop in minority enrollment. The following Tuesday, on February 20, the Michigan Student Assembly, the elected student government of U-M passed a resolution demanding that there be no drop in underrepresented minority student enrollment.[citation needed]\\r\\nOn Friday, July 1, 2011, the Federal Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals held the amendment unconstitutional on the grounds that it reorders the political process in Michigan to place special burdens on minority interests, and thus violates the 14th Amendment. Attorney General Bill Schuette then announced that he would appeal the ruling and ask to have the case re-heard \\"en banc,\\" by all active judges rather than a panel of three.[41]\\r\\nOn Thursday, November 3, 2011, the Equal Justice Society and more than a dozen other organizations announced that they had filed an amicus brief in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit, urging the court to strike down Michigans Proposal 2 as unconstitutional. The brief authors argue that Proposal 2 violates the Equal Protection Clause of the 14th Amendment of the Constitution by creating procedural barriers for people of color.[citation needed]\\r\\nOn 16 November 2012, the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals sitting en banc upheld the earlier ruling that the Initiative is unconstitutional.

The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame Foundation was established on April 20, 1983, by Atlantic Records founder and chairman Ahmet Ertegun. In 1986, Cleveland was chosen as the Hall of Fame's permanent home. Since opening in September 1995, the \\"Rock Hall\\" ÿ part of the city's redeveloped North Coast Harbor ÿ has hosted more than 10 million visitors and had a cumulative economic impact estimated at more than $1.8 billion.[2][3]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nFounder Ahmet Ertegun assembled a team that included attorney Suzan Evans, Rolling Stone magazine editor and publisher Jann S. Wenner, attorney Allen Grubman, and record executives Seymour Stein, Bob Krasnow, and Noreen Woods. The Foundation began inducting artists in 1986, but the Hall of Fame still had no home. The search committee considered several cities, including Philadelphia (home of Bill Haley and American Bandstand), Memphis (home of Sun Studios and Stax Records), Detroit (home of Motown Records), Cincinnati (home of King Records), New York City, and Cleveland.[citation needed]\\r\\nCleveland lobbied for the museum, citing that WJW disc jockey Alan Freed both coined the term \\"rock and roll\\" and heavily promoted the new genreand that Cleveland was the location of Freed's Moondog Coronation Ball, the first major rock and roll concert. In addition, Cleveland cited radio station WMMS, which played a key role in breaking several major acts in the U.S. during the 1970s and 80s, including artist David Bowie, who began his first U.S. tour in the city, Bruce Springsteen, Roxy Music, and Rush among many others.[4] Cleveland was also one of the premier tour stops for most rock bands.\\r\\nCivic leaders in Cleveland pledged $65 million in public money to fund the construction. A petition drive was signed by 600,000 fans favoring Cleveland over Memphis, and Cleveland ranked first in a 1986 USA Today poll asking where the Hall of Fame should be located. On May 5, 1986, the Hall of Fame Foundation chose Cleveland as the permanent home of the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and Museum. Sam Phillips of Sun Studios fame and many others were stunned and disappointed that it ended up in Cleveland. \\"The hall of fame should've been in Memphis, certainly,\\" wrote Peter Guralnick, author of an acclaimed two-volume Elvis Presley biography.[5]\\r\\nCleveland may also have been chosen as the organization's site because the city offered the best financial package. As The Plain Dealer music critic Michael Norman noted, \\"It was $65 million... Cleveland wanted it here and put up the money.\\" Co-founder Jann Wenner later said, \\"One of the small sad things is we didn't do it in New York in the first place,\\" but then added, \\"I am absolutely delighted that the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and Museum is in Cleveland.\\"\\r\\nDuring early discussions on where to build the Hall of Fame and Museum, the Foundation's board considered the Cuyahoga River. Ultimately, the chosen location was along East Ninth Street in downtown Cleveland by Lake Erie, east of Cleveland Stadium.\\r\\nAt one point in the planning phase when a financing gap existed, planners proposed locating the Rock Hall in the then-vacant May Company Building, but finally decided to commission architect I. M. Pei to design a new building. Initial CEO Dr. Larry R. Thompson facilitated I. M. Pei in designs for the site. Pei came up with the idea of a tower with a glass pyramid protruding from it. The museum tower was initially planned to stand 200?ft (61 m) high, but had to be cut down to 162?ft (49 m) due to its proximity to Burke Lakefront Airport. The building's base is approximately 150,000 square feet (14,000 m2). The groundbreaking ceremony took place on June 7, 1993. Pete Townshend, Chuck Berry, Billy Joel, Sam Phillips, Ruth Brown, Sam Moore of Sam and Dave, Carl Gardner of the Coasters and Dave Pirner of Soul Asylum all appeared at the groundbreaking.\\r\\nThe museum was dedicated on September 1, 1995, with the ribbon being cut by an ensemble that included Yoko Ono and Little Richard, among others, before a crowd of more than 10,000 people. The following night an all-star concert was held at the stadium. It featured Chuck Berry, Bob Dylan, Al Green, Jerry Lee Lewis, Aretha Franklin, Bruce Springsteen, Iggy Pop, John Fogerty, John Mellencamp, and many others.\\r\\nIn addition to the Hall of Fame inductees, the museum documents the entire history of rock and roll, regardless of induction status. Hall of Fame inductees are honored in a special exhibit located in a wing that juts out over Lake Erie.[6]\\r\\nSince 1986, the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame has selected new inductees. The formal induction ceremony has been held in New York City 26 times (1986ÿ92, 1994ÿ96, 1998ÿ2008, 2010ÿ11, 2014, 2016, and 2017); twice in Los Angeles (1993 and 2013); and four times in the Hall of Fame's home in Cleveland (1997, 2009, 2012, and 2015). Beginning in 2018, the induction ceremonies will alternate each year between Cleveland and New York.[7]\\r\\nThe 2009 and 2012 induction weeks were made possible by a publicÿprivate partnership between the City of Cleveland, the State of Ohio, the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, and local foundations, corporations, civic organizations and individuals. Collectively these entities invested $5.8 million in 2009 and $7.9 million in 2012 to produce a week of events, including free concerts, a gospel celebration, exhibition openings, free admission to the museum, and induction ceremonies filled with both fans and VIPs at Public Hall.[8]\\r\\nMillions viewed the television broadcast of the Cleveland inductions; tens of thousands traveled to Ohio during induction week to participate in Induction-related events. The economic impact of the 2009 induction week activities was more than $13 million, and it provided an additional $20 million in media exposure for the region. The 2012 induction week yielded similar results.[9]\\r\\nThere are seven levels in the building. On the lower level is the Ahmet M. Ertegun Exhibition Hall, the museum's main gallery. It includes exhibits on the roots of rock and roll (gospel, blues, rhythm & blues and folk, country and bluegrass). It also features exhibits on cities that have had a major impact on rock and roll: Memphis, Detroit, London and Liverpool, San Francisco, Los Angeles, New York and Seattle. There are exhibits about soul music, the Fifties, Sun Records, Atlantic Records, hip hop music, Cleveland's rock and roll legacy, the music of the Midwest, rock and roll radio and dee-jays, and the many protests against rock and roll. This gallery also has exhibits that focus on individual artists, including the Beatles, the Rolling Stones, Jimi Hendrix and others. Finally, the Ahmet M. Ertegun Exhibition Hall includes two theaters, one of which features a film about the roots of rock and roll and one that features films on various subjects.[10]\\r\\nThe first floor of the museum is the entrance level. It includes a cafe, a stage that the museum uses for various special performances and events throughout the year, and a section called \\"Backstage Stories.\\" The second floor includes several interactive kiosks that feature programs on one-hit wonders and the Songs That Shaped Rock and Roll. This level also includes a gallery with artifact-filled exhibits about Les Paul, Alan Freed, Sam Phillips and the evolution of audio technology.[11]\\r\\nVisitors enter the Hall of Fame section of the museum on the third floor. This section includes \\"The Power of Rock Experience,\\" which includes one of Jonathan Demme's final works, a film shown in the Connor Theater. The film includes musical highlights from some of the Hall's induction ceremonies.[12] Visitors exit the Hall of Fame section on the fourth floor. That level features the Foster Theater, a state-of-the-art 3-D theater that is used for special events and programs.[13][14]\\r\\nFinally, the top two levels of the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame feature large, temporary exhibits. Over the years, numerous exhibits have been installed on these two levels, including exhibits about Elvis Presley, hip-hop, the Supremes, the Who, U2, John Lennon, the Clash, Bruce Springsteen, Women Who Rock, and the Rolling Stones.\\r\\nDesigned by I. M. Pei, and structurally engineered by Leslie E. Robertson Associates, the building rises above the shores of Lake Erie. It is a combination of bold geometric forms and dynamic cantilevered spaces that are anchored by a 162-foot tower. The tower supports a dual-triangular-shaped glass \\"tent\\" that extends (at its base) onto a 65,000-square-foot plaza that provides a main entry facade.\\r\\nThe building houses more than 55,000 square feet of exhibition space, as well as administrative offices, a store, and a caf.\\r\\n\\"In designing this building,\\" Pei said, \\"it was my intention to echo the energy of rock and roll. I have consciously used an architectural vocabulary that is bold and new, and I hope the building will become a dramatic landmark for the city of Cleveland and for fans of rock and roll around the world.\\" [15]\\r\\nSince 1997, the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame has featured numerous temporary exhibits that range in size from major exhibits that fill the top two floors of the museum to smaller exhibits that are often installed in the main exhibition hall on the lower level.\\r\\nThe museum's first major exhibit opened on May 10, 1997. It was called I Want to Take You Higher: The Psychedelic Era, 1965 ÿ 1969. It included artifacts from numerous artists, including John Lennon, Eric Clapton, John Sebastian, the Jefferson Airplane, and Janis Joplin, as well as artifacts related to the Monterey International Pop Festival and Woodstock.\\r\\nThat exhibit was followed by Elvis is in the Building, an exhibit about the \\"King of Rock and Roll\\", which ran from August 8, 1998, to September 5, 1999. This year-long tribute was the first ever special exhibit devoted to a single artist, Elvis Presley, the first inductee into the RRHOF in 1986. Graceland supplied a significant selection of representative artifacts for this special tribute spanning Elvis' life and legendary career. (see Larry G. Keeter, \\"Elvis Is In the Building,\\" \\"Elvis International Forum,\\" Summer 2000, pp.?28ÿ29) Next, the museum curated Roots, Rhymes and Rage: The Hip-Hop Story. That was the first major museum exhibit to focus on hip-hop. It ran from November 11, 1999, to August 6, 2000. It was followed by Rock Style, an exhibit that focused on rock and roll and fashion. It featured clothing from Buddy Holly to Alice Cooper, from Ray Charles to David Bowie and from Smokey Robinson to Sly Stone. After it closed in Cleveland, Rock Style traveled to other museums in the U.S.\\r\\nOther temporary exhibits have included Lennon: His Life and Work, which ran from October 20, 2000, to January 1, 2003. It was followed by In the Name of Love: Two Decades of U2 and then Reflections: The Mary Wilson Supreme Legacy Collection. A major exhibition on display during the Republican National Convention in Cleveland in 2016 was Louder than Words: Rock, Power, Politics.[16]\\r\\nOther large temporary exhibits have focused on the Clash (Revolution Rock: The Story of the Clash), the Doors (Break on Through: The Lasting Legacy of the Doors), the Who's Tommy (Tommy: The Amazing Journey), and Bruce Springsteen (From Asbury Park to the Promised Land: The Life and Music of Bruce Springsteen). Another thematic temporary exhibit focused on the role of women in rock and roll (Women Who Rock: Vision, Passion, Power). Many of these exhibits travel to other museums after closing in Cleveland. The museum's current major temporary exhibit is about the history of the magazine Rolling Stone.[17]\\r\\nThe Rock and Roll Hall of Fame also curates many smaller temporary exhibits. Over the years, these exhibits have focused on such topics as the Vans Warped Tour, the Concert for Bangladesh, Woodstock's 40th anniversary, Austin City Limits, the Monterey International Pop Festival, Roy Orbison, Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers, Marty Stuart, Paul Simon, Graham Nash, and John Mellencamp.\\r\\nThe museum also devotes exhibits to photography and artwork related to rock and roll. Among the photographers whose work has been featured at the Hall of Fame are George Kalinsky, Alfred Wertheimer, Tommy Edwards, Kevin Mazur, Janet Macoska, Lynn Goldsmith, Mike McCartney, Robert Alford,[18] and George Shuba. The museum also featured the artwork of Philip Burke in one of its temporary exhibits, and a later exhibit featured Herb Ritts.[19][20]\\r\\nThe Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and Museum produces numerous public programs, including concerts, interviews, lectures, film screenings, and other events that help tell the story of rock and roll. Every February, the museum celebrates Black History Month[21] by hosting concerts, film screenings and lectures that illustrate the important role African-Americans have played in the history of rock and roll. Since the program began in 1996, such artists as Robert Lockwood, Jr., the Temptations, Charles Brown, Ruth Brown, the Ohio Players, Lloyd Price, Little Anthony and the Imperials, and Al Green have appeared at the museum during Black History Month.\\r\\nAnother program is the Hall of Fame Series. This series began in April 1996 and features interviews with Hall of Fame inductees in a rare and intimate settings, most often in the Museum's Foster Theater. The interviews are usually followed by a question-and-answer session with the audience and, often, a performance by the inductee. Among the inductees who have taken part in this series are Darryl \\"DMC\\" McDaniels of Run-D.M.C., Lloyd Price, Marky Ramone, Seymour Stein, Ray Manzarek of the Doors, Ronnie Spector, Bootsy Collins, Ann and Nancy Wilson of Heart, and Jorma Kaukonen of the Jefferson Airplane.\\r\\nA similar program is the Legends Series. The only real difference between this program and the Hall of Fame Series is that it features artists who have not yet been inducted into the Hall of Fame. Peter Hook of Joy Division, Spinderella of Salt n Pepa, Tommy James, and the Chi-Lites are among the artists who have participated in the Legends Series.\\r\\nThe Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and Museum's most acclaimed program is the annual American Music Masters series. Each year the museum celebrates one of the Hall's inductees with a week-long series of programs that include interviews, film screenings, and, often, a special exhibit. The celebration ends with an all-star concert held at a Cleveland theater. The concerts include a diverse mix of artists, from Hall of Fame inductees to contemporary musicians.\\r\\nThe American Music Masters series began in 1996 with Hard Travelin': The Life and Legacy of Pete Seeger. Since then, the programs have honored the following inductees: Jimmie Rodgers (1997), Robert Johnson (1998), Louis Jordan (1999), Muddy Waters (2000), Bessie Smith (2001), Hank Williams (2002), Buddy Holly (2003), Lead Belly (2004), Sam Cooke (2005), Roy Orbison (2006), Jerry Lee Lewis (2007), Les Paul (2008),[22] Janis Joplin (2009),[23] Fats Domino and Dave Bartholomew (2010), Aretha Franklin (2011),[24] and Chuck Berry (2012).[25]\\r\\nHall of Fame museum curator James Henke, along with \\"the museum's curatorial staff and numerous rock critics and music experts\\", created an unordered list of \\"500 Songs That Shaped Rock and Roll\\".[26][27] The list is part of a permanent exhibit at the museum, and was envisioned as part of the museum from its opening in 1995.[28] It contains songs recorded from the 1920s through the 1990s. The Beatles with seven songs was the most represented on the 500ÿsong list. The oldest song on the list is \\"Wabash Cannonball\\", written circa 1882 and credited to J. A. Roff. Since then, however, an additional 155 songs have been added, and the list is now simply referred to as \\"The Songs That Shaped Rock and Roll.\\" The most recent songs on the list are Gnarls Barkley's \\"Crazy\\" and My Chemical Romance's \\"Welcome to the Black Parade,\\" both released in 2006.[29] The Beatles and the Rolling Stones are the most represented on the 655ÿsong list, with eight songs each.\\r\\nThe Rock and Roll Hall of Fame celebrated its 25th anniversary with a concert series over two days on October 29 and 30, 2009 at Madison Square Garden in New York. The celebration included performances by Jerry Lee Lewis, U2, Patti Smith, Bruce Springsteen & the E Street Band, Simon & Garfunkel, Dion DiMucci, Metallica, James Taylor, Bonnie Raitt, Fergie, Mick Jagger, Lou Reed, Ray Davies, Ozzy Osbourne, Paul Simon, Jeff Beck, Buddy Guy, Aretha Franklin, Stevie Wonder, Sting, Little Anthony & the Imperials, and Crosby, Stills and Nash. The first night ran almost six hours with Bruce Springsteen & the E Street Band closing the concert with special guests John Fogerty, Darlene Love, Tom Morello, Sam Moore, Jackson Browne, Peter Wolf, and Billy Joel.[30][31][32]\\r\\nArtists are inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame at an annual induction ceremony. Over the years, the majority of the ceremonies have been held at the Waldorf-Astoria Hotel in New York City. However, on January 12, 1993, the ceremony was held in Los Angeles, and was held there again in 2013. On May 6, 1997, about a year and a half after the opening of the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and Museum, the ceremony was held in Cleveland. It returned to Cleveland in 2009 and again in 2012. Current plans call for the ceremony to be in Cleveland every three years. Generally, the number of inductees ranges from about a half-dozen to a dozen. Virtually all living inductees have attended the ceremonies, and they are presented with their Hall of Fame award by an artist who was influenced by that inductee's music. Both the presenter and the inductee speak at the ceremonies, which also include numerous musical performances, by both the inductees and the presenters. The first group of inductees, inducted on January 23, 1986, included Elvis Presley, James Brown, Little Richard, Fats Domino, Ray Charles, Chuck Berry, Sam Cooke, the Everly Brothers, Buddy Holly, and Jerry Lee Lewis. Robert Johnson, Jimmie Rodgers, and Jimmy Yancey were inducted as Early Influences, John Hammond received the Lifetime Achievement Award and Alan Freed and Sam Phillips were inducted as Non-Performers.\\r\\nA nominating committee composed of rock and roll historians selects names for the \\"Performers\\" category (singers, vocal groups, bands, and instrumentalists of all kinds), which are then voted on by roughly five hundred experts across the world. Those selected to vote include academics, journalists, producers, and others with music industry experience. Artists become eligible for induction 25 years after the release of their first record. Criteria include the influence and significance of the artists' contributions to the development and perpetuation of rock and roll. To be selected for induction, performers must receive the highest number of votes, and also greater than 50% of the votes. Around five to seven performers are inducted each year.[33]\\r\\nIn 2012, six additional groups, the Miracles, the Famous Flames, the Comets, the Blue Caps, the Midnighters, and the Crickets, were inducted as performers by a special committee due to the controversial exclusions when their lead singer was inducted. \\"There was a lot of discussion about this,\\" said Terry Stewart, a member of the nominating committee. \\"There had always been conversations about why the groups weren't included when the lead singers were inducted. Very honestly, nobody could really answer that question ÿ it was so long ago... We decided we'd sit down as an organization and look at that. This is the result.\\"[34]\\r\\nEarly Influences includes artists from earlier eras, primarily country, folk, and blues, whose music inspired and influenced rock and roll artists. Other notable artists that have been inducted as Early Influences include Bill Kenny & The Ink Spots, country musicians Jimmie Rodgers and Hank Williams, blues musicians Howlin' Wolf and Muddy Waters, and jazz musicians Jelly Roll Morton and Louis Armstrong. After Nat King Cole and Billie Holiday in 2000, no one was inducted in this category until 2009, when rockabilly singer Wanda Jackson was selected. Unlike earlier inductees in this category, Jackson's career almost entirely took place after the traditional 1955 start of the \\"rock era\\".\\r\\nFormerly the \\"Non-Performers\\" award, this category encompasses those who primarily work behind the scenes in the music industry, including record label executives, songwriters, record producers, disc jockeys, concert promoters and music journalists. This category has had at least one inductee every year except 2007 and 2009. Following the death of the Hall of Fame's co-founder Ahmet Ertegun, this award was renamed in his honor in 2008.[35]\\r\\nFormerly the \\"Sidemen\\" award, this category was introduced in 2000 and honors veteran session and concert players who are selected by a committee composed primarily of producers. The category was dormant from 2004 through 2007 and re-activated in 2008. This honor was renamed the \\"Award for Musical Excellence\\" in 2010. According to Joel Peresman, the president of the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame Foundation, \\"This award gives us flexibility to dive into some things and recognize some people who might not ordinarily get recognized.\\"[36]\\r\\nThe Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and Museum's Library and Archives is the world's most comprehensive repository of materials related to the history of rock and roll. The Library and Archives is located in a new building on the Metro Campus of Cuyahoga Community College in Cleveland's Campus District.\\r\\nThe Library and Archives' mission is to collect, preserve and provide access to these materials. The Library and Archives operates on two levels: people may come into the library and read the books and magazines, listen to music and other recordings, and watch videos and films. More serious scholars, historians and journalists may also make an appointment for access to the archival collections under the supervision of the staff archivists.\\r\\nThe library is composed of books, academic dissertations, and other references. It also includes popular magazines, scholarly journals and trade publications; commercial audio and video recordings, and research databases.\\r\\nThe archival collections include music-business records from record executives, artist managers, labels, historic venues, recording studios, specialists in stage design and lighting, and long-running concert tours. The collections also contain important individual items, such as personal letters penned by Aretha Franklin and Madonna, handwritten working lyrics by Jimi Hendrix and LL Cool J, papers from music journalists such as Sue Cassidy Clark, and rare concert recordings from CBGB in the 1970s.[37][38][39]\\r\\nThe most frequent criticism of the Hall of Fame is that the nomination process is controlled by a few individuals who are not themselves musicians, such as founder Jann Wenner (co-founder and editor-in-chief of Rolling Stone magazine), former foundation director Suzan Evans, and writer Dave Marsh, reflecting their personal tastes rather than the views of the rock world as a whole. A former member of the nominations board once commented that \\"At one point Suzan Evans lamented the choices being made because there weren't enough big names that would sell tickets to the dinner. That was quickly remedied by dropping one of the doo-wop groups being considered in favor of a 'name' artist ... I saw how certain pioneering artists of the '50s and early '60s were shunned because there needed to be more name power on the list, resulting in '70s superstars getting in before the people who made it possible for them. Some of those pioneers still aren't in today.\\"[40] Sister Rosetta Tharpe is often considered \\"The Godmother/Grandmother of Rock & Roll\\",[41][42] but has yet to be inducted. Also, the influential soul/funk group Tower of Power has not yet been honored. Velvet Underground drummer Maureen Tucker has dismissed the Hall of Fame as the \\"Hall of Lame\\".[43]\\r\\nThere is also controversy in the lack of transparency in the selection process. Janet Morrissey of The New York Times wrote:\\r\\n\\"With fame and money at stake, it's no surprise that a lot of backstage lobbying goes on. Why any particular act is chosen in any particular year is a mystery to performers as well as outsiders ÿ and committee members say they want to keep it that way.\\"[44]\\r\\nJon Landau, the chairman of the nominating committee, says they prefer it that way. \\"We've done a good job of keeping the proceedings nontransparent. It all dies in the room.\\"[44]\\r\\nAccording to Fox News, petitions with tens of thousands of signatures were also being ignored, and some groups that were signed with certain labels or companies or were affiliated with various committee members have even been put up for nomination with no discussion at all.[40] The committee has also been accused of largely ignoring certain genres.[45] According to author Brett Milano, \\"entire genres get passed over, particularly progressive rock, '60s Top 40, New Orleans funk and a whole lot of black music.\\"[46] In contrast, since the mid-2000s (decade), numerous hip hop artists have been inducted, including Tupac Shakur (class of 2017), N.W.A (class of 2016) and Grandmaster Flash and the Furious Five (class of 2007).[47]\\r\\nAnother criticism is that too many artists are inducted. In fifteen years, 97 different artists were inducted.[48] A minimum of 50% of the vote is needed to be inducted; although, the final percentages are not announced and a certain number of inductees (five in 2011) is set before the ballots are shipped.[48] The committee usually nominates a small number of artists (12 in 2010) from an increasing number of different genres. Several voters, including Joel Selvin, himself a former member of the nominating committee, did not submit their ballots in 2007 because they did not feel that any of the candidates were truly worthy.[49]\\r\\nMembers of the British punk rock band The Sex Pistols, inducted in 2006, refused to attend the ceremony, calling the museum \\"a piss stain\\" and \\"urine in wine\\".[50]\\r\\nIn BBC Radio 6 Music's Annual John Peel Lecture in 2013, the singer Charlotte Church accused the museum of gender bias, stating, \\"Out of 295 acts and artists in the Rock n' Roll Hall of Fame, 259 are entirely male, meaning that Tina Weymouth's part in Talking Heads makes them one of the 36 female acts.\\"[51][52] In fact, the actual percentage of woman inductees is 8.5%.[53] Combining all the categories, there have been 719 inductees, out of which only 61 have been women, none of which has been inducted more than once or awarded the Lifetime Achievement.[54]\\r\\nOn March 14, 2007, two days after that year's induction ceremony, Roger Friedman of Fox News published an article claiming that the Dave Clark Five should have been the fifth inductee, as they had more votes than inductee Grandmaster Flash and the Furious Five. The article went on to say \\"Jann Wenner used a technicality about the day votes were due in. In reality, The Dave Clark Five got six more votes than Grandmaster Flash. But he felt we couldn't go another year without a rap act.\\"[47]\\r\\nThe Rock and Roll Hall of Fame Foundation would later deny fixing the vote, although they did not deny that late votes were received, saying, \\"No. There is a format and rules and procedure. There is a specific time when the votes have to be in, and then they are counted. The bands with the top five votes got in.\\"[55] The Dave Clark Five was subsequently nominated again and then inducted the following year.[56]\\r\\nIn June 2007, Monkee Peter Tork complained to the New York Post that Wenner had blackballed the Monkees, commenting:\\r\\n[Wenner] doesn't care what the rules are and just operates how he sees fit. It is an abuse of power. I don't know whether the Monkees belong in the Hall of Fame, but it's pretty clear that we're not in there because of a personal whim. Jann seems to have taken it harder than everyone else, and now, 40 years later, everybody says, 'What's the big deal? Everybody else does it.'

It seems to operate as a business, and the inductees are there by some action of the owners of the Enterprise. The inductees appear to be chosen at the owner's pleasure. This seems proper to me. It is their business in any case. It does not seem to me that the HOF carries a public mandate, nor should it be compelled to conform to one.\\"[57]\\r\\nVarious magazines and news outlets, such as Time,[58] NPR radio,[59] The Christian Science Monitor,[60] Goldmine magazine,[61][62] Yahoo Music[63] and MSNBC [64] have argued that the Monkees belong in the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.","input":"Who started rock and roll hall of fame?"},{"output":"1,231","context":"\\r\\n\\r\\nPublix Super Markets, Inc., commonly known as Publix, is an employee-owned, American supermarket chain headquartered in Lakeland, Florida.[1] Founded in 1930 by George W. Jenkins, Publix is a private corporation that is wholly owned by present and past employees and members of the Jenkins family. \\r\\n[5] Publix operates throughout the Southeastern United States, with locations in Florida?(787), Georgia?(186), Alabama?(69), South Carolina?(58), Tennessee?(42), North Carolina?(38), and Virginia (8).[1]\\r\\n\\r\\nPublix stands as one of the largest U.S. regional grocery chains. Locations are found as far north as Spotsylvania, Virginia, as far south as Key West, Florida, while the westernmost location is in Mobile, Alabama. Today, the state of Florida still has the largest number of stores, with 787, about two-thirds of the outlets. As of August 2018, Publix employs about 193,000 people[6] at its 1,231 retail locations, cooking schools, corporate offices, 9 grocery distribution centers, and 11 manufacturing facilities. The manufacturing facilities produce its dairy, deli, bakery, and other food products.[1]\\r\\n\\r\\nPublix is ranked No. 47 on Fortune magazine's list of 100 Best Companies to Work For 2018, down from No. 21 in 2017,[7] and was ranked No. 7 on Forbes' 2017 list of America's Largest Private Companies and is the largest in Florida.[8] Fortune ranked Publix #1 on their 2018 list of World's Most Admired Companies in the Food & Drug Stores sector.[9] The company's 2017 sales totaled US$34.6 billion, with profits of $2.3 billion, ranking No. 88 on Fortune magazine's Fortune 500 list of U.S. companies for 2017.[10] According to the National Retail Federation, based on 2016 revenue, Publix is the fifteenth-largest U.S. retailer.[6][better?source?needed] Publix stock is only available for purchase by eligible active employees and non-employee members of its Board of Directors.\\r\\n\\r\\nGeorge Jenkins opened the first Publix market in Winter Haven, Florida, on September 6, 1930 - a 27?ft by 65?ft building at 199 West Central Avenue.[12][13] In 1934, that store made $120,000 in sales. In 1935, he opened a second market, the Economy Food Store, also in Winter Haven. Despite the Great Depression, his stores were financially successful.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1940, Jenkins, affectionately called \\"Mr. George\\" by his employees, mortgaged an orange grove to build Florida's first supermarket. His \\"food palace\\" had piped-in music, air conditioning, cold cases for frozen and refrigerated items, in-store doughnut and flower shops, and electric-eye automatic doors. During World War II, material shortages prevented him from building additional stores. In 1945, Jenkins purchased the 19-store All American chain of food stores and converted them into Publix Super Markets.[14]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1951, Publix moved its headquarters from Winter Haven to Lakeland, Florida, and built its first distribution warehouse there. At the same time, they began to close the All American stores, replacing them with Publix markets. In 1956, Publix achieved $50 million in sales, and $1 million in profit. In 1957, the donut shop in each store was expanded into a full-service bakery.[citation needed]\\r\\n\\r\\nBy 1959, Publix was the dominant supermarket chain in Central Florida, and began expansion to South Florida. In 1963, the company built a distribution center in Miami, and began providing deli services. In 1970, sales surpassed $500 million; they reached $1 billion in 1974, when the chain expanded to include Jacksonville, Florida.[citation needed]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1982, the company launched the Presto! ATM network; it soon installed ATMs in every Publix. Sales exceeded $5 billion in 1989.[15]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1983, Carol Jenkins Barnett joined the Publix Board of Directors and served in that role until 2016. During her time at Publix, the company grew into the largest supermarket chain in Florida, expanded into five other states, and recorded $32.5 billion in sales in 2015.[16]\\r\\n\\r\\nPublix Super Markets bought 49 Florida stores from Albertsons. The deal was announced on June 9, 2008, and was completed on September 9, 2008. It included 15 locations in North Florida, 30 in Central Florida, and four in South Florida. The sale allowed Publix to operate four stores in a new market area for the company, Escambia County, Florida (the Pensacola area).[17]\\r\\n\\r\\nOn February 5, 2009, Publix opened its 1,000th store in St. Augustine, Florida, allowing the company to become one of only five U.S. grocery retailers to operate that many stores. The St. Augustine store is among Publix's first stores designed to be energy-efficient. The store includes motion sensor lights throughout the store, including on the freezer doors, and an overhead light system that can be controlled by each department.[18]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe first Publix outside Florida opened in Savannah, Georgia, in 1991; distribution and manufacturing facilities in Dacula, Georgia (a northeastern suburb of Atlanta) soon followed, as it began to expand into metro Atlanta in 1993. Publix further expanded into South Carolina (1993), Alabama (1996), Tennessee (2002), North Carolina (2014) and Virginia (2017).\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 2011, Publix announced it was expanding into North Carolina, initially by opening stores in the Charlotte metropolitan area,[19] and later announced construction of a new store in Asheville.[20] The first Charlotte-area Publix stores (on the South Carolina side of the metropolitan area, opened in 2012); the first North Carolina Publix store opened in Ballantyne in 2014.[21]  Concurrently, Publix purchased seven Charlotte-area locations from competitor BI-LO stores.[22] Publix completed the purchase of property in Boone, North Carolina on November 20, 2015 with plans to open in 2017.[23]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn February 2016, Publix announced their entry into the Virginia market, with the signing of two store leases, the first in Bristol scheduled to open in 2017 and the second in metropolitan Richmond scheduled for 2018.[24] In July 2016, it was announced that Publix had entered into a purchase agreement with Ahold and Delhaize Group for 10 Martin's Food Markets locations in the Richmond market as part of the divestiture of stores to gain clearance from the Federal Trade Commission for the impending Ahold/Delhaize merger.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn April 2016, Ed Crenshaw, grandson of founder George Jenkins, retired from his position as CEO.[25] President Todd Jones, a 36-year Publix veteran whose first job was as a Front Service Clerk (bagger), has taken on Ed's responsibilities as CEO, marking the first time that someone outside the Jenkins family is in charge of the company.[26] Ed Crenshaw will remain with Publix as Chairman of the Board of Directors.[27]\\r\\n\\r\\nEach store provides products and services in its grocery, deli, bakery, produce, floral, meat, and seafood departments. Some stores have valet parking, cafs, sushi bars, pharmacy departments, and/or a liquor store.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe customer service counter also provides check cashing, money orders, Western Union services, Rug Doctor rentals, and lottery tickets. Some stores also provide DVD rental services. In December 2005, Publix discontinued its photo processing service, replacing it with an online or mail-order service via the Snapfish program.[14]  The Snapfish agreement has since been terminated, and Publix no longer offers photo services.\\r\\n\\r\\nPublix operates 11 cooking schools under the Aprons name.[28]\\r\\nThe schools offer cooking demonstrations in which customers are encouraged to sample easy-to-make, nutritious dishes prepared at in-store kiosks and take a recipe card with them. All recipes are developed in-house, using easy-to-prepare or prepackaged ingredients, often available at the Aprons kiosk.[29]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 2005 Publix introduced its Aprons make-ahead meals concept. Customers could purchase meals that they could assemble in-store or, for an extra charge, an Aprons associate would prepare and assemble the meals. These were standalone stores located in Jacksonville and Lithia, Florida. In summer 2009, Publix closed both locations citing lack of customer interest.[30]\\r\\n\\r\\nGreenWise Market is a concept the company introduced in response to the increase in the number and profitability of health food stores. GreenWise Markets were created to increase awareness of nutrition; it focuses on organic and natural items. These stores are similar to the Whole Foods Market chain. In addition to organic and traditional products, GreenWise Markets include salad and hot bars. The first six stores were set to be in Palm Beach Gardens, Boca Raton, Vero Beach, Tampa, Naples, and Coral Springs, Florida.[31]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe first GreenWise Market opened on September 27, 2007 in Palm Beach Gardens.[32] The second Publix GreenWise Market opened in Boca Raton on May 29, 2008, located in Boca Village Square.[33] The third Publix GreenWise Market opened November 6, 2008, in Tampa's Hyde Park neighborhood.[34]\\r\\n\\r\\nFrom 2008 to 2016, the company focused on a \\"hybrid\\" concept instead,[35] integrating the GreenWise concept into traditional Publix stores. Approximately half of locations built since 2008 are considered hybrid stores.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 2017, the company announced they would resume building standalone GreenWise locations, the first of which will be near the campus of Florida State University in Tallahassee, opening in 2018.[35]\\r\\n\\r\\nPublix operates seven stores, branded \\"Publix Sabor\\" (sabor is Spanish for \\"flavor\\"), which cater to Hispanic Americans living in Florida and offer products for Hispanics. Located in Miami-Dade County in Greater Miami, the seven themed stores are spread between Miami and Hialeah. They have since been closed and replaced by newly built locations or merged with existing stores that are not part of the Sabor sub-brand.[36] Two other Publix Sabor locations in Kissimmee and Lake Worth[37][36][38]\\r\\n\\r\\nPublix Sabor locations have bilingual English-Spanish employees, open seating cafs, and a wider selection of prepared foods from the deli and bakery catering to Hispanic flavors.[36] Publix offers cafs and hot foods because many Hispanic Americans grew up in foreign cities which had open public squares where people socialize and eat.[38]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe first Publix in-store pharmacy was opened on October 30, 1986, in Altamonte Springs, Florida.[39] By 1995, one-third of Publix stores had a pharmacy and today, approximately 90% of Publix stores include a pharmacy. Publix Pharmacies consistently ranked number one for customer satisfaction in supermarket pharmacies in several surveys conducted by independent research companies.[40][41]\\r\\n\\r\\nPublix announced in August 2007, that it would offer several types of antibiotics free to its customers. Customers must have a prescription; they are given a maximum of a two-week supply.[42] Several medical professionals expressed concerns that this could contribute to an overuse of antibiotics which leads to antibiotic resistance, a serious public health concern.[43] These medications include:\\r\\n\\r\\nThese antibiotics are offered to customers regardless of their prescription insurance provider.[42] Doxycycline Hyclate was removed from the list because of cost increases.[44] In May 2014, Cephalexin was removed from the list due to cost increases.[45]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn March 2010, Publix announced the launch of another free prescription, Metformin for Type II Diabetes, the generic of Glucophage. Publix provides the medication in 500?mg, 850?mg, and 1000?mg strengths. The only restriction is a 90-day supply or up to 360 500-mg, 270 850-mg, or 225 1000-mg tablets, but refills are not limited.[46][47]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn August 2011, Publix began offering Lisinopril, an ACE inhibitor that is used to prevent, treat, or improve symptoms of high blood pressure, certain heart conditions, diabetes, and certain chronic kidney conditions, as another free prescription. Customers can get a 90-day supply of this prescription for free at any Publix Pharmacy, up to a maximum of 180 tablets. Lisinopril-HCTZ combination products are excluded.[45][47]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn May 2014, Publix began offering Amlodipine, a calcium channel blocker used to treat high blood pressure and chest pain (angina) as a free medication. Customers can get a 90-day supply of this medication (up to 180 2.5-mg or 5-mg tablets, or 90 10-mg tablets) free of charge.[45][47]\\r\\n\\r\\nMontelukast, a medicine used for the treatment of allergies and asthma, was added to the free medication program in February 2017. 90-day supplies of 4- or 5-mg chewable tablets for children, or 10-mg oral tablets for adults, are available with a doctor's prescription.[48]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn early 2006, Publix and The Little Clinic signed an exclusive agreement to open medical clinics within Publix stores. The first clinics were opened in the Atlanta, Miami, Orlando, and Tampa markets in the first half of 2006. The Little Clinic health-care centers were staffed by nurse practitioners who can write prescriptions, provide diagnosis and treatment of common ailments and minor injuries, and offer wellness care like physicals, screenings, and vaccinations.[49] Effective May 9, 2011, Publix closed the Little Clinics in its stores in order to focus on its core pharmacy and grocery business.[50]\\r\\n\\r\\nPublix and BayCare Health System announced a collaboration to provide telehealth and telemedicine services at specialized pharmacies in four Tampa Bay-area counties in March 2017.[51] Pharmacies participating in the program have private rooms for patients to speak with a board-certified physician in BayCare's network via teleconferencing, plus diagnostic tools that can be used by the patient, with or without assistance from pharmacy staff.[52] Doctors will be able to perform basic exams and write prescriptions for minor illnesses and conditions for patients.[53]\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter PublixDirect, Publix made a second attempt in 2010 at e-commerce with the introduction of Publix Curbside. Customers had the ability to browse and purchase groceries online, then drive to a participating location where an associate will have selected their items and would bring them out to the buyer's vehicle.[54] Announced as a pilot program with locations in the Atlanta area and Tampa, the program was ended in January 2012 after its performance reportedly did not meet expectations.[55]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe company later resurrected its curbside concept, this time using its delivery partner, Instacart, to manage the online ordering portion of the service. Currently in a trial stage, the second iteration of Publix Curbside began with two pilot locations in the greater Tampa area in September 2017, and is expected to expand to the greater Atlanta area by the end of the year.[56]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn July 2016, Publix announced another pilot program with Instacart to offer online shopping and delivery services in the greater Miami area. Customers in 37 ZIP codes from Hallandale Beach to South Miami are able to participate in the program. Not all products available at stores, such as tobacco, gift cards, prescriptions, and age-restricted items, are able to be delivered by the service.[57] Beer and wine can be delivered in Florida and North Carolina only.[citation needed]\\r\\n\\r\\nAs of February 2017, Instacart deliveries from Publix are available in the metro areas of Atlanta, Charlotte, Fort Lauderdale,[58] Miami, Orlando, Raleigh, Tampa, Jacksonville, and Nashville, as determined by ZIP code.[59]\\r\\n\\r\\nLater in 2017, Publix announced its intent to expand its delivery program, and expects to have the service available from more than 90 percent of stores by the end of the year.[56]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn response to other grocery stores' aggressive discounting across the Florida market, Publix opened its first Food World store in September 1970 in Orlando, Florida.[60] The store marked the first under the Food World banner for Publix and would become the first of 22 more of the type.[61]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn November 1977, in Lakeland, Florida, Publix opened the Lake Miriam Food World, which, at 57,000 sq. ft., was its largest store in the company and also the largest store in the southeast. The store was the company's first to feature barcode scanners.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe brand was retired in 1985 because the stores were unable to turn a profit for Publix or give workers a percentage of their store's profits.[61]\\r\\n\\r\\nStarting in 2001, Publix operated 14 PIX (stylized in all-capitals) gasoline-convenience stores in Florida, Georgia, and Tennessee. Locations were limited during the trial period of the concept. In 2014, all Florida and Georgia locations were sold to Circle K, the sole Tennessee location was sold to another entity, and the concept was discontinued.[62] The locations were converted to other brands, as Publix retains the rights to \\"PIX.\\"[63]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 2002, Publix invested in the Lakeland-based restaurant chain Crispers, which concentrates on health-conscious fare. It increased its stake in 2004 before purchasing the remainder of the company in 2007. In May 2011, Publix announced it had sold the Crispers chain to Healthy Food Concepts LLC. The stores had not performed well during the downturn and in recent years Publix closed several units, leaving the chain with 36 stores when the sale was announced.[64]\\r\\n\\r\\nPublix tested the market response to liquor stores in the late 1980s, but closed its test sites in 1989. It re-entered the liquor sales market again in 2003 and has met with success since.[65] The liquor store is in an area accessed via a separate entrance as required by local laws, modeled after many other grocery chains.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn September 2010, Publix reported it started adding Blockbuster DVD rental kiosks to its stores, with the movie rentals starting at $1 per day. In 2010, Publix completed its rollout of Blockbuster Express kiosks to its stores.[66]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 2012, NCR sold its entertainment division, which includes the Blockbuster Express kiosks, to Coinstar, the owner of the Redbox DVD rental kiosks.[67][68] Blockbuster Express machines were replaced with Redbox machines in most stores by the end of 2012.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn December 2016, Publix opened its first in-store Starbucks location in the Orlando area, with five more opening throughout 2017.[69][70][71]\\r\\n\\r\\nPresto! is an automated teller machine (ATM) network owned and operated by Publix Super Markets. There are over 1,100 Presto! ATMs in Florida, Alabama, Georgia, North Carolina, South Carolina, and Tennessee, all located at Publix retail stores. This network includes point of sale (POS) capabilities, meaning that debit, credit, electronic benefit transfer (EBT) cash, or EBT food stamp cards can be used to make purchases at any Publix store.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe company, founded in 1930, has never had a layoff.[73]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1995 Publix was sued \\"for sex discrimination in job assignments, promotions and allocation of hours\\" and settled for $81.5 million in 1997.[74] Publix had claimed that the suit was simply an effort by the United Food and Commercial Workers to unionize the company, but the judge ruled in favor of the plaintiffs and required Publix to \\"correct some of its statements.\\"[75]\\r\\n\\r\\nPublix announced that effective January 1, 2015, health coverage would be available to same-sex couples regardless of place of marriage, as long as they are legally married.[76]\\r\\n\\r\\nPublix regularly conducts charity drives raising money and food for such charities as Special Olympics, March of Dimes, Children's Miracle Network, United Way, as well as various local food banks and soup kitchens such as Our Father's House Soup Kitchen[77] and Second Harvest North Florida.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn May 25, 2018, student activists and survivors of the Stoneman Douglas High School shooting, including David Hogg, planned a boycott of Publix, which would have included \\"die-in\\" protests at several Publix supermarkets, because of the $670,000 that the company made to Adam Putnam, a Republican candidate for Florida governor and self-described \\"proud NRA sell-out\\"[78] who opposed new state gun restrictions created in response to the school shooting.[79] Moments before the protests began, the company announced that it would suspend corporate-funded political contributions and reevaluate their political funding practices.[78]  Despite the company's announcement, David Hogg led a die-in on May 25, 2018 at a Publix supermarket with parents and students from Stoneman Douglas High School for 720 seconds, the approximate number of school shootings in recent history.[80]  Six days after halting political contributions, the Florida Retail Federation, a trade group heavily funded (>80% in 2017) by Publix, donated an additional $100,000 to Putnam's Florida Grown political action committee.[81]\\r\\n\\r\\nPublix stock is private and restricted: it can only be purchased by current employees or board members, and cannot be sold to anyone without first being offered back to Publix for repurchase.[82]\\r\\n\\r\\nStock was made available to associates in 1959, originally priced at $10.00 per share.[83]\\r\\nEmployees can acquire stock through three programs: an ESOP \\"PROFIT\\"[84] plan, 401(k) \\"SMART\\" (Saving Makes A Richer Tomorrow) plan, and an employee stock purchase plan.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs of August 1, 2018, Publix stock is valued at $42.55 per share.[85] Publix stock is quoted on the US OTC market under the code PUSH.[86] It is listed on the 2016 Fortune 500 list at #87.[87]\\r\\n\\r\\nDistribution centers are located in:[1]\\r\\n\\r\\nManufacturing facilities are located in:[1]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 2003, Publix supported a successful bill that prevents owners from suing if their land is polluted by dry cleaning chemicals dumped on an adjacent property, if the adjacent property owners are on a state clean-up list.

She was active in the student government and served as the school's first female president of the freshman class. She then completed a year of graduate study at that school, to qualify for doctoral-level studies.[7] Campbell entered the London School of Economics in 1970 to study towards her doctorate in Soviet Government, and spent three months touring the Soviet Union, from April to June 1972. She had spent several years studying the Russian language, and was nearly fluent.[8] Campbell ultimately left her doctoral studies, returning to live in Vancouver after marrying Nathan Divinsky, her longtime partner, in 1972.

Campbell is the second prime minister of Canada to have been divorced, after Pierre Trudeau.\\r\\nShe briefly dated Gregory Lekhtman, the inventor of Exerlopers, during her term as prime minister, but the relationship was relatively private and she did not involve him in the 1993 election campaign. She is currently married to Hershey Felder, an actor, playwright, composer, and concert pianist.[10] She remains close to Nathan Divinsky's daughter Pamelea.\\r\\nCampbell was the unsuccessful British Columbia Social Credit Party (Socred) candidate in Vancouver Centre for a seat in the Legislative Assembly of British Columbia in 1983, receiving 12,740 votes (19.3% in a double member riding). Campbell ran unsuccessfully for the leadership of the BC Social Credit Party in the summer of 1986 (placing last with 14 votes from delegates), but was elected in October 1986 to the British Columbia Legislative Assembly as a Socred member for Vancouver-Point Grey, getting 19,716 votes (23.2%, also in a double member riding). Consigned to the backbenches, she became disenchanted with Premier Bill Vander Zalm's leadership and broke with him and Social Credit over the issue of abortion, which Vander Zalm was opposed to. Campbell decided to leave provincial politics and enter federal politics.[11]\\r\\nCampbell was elected in the 1988 federal election as the member of parliament (MP) from Vancouver Centre. She won the party nomination after the incumbent, Pat Carney, declined to stand for re-nomination. In 1989 she was appointed to the cabinet as Minister of State (Indian Affairs and Northern Development). From 1990ÿ1993 she held the post of Minister of Justice and Attorney General where she oversaw notable amendments to the Criminal Code in the areas of firearms control and sexual assault. In 1990, following the Supreme Court's decision invalidating the country's abortion law, Campbell was responsible for introducing Bill C-43 to govern abortions in Canada. Although it passed the House of Commons, it failed to pass the Senate, and as of 2017 there is no national law governing abortions.[12][13]\\r\\nIn 1993 Campbell was transferred to the posts of Minister of National Defence and Minister of Veterans Affairs. Notable events during her tenure included dealing with the controversial issue of replacing shipborne helicopters for the navy and for search and rescue units. The actions by Canadian Airborne Regiment in the military scandal known as the Somalia Affair also first emerged while Campbell was minister.[14][15] When the Liberal Party of Canada took power, the incident became the subject of a lengthy public inquiry, continuing to focus attention on Campbell and the PCs.\\r\\nIn February 1993, Prime Minister Brian Mulroney announced his retirement from politics, to take effect June 25, 1993. Campbell entered the party leadership race to succeed Mulroney. Campbell had served in four cabinet portfolios prior to running for the party leadership, including three years as Minister of Justice, and garnered support of more than half the PC caucus when she declared for the leadership.\\r\\nShe defeated Jean Charest at the Progressive Conservative leadership convention that June, and Governor General Ray Hnatyshyn appointed her Prime Minister on June 25. As a concession to Charest, Campbell appointed him to the posts of Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Industry, Science and Technologythe first largely symbolic, and the second a significant cabinet portfolio position.\\r\\nAfter becoming party leader and Prime Minister, Campbell set about reorganizing the cabinet. She cut it from 35 ministers to 23 ministers; she consolidated ministries by creating three new ministries: Health, Canadian Heritage, and Public Security. Campbell extensively campaigned during the summer, touring the nation and attending barbecues and other events. In August 1993, a Gallup Canada poll showed Campbell as having a 51 percent approval rating, which placed her as Canada's most popular prime minister in 30 years.[16][17] By the end of the summer, her personal popularity had increased greatly, far surpassing that of Liberal Party leader Jean Chrtien.[18] Support for the Progressive Conservative Party had also increased to within a few points of the Liberals, while the Reform Party had been reduced to single digits.\\r\\nCampbell was the only Canadian prime minister not to have resided at 24 Sussex Drive since that address became the official home of the Prime Minister of Canada in 1951. Campbell's predecessor Mulroney remained at 24 Sussex while renovations on his new home in Montreal were being completed. Campbell instead took up residence at Harrington Lake, the PM's summer and weekend retreat, located in rural Quebec, north of Ottawa, and she did not move into 24 Sussex after Mulroney left. Like Charles Tupper and John Turner, Campbell never sat in Parliament as Prime Minister, as her term was filled by the summer break and the election campaign.\\r\\nCampbell entered office facing a statutory general election. She waited as long as she could before asking Governor General Ray Hnatyshyn to dissolve Parliament on September 8, only weeks before Parliament was due to expire. The election was scheduled for October 25, the latest date it could be legally held under Section 4 of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms.\\r\\nThe Tories were optimistic that they would be able to remain in power and, if not, would at least be a strong opposition to a Liberal minority government.\\r\\nCampbell's initial popularity declined after the writ was dropped. When she was running for the party leadership, Campbell's frank honesty was seen as an important asset and a sharp contrast from Mulroney's highly polished style. However, this backfired when she told reporters at a Rideau Hall event that it was unlikely that the deficit or unemployment would be much reduced before the \\"end of the century\\". During the election campaign, she further stated that discussing a complete overhaul of Canada's social policies in all their complexities could not be done in just 47 days; this statement was reduced to her having stated that an election is no time to discuss important issues.\\r\\nProgressive Conservative support tailed off as the campaign progressed. By October, polls showed the Liberals were well on their way to at least a minority government, and would probably win a majority without dramatic measures. Even at this point, Campbell was still considerably more popular than Liberal leader Jean Chrtien. In hopes of stemming the tide, the Progressive Conservative campaign team put together a series of ads attacking the Liberal leader. The second ad appeared to mock Chrtien's Bell's Palsy facial paralysis, and generated a severe backlash from the media,[19] with some Tory candidates calling for the ad to be pulled from broadcasts. Campbell claims to have not been directly responsible for the ad, and to have ordered it off the air[20] over her staff's objections.\\r\\nIt was to no avail. Tory support plummeted into the teens in the aftermath of the ad, all but assuring that the Liberals would win a majority government.\\r\\nOn election night, October 25, the Progressive Conservatives were swept from power in a Liberal landslide. Campbell herself was defeated in Vancouver Centre by rookie Liberal Hedy Fry. She conceded defeat with the remark, \\"Gee, I'm glad I didn't sell my car.\\"[21]\\r\\nIt was only the third time in Canadian history that a prime minister was unseated at the same time that his or her party lost an election. All Progressive Conservatives running for re-election lost their seats, with the lone exception of Jean Charest, who was also the only surviving member of Campbell's cabinet. The Tories' previous support in Western Canada moved to Reform and the Liberals, while the Bloc Qubcois inherited most soft-nationalist Tory support in Quebec. In some cases, the Bloc pushed Cabinet ministers from Quebec into third place.\\r\\nThe Tories still finished with over two million votes, taking third place in the popular vote, and falling only two percentage points short of Reform for second place. However, as a consequence of the first past the post system, Tory support was not concentrated in enough areas to translate into victories in individual ridings. As a result, the Tories won only two seats, compared to Reform's 52 and the Bloc's 54. It was the worst defeat in party history, and the worst defeat ever suffered by a Canadian governing party at the federal level.\\r\\nCampbell faced hurdles that she blamed as being insurmountable. Mulroney left office as one of the most (and according to Campbell, the most)[22] unpopular prime ministers since opinion polling began in the 1940s. He considerably hampered his own party's campaign effort by staging a very lavish international farewell tour at taxpayer expense, and by delaying his retirement until there were only two-and-a-half months left in the Tories' five-year mandate.\\r\\nSome have pointed to her gender as a major contributing factor to her historic loss. University of New Brunswick professor Joanna Everitt writes that while media simply reported the facts about rival male leaders such as Jean Chrtien, Campbell's actions were usually interpreted as having some motive (drawing up support, appealing to a group, etc.)[23]\\r\\nCanadian humourist Will Ferguson suggested that the poor campaign meant Campbell should receive \\"some of the blame\\" for her party's losses, though \\"taking over the party leadership from Brian (Mulroney) was a lot like taking over the controls of a 747 just before it plunges into the Rockies.\\"[24]\\r\\nOn December 13, 1993, Campbell resigned as party leader; Jean Charest succeeded her.\\r\\nDespite her dramatic loss in the election, the Canadian women's magazine Chatelaine named Campbell as its Woman of the Year for 1993.[25] She published an autobiography, Time and Chance, (ISBN?0-770-42738-3) in 1996. The book became a Canadian bestseller, and is in its third edition from the University of Alberta Bookstore Press (ISBN?000010132X).\\r\\nIt was briefly rumoured that she was to be sent to Moscow as the ambassador to Russia.[26] However, in 1996, Campbell was appointed consul general to Los Angeles by the Chrtien government, a post in which she remained until 2000. While she was there, she collaborated with her husband, composer, playwright and actor Hershey Felder, on the production of a musical, Noah's Ark.\\r\\nFrom 1999 to 2003, she chaired the Council of Women World Leaders, a network of women who hold or have held the office of president or prime minister. She was succeeded by former Irish President Mary Robinson. From 2003 until 2005 she served as President of the International Women's Forum, a global organization of women of prominent achievement, with headquarters in Washington, D.C. From 2001 to 2004, she lectured at the John F. Kennedy School of Government at Harvard University. She continues as an Honorary Fellow at the Center for Public Leadership at the Kennedy School. She served as a director of several publicly traded companies in high technology and biotechnology.\\r\\nCampbell chairs the steering committee of the World Movement for Democracy. She served on the board of the International Crisis Group, an NGO that aims to prevent and resolve deadly conflicts. She is on the board of the Forum of Federations, the EastWest Institute, and is on the advisory body of The International Centre for the Study of Radicalisation and Political Violence at King's College London. She was a founding member of the Club de Madrid, an independent organization whose main purpose is to strengthen democracy in the world. Its membership is by invitation only, and consists of former Heads of State and Government. At different times Campbell has served as its Interim President, Vice President and from 2004 2006 its Secretary General. Campbell was the founding Chair of the International Advisory Board of the Ukrainian Foundation for Effective Governance, an NGO formed in September 2007 with the aid of businessman Rinat Akhmetov.[27]\\r\\nDuring the 2006 election campaign, Campbell endorsed the candidacy of Tony Fogarassy, the Conservative candidate in Campbell's former riding of Vancouver Centre. Campbell also clarified to reporters that she is a supporter of the new Conservative Party. Fogarassy lost the election, placing a distant third.\\r\\nWhile testifying in April 2009 at the Mulroney-Schreiber Airbus inquiry, Campbell said she still follows Canadian politics \\"intermittently.\\"[28]\\r\\nIn April 2014, Campbell was appointed the founding principal of the new Peter Lougheed Leadership College at the University of Alberta.[29]\\r\\nShe has appeared on the CBC Television program Canada's Next Great Prime Minister, a show which profiles and selects young prospective leaders, and has also been an occasional panelist on Real Time with Bill Maher.\\r\\nOn August 2, 2016, it was announced by Liberal Prime Minister Justin Trudeau that Campbell had agreed to chair a seven-person committee to prepare a shortlist of candidates to succeed Thomas Cromwell on the Supreme Court of Canada.[30] In mid-October 2016, the committee announced that it would recommend the appointment of Malcolm Rowe to the court, and he was sworn in on October 31 as the first Supreme Court justice to hail from Newfoundland and Labrador.[31]\\r\\nAs Justice Minister, Campbell brought about a new rape law that clarified sexual assault and whose passage firmly entrenched that in cases involving sexual assault, \\"no means no\\". She also introduced the rape shield law, legislation that protects a person's sexual past from being explored during trial. Her legacy of supporting sexual victims has been confirmed through her work with the Peter Lougheed Leadership College at the University of Alberta, where the inaugural cohort of scholars proposed that the college immediately implement mandatory education regarding sexual assault for students, which Campbell readily accepted.[32][33][34]\\r\\nSince Parliament never sat during Campbell's four months as a prime minister,[35] she was unable to bring forth new legislation, which must be formally introduced there. However, she did implement radical changes to the structure of the Canadian government. Under her tenure, the federal cabinet's size was cut from over 35 cabinet ministers and ministers of state to 23. This included the redesign of 8 ministries and the abolition or merging of 15 others.[36][37] The Chrtien government retained these new ministries when it took office. The number of cabinet committees was reduced from 11 to 5. Her successors have continued to keep the size of the federal Cabinet to approximately 30 members. She was also the first prime minister to convene a First Ministers' conference for consultation prior to representing Canada at the G7 Summit. Due to her brief time in office, Campbell holds a unique spot among Canadian prime ministers in that she made no Senate appointments.\\r\\nCampbell harshly criticized Mulroney for not allowing her to succeed him before June 1993. In her view, when she became prime minister, she had very little time or chance to make up ground on the Liberals once her initial popularity faded. In her memoirs, Time and Chance, and in her response to The Secret Mulroney Tapes, Campbell suggested that Mulroney knew the Tories would be defeated in the upcoming election, and wanted a \\"scapegoat who would bear the burden of his unpopularity\\" rather than a viable successor. The cause of the 1993 debacle remains disputed, with some arguing that the election results were a vote against Mulroney rather than a rejection of Campbell, and others suggesting that the poorly run Campbell campaign was the key factor in the result.\\r\\nAlthough the Progressive Conservatives survived as a distinct political party for another decade after the 1993 debacle, they never recovered their previous standing. During that period they were led by Jean Charest (1993ÿ1998), Elsie Wayne (1998) and then, for the second time, by Joe Clark (1998ÿ2003) (who had been Opposition Leader and briefly Prime Minister 20 years earlier). By 2003, the party under new leader Peter MacKay had voted to merge with the Canadian Alliance to form the Conservative Party of Canada, thus ceasing to exist, despite MacKay having promised not to pursue a mergers. Joe Clark continued to sit as a \\"Progressive Conservative\\" into 2004. The new generation of right-leaning Conservatives gained power in the election of 2006, ensuring the \\"Tory\\" nickname's survival in the federal politics of Canada. A PC \\"rump\\" caucus continued to exist in the Senate of Canada (consisting of certain Clark, Mulroney and Paul Martin appointees), but as of 2012 only one senator, Elaine McCoy of Alberta, sits as a Progressive Conservative.\\r\\nCampbell remains one of the youngest women to have ever assumed the office of Prime Minister in any country, and thus also one of the youngest to have left the office.\\r\\nCampbell was ranked No. 20 out of the first 20 Prime Ministers of Canada (through Jean Chrtien) by a survey of 26 Canadian historians used by J.L. Granatstein and Norman Hillmer in their 1997 book Prime Ministers: Ranking Canada's Leaders. A follow-up article co-authored by Hillmer in 2011 for Maclean's Magazine broadened the number of historians surveyed; in this new survey of over 100 Canadian historians, Campbell again finished dead last, this time coming at #22 out of Canada's first 22 Prime Ministers (through Stephen Harper).[38]\\r\\nIn 2004, she was included in the list of 50 most important political leaders in history in the Almanac of World History compiled by the National Geographic Society. She was cited for her status as the only woman head of government of a North American country (defined variously), but controversy ensued among academics in Canada over the merit of this honour, since her brief term in office was marked by very few, if any, major political accomplishments.\\r\\nOn November 30, 2004, Campbell's official portrait for the parliamentary Prime Minister's gallery was unveiled. The painting was created by Victoria, British Columbia artist David Goatley. Campbell said she was \\"deeply honoured\\" to be the only woman to have her picture in the Prime Ministers' corridor, stating: \\"I really look forward to the day when there are many other female faces.\\" The painting shows a pensive Campbell sitting on a chair with richly coloured Haida capes and robes in the background, symbolizing her time as a cabinet minister and as an academic.[39]\\r\\nAccording to Canadian protocol, as a former Prime Minister, she is styled \\"The Right Honourable\\" for life.\\r\\nBold indicates parties with members elected to the House of Commons.","input":"Who was the only female prime minister of canada?"},{"output":"United States","context":"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe 2026 FIFA World Cup (Spanish: Copa mundial de la FIFA de 2026; French: Coupe du monde de la FIFA de 2026) will be the 23rd FIFA World Cup, the quadrennial international men's football championship contested by the national teams of the member associations of FIFA. The tournament will be jointly hosted by 16 cities in three North American countries; 60 matches, including the quarterfinals, semi-finals, and the final, will be hosted by the United States while neighboring Canada and Mexico will each host 10 matches. The tournament will be the first hosted by three nations.[1][2]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe United 2026 bid beat a rival bid by Morocco during a final vote at the 68th FIFA Congress in Moscow. It will be the first World Cup since South Korea/Japan in 2002 that will be hosted by more than one nation. With its past hosting of the 1970 and 1986 tournaments, Mexico will also become the first country to host all or part of three men's World Cups.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe 2026 World Cup will also see the tournament expanded from 32 to 48 teams.[3]\\r\\n\\r\\nMichel Platini, who was then the UEFA president, had suggested in October 2013 an expansion of the tournament to 40 teams,[4][5] an idea that FIFA president Gianni Infantino also suggested in March 2016.[6] A desire to increase the number of participants in the tournament from the previous 32 team format was announced on October 4, 2016. Four expansion options were considered:[7][8][9][10]\\r\\n\\r\\nOn January 10, 2017, the FIFA Council voted unanimously to expand to a 48-team tournament.[3]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe tournament will open with a group stage consisting of 16 groups of three teams, with the top two teams progressing from each group to a knockout tournament starting with a round of 32 teams.[11] The number of games played overall will increase from 64 to 80, but the number of games played by finalists remains at seven, the same as with 32 teams, but one group match will be replaced by a knockout match. The tournament will also be completed within 32 days, the same as previous 32-team tournaments.[12]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe European Club Association and its member clubs opposed the proposal for expansion, saying that the number of games was already at an \\"unacceptable\\" level and they urged the governing body to reconsider its idea of increasing the number of teams that qualify.[13] They contended that it was a decision taken for political reasons because Infantino would thus satisfy his electorate, rather than for sporting reasons.[14] Liga de F~tbol Profesional president Javier Tebas agreed, affirming the unacceptability of the new format. He told Marca that the football industry is maintained thanks to clubs and leagues, not FIFA, and that Infantino did politics because to be elected he promised more countries in the World Cup; he wanted to keep the electoral promises.[15] German national team coach Joachim L?w warned that expansion, as had occurred for Euro 2016, would dilute the value of the world tournament because players have already reached their physical and mental limit.[16]  Another criticism of the new format is that with three-team groups, the risk of collusion between the two teams playing in the last round of the group stage will increase compared with four-team groups (where simultaneous kick-offs have been employed). One suggestion by president Infantino is that group matches that end in draws will be decided by penalty shootouts.[17]\\r\\n\\r\\nOn March 30, 2017, the Bureau of the FIFA Council (composed of the FIFA president and the presidents of each of the six confederations) proposed a slot allocation for the 2026 FIFA World Cup. The recommendation was submitted for the ratification by the FIFA Council.[18][19]\\r\\n\\r\\nOn May 9, 2017, two days before the 67th FIFA Congress, the FIFA Council approved the slot allocation in a meeting in Manama, Bahrain. It includes an intercontinental playoff tournament involving six teams to decide the last two FIFA World Cup berths.[20]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe issue of how to allocate automatic host country qualification given that there are multiple host countries has not yet been resolved and will be decided by the FIFA council.[18][20][21]\\r\\nThe United bid anticipated all three host countries being awarded automatic places.[22]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe ratification of slot allocation gives OFC a guaranteed berth in the final tournament for the first time in FIFA World Cup history. The 2026 FIFA World Cup will be the first tournament in which all six confederations have guaranteed berths.\\r\\n\\r\\nA playoff tournament involving six teams will be held to decide the last two FIFA World Cup berths,[18] consisting of one team per confederation (except for UEFA) and one additional team from the confederation of the host country (i.e. CONCACAF).\\r\\n\\r\\nTwo of the teams will be seeded based on the FIFA World Rankings, and the seeded teams will play for a FIFA World Cup berth against the winners of the first two knockout games involving the four unseeded teams.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe tournament is to be played in the host country(ies) and to be used as a test event for the FIFA World Cup. The existing playoff window of November 2025 has been suggested as a tentative date for the 2026 edition.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe FIFA Council went back and forth between 2013 and 2017 on limitations within hosting rotation based on the continental confederations. Originally, it was set that bids to be host would not be allowed from countries belonging to confederations that hosted the two preceding tournaments. It was temporarily changed to only prohibit countries belonging to the confederation that hosted the previous World Cup from bidding to host the following tournament,[23] before the rule was changed back to its prior state of two World Cups. However, the FIFA Council did make an exception to potentially grant eligibility to member associations of the confederation of the second-to-last host of the FIFA World Cup in the event that none of the received bids fulfill the strict technical and financial requirements.[24][25] In March 2017, FIFA president Gianni Infantino confirmed that \\"Europe (UEFA) and Asia (AFC) are excluded from the bidding following the selection of Russia and Qatar in 2018 and 2022 respectively.\\"[26] Therefore, the 2026 World Cup could be hosted by one of the remaining four confederations: CONCACAF (North America; last hosted in 1994), CAF (Africa; last hosted in 2010), CONMEBOL (South America; last hosted in 2014), or OFC (Oceania, never hosted before), or potentially by UEFA in case no bid from those four met the requirements.\\r\\n\\r\\nCo-hosting the FIFA World Cupwhich had been banned by FIFA after the 2002 World Cupwas approved for the 2026 World Cup, though not limited to a specific number but instead evaluated on a case-by-case basis. Also by 2026, the FIFA general secretariat, after consultation with the Competitions Committee, will have the power to exclude bidders who do not meet the minimum technical requirements to host the competition.[24]\\r\\n\\r\\nCanada, Mexico and the United States had all publicly considered bidding for the tournament separately, but the United joint bid was announced on April 10, 2017. The United bid contacted 48 venues in 43 cities (3 venues in 3 cities in Mexico, 8 venues in 6 cities in Canada and 37 venues in 34 cities in the United States). This bid was ultimately cut down to 23 venues in 23 cities (3 in Canada, 3 in Mexico and 17 in the United States; the American venues will be cut down to 10 for a total of 16 venues for the tournament). Morocco announced its bid in August 2017, and had 14 proposed venues in 12 cities.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe voting took place on June 13, 2018, during FIFA's annual congress in Moscow, and it was reopened to all eligible members.[27] The United bid won receiving 134 valid ballots, while the Morocco bid received 65 valid ballots. Upon the selection, Canada becomes the fifth country to host both men's and women's World Cupthe latter was in 2015, Mexico becomes the first country to host three men's World Cupspreviously in 1970 and 1986, and the United States becomes the first country to host both men's and women's World Cup twice eachhaving hosted the 1994 men's and the 1999 and 2003 women's World Cups.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe 2026 World Cup's qualification process has yet to be decided. The FIFA Council is expected to decide which hosts, if  any, will receive automatic qualifications to the tournament.[18][20][21]\\r\\nThe United Bid personnel anticipated that all three host countries would be awarded automatic places.[22]\\r\\n\\r\\nDuring the bidding process, there were 49 venues in 43 cities contacted to be part of the bid. 41 cities with 45 venues responded and submitted to be part of the bid (3 venues in 3 cities in Mexico, 8 venues in 6 cities in Canada and 38 venues in 34 cities in the United States). A first round elimination cut 9 venues and 9 cities, then a second round elimination cut 9 venues in 6 cities, reducing the total number to 23 venues, each in their own city or metropolitan area. The 23 candidate cities and venues will be narrowed down to 16 in 2020 or 2021 (3 in Canada, 3 in Mexico, and 10 in the United States):\\r\\n\\r\\nFIFA president Gianni Infantino criticized the U.S. travel ban on several Muslim-majority nations. Infantino said, \\"When it comes to FIFA competitions, any team, including the supporters and officials of that team, who qualify for a World Cup need to have access to the country, otherwise there is no World Cup. That is obvious.\\"[29]\\r\\n\\r\\nHowever, assurances were later given by the government that there would be no such discrimination.[30][31]\\r\\n\\r\\nU.S. President Donald Trump threatened the countries that intended to support the Morocco bid to host the 2026 World Cup, tweeting: \\"The US has put together a STRONG bid w/ Canada & Mexico for the 2026 World Cup.

In August 2016 there were 547 local councils in Australia.[4]\\r\\nDespite the single level of local government in Australia, there are a number of extensive areas with relatively low populations which are not a part of any local government area. Powers of local governments in these areas may be exercised by special purpose bodies established outside the general legislation, as with Victoria's alpine resorts, or directly by state governments. The area covered by local councils in Australia ranges from as small as 1.5?km2 (0.58?sq?mi) for the Shire of Peppermint Grove in metropolitan Perth, to the Shire of East Pilbara in the Pilbara region of Western Australia, which covers 380,000?km2 (150,000?sq?mi), an area larger than Germany or Japan.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nLocal government in Australia is subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of the states or territories. The functions and practices of local government councils are similar throughout Australia, but may vary to some degree between jurisdictions.\\r\\nThe Australian Capital Territory is not divided into territory and local government.\\r\\nState departments oversee local government councils and may intervene in their affairs, subject to relevant legislation.[5]\\r\\nAs of January 2017[update], the following table provides a summary of local government areas by states and territories by local government area types:\\r\\nThe Australian Classification of Local Governments (ACLG) categorises Australian local governing authorities using the population, the population density and the proportion of the population that is classified as urban for the council.[6] The classification, at the two-digit level, is:\\r\\nThere is no mention of local government in the Constitution of Australia, though it is mentioned several times in the Annotated Constitution of Australia[7][8] namely where \\"Municipal institutions and local government\\" appears in Annotation 447, \\"Power of the Parliament of a Colony\\" under \\"Residuary Legislative Powers\\" on pages 935 and 936.\\r\\nThe first official local government in Australia was the Perth Town Trust, established in 1838, only three years after British settlement.[2] The Adelaide Corporation followed, created by the province of South Australia in October 1840. The City of Melbourne and the Sydney Corporation followed, both in 1842.[2][9] All of these early forms failed; it was not until the 1860s and 1870s that the various colonies established widespread stable forms of local government, mainly for the purpose of raising money to build roads in rural and outer-urban regions. Council representatives attended conventions before Federation, however local government was unquestionably regarded as outside the Constitutional realm.[2]\\r\\nIn the 1970s, the Whitlam Government expanded the level of funding to local governments in Australia beyond grants for road construction. General purpose grants become available for the first time.[10]\\r\\nSignificant reforms took place in the 1980s and 1990s in which state governments used metrics and efficiency analysis developed within the private sector in the local government arena. Each state conducted an inquiry into the benefits of council amalgamations during the 1990s.[11] In the early 1990s, Victoria saw the number of local councils reduced from 210 to 78.[11] South Australia, Tasmania and Queensland saw some reductions in the number of local governments while Western Australia and New South Wales rejected compulsory mergers. New South Wales eventually forced the merging of some councils. The main purpose of amalgamating councils was for greater efficiency and to improve operations, but forced amalgamation of councils is sometimes seen as a dilution of representative democracy.[11]\\r\\nAn increase in the range of services offered by councils, but only minor cost savings of less than 10% have been noted by academics as outcomes after mergers. The council mergers have resulted in widespread job losses and lingering resentment from some whose roles have experienced a larger workload.[11]\\r\\nThe growth of the Regional Organisations of Councils has also been a factor in local government reform in Australia.[11] In 1995, there were 50 such agreements across the country. A 2002 study identified 55 ROCs with the largest involving 18 councils.[11]\\r\\nLocal governments are subdivisions of the states and the Northern Territory. The Australian Capital Territory has no separate local governments; and functions in Canberra and the surrounding area normally performed by state and local governments are performed there by the territorial government of the Australian Capital Territory.\\r\\nAlthough they are all essentially identical in function, Australian local governments have a variety of names. The term \\"local government area\\" is used to refer collectively to all local governments regardless of status, whilst the local governing body itself is generally known as a council. Today, the styles \\"borough\\", \\"city\\", \\"district\\", \\"municipality\\", \\"region\\", \\"shire\\", \\"town\\", \\"community government\\", \\"Aboriginal shire\\" and \\"Island\\" are used in addition to areas/councils without a specific style.\\r\\nIn general, an urban or suburban LGA is called a city, as in the City of Canada Bay or City of Bunbury, and is governed by a City Council. A rural LGA covering a larger rural area is usually called a shire, as in Shire of Mornington Peninsula or Lachlan Shire, and is governed by a Shire Council.\\r\\nSometimes words other than \\"City\\" or \\"Shire\\" will be used in the names of LGAs. The word \\"Municipality\\" occurs in some states: in New South Wales, it is typically used for older urban areas and the word is also used for several rural towns in South Australia. Some rural areas in South Australia are known as \\"District Councils\\", while larger rural towns and small metropolitan centres in Queensland and Western Australia simply use the term \\"Town\\". New South Wales and Queensland have introduced a new term, \\"Region\\", for LGAs formed by the amalgamation of smaller shires and rural cities. Historically, the word \\"Borough\\" was common for small towns and metropolitan areas in Victoria, but only the Borough of Queenscliffe remains. In New South Wales, where the Local Government Act does not require a designation, some local governments are legally known simply as \\"Councils\\", such as Port Macquarie-Hastings Council, Inner West Council, or Federation Council. All the LGAs in Tasmania that were previously 'Municipalities' have been renamed 'Councils.'\\r\\nAlmost all local councils have the same administrative functions and similar political structures, regardless of their naming, and retain a particular designation (\\"Shire\\", \\"Borough\\", \\"Town\\", \\"City\\") for historical reasons only. They will typically have an elected council and usually a mayor or shire president responsible for chairing meetings of the council. In some councils, the mayor is a directly elected figure, but in most cases the mayor is elected by their fellow councillors from among their own number. The powers of mayors vary as well. In some states such as Queensland, the mayors have broad executive functions, whereas in New South Wales mayors are essentially ceremonial figureheads who can only exercise power at the discretion of the council.\\r\\nMost of the capital city LGAs administer only the central business districts and nearby central suburbs. A notable exception is the City of Brisbane, the most populous LGA in the country, which administers a significant part of the Brisbane metropolitan area. In most cases, when a city's population statistics are used, it is the statistical division population rather than the local government area.\\r\\nLocal government powers are determined by state governments, and states have primary responsibility for funding and exclusive responsibility for supervision of local councils.\\r\\nLocal government is mentioned in the annotated Australian constitution, as a department of the State Governments, and they are mentioned in the constitutions of each of the six states. A 1988 referendum sought to explicitly insert mention of local government in the federal constitution but this was comprehensively defeated. A further referendum was proposed in 2013, but was cancelled due to the change in the election date.\\r\\nFederal government interaction with local councils happens regularly through the provision of federal grants to help fund local government managed projects.\\r\\nAll local governments are approximately equal in their theoretical powers, although LGAs that encompass large cities such as Brisbane and the Gold Coast command more resources due to their larger population base. Unlike local governments in many other countries, services such as police, fire protection and schools are provided by state or territory government rather than by local councils.\\r\\nThe councils' chief responsibility in the first half of the 20th century was the provision of physical infrastructure such as roads, bridges and sewerage.[12] From the 1970s the emphasis changed to community facilities such as libraries and parks, maintenance of local roads, town planning and development approvals, and local services such as waste disposal. Child care, tourism and urban renewal were also beginning to be part of local governments' role. These are financed by collection of local land taxes known as \\"rates,\\" and grants from the state and Commonwealth governments. They are caricatured as being concerned only with the \\"three Rs\\": Rates, Roads and Rubbish.\\r\\nHowever, the roles of local government areas in Australia have recently expanded as higher levels of government have devolved activities to the third tier. Examples include the provision of community health services, regional airports and pollution control[12] as well as community safety and accessible transport.[5] The changes in services has been described as a shift from 'services to property' towards 'services to people'.[5] Community expectations of local government in Australia has risen in the 21st century partly as a result of wider participation in decision making and transparent management practices.[12]\\r\\nRecent years have seen some State governments devolving additional powers onto LGAs. In Queensland and Western Australia LGAs have been granted the power to independently enact their own local subsidiary legislation, in contrast to the previous system of by-laws. Councils also have organised their own representative structures such as Local Government Associations and Regional Organisations of Councils.\\r\\nDoctrines of new public management have shaped state government legislation towards increased freedoms aiming to allow greater flexibility on the part of local governments.[5]\\r\\nUnlike many other countries, Australia has only one level of local government immediately beneath state and territorial governments. Aside from very sparsely populated areas and a few other special cases, almost all of Australia is part of a local government area. Unincorporated areas are often in remote locations, cover vast areas or have very small populations.\\r\\nThe Australian Capital Territory has no municipalities and is in some sense an unincorporated area. The ACT government is directly responsible for matters normally carried out by a local government.\\r\\nNew South Wales has 2 unincorporated areas:\\r\\nIn the Northern Territory, 1.45% of the total area and 4.0% of the population are in unincorporated areas, including Unincorporated Top End Region (Finniss-Mary, the largest), areas covered by the Darwin Rates ActNhulunbuy, Alyangula on Groote Eylandt in the northern region, and Yulara in the southern region.[13]\\r\\nIn South Australia, 60% of the state's area is unincorporated and communities located within receive municipal services provided by a state agency, the Outback Communities Authority.[14]\\r\\nVictoria has 10 unincorporated areas, which are either ski resorts or small islands:[13]\\r\\nWestern Australia has 3 unincorporated areas:","input":"How does australia power our towns and cities?"},{"output":"Justified","context":"Justin Randall Timberlake (born January 31, 1981) is an American singer-songwriter, actor and record producer. Born and raised in Tennessee, he appeared on the television shows Star Search and The All-New Mickey Mouse Club as a child. In the late 1990s, Timberlake rose to prominence as one of the two lead vocalists and youngest member of NSYNC, which eventually became one of the best-selling boy bands of all time. Timberlake began to adopt a more mature image as an artist with the release of his debut solo album, the R&B-focused Justified (2002), which yielded the successful singles \\"Cry Me a River\\" and \\"Rock Your Body\\", and earned his first two Grammy Awards.\\r\\nHis critically acclaimed second album FutureSex/LoveSounds (2006), characterized by its diversity in music genres, debuted atop the U.S. Billboard 200 and produced the Hot 100 number-one singles \\"SexyBack\\", \\"My Love\\", and \\"What Goes Around... Comes Around\\". Established as a solo artist worldwide, his first two albums both exceeded sales of 10 million copies. He produced records and collaborated with other artists. From 2008 through 2012, Timberlake focused on his acting career, effectively putting his music career on hiatus; he held starring roles in the films The Social Network, Bad Teacher, In Time, and Friends with Benefits.\\r\\nTimberlake resumed his music career in 2013 with his third and fourth albums The 20/20 Experience and The 20/20 Experience ÿ 2 of 2, exploring neo soul styles, partly inspired by the expansive song structures of 1960s and 1970s rock. The former became the best-selling album of the year in the US with the largest sales week, and spawned the top-three singles \\"Suit & Tie\\" and \\"Mirrors\\", while the latter produced the top-ten song \\"Not a Bad Thing\\". For his live performances, including the eponymous concert tour for the albums, he began performing with his band The Tennessee Kids, composed by instrumentalists and dancers. Timberlake voiced the lead character in DreamWorks Animation's Trolls (2016), which soundtrack includes his fifth Billboard Hot 100 chart-topping single, \\"Can't Stop the Feeling!\\".\\r\\nAmong numerous awards and accolades, Timberlake is the recipient of ten Grammy Awards, four Emmy Awards, three Brit Awards, and nine Billboard Music Awards. Time named him one of the 100 most influential people in the world in 2007 and 2013. His other ventures include record label Tennman Records, fashion label William Rast, and the restaurants Destino and Southern Hospitality.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nJustin Randall Timberlake was born on January 31, 1981 in Memphis, Tennessee,[2][3] to Lynn (Bomar) Harless and Charles Randall Timberlake, a Baptist church choir director.[4][5][6] Timberlake grew up in Shelby Forest, a small community between Memphis and Millington.[3] He has two half-brothers, Jonathan (born September 12, 1993) and Stephen (born August 14, 1998), from Charles' second marriage to Lisa Perry. His half-sister Laura Katherine died shortly after birth on May 12, 1997, and is mentioned in his acknowledgments in the album NSYNC as \\"My Angel in Heaven\\".[7] His family circle includes a number of musicians;[8] his grandfather introduced him to music from country artists like Johnny Cash and Willie Nelson.[9] Performing as a child, Timberlake sang country and gospel music: at the age of 11, Timberlake appeared on the television show Star Search, performing country songs as \\"Justin Randall\\".[3] By that time, he began listening to rhythm and blues musicians from the 1960s and 70s, such as Al Green, Stevie Wonder and Marvin Gaye, and he had listening sessions with his father of studio albums by the Eagles and Bob Seger.[9]\\r\\nIn 1993 and 1994, he was a cast member in The Mickey Mouse Club, where his castmates included future girlfriend and singer Britney Spears, future tourmate Christina Aguilera, future bandmate JC Chasez, and future movie actors Ryan Gosling and Keri Russell.[10] Timberlake then recruited Chasez to be in an all-male singing group, organized by boy band manager Lou Pearlman, that eventually became NSYNC.[11]\\r\\nThe boy band NSYNC formed in 1995, and began their career in 1996 in Europe; Timberlake and Chasez served as its two lead singers.[12] In 1998, the group rose to prominence in the United States with the release of their self-titled debut studio album, which sold 11 million copies and included the hit single \\"Tearin' Up My Heart\\". Their second album No Strings Attached (2000) sold 2.4 million copies in the first week,[13] and included a No. 1 single, \\"It's Gonna Be Me\\". NSYNC's third album Celebrity (2001) was also financially successful. Upon the completion of the Celebrity Tour, the group went into hiatus in 2002. In its lifetime, NSYNC was internationally famous and performed at the Academy Awards,[14] the Olympics,[15] and the Super Bowl,[16] as well as selling more than 50 million copies worldwide, becoming the third-best selling boy band in history.[17]\\r\\nIn late 1999, Timberlake appeared in the Disney Channel movie Model Behavior. He played Jason Sharpe, a model who falls in love with a waitress after mistaking her for another model. It was released on March 12, 2000.[19] The rise of his own stardom and the general decline in the popularity of boy bands led to the dissolution of NSYNC. Band member Lance Bass was openly critical of Timberlake's actions in his memoir Out of Sync.[20]\\r\\nIn August 2002, Timberlake performed at the 2002 MTV Video Music Awards, where he premiered his debut solo single \\"Like I Love You\\";[21] it peaked at number 11 on the Billboard Hot 100[22] and number two on the UK Singles Chart.[23] His debut solo studio album Justified was released in November[24] and debuted at number two on the Billboard 200 with first-week sales of 439,000 copies, fewer than previous 'N Sync releases. It went on to sell over three million copies in the U.S. and more than seven million copies worldwide.[25] Its R&B influence, provided by hip-hop producers The Neptunes and Timbaland,[26] was complimented by music critics. About the musical direction of the record, he commented, \\"I just want to do R&B. It's what I grew up listening to\\".[27] The album spawned the top-five singles \\"Cry Me a River\\" and \\"Rock Your Body\\".[22] In summer 2003, Timberlake and Christina Aguilera headlined the Justified/Stripped Tour.[28] Later that year he recorded a song \\"I'm Lovin' It\\", used by McDonald's as the theme to its \\"I'm Lovin' It\\" campaign. The deal with McDonald's earned Timberlake an estimated $6 million. A tour titled Justified and Lovin' It Live was included with the deal, following his initial Justified World Tour.[29] Timberlake was featured on Nelly's song, \\"Work It\\", which was remixed and included on Nelly's 2003 remix album.[30]\\r\\nNear the end of 2002, Timberlake was the first celebrity to appear on Punk'd, a \\"candid camera\\" type show created by Ashton Kutcher to trick celebrities.[31] Timberlake, who cried during the episode, later admitted to being under the influence of cannabis when he was pranked. Three episodes later, he set up Kelly Osbourne to be \\"punk'd\\", thus making him the first celebrity to appear on the show more than once.[32] Timberlake later spoofed Ashton Kutcher and Punk'd in a 2003 episode of NBC's Saturday Night Live.[33] Timberlake co-starred in skit titled The Barry Gibb Talk Show alongside comedian Jimmy Fallon, where the duo portrayed Bee Gees brothers Barry and Robin Gibb. It marked the beginning of a long-running friendship and collaboration with Fallon.[34]\\r\\nIn February 2004, during the halftime show of the Super Bowl XXXVIII broadcast on the CBS television network from Houston, Timberlake performed with Janet Jackson before a television audience of more than 140 million viewers. At the end of the performance, as the song drew to a close, Timberlake tore off a part of Jackson's black leather costume in a \\"costume reveal\\" meant to accompany a portion of the song lyrics. Jackson's representative explained Timberlake intended \\"to pull away the rubber bustier to reveal a red lace bra. The garment collapsed and her breast was accidentally revealed.\\"[35] Part of the costume detached, and Jackson's breast was briefly exposed.[36] Timberlake apologized for the incident, stating he was \\"sorry that anyone was offended by the wardrobe malfunction during the halftime performance of the Super Bowl...\\"[37] The phrase \\"wardrobe malfunction\\" has since been used by the media to refer to the incident and has entered pop culture.[38] Timberlake and Jackson were threatened with exclusion from the 2004 Grammy Awards unless they agreed to apologize on screen at the event. Timberlake attended and issued a scripted apology when accepting the first of two Grammy Awards he received that night (Best Pop Vocal Album for Justified and Best Male Pop Vocal Performance for \\"Cry Me a River\\").[39] He had also been nominated for Album of the Year for Justified, and Record of the Year along with Best Rap/Sung Collaboration for \\"Where Is the Love?\\" with The Black Eyed Peas.[40]\\r\\nAfter the Super Bowl incident, Timberlake put his recording career on hold to act in several films, having starred in a few feature films earlier in his career.[10] The first role he took during this time was as a journalist in Edison Force, filmed in 2004 and received a direct-to-video release on July 18, 2006.[41] He also appeared in the films Alpha Dog, Black Snake Moan, Richard Kelly's Southland Tales, and voiced Prince Artie Pendragon in the animated film Shrek the Third, released on May 18, 2007.[42] He also appeared as a young Elton John, in the video for John's song \\"This Train Don't Stop There Anymore\\".[43] Timberlake was considered to play the role of Roger Davis in the film version of the rock musical Rent, but director Chris Columbus had insisted that only the original Broadway members could convey the true meaning of Rent, so the role was reprised by Adam Pascal.[44]\\r\\nHe continued to record with other artists. After \\"Where Is the Love?\\", he again collaborated with the Black Eyed Peas on the 2005 track \\"My Style\\" from their album Monkey Business.[45] When recording the 2005 single \\"Signs\\" with Snoop Dogg, Timberlake discovered a throat condition.[46] Nodules were subsequently removed from his throat in an operation that took place on May 5, 2005.[47] He was advised not to sing or speak loudly for at least a few months.[48] In 2005, he began his own record company, JayTee records.[49]\\r\\nTimberlake released his second studio album, FutureSex/LoveSounds, on September 12, 2006. The album, which Timberlake created from 2005 to 2006, debuted at number one on the Billboard 200 album chart, selling 684,000 copies its first week.[50] It became the biggest album for pre-orders on iTunes, and beat Coldplay's record for the biggest one-week sales of a digital album.[51] The album was produced by Timbaland and Danja (who produced a bulk of the album), will.i.am, Rick Rubin and Timberlake himself, and features guest vocals by Snoop Dogg, Three 6 Mafia, T.I. and will.i.am.[52] A studio representative described it as being \\"all about sexiness\\" and aiming for \\"an adult feel\\".[47]\\r\\nThe album's lead single, \\"SexyBack\\", was performed by Timberlake at the opening of the 2006 MTV Video Music Awards and reached number one on the Billboard Hot 100, where it remained for seven consecutive weeks.[53] \\"My Love\\", the album's second single, also produced by Timbaland and featuring rapper T.I., reached number one on the Hot 100, as did third single \\"What Goes Around... Comes Around\\". The song is reported to have been inspired by the break-up of his childhood friend and business partner, Trace Ayala, with actress Elisha Cuthbert.[54] In October 2006, Timberlake said that he would focus on his music career rather than his film roles, specifying that leaving the music industry would be a \\"dumb thing to do at this point\\".[53] He was the special guest performer at the 2006 Victoria's Secret Fashion Show where he sang \\"SexyBack\\", \\"My Love\\" and \\"LoveStoned\\".[55]\\r\\nTimberlake hosted many music events, including the European MTV Music Awards in 2006. On December 16, 2006, Timberlake hosted Saturday Night Live, doing double duty as both host and musical guest for the second time. During this appearance, he and Andy Samberg performed an R&B song for a skit titled \\"Dick in a Box\\", which some radio stations aired as an unofficial single from Timberlake. Called \\"one of the most iconic musical moments in the shows history\\" by Billboard, it became a viral hit and one of the most viewed videos on YouTube at the time.[56] Rolling Stone listed the skit at number three on their \\"50 Greatest 'Saturday Night Live' Sketches of All Time\\".[57] The song earned him an Emmy Award and was later featured on The Lonely Island's debut album Incredibad.\\r\\nIn January 2007, Timberlake embarked on the FutureSex/LoveShow tour. Following singles off the album, \\"LoveStoned/I Think She Knows (Interlude)\\" and \\"Until the End of Time\\", peaked within the top 20 on the Hot 100, while the sixth single \\"Summer Love\\" reached the top 10. The song \\"Give It to Me\\", a Timbaland single on which Timberlake guests with Nelly Furtado, reached the Hot 100 number-one spot.[58] Eventually, FutureSex/LoveSounds was added to the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame's musical library and archive.[59]\\r\\nThe song \\"4 Minutes\\", was first played by Timbaland at Philadelphia's Jingle Ball on December 17, 2007.[60] When released on March 17, 2008, \\"4 Minutes\\" was revealed to be a duet between Timberlake and Madonna, with backing vocals by Timbaland. It was lead single from Madonna's eleventh studio album Hard Candy, which featured four other song-writing collaborations with Timberlake, being also one of the executive producers.[61] The single was an international hit, topping the charts in over 21 countries worldwide.[62] Timberlake also appears in the music video, which was directed by Jonas & Fran?ois. On March 30, 2008, Timberlake performed the song at Madonna's Hard Candy Promo Show at Roseland Ballroom in New York City.[63] On November 6, 2008, Timberlake performed the song with Madonna on the Los Angeles stop of her Sticky & Sweet Tour.[64]\\r\\nIn June 2007, Timberlake co-wrote, produced and provided vocals for the songs \\"Nite Runner\\" and \\"Falling Down\\" for Duran Duran's album Red Carpet Massacre, released on November 13, 2007. \\"Falling Down\\" had been released as a single in the UK on the previous day.[65] Also in 2007, Timberlake made an appearance on 50 Cent's third album, Curtis. Timberlake, along with Timbaland, is featured on a track called \\"Ayo Technology\\", which was the album's fourth single. Also, another possible collaboration was to occur with Lil Wayne for his album Tha Carter III with Nelly Furtado and Timbaland.[66] With the wrapping up of the FutureSex/LoveSounds tour of Australasia and the Middle East in November 2007, Timberlake resumed his film career. Projects underway early in 2008 were starring roles in Mike Myers' comedy The Love Guru (released June 20, 2008) and Mike Meredith's drama The Open Road (released August 28, 2009). In March 2008 it was announced that he was to be an executive producer in an American adaptation of the hit Peruvian comedy My Problem with Women for NBC.[67] On November 20, 2008, TV Guide reported that Timberlake's next single, \\"Follow My Lead\\", which also featured vocals by Timberlake's protge, former YouTube star Esme Denters, would be available for exclusive download through Myspace. All proceeds would go to Shriners Hospitals for Children, a charity dedicated to improving pediatric care for sick children.[68]\\r\\nIn February 2008, Timberlake was awarded two Grammy Awards. At the 50th Grammy Awards ceremony, he won the Award for Best Male Pop Vocal Performance for \\"What Goes Around...Comes Around\\", and the Award for Best Dance Recording for \\"LoveStoned/I Think She Knows\\".[69]\\r\\nIn 2008, a collaboration between Timberlake and T.I., \\"Dead and Gone\\" featured on T.I.'s sixth studio album, Paper Trail, and was released as its fourth single late in 2009. In November 2008, it was confirmed that Timberlake would make a guest appearance and produce some tracks on R&B/pop singer Ciara's upcoming album Fantasy Ride due out May 5, 2009. Timberlake featured on Ciara's second single \\"Love Sex Magic\\", the video being shot on February 20, 2009.[70] The single became a worldwide hit, reaching the top ten in numerous countries and peaking at number one in several countries including Taiwan, India, and Turkey. The song was nominated for Best Pop Collaboration with Vocals at the 52nd Grammy Awards. Timberlake hosted the 16th ESPY Awards, which musical number \\"I Love Sports\\" was later nominated for an Emmy award.[71] Timberlake and his production team The Y's, along with Mike Elizondo, produced and co-wrote the song \\"Don't Let Me Down\\" for Leona Lewis's second studio album, Echo, released on November 17, 2009. Timberlake also co-wrote and performed on \\"Carry Out\\", the third single from Timbaland's album Shock Value II, released on December 1, 2009.[72] Timberlake appeared on Jimmy Fallon's debut as host of Late Night with Jimmy Fallon on March 2, 2009.[73] Timberlake was the executive producer on the MTV reality series The Phone, which premiered on April 21, 2009. In late 2009, Barbadian singer Rihanna released the album Rated R, with Timberlake being one of the writers and producers.[74] They both worked together previously for her third studio album Good Girl Gone Bad.[75]\\r\\nFrom 2010, Timberlake increased his acting work. He played Sean Parker, the founder of Napster, in the acclaimed film The Social Network (2010). He also appeared at the 2010 MTV VMAs on September 12, 2010.[76] In 2011, he starred alongside Cameron Diaz in Bad Teacher and then alongside Mila Kunis in Friends with Benefits, and played Will Salas, the protagonist of In Time, a science fiction film by Andrew Niccol.[77] He provided a feature and appeared in the music video for the song Motherlover from The Lonely Island's second album Turtleneck & Chain,[78] and directed and made a cameo in the FreeSol music video \\"Hoodies On, Hats Low\\" which was released in August 2011.[79] The Late Night with Jimmy Fallon sketch \\"History of Rap\\" was performed for the first time by both Fallon and Timberlake in 2010.[80] In July 2011 United States Marine Kelsey De Santis uploaded a YouTube video asking Timberlake to be her date to the United States Marine Corps birthday ball; they attended the event on November 13, 2011 in Richmond, Virginia.[81]\\r\\nHis fifth Saturday Night Live episode, as host and musical guest, was the most-watched episode since January 7, 2012, with Charles Barkley as host and Kelly Clarkson as musical guest.[82]\\r\\nTimberlake began work on his third studio album The 20/20 Experience in June 2012, with \\"no rules and/or end goal in mind\\".[83] He publicly announced his return to the music industry in January 2013,[84] releasing the album's lead single \\"Suit & Tie\\" featuring Jay-Z later that month, which would eventually peak at number three on the Billboard Hot 100. After four years not performing in concert, Timberlake appeared the night before the 2013 Super Bowl and performed during the \\"DirecTV Super Saturday Night\\", on February 2, 2013 in New Orleans.[85] On February 10, 2013, he performed \\"Suit & Tie\\" with sepia-toned lighting at the 55th Annual Grammy Awards, with Jay-Z joining him from the audience.

It's Southern American music. But I want to make it sound modern  at least that's the idea right now.\\"[126]\\r\\nWoody Allen's upcoming film Wonder Wheel starring by Kate Winslet, features Timberlake and Juno Temple in supporting roles. The film marks the first collaboration between Timberlake and director Allen.[127] On February 26, 2017, Timberlake opened the 89th Academy Awards with a performance of \\"Can't Stop the Feeling!\\", since the song earned Max Martin, Shellback and him a nomination.[128] Timberlake will perform at Rock in Rio 2017[129] and the United States Grand Prix.[130]\\r\\nIn early 1999, Timberlake began dating fellow former The New Mickey Mouse Club cast member and singer Britney Spears. Their relationship ended abruptly in March 2002.[131] In April 2003, he began dating actress Cameron Diaz soon after they met at the Nickelodeon Kids' Choice Awards. After much speculation of breakups throughout their relationship,[132] the couple split in December 2006 shortly after she introduced him as musical guest on Saturday Night Live.[133]\\r\\nIn January 2007, Timberlake began dating actress Jessica Biel.[134] They became engaged in December 2011, and married on October 19, 2012 at the Borgo Egnazia resort in Fasano, Italy.[135] Timberlake and Biel have one son, born in April 2015.[136]\\r\\nForbes magazine began reporting on Timberlake's earnings in 2008, calculating that he earned $44?million between June 2007 and June 2008 for his music, tour, commercials and hospitality, making him the world's 4th best-paid music personality at the time, above Madonna and Celine Dion.[137] They placed him twelfth on the Celebrity 100 list[138] and second on the \\"Best-Paid Celebrities Under 30\\" list.[139] According to Billboard, Timberlake was the third highest-paid musician of 2013, with earnings of $31?million.[140] He was ranked 26th with earnings of $57?million on the Celebrity 100 list for 2014,[141] and 19th on the 2015 list with $63?million.[142] Timberlake was listed at number three on Billboard Money-Makers List of 2014.[143]\\r\\nTimberlake has a lyric tenor vocal range.[144] Primarily an R&B album, his debut Justified also contains influences of dance-pop, funk and soul music.[145] During the production of FutureSex/LoveSounds, Timberlake was interested in rock music.[146] This inspiration was used in his approach in recording the songs, rather than in composing them. Timberlake reveals, \\"I wanted to sing the song like a rock and roll singer, not an R&B singer.\\"[147] On the influences he drew from, he said that if Justified was \\"characterized\\" by Michael Jackson and Stevie Wonder, FutureSex/LoveSounds is more like David Bowie and Prince.[148] Other influences include late INXS-frontman Michael Hutchence,[149] Arcade Fire, David Byrne, The Killers, The Strokes, and Radiohead.[146] He began including beatboxing in his records near the end of his boyband era and into his emergence as a solo act,[150] this includes songs from Justified[151] and FutureSex/LoveSounds.[152]\\r\\nUnlike his previous record primarily focused on R&B and pop genres,[153] FutureSex/LoveSounds is less concentrated on one particular sound, thus representing a wider range. Timberlake explains, \\"It's more broad as far as the styles I wanted to mix in to my own type of thing.\\"[154] A musically \\"complex\\" album, FutureSex/LoveSounds is a fusion of rap, rock, funk, soul, gospel, new wave, opera, and world music,[148] characterized by preludes and interludes interspersed on the album's tracks.[155] Entertainment Weekly noted that the album's sound is a \\"sonic departure\\" from both NSYNC and Justified.[156] Although \\"What Goes Around\\" sounds similar to Justified, Timberlake admitted that it is the only song in the new album to have such similarity.[153] The 20/20 Experience is a neo soul album partly inspired by the expansive song structures of 1960s and 1970s rock.[157] Mikael Wood of the Los Angeles Times found its elaborate structures ambitious in the vein of Stevie Wonder, Prince, and Michael Jackson.[158] Since his marriage, he incorporated themes of romance in his songwriting, as Complex noted, showing that he \\"writes his tracks on his emotions, leaving him with a career of personal albums.\\"[159] Moments of emotional pain after betrayal influenced the songwriting of some previous records.[160]\\r\\nLongtime critic Robert Hilburn for the Los Angeles Times praised Timberlake's act after attending the Justified and Stripped Tour in 2003, considering him \\"born for the stage (with) the savvy instincts to put together a show that works. Rather than make himself the constant center of attention, he was comfortable enough at times simply to be part of a talented ensemble.\\"[161] In 2013, Timberlake introduced his big-band orchestra called the Tennessee Kids for Legends of the Summer and The 20/20 Experience World Tour which includes guitarists, dancers, background singers, drummers, bassists, keyboardists, trumpeters, a music coordinator, a percussionist, a saxophonist, among others musicians.[162][163] The 20/20 Experience allowed Timberlake to throw back to the big-band era,[164] its stage production embraced a vintage sheen and everyone in classic suits. For the tour, Timberlake had a horn section onstage with him called The Regiment Horns.[165] The Hollywood Reporter's Emily Zemler described him as a performer who is \\"genuinely having fun,\\"[166] whereas Jon Pareles of The New York Times commented that the singer \\"reveals something darker, more fiery and intense\\" while performing post-breakup revenge songs, such as \\"Cry Me a River and What Goes Around... Comes Around.[167] Billboard editor Phil Gallo praised Timberlake's medley performance at the 2013 MTV Video Music Awards, saying he \\"gave the show its heart and center,\\" also mentioning his place as a modern recording artist and a solid link in the lineage of the most acclaimed performers in the show's history.[168] The New York Times' editor Katie Rogers highlighted Timberlake's crossover appeal after his performance with Chris Stapleton at the 2015 Country Music Association Awards.[169] Described by critics as a \\"consummate showman\\",[164][170] Timberlake usually plays guitar, piano and keyboard in his shows.[171]\\r\\nTimberlake was given Sexiest Man titles by Teen People and Cosmopolitan magazines.[172] On February 17, 2009, Timberlake was named the \\"Most Stylish Man in America\\" by GQ magazine.[173] In 2011, he ranked No. 46 on AskMen's annual rundown of the 49 Most Influential Men.[174] VH1 listed him at number three on its 100 Sexiest Artists List.[175] In Nielsen Music's U.S. report for 2015, Timberlake led the \\"Top 10 Musicians Among Millennials\\" list.[176] Wax figures of Timberlake are found at Madame Tussauds Wax Museums in New York,[177] Las Vegas,[178] Hollywood,[179] Nashville,[180] Berlin,[181] Amsterdam,[182] and London.[183] His costume for the Saturday Night Live skit \\"Dick in a Box\\" is displayed at \\"Saturday Night Live: The Exhibition\\" in New York.[184] The New York Times' editor Sia Michel wrote in 2007, \\"Since his last tour, for 2002's multiplatinum Justified, he has learned how to project sex-symbol edge\\" adding \\"he's a rock star who can commit.\\"[185] Napster's founder Sean Parker, portrayed by Timberlake in The Social Network, stated \\"I dont think I look anything like Timberlake, but it's not so bad being played by a sex symbol.\\"[186]\\r\\nTimberlake's fashion and style evolution, from \\"boy-band synchronized wardrobe days\\" to \\"a notable source of fashion inspiration to men all over,\\" has been noticed by the media.[187][188] As noted by a Billboard editor, \\"Since his solo career began with the 2002 release of debut album Justified, Timberlake has honed his unique sense of style,\\" while citing Elvis Presley, Johnny Cash, Jerry Lee Lewis and Frank Sinatra, as style influences: guys who were just really never trying to be that [stylish], they just were that.[189] According to American fashion designer Tom Ford, who has dressed Timberlake since 2011 and created more than 600 exclusive pieces for The 20/20 Experience World Tour, Timberlake \\"has a kind of effortless cool that makes classic menswear tailoring modern.\\"[190]\\r\\nAfter New York legalized same-sex marriage in 2011, he voiced his support for LGBT equality in the U.S., stating, \\"We should be using our differences to bring ourselves closer together. Not be afraid of something that we don't know.\\"[191][192] Timberlake and his wife Jessica Biel received the Inspiration Award at the GLSEN Respect Awards in 2015, with the executive director saying, \\"They are two vocal and committed allies to the LGBT community who are also devoted to charitable works that improve the lives of youth.\\"[191]\\r\\nInfluenced by the national attention received by Timberlake's selfie inside a voting booth shared on Instagram during the 2016 presidential election, which was at the moment an illegal act,[193] Senator Brian Kelsey of Germantown brought up a bill that would allow taking photos in voting poll stations, with the exceptions of the acts of committing voter intimidation, fraud or selling a vote. It was later approved by the Tennessee Senate.[194]\\r\\nTimberlake has been referred to as the \\"President of Pop\\"[195] and \\"Prince of Pop\\"[196] by contemporary critics.[197] In a 2016 article of The Hollywood Reporter, editor Scott Feinberg stated Timberlake is \\"widely regarded as one of the greatest all-around entertainers in the history of show business.\\"[198]\\r\\nIn 2003, Rolling Stone named him the biggest pop star of the year and featured him on the magazine's cover, commenting that he \\"attained the one thing most pop stars don't, and the one thing he wanted more than anything else: credibility.\\"[9] For Entertainment Weekly his second studio album, FutureSex/LoveSounds, \\"redefined pop's cutting edge\\";[199] for Vibe it \\"pushed boundaries more forcefully\\" than works by his male contemporaries.[200] Fuse TV's editor Jason Lipshutz stated it \\"changed the game. [The album] was steely and sweaty, a universal dance opus that made room for intimacy. It had the best first half of any pop album in 25 years. You have to go back to 1979 for Off the Wall, to find a pop album with a first half that matches up.\\"[201] He was ranked 66th on the VH1 100 Greatest Artists of All-Time.[202] Timberlake appeared for the first time on the Time 100 list of most influential people in 2007.[203] In 2013, Timberlake made his second appearance on the 100 list, with Stevie Wonder writing \\"Justin has accomplished a lot at a young age, taking advantage of all the possibilities, and yet he's found time to give of himself toohe gets and gives back. He has a spirit. He does God's work through using the most of his talent.\\"[204] In October 2015, he was inducted into the Memphis Music Hall of Fame, becoming its youngest member.[205][206]\\r\\nJustified's single \\"Cry Me a River\\", which is also considered by Rolling Stone to be one of the 500 greatest songs of all time,[207] ranked at number 20 on the magazine's 100 Best Songs of the 2000s.[208] It was further cited by Marilyn Manson as one of the main songs that influenced him.[209][210] Billboard editor Jason Lipshutz named the song's music video \\"one of the more brilliant musical moments in pop music since the dawn of the century.\\"[211] His second album FutureSex/LoveSounds was placed at 46 on Rolling Stone's 100 Best Albums of the 2000s,[212] the ninth best-album of the decade for Entertainment Weekly,[199] and the greatest of the decade for Vibe.[200] The lead single, \\"SexyBack\\", helped introduce EDM sounds to top 40 radio, as it brought together variations of electronic dance music with Timberlake's R&B sounds.[213][214] Aside from earning critical acclaim for its parent album, according to Sia Michel of The New York Times, he was responsible for popularizing in 2006 the catchphrase \\"I'm bringing sexy back\\";[156][215] it spawned a \\"phenomenon\\" in which video-makers spoofed the song.[216]\\r\\nConsidered a pop icon by media outlets,[217] his work has influenced numerous artists, including Olly Murs,[218] Maroon 5,[219] Britney Spears,[220] Lorde,[221] Justin Bieber,[222] Joe Jonas,[223] Shawn Mendes,[224] Thomas Rhett,[225] Ed Sheeran,[226] Jason Derulo,[227] Liam Payne,[228][229] Bridgit Mendler,[230] Tori Kelly,[231] Hunter Hayes,[232] BoA,[233] Seungri,[234][235] Taeyang,[236] Rain,[237][238] Lloyd Banks,[239] and Maluma.[240] Bieber and Nick Jonas have cited him as one of their role models, with the latter stating is for \\"not only transitioning from where he started, but also balancing acting and singing.\\"[241][242] Christian hip hop artist tobyMac has stated Timberlake's work inspires him, commenting \\"he's setting himself up to be a classic, making decisions and moving on them.

The ancestry question will return in the 2020 Census.[7]\\r\\nAs of July 2016[update], White Americans are the racial majority. African Americans are the largest racial minority, amounting to an estimated 12.7% of the population. Hispanic and Latino Americans amount to an estimated 17.8% of the total U.S. population, making up the largest ethnic minority.[8] The White, non-Hispanic or Latino population make up 61.3% of the nation's total, with the total White population (including White Hispanics and Latinos) being 76.9%.[9]\\r\\nWhite Americans are the majority in every census-defined region (Northeast, Midwest, South, West) and in every state except Hawaii[10], but contribute the highest proportion of the population in the Midwestern United States, at 85% per the Population Estimates Program (PEP),[4] or 83% per the American Community Survey (ACS).[11][verification needed] Non-Hispanic Whites make up 79% of the Midwest's population, the highest ratio of any region.[5] However, 35% of White Americans (whether all White Americans or non-Hispanic/Latino only) live in the South, the most of any region.[4][5]\\r\\n55% of the African American population lives in the South.[4] A plurality or majority of the other official groups reside in the West. The latter region is home to 42% of Hispanic and Latino Americans, 46% of Asian Americans, 48% of American Indians and Alaska Natives, 68% of Native Hawaiians and Other Pacific Islanders, 37% of the \\"two or more races\\" population (Multiracial Americans), and 46% of those self-designated as \\"some other race\\".[4][12]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the 2000 Census and subsequent United States Census Bureau surveys, Americans self-described as belonging to these racial groups:[3]\\r\\nEach person has two identifying attributes, racial identity and whether or not they are of Hispanic ethnicity.[19] These categories are sociopolitical constructs and should not be interpreted as being scientific or anthropological in nature.[2] They have been changed from one census to another, and the racial categories include both \\"racial\\" and national-origin groups.[20][21]\\r\\nIn 2007, the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission of the US Department of Labor finalized its update of the EEO-1 report format and guidelines to come into an effect on September 30, 2007. In particular, this update concerns the definitions of racial/ethnic categories.\\r\\nThe question on Hispanic or Latino origin is separate from the question on race.[3][22] Hispanic and Latino Americans have ethnic origins in the countries of Latin America, Spain, and Portugal. Latin American countries are, like the United States, racially diverse.[23] Consequently, no separate racial category exists for Hispanic and Latino Americans, as they do not constitute a race, nor a national group. When responding to the race question on the census form, each person is asked to choose from among the same racial categories as all Americans, and are included in the numbers reported for those races.[24]\\r\\nEach racial category may contain Non-Hispanic or Latino and Hispanic or Latino Americans. For example: the White (European-American) race category contains Non-Hispanic Whites and Hispanic Whites (see White Hispanic and Latino Americans); the Black or African-American category contains Non-Hispanic Blacks and Hispanic Blacks (see Black Hispanic and Latino Americans); the Asian-American category contains Non-Hispanic Asians and Hispanic Asians (see Asian Hispanic and Latino Americans); and likewise for all the other categories. See the section on Hispanic and Latino Americans in this article.\\r\\nSelf-identifying as both Hispanic or Latino and not Hispanic or Latino is neither explicitly allowed nor explicitly prohibited.[2]\\r\\nIn the United States since its early history, Native Americans, Africans and Europeans were considered to belong to different races. For nearly three centuries, the criteria for membership in these groups were similar, comprising a person's appearance, their social circle (how they lived), and their known non-White ancestry. History played a part, as persons with known slave ancestors were assumed to be African (or, in later usage, black), regardless of whether they also had European ancestry.\\r\\nThe differences between how Native American and Black identities are defined today (blood quantum versus one-drop and political assumptions) have been based on different historical circumstances. According to the anthropologist Gerald Sider, such racial designations were a means to concentrate power, wealth, privilege and land in the hands of Whites in a society of White hegemony and privilege (Sider 1996; see also Fields 1990). The differences had little to do with biology and more to do with the history of slavery and its racism, and specific forms of White supremacy (the social, geopolitical and economic agendas of dominant Whites vis--vis subordinate Blacks and Native Americans). They related especially to the different social places which Blacks and Amerindians occupied in White-dominated 19th-century America. Sider suggests that the blood quantum definition of Native American identity enabled mixed-race Whites to acquire Amerindian lands during the allotment process. The one-drop rule of Black identity, enforced legally in the early 20th century, enabled Whites to preserve their agricultural labor force in the South. The contrast emerged because, as peoples transported far from their land and kinship ties on another continent, Black labor was relatively easy to control, and they became reduced to valuable commodities as agricultural laborers. In contrast, Amerindian labor was more difficult to control; moreover, Amerindians occupied large territories that became valuable as agricultural lands, especially with the invention of new technologies such as railroads. Sider thinks the blood quantum definition enhanced White acquisition of Amerindian lands in a doctrine of Manifest Destiny, which subjected Native Americans to marginalization and resulted in numerous conflicts related to American expansionism.\\r\\nThe political economy of race had different consequences for the descendants of aboriginal Americans and African slaves. The 19th-century blood quantum rule meant that it was relatively easier for a person of mixed Euro-Amerindian ancestry to be accepted as White. The offspring of a few generations of intermarriage between Amerindians and Whites likely would not have been considered Amerindian (at least not in a legal sense). Amerindians could have treaty rights to land, but because an individual with only one Amerindian great-grandparent no longer was classified as Amerindian, he lost a legal claim to Amerindian land, under the allotment rules of the day. According to Sider's theory, Whites were more easily able to acquire Amerindian lands. On the other hand, the same individual who could be denied legal standing in a tribe, according to the government, because he was \\"too White\\" to claim property rights, might still have enough visually identifiable Amerindian ancestry to be considered socially as a \\"half-breed\\" or breed, and stigmatized by both communities.\\r\\nThe 20th-century one-drop rule made it relatively difficult for anyone of known Black ancestry to be accepted as White. The child of an African-American sharecropper and a White person was considered Black by the local communities. In terms of the economics of sharecropping, such a person also would likely become a sharecropper as well, thus adding to the landholder or employer's labor force. In short, this theory suggests that in a 20th-century economy that benefited from sharecropping, it was useful to have as many Blacks as possible.\\r\\nAlthough some scholars of the Jim Crow period agree that the 20th-century notion of invisible Blackness shifted the color line in the direction of paleness, and \\"expanded\\" the labor force in response to Southern Blacks' Great Migration to the North. But, others (such as the historians Joel Williamson, C. Vann Woodward, George M. Fredrickson, and Stetson Kennedy) considered the one-drop rule a consequence of the need to define Whiteness as being pure, and justifying White-on-Black oppression.\\r\\nOver the centuries when Whites wielded power over both Blacks and Amerindians and believed in their inherent superiority over people of color, they created a social order of hypodescent, in which they assigned mixed-race children to the lower-status groups. They were often ignorant of the systems among Native American tribes of social classification, including kinship and hypodescent. The Omaha people, for instance, who had a patrilineal kinship system, classified all children with white fathers as \\"white\\", and excluded them as members of the clans and tribe, unless one was formally adopted by a male member. Tribal members might care for mixed-race children of white fathers, but considered them outside the hereditary clan and kinship fundamental to tribal society.[25]\\r\\nThe hypodescent social construction related to the racial caste that was associated with African slavery and the conditions of the slave societies. It was made explicit by Virginia and other colonies' laws as early as 1662. Virginia incorporated the Roman principle of partus sequitur ventrem into slave law, saying that children of slave mothers were born into their status. Under English common law for subjects, children's social status was determined by the father, not the mother. But the colonists put Africans outside the category of English subjects. Generally, white men were in positions of power to take sexual advantage of black women slaves. But, historian Paul Heinegg has shown that most free African-American families listed in the censuses of 1790ÿ1810 were, in fact, descended from unions between white women and African men in colonial Virginia, from the years when working classes lived and worked closely together, and before slavery had hardened as a racial caste.[26]\\r\\nIn the United States, social and legal conventions developed over time by whites that classified individuals of mixed ancestry into simplified racial categories (Gossett 1997), but these were always porous. The decennial censuses conducted since 1790, after slavery was well established in the United States, included classification of persons by race: white, black, mulatto, and Indian (Nobles 2000). But, the inclusion of mulatto was an explicit acknowledgement of mixed race. In addition, before the Civil War, Virginia and some other states had legal definition of \\"whiteness\\" that provided for people being classified as white if no more than 1/8 black. (For example, if not born into slavery, Thomas Jefferson's children by his slave Sally Hemings would have been classified as legally white, as they were 7/8 white by ancestry. Three of the four surviving children entered white society as adults, and their descendants have identified as white.) In the late 18th and 19th centuries, people of mixed race often migrated to frontiers where societies were more open, and they might be accepted as white if satisfying obligations of citizenship.[26]\\r\\nThe more familiar \\"one-drop rule\\" was not adopted by Virginia and other states until the 20th century, but it classified persons with any known African ancestry as black (Davis 2001). Passage of such laws was often urged by white supremacists and people promoting \\"racial purity\\" through eugenics, having forgotten the long history of multi-racial unions in the South that comprised the ancestry of many families.[citation needed]\\r\\nIn other countries in the Americas, where mixing among groups was overtly more extensive, social categories have tended to be more numerous and fluid. In some cases, people may move into or out of categories on the basis of a combination of socioeconomic status, social class, ancestry, and appearance (M?rner 1967).\\r\\nThe term Hispanic as an ethnonym emerged in the 20th century, with the rise of migration of laborers from Spanish-speaking countries of the western hemisphere to the United States. It includes people who may have been considered racially distinct (Black, White, Amerindian or other mixed groups) in their home countries. Today, the word \\"Latino\\" is often used as a synonym for \\"Hispanic\\". Even if such categories were earlier understood as racial categories, today they have begun to represent ethno-linguistic categories (regardless of perceived race). Similarly, \\"Anglo\\" is now used among many Hispanics to refer to non-Hispanic White Americans or European Americans, most of whom speak the English language but are not of primarily English descent.\\r\\nThe United States is a racially diverse country. The growth of the Hispanic population through immigration and high birth rates is noted as a partial factor for the US' population gains in the last quarter-century. The 2000 census revealed that Native Americans had reached their highest documented population, 4.5 million, since the US was founded in 1776.[3]\\r\\nThe immigrants to the New World came largely from widely separated regions of the Old World. In the Americas, the immigrant populations began to mix among themselves and with the indigenous inhabitants of the continents. In the United States, for example, most people who identify as African American have some European ancestors, as revealed by genetic studies. In one analysis of those genetic markers that have differing frequencies between continents, European ancestry ranged from an estimated 7% for a sample of Jamaicans to ~?23?% for a sample of African Americans from New Orleans, where there was historically a large class of mixed race (now called Louisiana Creoles) (Parra et al. 1998).\\r\\nIn the United States since its early history, Native Americans, African Americans, and European Americans were classified as belonging to different races. For nearly three centuries, the criteria among whites for membership in these groups were similar, comprising physical appearance, assumption of non-European ancestry, and social circle. The criteria for membership in these races diverged in the late 19th century. During and after Reconstruction, after the emancipation of slaves after the Civil War, in the effort to restore white supremacy in the South, whites began to classify anyone with \\"one drop\\" of \\"black blood\\", or known African ancestry, to be black. Such a legal definition was not put into law until the early 20th century in most southern states, but many established racial segregation of facilities during the Jim Crow era, after white Democrats regained control of state legislatures in the South.\\r\\nEfforts to track mixing between groups led to an earlier proliferation of historical categories (such as \\"mulatto\\" and \\"octaroon\\" among persons with partial African descent) and \\"blood quantum\\" distinctions, which became increasingly untethered from self-reported ancestry. In the 20th century, efforts to classify the increasingly mixed population of the United States into discrete categories generated many difficulties (Spickard 1992). By the standards used in past censuses, many mixed-race children born in the United States were classified as of a different race than one of their biological parents. In addition, a person may change personal racial identification over time because of cultural aspects, and self-ascribed race can differ from assigned race (Kressin et al. 2003).\\r\\nUntil the 2000 census, Latinos were required to identify as one race, and none was Latino. Partly as a result of the confusion generated by the distinction, 32.9% (U.S. census records) of Latino respondents in the 2000 census ignored the specified racial categories and checked \\"some other race\\". (Mays et al. 2003 claim a figure of 42%)\\r\\nHistorical trends influencing the ethnic demographics of the United States include:\\r\\nIn some cases, immigrants and migrants form ethnic enclaves; in others, mixture creates ethnically diverse neighborhoods.\\r\\n(For demographics by specific ethnic groups rather than general race, see \\"Ancestry\\" below.)\\r\\nThe majority of people currently living in the United States are White and European Americans. The United States Census Bureau defines White people as those \\"having origins in any of the original peoples of Europe, the Middle East, or North Africa.\\"[27] Like all official U.S. racial categories, \\"White\\" has a \\"not Hispanic or Latino\\" and a \\"Hispanic or Latino\\" component,[28] the latter consisting mostly of White Mexican Americans and White Cuban Americans.\\r\\nWhite Americans are the majority in 49 of the 50 states, with Hawaii as the exception. Non-Hispanic Whites are the majority in 46 states; Hawaii, New Mexico, California, and Texas (and the District of Columbia) are the exceptions.[29] These five jurisdictions have \\"minority majorities\\", i.e. minority groups compose the majority of the population.\\r\\nThe non-Hispanic White percentage (63% in 2012[5]) tends to decrease every year, and this sub-group is expected to become a plurality of the overall U.S. population after the year 2043. White Americans overall (non-Hispanic Whites together with White Hispanics) are projected to continue as the majority, at 73.1% (or 303 million out of 420 million) in 2050, from currently 77.1%.\\r\\nAlthough a high proportion of the population is known to have multiple ancestries, in the 2000 census, the first with the option to choose more than one, most people still identified with one racial category.[citation needed] In the 2000 census, self-identified German Americans made up 17.1% of the U.S. population, followed by Irish Americans at 12%, as reported in the 2000 U.S. Census. This makes German and Irish the largest and second-largest self-reported ancestry groups in the United States. Both groups had high rates of immigration to the U.S. beginning in the mid-19th century, triggered by the Great Famine in Ireland and the failed 1848 Revolution in Germany. However, English Americans and British Americans are still considered the largest ethnic group due to a serious under count following the 2000 census whereby many English and British Americans self-identified under the new category entry 'American' considering themselves 'indigenous' because their families had resided in the US for so long[30][31][32][33] or, if of mixed European ancestry, identified with a more recent and differentiated ethnic group.[34]\\r\\n7.2% of the population listed their ancestry as American on the 2000 census (see American ethnicity). According to the United States Census Bureau, the number of people in the U.S. who reported American and no other ancestry increased from 12.4 million in 1990 to 20.2 million in 2000. This change in reporting represented the largest \\"growth\\" of any ethnic group in the United States during the 1990s, but it represented how people reported themselves more than growth through birth rates, for instance, and certainly did not reflect immigration.\\r\\nMost French Americans are believed descended from colonists of Catholic New France; exiled Huguenots, much fewer in number and settling in the eastern English colonies in the late 1600s and early 1700s, needed to assimilate into the majority culture and have intermarried over generations. Isle?os of Louisiana and the Hispanos of the Southwest have had, in part, direct Spanish ancestry; most self-reported White Hispanics are of Mexican, Puerto Rican, and Cuban origins, each of which are multi-ethnic nations. Hispanic immigration has increased from nations of Central and South America.[35]\\r\\nBlack and African Americans are citizens and residents of the United States with origins in Sub-Saharan Africa.[36] According to the Office of Management and Budget, the grouping includes individuals who self-identify as African-American, as well as persons who emigrated from nations in the Caribbean and Sub-Saharan Africa.[37] The grouping is thus based on geography, and may contradict or misrepresent an individual's self-identification since not all immigrants from Sub-Saharan Africa are \\"Black\\". Among these racial outliers are persons from Cape Verde, Madagascar, various Hamito-Semitic populations in East Africa and the Sahel, and the Afrikaners of Southern Africa.[36]\\r\\nAfrican Americans (also referred to as Black Americans or Afro-Americans, and formerly as American Negroes) are citizens or residents of the United States who have origins in any of the black populations of Africa.[38] According to the 2009 American Community Survey, there were 38,093,725 Black and African Americans in the United States, representing 12.4% of the population. In addition, there were 37,144,530 non-Hispanic blacks, which comprised 12.1% of the population.[39] This number increased to 42 million according to the 2010 United States Census, when including Multiracial African Americans,[37] making up 14% of the total U.S. population.[a][41] Black and African Americans make up the second largest group in the United States, but the third largest group after White Americans and Hispanic or Latino Americans (of any race).[42] The majority of the population (55%) lives in the South; compared to the 2000 Census, there has also been a decrease of African Americans in the Northeast and Midwest.[41]\\r\\nMost African Americans are the direct descendants of captives from West Africa, who survived the slavery era within the boundaries of the present United States.[43] As an adjective, the term is usually written African-American.[44] The first West Africans were brought to Jamestown, Virginia in 1619. The English settlers treated these captives as indentured servants and released them after a number of years. This practice was gradually replaced by the system of race-based slavery used in the Caribbean.[45] All the American colonies had slavery, but it was usually the form of personal servants in the North (where 2% of the people were slaves), and field hands in plantations in the South (where 25% were slaves);[46] by the beginning of the American Revolutionary War 1/5th of the total population was enslaved.[47] During the revolution, some would serve in the Continental Army or Continental Navy,[48][49] while others would serve the British Empire in Lord Dunmore's Ethiopian Regiment, and other units.[50] By 1804, the northern states (north of the MasonÿDixon line) had abolished slavery.[51] However, slavery would persist in the southern states until the end of the American Civil War and the passage of the Thirteenth Amendment.[52] Following the end of the Reconstruction Era, which saw the first African American representation in Congress,[53] African Americans became disenfranchised and subject to Jim Crow laws,[54] legislation that would persist until the passage of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and Voting Rights Act of 1965 due to the Civil Rights Movement.[55]\\r\\nAccording to US Census Bureau data, very few African immigrants self-identify as African-American. On average, less than 5% of African residents self-reported as \\"African-American\\" or \\"Afro-American\\" on the 2000 US Census. The overwhelming majority of African immigrants (~95%) identified instead with their own respective ethnicities. Self-designation as \\"African-American\\" or \\"Afro-American\\" was highest among individuals from West Africa (4%-9%), and lowest among individuals from Cape Verde, East Africa and Southern Africa (0%-4%).[56] None the less, African immigrants often develop very successful professional and business working-relationships with African-Americans.\\r\\nIn 2008, \\"Hispanic or Latino origin\\" was the self-identification of 47 million Americans. They chiefly have origins in the Spanish-speaking nations of Latin America. Very few also come from other places, for example: 0.2% of Hispanic and Latino Americans were born in Asia.[57] The group is heterogeneous in race and national ancestry.\\r\\nThe Census Bureau defines \\"Hispanic or Latino origin\\" thus:\\r\\nThe leading country-of-origin for Hispanic Americans is Mexico (30.7 million), followed by Puerto Rico (4.2 million) (which actually has a special relationship with the US, of which its people are citizens), and Cuba (1.6 million), as of 2008.[59] However, as of 2010, there were 1,648,968 Salvadorans in the United States, the largest of the U.S.-Central American community. Salvadorans are poised to become the third largest Hispanic group by the next census, significantly overtaking and replacing Cubans.[60] Recent estimates already put the Salvadoran population as high as 2 million, as of 2013, the third largest Hispanic-American group.[61]\\r\\n62.4% of Hispanic and Latino Americans identified as white.[12] 30.5% identified as \\"some other race\\" (other than the ones listed). According to the PEP 91.9% of Latinos are white, as these official estimates do not recognize \\"some other race\\".[5] In the official estimates, Black or African American Hispanics are the second-largest group, with 1.9 million, or 4.0% of the whole group. The remaining Hispanics are accounted as follows, first per the PEP: 1.6% American Indian and Alaska Native, 1.5% two or more races, 0.7% Asian, and 0.03% Native Hawaiian and Other Pacific Islander. Per the ACS: 3.9% two or more races, 1.9% Black or African American, 1.0% American Indian and Alaska Native, 0.4% Asian, and 0.05% Native Hawaiian and Other Pacific Islander.[12]\\r\\nIn the United States the Hispanic and Latino population has reached 58 million in 2016. According to Pew Research Center the Latino population has been the principal driver of United States demographic growth since 2000. Mexicans make up most of the Hispanic and Latino population 35,758,000. There is also a growth of Hispanics who are receiving a college education in 2015, 40% of Hispanics age 25 and older have had a college experience. In 2000 the percentage was at a low 30%. In all the 50 US states California houses the largest population percentage of Latinos. In 2015, 15.2 million Hispanics lived in California.[62]\\r\\nThe Hispanic or Latino population is young and fast-growing, due to immigration and higher birth rates.[57] For decades it has contributed significantly to U.S. population increases, and this is expected to continue. The Census Bureau projects that by 2050, one-quarter of the population will be Hispanic or Latino.[63][64]\\r\\nA third significant minority is the Asian American population, comprising 19.4 million in 2013, or 6.0% of the U.S. population.[11] California is home to 4.5 million Asian Americans, whereas 495,000 live in Hawaii, where they compose the plurality, at 38.5% of the islands' people. This is their largest share of any state.[65] Historically first concentrated on Hawaii and the West Coast, Asian Americans now live across the country, living and working in large numbers in New York City, Chicago, Boston, Houston, and other major urban centers.\\r\\nTheir histories are diverse. As with the new immigration from central and eastern Europe to the East Coast from the mid-19th century on, Asians started immigrating to the United States in large numbers in the 19th century. This first major wave of immigration consisted predominantly of Chinese and Japanese laborers, but also included Korean and South Asian immigrants. Many immigrants also came during and after this period from the Philippines, which was a US colony from 1898 to 1946. Exclusion laws and policies largely prohibited and curtailed Asian immigration until the 1940s. After the US changed its immigration laws during the 1940s to 1960s to make entry easier, a much larger new wave of immigration from Asia began. Today the largest self-identified Asian American sub-groups according to census data are Chinese Americans, Filipino Americans, Indian Americans, Vietnamese Americans, Korean Americans, and Japanese Americans, among other groups.[66]\\r\\nIndigenous peoples of the Americas, particularly Native Americans, made up 0.8% of the population in 2008, numbering 2.4 million.[11] An additional 2.3 million persons declared part-American Indian or Alaska Native ancestry.[67]\\r\\nThe legal and official designation of who is Native American has aroused controversy by demographers, tribal nations, and government officials for many decades. Federally recognized tribes and state recognized tribes set their own membership requirements; tribal enrollment may require residency on a reservation, documented lineal descent from recognized records, such as the Dawes Rolls, and other criteria. Some tribes have adopted the use of blood quantum, requiring members to have a certain percentage. The federal government requires individuals to certify documented blood quantum of ancestry for certain federal programs, such as education benefits, available to members of recognized tribes. But Census takers accept any respondent's identification. Genetic scientists estimated that more than 15 million other Americans, including African Americans and Hispanic Americans (specifically those of Mexican heritage), may have up to one quarter of American Indian ancestry.[citation needed]\\r\\nOnce thought to face extinction as a race or culture, Native Americans of numerous tribes have achieved revival of aspects of their cultures, together with asserting their sovereignty and direction of their own affairs since the mid-20th century. Many have started language programs to revive use of traditional languages; some have established tribally controlled colleges and other schools on their reservations, so that education is expressive of their cultures. Since the late 20th century, many tribes have developed gaming casinos on their sovereign land to raise revenues for economic development, as well as to promote the education and welfare of their people through health care and construction of improved housing.\\r\\nToday more than 800,000 to one million persons claim Cherokee descent in part or as full-bloods; of these, an estimated 300,000 live in California, 70,000160,000 in Oklahoma, and 15,000 in North Carolina in ancestral homelands.[citation needed]\\r\\nThe second largest tribal group is the Navajo, who call themselves Din and live on a 16-million acre (65,000?km2) Indian reservation covering northeast Arizona, northwest New Mexico, and southeast Utah. It is home to half of the 450,000 Navajo Nation members.[citation needed] The third largest group are the Lakota (Sioux) Nation, with distinct federally recognized tribes located in the states of Minnesota, Nebraska, Montana, Wyoming; and North and South Dakota.[citation needed]\\r\\nNative Hawaiians and other Pacific Islanders numbered 427,810 in 2008, or 0.1% of the population.[11] Additionally, nearly as many individuals identify as having partial Native Hawaiian ancestry, for a total of 829,949 people of full or part Native Hawaiian ancestry.[68] This group constitutes the smallest minority in the United States. More than half identify as \\"full-blooded\\", but historically most Native Hawaiians on the island chain of Hawaii are believed to have admixture with Asian and European ancestries.[citation needed] But, the Census takes reporting by individuals as to how they identify.\\r\\nSome demographers believe that by the year 2025, the last full-blooded Native Hawaiian will die off, leaving a culturally distinct, but racially mixed population.[citation needed] The total number of persons who have identified as Native Hawaiian in 2008 was more than the estimated Hawaiian population when the US annexed the islands in 1898.[citation needed] Native Hawaiians are receiving ancestral land reparations. Throughout Hawaii, they are working to preserve and assert adaptation of Native Hawaiian customs and the Hawaiian language. They have cultural schools solely for legally Native Hawaiian students.\\r\\nAccording to the Arab American Institute (AAI), countries of origin for Arab Americans include Algeria, Bahrain, Comoros, Djibouti, Egypt, Iraq, Jordan, Kuwait, Lebanon, Libya, Mauritania, Morocco, Oman, Qatar, Palestine, Saudi Arabia, Somalia, Sudan, Syria, Tunisia, United Arab Emirates and Yemen.[69]\\r\\nThere are an estimated 1.9-2.0 million Middle Eastern Americans according to the U.S. Census,[70] including both Arab and non-Arab Americans,[71] comprising 0.6% of the total U.S. population; however, the Arab American Institute estimates a population closer to 3.6 million.[72] U.S. Census population estimates are based on responses to the ancestry question on the census, which makes it difficult to accurately count Middle Eastern Americans.[72][73] Though Middle Eastern American communities can be found in each of the 50 states, the majority live in just 10 states with nearly \\"one third of the total liv[ing] in California, New York, and Michigan\\".[74] More Middle Eastern Americans live in California than any other state, but Middle Eastern Americans represent the highest percentage of the population of Michigan.[74] In particular, Dearborn, Michigan has long been home to a high concentration of Middle Eastern Americans.[75][76]\\r\\nThe United States Census Bureau is presently finalizing the ethnic classification of MENA populations. In 2012, prompted in part by post-9/11 discrimination, the American-Arab Anti-Discrimination Committee petitioned the Department of Commerce's Minority Business Development Agency to designate the MENA populations as a minority/disadvantaged community.[77] Following consultations with MENA organizations, the US Census Bureau announced in 2014 that it would establish a new MENA ethnic category for populations from the Middle East, North Africa and the Arab world, separate from the \\"white\\" classification that these populations had previously sought in 1909. The expert groups, including some Jewish organizations, felt that the earlier \\"white\\" designation no longer accurately represents MENA identity, so they successfully lobbied for a distinct categorization.[16][78] This process does not currently include ethnoreligious groups such as Jews or Sikhs, as the Bureau only tabulates these groups as followers of religions rather than members of ethnic groups.[79]\\r\\nAs of December 2015, the sampling strata for the new MENA category includes the Census Bureau's working classification of 19 MENA groups, as well as Turkish, Sudanese, Somali, Mauritanian, Armenian, Cypriot, Afghan, Azerbaijani and Georgian groups.[80]\\r\\nSelf-identified multiracial Americans numbered 7.0 million in 2008, or 2.3% of the population.[11] They have identified as any combination of races (White, Black or African American, Asian, American Indian or Alaska Native, Native Hawaiian or other Pacific Islander, \\"some other race\\") and ethnicities.[81] The U.S. has a growing multiracial identity movement.\\r\\nWhile the colonies and southern states protected white fathers by making all children born to slave mothers be classified as slaves, regardless of paternity, they also banned miscegenation or interracial marriage, most notably between whites and blacks. This did little to stop interracial relationships, except as legal, consensual unions.\\r\\nDemographers state that, due to new waves of immigration, the American people through the early 20th century were mostly multi-ethnic descendants of various immigrant nationalities, who maintained cultural distinctiveness until, over time, assimilation, migration and integration took place.[citation needed] The Civil Rights Movement through the 20th century gained passage of important legislation to enforce constitutional rights of minorities.\\r\\nAccording to James P. Allen and Eugene Turner from California State University, Northridge, by some calculations in the 2000 Census, the multiracial population that is part white (which is the largest percentage of the multiracial population), is as follows:\\r\\nA 2002 study found an average of 18.6% European genetic contribution and 2.7% Native American genetic contribution (with standard errors 1.5% and 1.4% respectively) in a sample of 232 African Americans. Meanwhile, in a sample of 187 European Americans from State College, Pennsylvania, there was an average of 0.7% West African genetic contribution and 3.2% Native American genetic contribution (with standard errors 0.9% and 1.6% respectively). Most of the non-European admixture was concentrated in 30% of the sample, with West African admixture ranging from 2 to 20%, with an average of 2.3%.[83]\\r\\nIn 1958 Robert Stuckert produced a statistical analysis using historical census data and immigration statistics. He concluded that the growth in the White population could not be attributed solely to births in the White population and immigration from Europe, but was also due to people identifying as white who were partly black. He concluded that 21 percent of white Americans had some recent African-American ancestors. He also concluded that the majority of Americans of known African descent were partly European and not entirely sub-Saharan African.[84]\\r\\nMore recently, many different DNA studies have shown that many African Americans have European admixture, reflecting the long history in this country of the various populations. Proportions of European admixture in African-American DNA have been found in studies to be 17?%[85] and between 10.6% and 22.5%.[86] Another recent study found the average to be 21.2%, with a standard error of 1.2%.[83]\\r\\nThe Race, Ethnicity, and Genetics Working Group of the National Human Genome Research Institute notes that \\"although genetic analyses of large numbers of loci can produce estimates of the percentage of a person's ancestors coming from various continental populations, these estimates may assume a false distinctiveness of the parental populations, since human groups have exchanged mates from local to continental scales throughout history.\\"[87]\\r\\nIn the 2000 census, the non-standard category of \\"Other\\"[3] was especially intended to capture responses such as Mestizo and Mulatto,[18] two large multiracial groups in most of the countries of origin of Hispanic and Latino Americans. However, many other responses are captured by the category.\\r\\nIn 2008 15.0 million people, nearly 5% of the total U.S. population, were estimated to be \\"some other race\\",[11] with 95% of them being Hispanic or Latino.[12]\\r\\nDue to this category's non-standard status, statistics from government agencies other than the Census Bureau (for example: the Centers for Disease Control's data on vital statistics, or the FBI's crime statistics), but also the Bureau's own official Population Estimates, omit the \\"some other race\\" category and include most of the people in this group in the white population, thus including the vast majority (about 90%) of Hispanic and Latino Americans in the white population. For an example of this, see The World Factbook, published by the Central Intelligence Agency.[88]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe ancestry of the people of the United States of America is widely varied and includes descendants of populations from around the world. In addition to its variation, the ancestry of people of the United States is also marked by varying amounts of intermarriage between ethnic and racial groups.\\r\\nWhile some Americans can trace their ancestry back to a single ethnic group or population in Europe, Africa, or Asia, these are often first- and second-generation Americans. Generally, the degree of mixed heritage increases the longer one's ancestors have lived in the United States (see melting pot).

He is considered to be the father of library science, documentation, and information science in India and is widely known throughout the rest of the world for his fundamental thinking in the field. His birthday is observed every year as the National Librarian's Day in India.[4]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nHe was a university librarian and professor of library science at Banaras Hindu University (1945ÿ47) and professor of library science at the University of Delhi (1947ÿ55). The last appointment made him director of the first Indian school of librarianship to offer higher degrees. He was president of the Indian Library Association from 1944 to 1953. In 1957 he was elected an honorary member of the International Federation for Information and Documentation (FID) and was made a vice-president for life of the Library Association of Great Britain.[5]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nRanganathan, born on 12[1] August 1892 to Ramamrita, in Siyali (at present, Sirkazhi) in British-ruled India at Tanjavoor (at present, Ubayavethanthapuram ,Thiruvarur District), Tamil Nadu.[1]\\r\\nRanganathan began his professional life as a mathematician; he earned B.A. and M.A. degrees in mathematics from Madras Christian College in his home province, and then went on to earn a teaching license. His lifelong goal was to teach mathematics, and he was successively a member of the mathematics faculties at universities in Mangalore, Coimbatore and Madras). As a mathematics professor, he published papers mainly on the history of mathematics. His career as an educator was somewhat hindered by stammering (a difficulty he gradually overcame in his professional life). The Government of India awarded Padmashri to Dr. S.R. Ranganathan in 1957 for valuable contributions to Library Science.[6]\\r\\nIn 1923, the University of Madras created the post of University Librarian to oversee their poorly organized collection. Among the 900 applicants for the position, none had any formal training in librarianship, and Ranganathan's' handful of papers satisfied the search committee's requirement that the candidate should have a research background. His sole knowledge of librarianship came from an Encyclop?dia Britannica article he read days before the interview. Ranganathan was initially reluctant to pursue the position (he had forgotten about his application by the time he was called for an interview there). To his own surprise, he received the appointment and accepted the position in January 1924.[1]\\r\\nAt first, Ranganathan found the solitude of the position was intolerable. In a matter of weeks, complaining of total boredom, he went back to the university administration to beg for his teaching position back. A deal was struck that Ranganathan would travel to London to study contemporary Western practices in librarianship, and that, if he returned and still rejected librarianship as a career, the mathematics lectureship would be his again.[7]\\r\\nRanganathan travelled to University College London, which at that time housed the only graduate degree program in library science in Britain. At University College, he earned marks only slightly above average, but his mathematical mind latched onto the problem of classification, a subject typically taught by rote in library programs of the time. As an outsider, he focused on what he perceived to be flaws with the popular decimal classification, and began to explore new possibilities on his own.[8]\\r\\nHe also devised the Acknowledgment of Duplication, which states that any system of classification of information necessarily implies at least two different classifications for any given datum. He anecdotally proved this with the Dewey Decimal Classification (DDC) by taking several books and showing how each might be classified with two totally different resultant DDC numbers.[9] For example, a book on \\"warfare in India\\" could be classified under \\"warfare\\" or \\"India\\". Even a general book on warfare could be classified under \\"warfare\\", \\"history\\",\\"social organisation\\",\\"Indian essays\\", or many other headings, depending upon the viewpoint, needs, and prejudices of the classifier. To Ranganathan, a structured, step-by-step system acknowledging each facet of the topic of the work was immensely preferable to the anarchy and \\"intellectual laziness\\" (as he termed it) of the DDC. Given the poor technology for information retrieval available at that time, the implementation of this concept was a tremendous step forwards for the science of information retrieval. The system remains useful even into the modern times.\\r\\nHe began drafting the system that was ultimately to become colon classification while in England, and refined it as he returned home, even going so far as to reorder the ship's library on the voyage back to India. He initially got the idea for the system from seeing a set of Meccano in a toy store in London. Ranganathan returned with great interest for libraries and librarianship and a vision of its importance for the Indian nation. He returned to and held the position of University Librarian at the University of Madras for twenty years. During that time, he helped to found the Madras Library Association, and lobbied actively for the establishment of free public libraries throughout India and for the creation of a comprehensive national library.[9]\\r\\nRanganathan was considered by many to be a workaholic. During his two decades in Madras, he consistently worked 13-hour days, seven days a week, without taking a vacation for the entire time. Although he married in November 1928, he returned to work the afternoon following the marriage ceremony. A few years later, he and his wife Sarada had a son. The couple remained married until Ranganathan's death.\\r\\nThe first few years of Ranganathan's tenure at Madras were years of deliberation and analysis as he addressed the problems of library administration and classification.[10] It was during this period that he produced what have come to be known as his two greatest legacies: his five laws of library science (1931) and the colon classification system (1933).[11]\\r\\nRegarding the political climate at the time, Ranganathan took his position at the University of Madras in 1924. Gandhi had been imprisoned in 1922 and was released around the time that Ranganathan was taking that job. Ranganathan sought to institute massive changes to the library system and to write about such things as open access and education for all which essentially had the potential to enable the masses and encourage civil discourse (and disobedience). Although there's no evidence that Ranganathan did any of this for political reasons, his changes to the library had the result of educating more people, making information available to all, and even aiding women and minorities in the information-seeking process.\\r\\nThe Northern Ireland crisis got an unexpected metaphorical reference in a book by S. R. Ranganathan, as \\"making an Ulster of the ... law of parsimony\\", complaining about the harmful effects of low budget on the good functioning of a library.\\r\\nAfter two decades of serving as librarian at Madras?ÿ a post he had intended to keep until his retirement, Ranganathan retired from his position after conflicts with a new university vice-chancellor became intolerable. At the age of 54, he submitted his resignation and, after a brief bout with depression, accepted a professorship in library science at Banaras Hindu University in Varanasi, his last formal academic position, in August 1945. There, he catalogued the university's collection; by the time he left four years later, he had classified over 100,000 items personally.\\r\\nRanganathan headed the Indian Library Association from 1944 to 1953, but was never a particularly adept administrator, and left amid controversy when the Delhi Public Library chose to use the Dewey Decimal Classification system instead of his own Colon Classification. He held an honorary professorship at Delhi University from 1949 to 1955 and helped build that institution's library science programs with S. Dasgupta, a former student of his.[7] In 1951, Ranganathan released an album on Folkways Records entitled, Readings from the Ramayana: In Sanskrit Bhagavad Gita.\\r\\nRanganathan briefly moved to Zurich, Switzerland, from 1955 to 1957, when his son married a European woman; the unorthodox relationship did not sit well with Ranganathan, although his time in Zurich allowed him to expand his contacts within the European library community, where he gained a significant following. However, he soon returned to India and settled in the city of Bangalore, where he would spend the rest of his life. While in Zurich, though, he endowed a professorship at Madras University in honour of his wife of thirty years, largely as an ironic gesture in retaliation for the persecution he suffered for many years at the hands of that university's administration.\\r\\nRanganathan's final major achievement was the establishment of the Documentation Research and Training Centre as a department and research center in the Indian Statistical Institute in Bangalore in 1962, where he served as honorary director for five years. In 1965, the Indian government honoured him for his contributions to the field with a rare title of \\"National Research Professor.\\"\\r\\nIn the final years of his life, Ranganathan finally succumbed to ill health, and was largely confined to his bed. On 27 September 1972, he died of complications from bronchitis.[12]\\r\\nUpon the 1992 centenary of his birth, several biographical volumes and collections of essays on Ranganathan's influence were published in his honour. Ranganathan's autobiography, published serially during his life, is titled A Librarian Looks Back.","input":"Who is the father of indian library movement?"},{"output":"more than 5,643 structures","context":"The Tubbs Fire was the most destructive wildfire in California history,[3] burning parts of Napa, Sonoma, and Lake counties in Northern California during October 2017, and affecting the city of Santa Rosa, California the most. It was one of more than a dozen large fires that broke out in early October and were simultaneously burning in eight Northern California counties in what was called the \\"Northern California firestorm.\\"[5] By the time of its containment on October 31, the fire was estimated to have burned 36,810 acres (149?km2),[6][7] and at least 22 people had been killed in Sonoma County by the fire.[8]\\r\\nThe fire incinerated more than 5,643 structures,[3][4][9] including more than 2,800 homes in the city of Santa Rosa.[10] In that city,?the damage was estimated at $1.2 billion, with five percent of the city's housing stock destroyed.[2]\\r\\nThe Tubbs Fire started near Tubbs Lane, named after Alfred Tubbs, the owner of a winery in that area in 1882. The Tubbs mansion had burned down in the Hanley Fire in 1964.[11]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Tubbs Fire started near Tubbs Lane in Calistoga[12] around 9:43 p.m. on Sunday, October 8.[13] Although the cause of the fire remains under investigation, Sonoma County emergency dispatchers sent fire crews to at least 10 reports of downed power lines and exploding transformers as the North Bay fires, including the Tubbs fire, began. At a weather station in north Santa Rosa, the peak wind gusts at 9:29 p.m. hit 30 mph; an hour later, they were 41 mph.[14]\\r\\nPushed by strong winds from the northeast, the front of the fire moved more than twelve miles in its first three hours.[13] The Mark West Springs area, north of Santa Rosa in unincorporated Sonoma County, was directly in the path of the fire. One exception to the destruction in that area was that all of the more than 1,000 animals at the renowned Safari West Wildlife Preserve were unharmed by the fire, saved by owner Peter Lang, who, at age 76, single-handedly fought back the flames for more than 10 hours using only garden hoses.[15][16]\\r\\nSonoma County officials could have sent out an emergency alert to every cellphone in the region on Sunday night as the fire grew, but chose not to, saying such a widespread alarm would have hampered emergency efforts. Instead, Nixle SMS and email alerts were broadcast  the first of these text messages going out at 10:51 p.m., and used a system called SoCo Alerts to notify people via cellphone; both are limited to those who sign up for these services. Officials also used a reverse 911 system that called landlines in certain areas.[17] At 11:58 p.m., firefighters called for an evacuation order encompassing the area between the city of Calistoga and Santa Rosa. [18]\\r\\nBy 1 a.m. on Monday, the fire, spreading quickly to the south and west, had reached Santa Rosa city limits.[13] The front entered the city from the north,[19] moving into the Fountaingrove area, then moving down ravines between Mark West Springs Road and Fountaingrove Parkway.[20] Hundreds of homes and many other structures were destroyed, with tens of thousands of people evacuating with very little notice.[21] The historic Fountaingrove Inn, the Fountaingrove Round Barn nearby, and a large Hilton hotel were destroyed.[22][23] Nearly all of the 160 units at the Journey's End mobile home park were turned to rubble.[24]\\r\\nAt about 1:30 a.m., Sonoma County officials began to evacuate neighborhoods in and around Santa Rosa.[20]\\r\\nBy about 2 a.m., the fire, carried by near hurricane-level winds,[20] had spread further to the west, crossing Highway 101.[12] By 4:30 a.m., the winds had reached their peak speed of more than 60 miles per hour.[13]\\r\\nEarly Monday morning, the fire reached the Coffey Park neighborhood, where it leveled much of the area.[25][26] An estimated 1,300 structures, mostly detached homes, were destroyed.[27] Other damage along several streets bordering Highway 101 included a Kmart store and numerous restaurants that burned to the ground.[24][28]\\r\\nBy noon on Monday, two medical centers in Santa Rosa, Kaiser Permanente and Sutter Health, had been evacuated.[29] Some Kaiser employees reportedly used their personal vehicles to evacuate some of the 130 patients at that hospital.[30]\\r\\nOther notable damage on Monday included the complete loss of a senior living complex, Oakmont of Villa Capri; Hidden Valley Satellite, a primary school; and the Santa Rosa portion of Paradise Ridge Winery.[28] The Cardinal Newman High School campus was badly damaged, as was one end of the Luther Burbank Center for the Performing Arts.[28] Redwood Adventist Academy was also destroyed in the fire. [31] Another large concentration of incinerated homes was in the Larkfield-Wikiup area, about a mile north of the city, where about 500 buildings were destroyed.[9]\\r\\nOf the 2,900 homes destroyed in Santa Rosa, over 200 of them belonged to doctors associated with the area hospitals, including Kaiser Permanente, Sutter Hospital's Santa Rosa Center, and Santa Rosa Memorial Hospital. [32] Additionally, the fire destroyed Santa Rosa Community Health's Vista Campus, the largest in its system, which served 24,000 people annually. [33]\\r\\nPacific Gas and Electric Company cut off natural gas to 31,000 customers in the Santa Rosa and Windsor areas as a precaution.[34]\\r\\nWind direction turned clockwise from northeasterly to southerly (compare MODIS satellite images). At a town hall meeting on the evening of October 10 in Santa Rosa, Cal Fire representatives reported that there could be as many as 3,000 structures lost to the Tubbs and Atlas fires. [35][36]\\r\\nOn Wednesday, October 11, the entire town of Calistoga was evacuated[37]; about 2,000 people were asked to leave.[38] The escape for some was along roads walled by flames.[39] The Lake County Sheriffs Office issued an advisory evacuation notice for residents in the Middletown area, to the north of Calistoga.[40]\\r\\nOne active part of the fire was east of the town of Windsor, with the fire burning from Shiloh ridge to Chalk Hill Road and Knights Valley.[39]\\r\\nAs of 7 a.m. on Thursday, the Tubbs Fire had burned 34,270 acres, and was 10 percent contained.[41] In the city of Santa Rosa, officials said that the fire had destroyed an estimated 2,834 homes, along with about 400,000 square feet of commercial space.[10]\\r\\nAs of Thursday morning, efforts continued to be focused on two areas:\\r\\nAmong the losses reported on Thursday was the destruction of the Santa Rosa hillside home of late Peanuts creator Charles Schulz; his widow, Jean Schulz, escaped unhurt.[41][42] By Thursday evening, 28,000 customers in the Santa Rosa and Windsor areas still had not had their gas service restored.[34]\\r\\nOn Friday morning, October 13, the fire was 25 percent contained.[44] It remained about two miles outside of Calistoga's city limits.[45]\\r\\nA fire erupted in the hills east of Oakmont late Friday night, prompting the mandatory evacuation of neighborhoods early Saturday morning from Calistoga Road to Adobe Canyon Road, along Highway 12. The zone included several schools and the Oakmont Village retirement neighborhood. Evacuations for the area were lifted by late the following Wednesday.\\r\\nBy Saturday morning, October 14, the fire was 44 percent contained.[46] A \\"small army of firefighters and police\\" was positioned between where the fire was most active, north of Calistoga, and the city itself.[47]\\r\\nIn the Fountaingrove area of Santa Rosa, firefighters and utility crews combed through the ruins left by the fire. Fire officials searched for dangerous hot spots that could re-ignite the blaze, and utility workers began cleaning up the demolished neighborhoods.[48]\\r\\nIn 1964, the Hanly Fire, the largest fire in Sonoma County history, burned 52,700 acres, with striking similarities to the Tubbs Fire.[69] The two fires differed, however, because since 1964, hundreds of expensive homes, a golf course and clubhouse restaurant, office and medical buildings, light industry, lakeside retirement homes, a long row of nursing facilities, and two hotels were built in the Fountaingrove area, which had been almost entirely open land in 1964.[70]\\r\\nThe path the Hanly Fire took in 1964, as well as the areas it burned, were very similar to the Tubbs Fire: from Calistoga, along Porter Creek and Mark West Springs roads into Sonoma County, burning homes along Mark West Springs and Riebli roads, through Wikiup, and to Mendocino Avenue, where it stopped, across the street from Journeys End Trailer Park.[71] The fire was propelled by 70 mph winds, close to hurricane strength; it initially went east from Calistoga, but on the third day its direction switched, going south-west from Calistoga to Santa Rosa in only about half a day.[69] But the fire only destroyed a few dozen homes, because the area it burned was so sparsely settled in 1964.[72]\\r\\nSonoma County has four \\"historic wildfire corridors,\\"[73] including the Hanly Fire area. New homes in the fire zones must meet building code requirements for fire-resistant materials for siding, roofing and decks, with protected eaves to keep out windblown embers.[69] Those measures made little difference. For example, despite a 100-foot fire break that ringed much of the Fountaingrove II subdivision, which consisted of 600 upscale homes in the same path as the Hanly Fire,[74] virtually the entire subdivision was destroyed by the Tubbs Fire.[75][76]\\r\\nThe fire was covered extensively and in-depth by news outlets from around the San Francisco Bay Area and beyond. In addition to local coverage, CNN and Fox News were on scene in Sonoma County, focusing primarily on northern Santa Rosa, California.[77][78] The majority of communication regarding the fire came from social media websites such as Twitter, Facebook, Snapchat and Nixle.[79]\\r\\nFrom October 9 through 13, Snapchat ran a geolocation tagging filter to isolate material about the fire, and these posts were featured on the Discover page.[80] By October 11, over 12,000 videos and images had been uploaded to Snapchat.[81] Donald Laird, a professor at Santa Rosa Junior College, and Richard Dunn, a local photographer, submitted featured posts. [82]\\r\\nOn social media sites such as Twitter and Facebook, hashtags used to identify information about the fire included #santarosafire, #tubbsfire, and #santarosastrong.[83]\\r\\nTwitter analytics revealed that the majority of tweets about the Tubbs Fire were posted on October 11.[84]","input":"How many structures burned in the santa rosa fire?"},{"output":"the time from the moment the customer places an order (the moment the supplier learns of the requirement) to the moment it is ready for delivery","context":"A lead time is the latency between the initiation and execution of a process. For example, the lead time between the placement of an order and delivery of a new car from a manufacturer may be anywhere from 2 weeks to 6 months. In industry, lead time reduction is an important part of lean manufacturing and lean construction.[1]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nLead time in publishing describes the amount of time that a journalist has between receiving a writing assignment and submitting the completed piece. Depending on the publication, lead times can be anything from a couple of hours to many months/years.\\r\\nLead time (when referring to a disease) is the length of time between detection of a disease through screening and the moment in time where it would have normally presented with symptoms and led to a diagnosis. An example of this is seen with breast cancer population screening, where women who are asymptomatic have a positive test result with mammography, whereas the underlying disease would have taken many more years to manifest.\\r\\nA more conventional definition of lead time in the supply chain management realm is the time from the moment the customer places an order (the moment the supplier learns of the requirement) to the moment it is ready for delivery. In the absence of finished goods or intermediate (work in progress) inventory, it is the time it takes to actually manufacture the order without any inventory other than raw materials. The Chartered Institute of Procurement & Supply identifies \\"total lead time\\" as a combination of \\"internal lead time\\" (the time required for the buying organisation's internal processes to progress from identification of a need to the issue of a purchase order) and \\"external lead time\\" (the time required for the supplying organisation's processes, including any development required, manufacture, despatch and delivery).[2]\\r\\nIn the manufacturing environment, lead time has the same definition as that of Supply Chain Management, but it includes the time required to ship the parts from the supplier. The shipping time is included because the manufacturing company needs to know when the parts will be available for material requirements planning. It is also possible for lead time to include the time it takes for a company to process and have the part ready for manufacturing once it has been received. The time it takes a company to unload a product from a truck, inspect it, and move it into storage is non-trivial. With tight manufacturing constraints or when a company is using Just In Time manufacturing it is important for supply chain to know how long their own internal processes take.\\r\\nLead time is made of:[3]\\r\\nExample\\r\\nCompany A needs a part that can be manufactured in two days once Company B has received an order. It takes three days for company A to receive the part once shipped, and one additional day before the part is ready to go into manufacturing.\\r\\nIn more detail\\r\\nLead Time terminology has been defined in greater detail.[4] The Supply Chain from customer order received to the moment the order is delivered is divided into five lead times.\\r\\nExample\\r\\nA restaurant opens up and a customer walks in. A waiter guides him to a table, gives him the menu and asks what he would like to order. The customer selects a dish and the waiter writes it in his notepad. At that moment the customer has made an order which the restaurant has accepted ÿ Order Lead Time and Order Handling Time have begun. Now the waiter marks the order in the cash register, rips the paper from the notepad, takes it into the kitchen and puts into the order queue. The order has been handled and is waiting in the factory (kitchen) for manufacturing. As there are no other customers, the waiter decides to stand outside the kitchen, by the door, waiting for the dish to be prepared and begins calculating Manufacturing Lead Time.\\r\\nMeanwhile, the chef finishes what he was doing, takes the order from the queue, starts his clock as a mark for the start of Production Lead Time and begins cooking. The chef chops the vegetables, fries the meat and boils the pasta. When the dish is ready, the chef rings a bell and stops his clock. At the same time the waiter stops calculating Manufacturing Lead Time and rushes through the kitchen door to get the food while it is hot.\\r\\nWhen he picks it up, begins counting of Delivery Lead Time that ends when the dish is served to the customer, who can now happily say that the Order Lead Time was shorter than he had expected.\\r\\nWhen talking about Order Lead Time (OLT) it is important to differentiate the definitions that may exist around this concept. Although they look similar there are differences between them that help the industry to model the order behavior of their customers. The four definitions are?:\\r\\nThe OLTRequested will be determined by the difference between the date the customer wants the material in his facilities (wish date) and the date when they provided its order to the supplier.\\r\\nThe OLTQuote will be determined by the difference between the date the customer agree to receive the material in their facilities (Quote date) and the date when the order is provided to the supplier.\\r\\nThe OLTActual will be determined by the difference between the day the provider deliver the material (Delivery date) and the date when they enter the order in the system.\\r\\nThe OLTConfirmed will be determined by the difference between the date the confirmed date by the provider to deliver the material in the customer facilities (Confirmed date) and the date when they provide the order to the supplier.\\r\\nThe Average OLT based on Volume (OLTV) is the addition of all the multiplications between the volume of product we deliver (quantity) and the OLT divided by the total quantity delivered in the period of time we are studying for that specific facility.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nO\\r\\nL\\r\\nT\\r\\nV\\r\\n=\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nh\\r\\n\\r\\nj\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nQ\\r\\nu\\r\\na\\r\\nn\\r\\nt\\r\\ni\\r\\nt\\r\\n\\r\\ny\\r\\n\\r\\nj\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n?\\r\\nO\\r\\nL\\r\\n\\r\\nT\\r\\n\\r\\nj\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nT\\r\\no\\r\\nt\\r\\na\\r\\nl\\r\\nQ\\r\\nu\\r\\na\\r\\nn\\r\\nt\\r\\ni\\r\\nt\\r\\ny\\r\\nD\\r\\ne\\r\\nl\\r\\ni\\r\\nv\\r\\ne\\r\\nr\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n{\\\\displaystyle OLTV={\\\\frac {\\\\sum _{j}{Quantity_{j}\\\\cdot OLT_{j}}}{_{TotalQuantityDeliver}}}\\\\,}\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nBy doing this the company will be able to find a relation of volume weighted between the quantities of material required for an order and the time requested to accomplish it. The volume metric could be applied to the 4 types of OLT.\\r\\nThe figure obtained from this calculation will be the average time (e.g. in days) between order placing and the requested delivery date of a specific customer under consideration of the average quantities ordered during that particular time.\\r\\nThe correct analysis of OLT will give the company:\\r\\nIn project management lead time is the time it takes to complete a task or a set of interdependent tasks.

In the Book of Ezekiel, Gabriel is understood to be the angel that was sent to destroy Jerusalem. According to the Jewish Encyclopedia, Gabriel takes the form of a man, and stands at the left hand of God.[8] Shimon ben Lakish (Syria Palaestina, 3rd century) concluded that the angelic names of Michael, Raphael, and Gabriel came out of the Babylonian exile (Gen. Rab. 48:9).[9] Alongside archangel Michael, Gabriel is described as the guardian angel of Israel, defending this people against the angels of the other nations.[10]\\r\\nIn Kabbalah, Gabriel is identified with the sephirot of Yesod. Gabriel also has a prominent role as one of God's archangels in the Kabbalah literature. There, Gabriel is portrayed as working in concert with Michael as part of God's court. Gabriel is not to be prayed to because only God can answer prayers and sends Gabriel as his agent.[8]\\r\\nAccording to Jewish mythology, in the Garden of Eden there is a tree of life or the \\"tree of souls\\"[11] that blossoms and produces new souls, which fall into the Guf, the Treasury of Souls.

Then Lailah, the Angel of Conception, watches over the embryo until it is born.[12]\\r\\nThe intertestamental period (roughly 200 BCE ÿ 50 CE) produced a wealth of literature, much of it having an apocalyptic orientation. The names and ranks of angels and devils were greatly expanded, and each had particular duties and status before God.\\r\\nIn 1 Enoch 9:1ÿ3, Gabriel, along with Michael, Uriel and Suriel, \\"saw much blood being shed upon the earth\\" (9:1) and heard the souls of men cry, \\"Bring our cause before the Most High.\\" (9:3) In 1 Enoch 10:1, the reply came from \\"the Most High, the Holy and Great One\\" who sent forth agents, including Gabriel\\r\\nAnd the Lord said to Gabriel: \\"'Proceed against the bastards and the reprobates, and against the children of fornication: and destroy [the children of fornication and] the children of the Watchers from amongst men [and cause them to go forth]: send them one against the other that they may destroy each other in battle: for length of days shall they not have.\\" 1?Enoch?10:9\\r\\nGabriel is the fifth of the five angels who keep watch: \\"Gabriel, one of the holy angels, who is over Paradise and the serpents and the Cherubim.\\" (1 Enoch 20:7)\\r\\nWhen Enoch asked who the four figures were that he had seen: \\"And he said to me: 'This first is Michael, the merciful and long-suffering: and the second, who is set over all the diseases and all the wounds of the children of men, is Raphael: and the third, who is set over all the powers, is Gabriel: and the fourth, who is set over the repentance unto hope of those who inherit eternal life, is named Phanuel.' And these are the four angels of the Lord of Spirits and the four voices I heard in those days.\\" (Enoch 40:9)\\r\\nFirst, concerning John the Baptist, an angel appeared to his father Zacharias, a priest of the course of Abia, (Luke 1:5-7) whose barren wife Elisabeth was of the daughters of Aaron, while he ministered in the temple:\\r\\nLuke 1:10 And the whole multitude of the people were praying without at the time of incense.\\r\\n11 And there appeared unto him an angel of the Lord standing on the right side of the altar of incense.\\r\\n12 And when Zacharias saw him, he was troubled, and fear fell upon him.\\r\\n13 But the angel said unto him, Fear not, Zacharias: for thy prayer is heard; and thy wife Elisabeth shall bear thee a son, and thou shalt call his name John.\\r\\n14 And thou shalt have joy and gladness; and many shall rejoice at his birth.\\r\\n15 For he shall be great in the sight of the Lord, and shall drink neither wine nor strong drink; and he shall be filled with the Holy Ghost, even from his mother's womb.\\r\\n16 And many of the children of Israel shall he turn to the Lord their God.\\r\\n17 And he shall go before him in the spirit and power of Elias, to turn the hearts of the fathers to the children, and the disobedient to the wisdom of the just; to make ready a people prepared for the Lord.\\r\\n18 And Zacharias said unto the angel, Whereby shall I know this? for I am an old man, and my wife well stricken in years.\\r\\n19 And the angel answering said unto him, I am Gabriel, that stand in the presence of God; and am sent to speak unto thee, and to shew thee these glad tidings.\\r\\n20 And, behold, thou shalt be dumb, and not able to speak, until the day that these things shall be performed, because thou believest not my words, which shall be fulfilled in their season.\\r\\n(Luke 1:10-20 KJV) (other versions: Luke 1:1-25)\\r\\nAfter completing his week[13] of ministry, Zacharias returned to his house (in Hebron)[14] and his wife Elizabeth conceived. After she completed \\"five months\\" (Luke 1:21-25) of her pregnancy, Gabriel is mentioned again:\\r\\nLuke 1:26 ? And in the sixth month the angel Gabriel was sent from God unto a city of Galilee, named Nazareth,\\r\\n27 To a virgin espoused to a man whose name was Joseph, of the house of David; and the virgin's name was Mary.\\r\\n28 And the angel came in unto her, and said, Hail, thou that art highly favoured, the Lord is with thee: blessed art thou among women.\\r\\n29 And when she saw him, she was troubled at his saying, and cast in her mind what manner of salutation this should be.\\r\\n30 And the angel said unto her, Fear not, Mary: for thou hast found favour with God.\\r\\n31 And, behold, thou shalt conceive in thy womb, and bring forth a son, and shalt call his name JESUS.\\r\\n32 He shall be great, and shall be called the Son of the Highest: and the Lord God shall give unto him the throne of his father David:\\r\\n33 And he shall reign over the house of Jacob for ever; and of his kingdom there shall be no end.\\r\\n34 Then said Mary unto the angel, How shall this be, seeing I know not a man?\\r\\n35 And the angel answered and said unto her, The Holy Ghost shall come upon thee, and the power of the Highest shall overshadow thee: therefore also that holy thing which shall be born of thee shall be called the Son of God.\\r\\n36 And, behold, thy cousin Elisabeth, she hath also conceived a son in her old age: and this is the sixth month with her, who was called barren.\\r\\n37 For with God nothing shall be impossible.\\r\\n38 And Mary said, Behold the handmaid of the Lord; be it unto me according to thy word. And the angel departed from her.\\r\\n(Luke 1:26-38 KJV) (other versions: Luke 1:26-38)\\r\\nGabriel only appears by name in those two passages in Luke. In the first passage the angel identified himself as Gabriel, but in the second it is Luke who identified him as Gabriel. The only other named angels in the New Testament are Michael the Archangel (in Jude 1:9) and Abaddon (in Revelation 9:11) . Gabriel is not called an archangel in the Bible. Believers are expressly warned not to worship angels (in Colossians 2:18-19 and Revelation 19:10).[15]\\r\\nThe trope of Gabriel blowing a trumpet blast to indicate the Lord's return to Earth is especially familiar in Negro spirituals. However, though the Bible mentions a trumpet blast preceding the resurrection of the dead, it never specifies Gabriel as the trumpeter. Different passages state different things: the angels of the Son of Man (Matthew 24:31); the voice of the Son of God (John 5:25-29); God's trumpet (I Thessalonians 4:16); seven angels sounding a series of blasts (Revelation 8-11); or simply \\"a trumpet will sound\\" (I Corinthians 15:52).[16]\\r\\nIn related traditions, Gabriel is again not identified as the trumpeter. In Judaism, trumpets are prominent, and they seem to be blown by God himself, or sometimes Michael. In Zoroastrianism, there is no trumpeter at the last judgement. In Islamic tradition, it is Israfil who blows the trumpet, though he is not named in the Qur'an. The Christian Church Fathers do not mention Gabriel as the trumpeter; early English literature similarly does not.[16]\\r\\nThe earliest known identification of Gabriel as the trumpeter comes in John Wycliffe's 1382 tract, De Ecclesi? Dominio.[17] In the year 1455, in Armenian art, there is an illustration in an Armenian manuscript showing Gabriel sounding his trumpet as the dead climb out of their graves.[18] Two centuries later, Gabriel is identified as the trumpeter, in John Milton's Paradise Lost (1667):[16][19]\\r\\nBetwixt these rockie pillars Gabriel sat\\r\\nChief of the Angelic guards (IV.545f)...\\r\\nHe ended, and the Son gave signal high\\r\\nTo the bright minister that watch'd, he blew\\r\\nHis trumpet, heard in Oreb since perhaps\\r\\nWhen God descended, and perhaps once more\\r\\nTo sound at general doom. (XI.72ff).\\r\\nLater, Gabriel's horn is omnipresent in Negro spirituals, but it is unclear how the Byzantine conception inspired Milton and the spirituals, though they presumably have a common source.[16]\\r\\nGabriel's horn also makes an appearance in The Eyes of Texas (1903) where it signifies the rapture.[20]\\r\\nIn Marc Connelly's play based on spirituals, The Green Pastures (1930), Gabriel has his beloved trumpet constantly with him, and the Lord has to warn him not to blow it too soon.[16] Four years later \\"Blow, Gabriel, Blow\\" was introduced by Ethel Merman in Cole Porter's Anything Goes (1934).\\r\\nSaint Gabriel Archangel's festivity day was exclusively celebrated the 18th of March as of many sources dating between the years 1588 and 1921, except for a source published in 1856,[21] where the feast was celebrated on April 7th for unknown reasons (a parentheses notes that the day is normally celebrated on March 18). Writer Elizabeth Drayson mentions the feast being celebrated in March 18 the year of 1588 in her 2013 book: \\"The Lead Books of Granada\\". Drayson, Elizabeth (January 13, 2016).

Browne and Nolan, 1886. 1886. p.?1112.? There is a painting from 1886 by the Italian artist Diodore Rahoult, the 18th of March appears on the painting as well.[22]\\r\\nThe feast of Saint Gabriel was included for the first time in the General Roman Calendar in 1921, for celebration on March 24.[citation needed] It is unknown whether this was a temporary change, however there is no recent mention of the feast commemoration between the years 1921 and 1969. In 1969 the day was officially transferred to September 29 for celebration in conjunction with the feast of St. Michael and St. Raphael.[23] The Church of England has also adopted the September 29 date, known as Michaelmas.\\r\\nThe Eastern Orthodox Church and those Eastern Catholic Churches which follow the Byzantine Rite celebrate his feast day on November 8 (for those churches that follow the traditional Julian Calendar, November 8 currently falls on November 21 of the modern Gregorian Calendar, a difference of 13 days). Eastern Orthodox commemorate him, not only on his November feast, but also on two other days: March 26 is the \\"Synaxis of the Archangel Gabriel\\" and celebrates his role in the Annunciation.\\r\\nJuly 13 is also known as the \\"Synaxis of the Archangel Gabriel\\", and celebrates all the appearances and miracles attributed to Gabriel throughout history. The feast was first established on Mount Athos when, in the 9th century, during the reign of Emperor Basil II and the Empress Constantina Porphyrogenitus and while Nicholas Chrysoverges was Patriarch of Constantinople, the Archangel appeared in a cell[24] near Karyes, where he wrote with his finger on a stone tablet the hymn to the Theotokos, \\"It is truly meet...\\".[25]\\r\\nThe Coptic Orthodox Church celebrates his feast on Paoni 13[26], Koiak 22 and Paoni 26.[27]\\r\\nThe Ethiopian Church celebrates his feast on December 28, with a sizeable number of its believers making a pilgrimage to a church dedicated to \\"Saint Gabriel\\" in Kulubi on that day.[28]\\r\\nAdditionally, Gabriel is the patron saint of messengers, those who work for broadcasting and telecommunications such as radio and television, remote sensing[citation needed], postal workers, clerics, diplomats, and stamp collectors.[5]\\r\\nIn Latter-day Saint theology, Gabriel is believed to have lived a mortal life as the prophet Noah. The two are regarded as the same individual; Noah being his mortal name and Gabriel being his heavenly name.[29]\\r\\nGabriel (Arabic: ?????, Jibrؐl or ??????? Jibr?ؐl)[30] is venerated as an archangel and as the Angel of Revelation in Islam. As the Bible portrays Gabriel as a celestial messenger sent to Daniel,[31] Mary,[32] and Zechariah,[33] so too Islamic tradition holds that Gabriel was sent to numerous pre-Islamic prophets with revelation and divine injunctions, including Adam, whom Muslims believe was consoled by Gabriel some time after the Fall.[34]\\r\\nAccording to Muslim belief, God revealed the Quran to the Islamic prophet Muhammad through the angel Gabriel,[34] and the fifty-third chapter of the text describes the angel without naming him, in a passage that Islamic commentators have unanimously interpreted as referring to Gabriel. The passage in question, 53:4-11, reads:\\r\\nThis is naught but a revelation revealed,\\r\\ntaught him by one mighty in power,\\r\\nvery strong; he stood poised\\r\\nbeing on the higher horizon,\\r\\nthen drew near and suspended hung,\\r\\ntwo bows'-length away, or nearer,\\r\\nthen revealed to His servant that he revealed.\\r\\nGabriel is also named numerous times in the Qur'an (2:97 and 66:4 for example). In 2:92-96, the Quran mentions Gabriel along with Michael, who is also venerated as an exalted angel in Islam. In Muslim tradition, Gabriel is considered one of the primary archangels. Exegesis narrates that Muhammad saw Gabriel in his full angelic splendor only twice, the first time being when he received his first revelation.[35]\\r\\nMuslims also revere Gabriel for a number of historical events predating the first revelation. Muslims believe that Gabriel was the angel who informed Zachariah of John's birth as well as Mary of the future nativity of Jesus,[36] and that Gabriel was one of three angels who had earlier informed Abraham of the birth of Isaac.[37] All of these events can be found also in the Quran. Gabriel also makes a famous appearance in the Hadith of Gabriel, where he questions Muhammad on the core tenets of Islam.\\r\\nThe Bah' Faith sees Gabriel as a messenger of God who delivered messages to Muhammad. He is mentioned in the Kitb-i-qn, the primary theological work of the Baha'i religion.[38]\\r\\nAngels are described as pure spirits. [39][40] The lack of a defined form allows artists wide latitude in depicting them.[41] Amelia R. Brown draws comparisons in Byzantine iconography between portrayals of angels and the conventions used to depict court eunuchs. Mainly from the Caucasus, they tended to have light eyes, hair, and skin; and those \\"castrated in childhood developed a distinctive skeletal structure, lacked full masculine musculature, body hair and beards....\\" As officials, they would wear a white tunic decorated with gold. Brown suggests that \\"Byzantine artists drew, consciously or not, on this iconography of the court eunuch\\".[42] Some recent popular works on angels consider Gabriel to be female or androgynous.[43][44]\\r\\nArchangel Gabriel Millennium Monument at Heroes' Square in Budapest\\r\\nArchangel Gabriel in the church of St. Georg in Bermatingen\\r\\nArchangel Gabriel in the church of St. Magnus in Waldburg\\r\\nArchangel Gabriel at the facade of the Cathedral of Reims\\r\\nArchangel Gabriel at the Liberty square, Budapest\\r\\nThe eccentric English hagiographer and antiquarian, Sabine Baring-Gould (1834ÿ1924), wrote the English lyrics to Gabriel's Message, which he translated from the Basque Christmas carol Birjina gaztetto bat zegoen, which was probably related to the 13th or 14th-century Latin chant Angelus Ad Virginem, which itself is based on the biblical account of the Annunciation in the Gospel of Luke. In Creed's song, \\"My Own Prison\\", Gabriel is mentioned deciphering the visions to the main character in the song. \\"Sugar Baby\\", the last track on Bob Dylan's Love and Theft album, contains this reference: \\"Just as sure as we're living, just as sure as we're born/ Look up, look up - seek your Maker - 'fore Gabriel blows his horn.\\"\\r\\nSee also Gabriel gallery in Commons\\r\\nDaniel 8:15 describes Gabriel as appearing in the \\"likeness of man\\" and in Daniel 9:21 he is referred to as \\"the man Gabriel.\\" David Everson observes that \\"such anthropomorphic descriptions of an angel are consistent with previous ... descriptions of angels,\\" as in Genesis 19:5.[9]\\r\\nGabriel is most often portrayed in the context of scenes of the Annunciation. In 2008 a 16th-century drawing by Lucas van Leyden of the Netherlands was discovered. George R. Goldner, chairman of the department of prints and drawings at New York's Metropolitan Museum of Art, suggests that the sketch was for a stained glass window. \\"The fact that the archangel is an ordinary-looking person and not an idealized boy is typical of the artist\\", said Goldner.[50]\\r\\nIn chronological order (to see each item, follow the link in the footnote):[51]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n,","input":"What does the angel gabriel's name mean?"},{"output":"34 goals","context":"","input":"How many goals have messi scored for barcelona?"},{"output":"Dr. Maikanti Baru","context":"The Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC) is the oil corporation through which the federal government of Nigeria regulates and participates in the country's petroleum industry.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nNNPC was established on 1 April 1977 as a merger of the Nigerian National Oil Corporation and the Federal Ministry of Mines and Steel. NNPC by law manages the joint venture between the Nigerian federal government and a number of foreign multinational corporations, which include Royal Dutch Shell, Agip, ExxonMobil, Chevron, and Texaco (now merged with Chevron). Through collaboration with these companies, the Nigerian government conducts petroleum exploration and production. In 2007, the head of the Nigerian wing of Transparency International said salaries for NNPC workers were too low to prevent graft.[1]\\r\\nThe NNPC Towers in Abuja is the headquarters of NNPC.

The subsidiary companies include: Nigerian Petroleum Development Company(NPDC).\\r\\nAccording to the Nigerian constitution, all minerals, gas, and oil the country possesses are legally the property of the Nigerian federal government. As such, the oil corporations operating in Nigeria appropriate portions of their revenue to the government, which accrues nearly 60% of the revenue generated by the oil industry in this manner. The revenue gained by the NNPC accounts for 76% of federal government revenue[1] and 40% of the entire country's GDP. As of 2000, oil and gas exports account for 98% of Nigerian export earnings.[citation needed]\\r\\nIn December 2011, the Nigerian government permitted a forensic report conducted by KPMG to be published. The audit, commissioned by the Ministry of Finance following concerns over the NNPC's transparency, detailed the NNPC's sharp business practices, violation of regulations, illegal deductions of funds belonging to the state, and failure to account for several billions of naira that should go to the federation account.[2]\\r\\nAuditors found that between 2007 and 2009 alone, the NNPC over-deducted funds in subsidy claims to the tune of N28.5?billion. It has not been able to account for the sum ever since.[3]\\r\\nIn May 2008, Willbros Group Inc, a US company, admitted to making corrupt payments totalling over $6.3?million to officials at the NNPC and its subsidiary NAPIMS, in return for assistance in obtaining and retaining contracts for work on the Eastern Gas Gathering System (EGGS).[4]\\r\\nIn July 2004, ABB Vetco Gray, a US company, and its UK subsidiary ABB Vetco Gray UK Ltd, admitted to paying over $1?million in bribes to officials at NNPC subsidiary NAPIMS in exchange for obtaining confidential bid information and favourable recommendations from Nigerian government agencies.[5]\\r\\nIn November 2013 after a report was published by Swiss Non-governmental advocacy organisation ÿ Erkl?rung von Bern ÿ allegations of heavy fraud surfaced, placing the NNPC under suspicion of siphoning off $6.8?billion in crude oil revenues.[6][7][8]\\r\\nOn 9 December 2013, a letter from the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) Governor to the President of Nigeria, Goodluck Ebele Jonathan, dated show of 25 September 2013ing details that the NNPC had not remitted over $49.8?billion proceeds of crude oil sales to the Government surfaced.

CBN then informed senate committee on Finance on 4 February 2014 that NNPC needs to account for $20bn as the CBN could only confirm receipt of $47bn out of $67bn revenue for the period under review. The then Finance Minister recommended the conduct of an independent Forensic Audit and PwC was officially appointed by the office of the Auditor General of the Federation (AuGF) to conduct a forensic audit into the allegations.[9]\\r\\nAmong the conclusions reached by PwC at the end of their work, as stated in their report, which was made public are:\\r\\n1. Total cash remitted into the Federation accounts in relation to crude oil liftings was $50.81bn and NOT $47bn as earlier stated by the Reconciliation Committee for the period from January 2012 to July 2013.[9]\\r\\n2. NNPC has provided information on the difference leading to a potential excess remittance of $0.74 billion (without considering expected remittances from NPDC).

Zia's stated intention was to \\"eradicate the scourge of interest\\" on loans and securities,[4] and create an \\"interest-free economy\\".[3] On January 1, 1980, approximately 7,000 interest-free counters were opened at all the nationalized commercial banks, making Pakistan the first country in the Muslim world with Islamic banking.[3]\\r\\nHowever, in spite of the public support allegedly demonstrated for it (and other Islamisation policies) by the 1984 Islamisation referendum and the programme's initial gains and success, it failed to achieve international targets and to meet commercial interactions with other major international banks.[3] Islamic activists were also displeased that Zia's ordinances and proclamations did not ban interest paying accounts.\\r\\nZia's successors were not as active in their pursuit of Islamisation. While conservative Prime minister Nawaz Sharif publicly supported Islamisation, his economic policies focused on privatization and economic liberalization.[5] Many Pakistani economists and business people worry that attempting to impose an Islamic economy on Pakistan would have \\"devastating economic, political, and social consequences for the country\\",[6][7] though others (such as governor of the State Bank of Pakistan, Ishrat Husain), have termed fears of Islamlisation \\"absurd\\" and based on Western stereotypes. Islamisation has continued through the efforts of the Islamic courts Zia created, including activists on the Shariat Appellate Bench of the Supreme Court, although it was given a setback when the government of Pervez Musharraf came to power and pressured a number of activist judges to retire.[4]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nAs a state created specifically for Muslims, Pakistan has long had Islamic activists advocating for more thorough Islamisation of that country, and specifically for the elimination of riba (defined as interest on loans). But the country has also had Islamic modernists and secularists in positions of influence and \\"generations of Muslim usage and custom supported by the fatwa of respected ulema that held low rates of interest to be acceptable, non-usurious, and not riba\\", according to economist Feisal Khan.[8] Even Allama Iqbal \\"the Thinker of Pakistan\\" (Mufakkir-e-Pakistan) \\"cited approvingly\\" the fact that Muslim princely states in India did not restrict modern banking or \\"attempt to impose some sort of \`Islamic\` concept of interest-free financial transactions.\\"[Note 1][9] Consequently enthusiasm for Islamisation has waxed and waned throughout Pakistan's history. It has been strong when \\"religious elements are in ascendancy\\", such as during partition, the 1977 Nizam-e-Mustafa movement, and during the rise in fundamentalist after 2000. At other times \\"only lip service\\" is paid to the issue.[10][11] Maududi and other Islamist hoped to make Pakistan \\"a new Medina\\" which would become \\"the leader of the Islamic world in the twentieth century, a laboratory where experiments in Islamic modernity would be successfully conducted en route' to ushering a new Islamic renaissance\\"[12]\\r\\nAshraf Qureishi and Abul A'la Maududi, two of the pioneer theoreticians of Islamic banking, who preached that interest was riba, forbidden to Muslim, and \\"laid the foundations of current\\" Islamic Banking and Finance in the 1940, were from South Asia. (Maududi moved to Pakistan where he became an influential Islamist leader.)[13] According to Feisal Khan, \\"South Asians in general and Pakistanis in particular are \`over-represented\`\\" among Islamic Banking \\"theorist and practitioners,\\" and Pakistanis are \\"found in Islamic banks and financial firms throughout the [Persian] Gulf at all levels, from tellers to the boardroom.\\"[14]\\r\\nArticle 28 of Pakistan's 1956 Constitution called for the elimination of riba \\"as early as possible\\". The 1962 Constitution provided in the principles of policy that \\"usury\\" should be abolished. Similar provisions were found in the 1973 Constitution.[4] In 1969 the state-sponsored advisory body known as the Council of Islamic Ideology (CII), declared that Pakistan's banking system was \\"fundamentally based upon riba\\", and unanimously called for its elimination.[4]\\r\\nThe mid and late 1970s were a time of Islamic revivalism throughout parts of the Muslim world, including Pakistan. Zia's predecessor, leftist Prime Minister Zulfikar Ali Bhutto faced economic problems of stagflation and opposition to his programme of nationalization and land reform. In 1976 and 1977, vigorous opposition to Bhutto's policies united under the revivalist banner of Nizam-e-Mustafa[15] (\\"Rule of the prophet\\") and preached that establishing an Islamic state based on sharia law would bring a return to the justice and success of the early days of Islam when the Islamic prophet Muhammad ruled Muslims.[16] In an effort to stem the tide of street Islamization, Bhutto also called for Islamisation and banned the drinking and selling of wine by Muslims, nightclubs and horse racing.[16][17] Confrontation between Bhutto's PPP and the opposition Pakistan National Alliance, street protests, loss of life and property, all preceded the military overthrow of Zulfikar Ali Bhutto by Zia in 1977.[18] On coming to power, Zia committing himself to enforcing Nizam-e-Mustafa,[16] a significant turn from Pakistan's predominantly secular law, inherited from the British.\\r\\nLess than two years after the coup, Pakistan's Shia neighbor, Iran, saw a very unexpected Islamic revolution overthrow its well-financed pro-Western, secular monarchy. The new self-proclaimed revolutionary Islamic Republic of Iran believed in the necessity of Islamic sharia law for Islam to survive and prosper, and in the need to spread this doctrine to other Muslim states. While part of the Islamic revival, the revolution created a new conflict in the Islamic world by pitting revolutionary Shia Iran against its doctrinal and geopolitical rival the conservative Wahhabi Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, for leadership of the Islamic world. As poor, predominantly Sunni country, Pakistan has been closely tied to the petroleum-exporting Saudi Arabia which has employed many Pakistani guest workers. This competition for influence affected many things in Muslim countries, including economic policies.\\r\\nDespite its success in initial first five years, the programme was fractured in many obvious reasons, and the stagflation again began to bite the country's resources, as well as many technical and scientific problems arise in the new economic system that the military government and Zia-ul-Haq himself was unable to solve.[29] The newly elected, but technocratic government of Prime minister Mohammad Khan Junejo refused to pass the new and more stricter version of Sharia bill.[30] Zia abruptly dismissed the government on May 29, 1988, and the dissolved parliament the next day, alleging a slow pace of Islamization, corruption, deterioration of law and order, and mismanagement of the economy.[30]\\r\\nGeneral Zia declared that effective 1 July 1979 the affairs of the National Investment Trust, the House Building Finance Corporation, and the Investment Corporation of Pakistan were to be run on an interest-free basis through the adoption of profit and loss sharing finance (PLS).[4] On January 1, 1980, he appeared on national television and announced the introduction of a \\"Profit and Loss Sharing System\\", according to which account holders were to share the losses and profits of the bank.[31]\\r\\nIn 1980 the Council of Islamic Ideology issued a report with \\"detailed and far reaching reforms\\" to eliminate interest. The military government employed Islamic scholars and economists led by professor Khurshid Ahmad to compile laws about Islamic financing.[31] Zia's government responded to the council's report by replacing interest-bearing savings accounts with PLS instruments in Pakistan's five state banks. The government also introduced and encouraged such banks to adopt financing schemes based upon the principles of mudaraba and or musharaka.[4]\\r\\nHowever these Islamisation policies did not include a ban on interest-paying accounts and \\"in most instances\\" Pakistani banks continued to offer accounts with fixed interest rates.[32] For example, for term deposits, the banks substituted the phrases 'rate of interest' with 'expected rate of profit' and \\"kept the entire regime of interest-based deposits intact.\\"[33]\\r\\nWhile the Federal Shariat Court (FSC)  established by General Zia to, among other things, examine existing laws and strike down those that did not complied with Shari'a law [Note 2]would have been the way to put a stop to such interest-paying accounts, Zia had created an article in the constitution (203B) which specifically removed from the FSC's jurisdiction \\"fiscal law or any law relating to the levy and collection of taxes and fees or banking or insurance practice and procedure\\", until government deemed it appropriate to withdraw the ban.\\r\\nFurthermore, after the death of general Zia-ul-Haq, this programme was neglected by his long-time opponent Prime minister Benazir Bhutto, while Zia ally Nawaz Sharif launched a twin intensified programme, Privatization programme and the economic liberalisation to promote the GDP growth rate as well as reverting the economy back to Westernized economic system.[Note 3]\\r\\nTo surmount this obstacle, Islamic activists worked to[35]\\r\\nMuslims agree that the Quran condemns Riba,[36] but do not all agree over what riba is.[37]\\r\\nWhile Muslim activists (and most Pakistanis) agree that riba is interest on debt, others believe that riba is usury (unethical loans that unfairly enrich the lender) and not interest charged under state-regulated banking practices. Such people were to be found disproportionately among \\"the economists, bankers, politicians, and bureaucrats\\" who \\"would be responsible to administer an interest free system\\".[38]\\r\\nTo convince these people and others, Jamat-e-Islami and like-minded groups have sponsored, and Saudi Arabia has financed, numerous symposia \\"dedicated to the task of defining the modalities of an interest-free economy.\\" A \\"vibrant\\" and abundant literature has emanated from these conferences, but many mainstream economists have remained unpersuaded.[38] Activists also had no luck getting a law enacted to make the constitution subordinate to shariat, but had more luck in the courts.\\r\\nWhile Zia had blocked the shariah courts ability to ban interest with Article 203B, he had also added Article 2A (also known as the Objectives Resolution) to the constitution, which included the statement that Muslims' lives should be ordered \\"in the individual and collective spheres in accordance with the teachings and requirements of Islam as set out in the Holy Quran and Sunnah.\\" One superior court judge[39] known as a particularly \\"skillful\\" Islamic activist and judicial activist -- Tanzil-ur-Rahmanargued that Article 2A required shariat law be enforced and was a \\"supra-Constitutional\\" grund norm of law in Pakistan,[40] which meant that it gave superior courts jurisdiction to overrule parts of laws otherwise protected by the constitution if they are in violation of article 2-A, unless that court was specifically excluded.[41] (Article 203B specifically excluded the FSC from examining fiscal laws for repugnancy to Islam, but not the high courts.[41]) Several decisions handed down in the late 1980s and early 1990s supported Tanzil-ur-Rahman's interpretation,[42] but most high court justices did not subscribe to his application of the Objectives Resolution, nor to a ban on interest, and Tanzil-ur-Rehman retired from the bench in 1990.\\r\\nHowever, in 1990, the Benazir Bhutto government was dismissed by the president and Tanzil-ur-Rehman was brought out of retirement and appointed chief justice of the FSC. In November 1991 in a \\"monumental decision\\" he overturned 20 federal and provincial financial laws as repugnant to Islam.[43][44]\\r\\nThe decision forbade riba absolutely without exceptions, defined it as \\"any addition, however slight, over and above the principal\\", including any system of markup, any indexing for inflation, payment by value rather than kind. It forbid riba in \\"production loans\\" as well as \\"consumptive\\" loans. It specifically declared invalid two Islamic Modernist interpretations that avoided strict prohibition: considering anti-riba Quranic verses (2:275-8) allegorical, and use of ijtihad (independent reasoning) of the issue based on finding the public good (maslaha).[45]\\r\\nThe government was publicly committed to Islamisation, but also pursuing a liberalization of Pakistan's economy and had a semi-autonomous state bank file an appeal. After much stalling by the government and bureaucracy, the Faisal case was upheld in 1999 by the Shariah Appellate Bench in the Aslam Khaki decision, with detailed orders to start the interest free economy.[4][46] Pleading that implementation of the judgment would \\"create enormous problems\\" for the domestic, western-style banking and the economy, as well as Pakistan's \\"official and private business and financial dealings with the outside world\\", the government was given an additional year to Islamise by the Bench.[11]\\r\\nBy this time, however, Pervez Musharraf had staged a coup and come to power and limited the power of the courts. He required judges to take a \\"fresh oath of office\\" in which they would undertake to uphold the \\"Provisional Constitution Order\\" established by the coup, which required judges to not \\"make any order against the Chief Executive or any other person exercising powers or jurisdiction under his authority.\\" Two justices of the Shariah Appellate Bench resigned rather than take the oath, a new appeal with new judges found many \\"errors\\" in the Aslam Khaki case and overturned the ruling of a couple months earlier. [11][47]\\r\\nIn Pakistan's financial sector, as of 2006, a system of Islamic banking has been adopted that operates in parallel with the conventional banking system. Pakistanis can choose between the two modes of financing. Most informed Pakistanis, however, insist that there is \\"no concerted move\\" to do away altogether with the conventional banking system, or to replace existing linkages and relationships with international financial markets.[48]\\r\\nAs of March 2014, the new \\"rebooted\\" Islamic banking sector made up 9.4% of Pakistan's banking assets,[49] but like the old Islamic banking sector is still overwhelmingly based on markup, not profit and loss sharing.[50] As of 2015 the Faisal case decision that banned all interest on bank loans but was sent back to Federal Shariat Court (FSC) for \\"definitive finding on all the issues ...\\" in 2002 remains unheard in the Federal Shariat Court.[51]\\r\\nIslamic activists (such as M. Akram Khan), maintained that Islamic banking and economics had \\"effectively failed\\"[52] because of lack of \\"political will\\", ignorance of Islamic banking's \\"potential\\", the \\"inexperience\\" of the banking sector, failure to interest the public,[53] etc.\\r\\nCritic and economist Feisal Khan has noted that the Islamic banking industry in Pakistan has been supply driven rather than demand driven (mandated by General Zia-ul-Haq, court rulings, and the State Bank of Pakistan, rather than by customer interest or popular movements).[54] In series of interviews conducted in 2008 and 2010 with Pakistani banking professionals (banker in conventional and Islamic, Shariah banking advisors, finance-using businessmen, and management consultants), Khan noted many Islamic bankers expressed \\"cynicism\\" over the different or lack thereof between conventional and Islamic bank products,[55] the lack of requirements for external Shariah-compliance audits of Islamic banks in Pakistan,[56] shariah boards lack of knowledge of un-shariah compliant practices in their banks or power to stop these practices.[57] However this did not deter patronage by the pious (one of whom explained that if his Islamic bank was not truly shariah compliant, 'The sin is on their head now, not on mine! What I could do, I've done.') [58]\\r\\nOne estimate of banking customer preference (given by a Pakistani banker) was that out of the entire Pakistani banking sector, was that about 10% of customers were \\"strictly conventional banking clients\\", 20% were strictly Shariah-compliant banking clients, and 70% would prefer Shariah-compliant banking but would use conventional banking if \\"there was a significant pricing difference\\".[59] A survey of Islamic and conventional banking customers found (unsurprisingly) Islamic banking customers were more observant (having attended hajj, observing salat, growing a beard, etc.), but also had higher savings account balances than conventional bank customers, were older, better educated, had traveled more overseas, and tended to have a second account at a conventional bank.[Note 4] Another study, using \\"official data\\" reported to State Bank of Pakistan, found that for lenders who had taken out both Islamic (Murabaha) financing and conventional loans, the default rate was more than twice as high on the conventional loans. Borrowers were \\"less likely to default during Ramadan and in big cities if the share of votes to religious-political parties increases, suggesting that religion ÿ either through individual piousness or network effects ÿ may play a role in determining loan default.\\"[61] [Note 5]\\r\\nOther economists had different and more critical explanations and observations. In 2000, the Governor of the State Bank of Pakistan, Ishrat Hussain contended that \\"Pakistan is far removed from the day when it will be ready to adopt a full-fledged Islamic economic system. ... Most of the assumptions and premises on which the (scientific) hypotheses about the Islamic economic system have been constructed are serious flawed... \\"[63] A report by the IMF noted that the government has been unable to formulate non-interest based instruments for financing budget deficits, \\"thus the government, which is the major exponent of the implementation of the Islamic system, is forced to raise funds through borrowing on the basis of a fixed rate of return\\".[64]\\r\\nAnother critic of \\"Islamization\\" of the economy, Feisal Khan, argues that one reason for the failure of the equity investment proposed by Islamic finance proponents to catch on is the \\"long established consensus\\" that debt finance is superior to equity investment because accurately determining the credit-worthiness of the borrower/investee is both time consuming and expensive, and much more crucial for equity investors than debt lenders. The quality and quantity of such information is particularly problematic when tax evasion is high and the underground economy large. This is very much the case in Pakistan where the 2005 incidence of tax evasion was between 5.7 and 6.5% of GDP, and the size of the unofficial/underground economy as between 54.6 and 62.8 percent of GDP,[65] \\"among the world's highest\\".[66] (The average size of the informal economy is about 30% in Asia.)[67]\\r\\nEconomist Izzud-Din Pal argues that \\"Islamising\\" the economy in Pakistan cannot be seen apart from the wider attempt of regimes and political elites with low levels of legitimacy and popularity to use religion to win public support.[68][69] Unfortunately, according to another author Yoginder Sikand, \\"rather than focusing on the Islamic imperatives of equality and social justice, which are so central to the Quranic text, successive regimes in Pakistan have sought to focus on particular economic injunctions of the Quran abstracted from wider issues of justice and equality\\".[68] Because the debate on \\"Islamising\\" Pakistan's national economy has been reduced to issues related to interest-free banking, the abolition of riba (interest), the laws of inheritance and the levy of the \\"zakt\\", Sikand believes all that is being offered are \\"magical solutions\\" to the complex modern problems of Pakistan's economy.[68][69]\\r\\nFeisal Khan also argues that instituting a strictly Islamic banking system of mudaraba and musharaka, as called for by the 1999 Aslam Khaki decision of the Shariah Appellate Bench could lead to financial catastrophe. If murabaha and other fixed income instruments were banned and replaced by the more \\"authentic\\" profit and loss sharing, banks could only finance enterprise by taking \\"a direct equity state\\" as called for in mudaraba and musharaka. Credit would contract and central banks would be unable to prevent a liquidity crisis by buying bonds, commercial paper, etc. to expand credit.[70]\\r\\nLand ownership is concentrated in Pakistan  as of 2015 a reported one-half of rural households in Pakistan are landless, while 5% of the country's population owns almost two-thirds of its farmland.[Note 6] Some reformers believe concentrated land ownership plays a part in \\"maintaining poverty and food insecurity\\" in Pakistan,[71] and several attempts have been made to redistribute land to peasants and landless (laws created in 1959, 1972 and 1977). However, most provisions of these laws have been overruled as un-Islamic by Pakistan courts.[72][73]\\r\\nThe first attempts at land reform in Pakistan occurred under Ayub Khan's government in 1959, were successfully opposed by the landed elite who mobilized the Islamist party, Jamaat-e-Islami to defend the \\"sanctity of private property in Islam\\".[74]\\r\\nIn 1971 when Zulfikar Ali Bhutto and the Pakistan People's Party came to power, land reforms were \\"at the center\\" of that government's plans to transform Pakistan in to a \\"democratic Islamic socialist\\" state. The regime issued two land reform laws. A 1972 law (Martial Law Regulation - MLR 115, \\"promlogated\\" by the prime minister rather than passed by the National Assembly) was designed to place ceilings on the agricultural holding of Pakistan's large landlords (usually 150 acres but 300 acres if the land was unirrigated; exceptions were granted for tractors or installed tubewells[75]). Land was to be seized by the state without compensation and distributed to the landless.[76] Another provision of the law gave \\"first right of pre-emption\\" (right of first refusal to buy the land) to the existing tenants. In 1977, a bill was passed by the National Assembly, reducing the ceiling still further to 100 acresalthough this act provided for compensation to landlords.[76]\\r\\nThe implementation of land reforms was criticized[77] for the modest amount of land seized and redistributed to the peasants, less-than-equitable administrationimplementation was much more robust in the NWFP and Balochistan, where opposition to Bhutto was centeredand for being inherently \\"un-Islamic\\".[77] Many of Pakistan's large landlords mobilized against the reforms which they saw as \\"a direct challenged to their long-standing interest in maintaining political control in Pakistan's rural areas\\".\\r\\nAfter Ali Bhutto was overthrown, landlords who had lost as a result of land reform appealed to \\"Islamic Courts\\" (i.e. the Shariah Appellate Bench and Federal Shariat Court), established by Bhutto's successor General Zia-ul-Haq, and these, rather than the executive or legislature of Pakistan, undid much of Ali Bhutto's reform program. According to scholar Charles H. Kennedy, the courts effectively \\"suspended implementation\\" of the land reforms, \\"repealed the reforms, drafted new legislation, and then interpreted the new laws' meanings\\".[78]\\r\\n\\"In early 1979, the \\"Shariat Bench\\" of the Peshawar High Court\\" found the section of the 1972 law granting tenants the right to buy land they worked before other offers (\\"right to preemption\\") was \\"repugnant to Islam\\" and thus void. The petitioners against the law had successfully argued that \\"nowhere in the Holy Quran or Sunnah\\" was there mention of a tenant's right to preemption.[79] The right to preemption according to the a hadith (the recorded reports of the teachings, deeds and sayings of the Islamic prophet Muhammad that make up much of the Sunnah) according to the petitioners and judges of the Shariat Bench went instead to the[79]\\r\\nThis decision was reaffirmed by the Federal Shariat Court in 1981[81][82] (although the court acknowledged that \\"Islam recognized the validity of state imposed limits on wealth for the purpose of alleviating poverty or providing for the public good\\", which was a goal of the land reform laws[80]), and upheld by the Shariah Appellate Bench of the Supreme Court in 1986 in a 3 to 2 decision. This decision was \\"clarified and reclarified\\" in subsequent decisions,[83] (but confusion over what land transfers were valid or not under the \\"old law\\" remained since legal proceedings with \\"final decree\\" prior to the August 1986 ruling remained valid[83][Note 7]).\\r\\nIn August 1989 the Shariat Appellate Bench struck down several more measures of the 1972 land reform law.[84] It ruled unanimously that provisions that allowed the confiscation of land without compensation were un-Islamic. On other measures it divided 3 to 2. It ruled that Waqf (an Islamic religious endowment, typically a donated plot of land or building) land was exempt from any provision of land reform laws; that the ceilings on amount of land owned were an undue restriction on property rights,[85] on the grounds that \\"Islam does not countenance compulsory redistribution of wealth or land for the purpose of alleviating poverty, however laudable the goal of poverty relief may be.\\"[73][Note 8][86] Dissenting justices argued that under Islam the rights of property holder must be balanced against the needs of the community.[87] (The repudiation of a major feature of Ali Bhutto's domestic policies during the regime of his daughter underscoring judicial independence (i.e. power), and the weakness of the elected government.[85])\\r\\nAccording to barrister writing in dawn.com, \\"The net result of the Qazalbash Waqf v Chief Land Commissioner (the 1989 Shariat Appellate Bench decision) is that land reforms in Pakistan are now at the same level as they were in 1947, as the 1972 regulations and the 1977 act have seen their main provisions being struck down and the 1959 regulations have been repealed.\\"[72]\\r\\nOther ordinances dealing with Islamic finance included the Zakt and Ushr Ordinances issued on 20 June 1980, to Islamize taxation. The new system expelled the secular and international financial institutions and consisted only Islamic organizations, associations and institutions.[31] The Zakt was to be deducted from bank accounts of Muslims at the rate of 2.5% annually above the balance of Rs. 3,000.[31] The Ushr was levied on the yield of agricultural land in cash or kind at the rate of 10% of the agricultural yield, annually.[31]\\r\\nAuthorized by General Zia-ul-Haq, the government appointed Central, Provincial, District and Tehsil Zakat Councils to distribute Zakat funds to the needy, poor, orphans and widows.[31] The Shia Muslims were exempted from Zakat deduction from their accounts due to their own religious beliefs.[31] According to critics (Arskal Salim) the program has not been a great success:\\r\\n\\"Since it was introduced through the Zakat and Ushr Ordinance No. 17 of 1980 ... the real lives and economic conditions of millions of Pakistani citizens have been completely unchanged, but a great number of socioreligious and political problems have arisen from state involvement in zakat administration.\\"[88]\\r\\nAnother economist (Parvez Hasan) writing in 2004 states zakat collections were insufficient to help the poor as it makes up only \\"0.17 percent of GDP ... Rs. 5-6 billion\\". The present level of grants \\"would add only 5-6 percent\\" to the income of the 1.2 million of the poorest Pakistani households even if every rupee of zakat collected went directly to these poor.[89]","input":"When was islamic banking system introduced in pakistan?"},{"output":"New Zealand","context":"The first voyage of James Cook was a combined Royal Navy and Royal Society expedition to the south Pacific Ocean aboard HMS Endeavour, from 1768 to 1771. It was the first of three Pacific voyages of which Cook was the commander. The aims of this first expedition were to observe the 1769 transit of Venus across the Sun (3ÿ4 June of that year), and to seek evidence of the postulated Terra Australis Incognita or \\"unknown southern land\\".\\r\\nThe voyage was commissioned by King George III and commanded by Lieutenant James Cook, a junior naval officer with good skills in cartography and mathematics. Departing from Plymouth-Dock (Devonport) in August 1768, the expedition crossed the Atlantic, rounded Cape Horn and reached Tahiti in time to observe the transit of Venus. Cook then set sail into the largely uncharted ocean to the south, stopping at the Pacific islands of Huahine, Borabora and Raiatea to claim them for Great Britain[citation needed], and unsuccessfully attempting to land at Rurutu. In September 1769 the expedition reached New Zealand, being the second Europeans to visit there, following the first European discovery by Abel Tasman 127 years earlier. Cook and his crew spent the following six months charting the New Zealand coast, before resuming their voyage westward across open sea. In April 1770 they became the first Europeans to reach the east coast of Australia, making landfall at Point Hicks, and then proceeding to Botany Bay.\\r\\nThe expedition continued northward along the Australian coastline, narrowly avoiding shipwreck on the Great Barrier Reef. In October 1770 the badly damaged Endeavour came into the port of Batavia in the Dutch East Indies, her crew sworn to secrecy about the lands they had discovered. They resumed their journey on 26 December, rounded the Cape of Good Hope on 13 March 1771, and reached the English port of Deal on 12 July. The voyage lasted almost three years.\\r\\nThe year following his return Cook set out on a second voyage of the Pacific, which lasted from 1772 to 1775. His third and final voyage lasted from 1776 to 1779.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nOn 16 February 1768 the Royal Society petitioned King George III to finance a scientific expedition to the Pacific to study and observe the 1769 transit of Venus across the sun to enable the measurement of the distance from the Earth to the Sun.[1] Royal approval was granted for the expedition, and the Admiralty elected to combine the scientific voyage with a confidential mission to search the south Pacific for signs of the postulated continent Terra Australis Incognita (or \\"unknown southern land\\").[2] The aims of the expedition were revealed in the press: \\"To-morrow morning Mr. Banks, Dr. Solano [sic], with Mr. Green, the Astronomer, will set out for Deal, to embark on board the Endeavour, Capt. Cook, for the South Seas, under the direction of the Royal Society, to observe the Transit of Venus next summer, and to make discoveries to the South and West of Cape Horn\\".[3] The London Gazetteer was more explicit when it reported on 18 August 1768: \\"The gentlemen, who are to sail in a few days for Georges Land, the new discovered island in the Pacific ocean, with an intention to observe the Transit of Venus, are likewise, we are credibly informed, to attempt some new discoveries in that vast unknown tract, above the latitude 40\\".[4] Another article reported that the principal and almost sole national advantage of the island discovered by Captain Wallace, that is Tahiti, was its situation for exploring the Terra Incognita of the Southern Hemisphere, and that, The Endeavour, a North-Country Cat, is purchased by the Government, and commanded by a Lieutenant of the Navy; she is fitting out at Deptford for the South Sea, thought to be intended for the newly discovered island.[5]\\r\\nThe Royal Society suggested command be given to Scottish geographer Alexander Dalrymple, whose acceptance was conditional on a brevet commission as a captain in the Royal Navy. However, First Lord of the Admiralty Edward Hawke refused, going so far as to say he would rather cut off his right hand than give command of a Navy vessel to someone not educated as a seaman.[6] In refusing Dalrymple's command, Hawke was influenced by previous insubordination aboard the sloop HMS?Paramour in 1698, when naval officers had refused to take orders from civilian commander Dr. Edmond Halley.[6] The impasse was broken when the Admiralty proposed James Cook, a naval officer with a background in mathematics and cartography.[7] Acceptable to both parties, Cook was promoted to Lieutenant and named as commander of the expedition.[8]\\r\\nThe vessel chosen by the Admiralty for the voyage was a merchant collier named Earl of Pembroke, launched in June 1764 from the coal and whaling port of Whitby in North Yorkshire.[9] She was ship-rigged and sturdily built with a broad, flat bow, a square stern and a long box-like body with a deep hold.[10] A flat-bottomed design made her well-suited to sailing in shallow waters and allowed her to be beached for loading and unloading of cargo and for basic repairs without requiring a dry dock. Her length was 106 feet (32?m), with a beam of 29?feet 3?inches (8.92?m), and measuring 368?71?94 tons burthen[9][11]\\r\\nEarl of Pembroke was purchased by the Admiralty in May 1768 for S2,840 10s 11d[12][a] and sailed to Deptford on the River Thames to be prepared for the voyage. Her hull was sheathed and caulked, and a third internal deck installed to provide cabins, a powder magazine and storerooms.[13] A longboat, pinnace and yawl were provided as ship's boats, as well as a set of 28?ft (8.5?m) sweeps to allow the ship to be rowed if becalmed or demasted.[14] After commissioning into the Royal Navy as His Majesty's Bark the Endeavour, the ship was supplied with ten 4-pounder cannons and twelve swivel guns, for defence against native attack while in the Pacific.[15]\\r\\nProvisions loaded at the outset of the voyage included 6,000 pieces of pork and 4,000 of beef, nine tons of bread, five tons of flour, three tons of sauerkraut, one ton of raisins and sundry quantities of cheese, salt, peas, oil, sugar and oatmeal. Alcohol supplies consisted of 250 barrels of beer, 44 barrels of brandy and 17 barrels of rum.[16]\\r\\nOn 30 July 1768 the Admiralty authorised a ship's company for the voyage, of 73 sailors and 12 Royal Marines.[17] The voyage was commanded by 40-year-old Lieutenant James Cook. His second lieutenant was Zachary Hicks, a 29-year-old from Stepney with experience as acting commander of the Hornet, a 16-gun cutter.[18] The third lieutenant was John Gore, a 16-year Naval veteran who had served as master's mate aboard HMS Dolphin during its circumnavigation of the world in 1766.[19]\\r\\nOther notable people on the expedition include the official astronomer, Charles Green, then assistant to the Astronomer Royal, Nevil Maskelyne. Joseph Banks had been appointed to the voyage as the official botanist. Banks funded seven others to join him: a Swedish naturalist Daniel Solander, a Finnish naturalist Herman Sp?ring, two artists, a scientific secretary, and two black servants from his estate.[20]\\r\\nCook departed from Plymouth on 26 August 1768, carrying 94?people and 18 months of provisions.[21] The ship rounded Cape Horn and continued westward across the Pacific to arrive at Matavai Bay, Tahiti on 13 April 1769, where the observations were to be made. The transit was scheduled to occur on 3 June, and in the meantime he commissioned the building of a small fort and observatory at what is now known as Point Venus.\\r\\nThe astronomer appointed to the task was Charles Green, assistant to the recently appointed Astronomer Royal, Nevil Maskelyne. The primary purpose of the observation was to obtain measurements that could be used to calculate more accurately the distance of Venus from the Sun. If this could be achieved, then the distances of the other planets could be worked out, based on their orbits. On the day of the transit observation, Cook recorded:\\r\\nSaturday 3rd This day prov'd as favourable to our purpose as we could wish, not a Clowd was to be seen the Whole day and the Air was perfectly clear, so that we had every advantage we could desire in Observing the whole of the passage of the Planet Venus over the Suns disk: we very distinctly saw an Atmosphere or dusky shade round the body of the Planet which very much disturbed the times of the contacts particularly the two internal ones. D?r Solander observed as well as Mr Green and my self, and we differ'd from one another in observeing the times of the Contacts much more than could be expected.\\r\\nDisappointingly, the separate measurements of Green, Cook and Solander varied by more than the anticipated margin of error. Their instrumentation was adequate by the standards of the time, but the resolution still could not eliminate the errors. When their results were later compared to those of the other observations of the same event made elsewhere for the exercise, the net result was not as conclusive or accurate as had been hoped. The difficulties are today thought to relate to the Black drop effect, an optical phenomenon that precludes accurate measurement?ÿ particularly with the instruments used by Cook, Green and Solander.\\r\\nOnce the observations were completed, Cook opened the sealed orders for the second part of his voyage: to search the south Pacific for signs of the postulated rich southern continent of Terra Australis, acting on additional instructions from the Admiralty.[22] The Royal Society, and especially Alexander Dalrymple, believed that it must exist and that Britain's best chance of discovering it and claiming its fabled riches before any other rival European power managed to do so would be by using Cook's Transit of Venus mission (on an inconspicuous small ship such as the Endeavour) as a cover.\\r\\nCook, however, had his own personal doubts on the continent's existence. With the help of a Tahitian named Tupaia, who had extensive knowledge of Pacific geography, Cook managed to reach New Zealand on 6 October 1769, leading only the second group of Europeans to do so (after Abel Tasman over a century earlier, in 1642). Cook mapped the complete New Zealand coastline, making only some minor errors (such as calling Banks Peninsula an island, and thinking Stewart Island/Rakiura was a peninsula of the South Island). He also identified Cook Strait, which separates the North Island from the South Island, and which Tasman had not seen.\\r\\nHe wrote in his Journal on 31 March 1770 that the Endeavour's voyage \\"must be allowed to have set aside the most, if not all, the Arguments and proofs that have been advanced by different Authors to prove that there must be a Southern Continent; I mean to the Northward of 40 degrees South, for what may lie to the Southward of that Latitude I know not\\".[23]\\r\\nOn the same day he recorded his decision to set a course to return home by way of the yet unknown east coast of New Holland (as Australia was then called):\\r\\nbeing now resolv'd [sic] to quit this Country altogether, and to bend my thought towards returning home by such a rout as might Conduce most to the Advantage of the Service I am upon, I consulted with the Officers upon the most Eligible way of putting this in Execution. To return by the way of Cape Horn was what I most wished, because by this rout we should have been able to prove the Existance [sic] or Non-Existance [sic] of a Southern Continent, which yet remains Doubtfull [sic]; but in order to Ascertain this we must have kept in a higher Latitude in the very Depth of Winter, but the Condition of the Ship, in every respect, was not thought sufficient for such an undertaking. For the same reason the thoughts of proceeding directly to the Cape of Good Hope was laid aside, especially as no discovery of any Moment could be hoped for in that rout. It was therefore resolved to return by way of the East Indies by the following rout: upon Leaving this Coast to steer to the Westward until we fall in with the East Coast of New Holland, and then to follow the direction of that Coast to the Northward, or what other direction it might take us, until we arrive at its Northern extremity; and if this should be found impracticable, then to Endeavour [sic] to fall in with the Land or Islands discovered by Quiros\\".[24]\\r\\nA voyage to explore the east coast of New Holland, with a view to a British colonization of the country, had been recommended in John Campbells editions of John Harris's Navigantium atque Itinerantium Bibliotheca, or Voyages and Travels (1744ÿ1748, and 1764), a book which Cook had with him on the Endeavour:\\r\\nThe first Point, with respect to a Discovery, would be, to send a small Squadron on the Coast of Van Diemen's Land, and from thence round, in the same course taken by Captain Tasman, by the Coast of New Guiney; which might enable the Nations that attempted it, to come to an absolute Certainty with regard to its Commodities and Commerce... By this means all the back Coast of New Holland, and New Guiney, might be roughly examined; and we might know as well, and as certainly, as the Dutch, how far a Colony settled there might answer our Expectations.[25]\\r\\nHe then set course westwards, intending to strike for Van Diemen's Land (present-day Tasmania, sighted by Tasman) to establish whether or not it formed part of the fabled southern continent. However, they were forced to maintain a more northerly course owing to prevailing gales, and sailed onwards until one afternoon when land was sighted, which Cook named Point Hicks. Cook calculated that Van Diemen's Land ought to lie due south of their position, but having found the coastline trending to the south-west, recorded his doubt that this landmass was connected to it. This point was on the south-eastern coast of the Australian continent, and in doing so his expedition became the first recorded Europeans to have encountered its eastern coastline. In his journal, Cook recorded the event thus:\\r\\nthe Southermost Point of land we had in sight which bore from us W1/4S I judged to lay in the Latitude of 38..0' S and in the Longitude of 211..07' W?t from the Meridion of Greenwich. I have named it Point Hicks, because Leuit?t Hicks was the first who discover'd this land.\\r\\nThe ship's log recorded that land was sighted at 6 a.m. on Thursday 19 April 1770. Cook's log used the nautical date, which, during the 18th?century, assigned the same date to all ship's events from noon to noon, first p.m. and then a.m. That nautical date began twelve hours before the midnight beginning of the like-named civil date. Furthermore, Cook did not adjust his nautical date to account for circumnavigation of the globe until he had travelled a full 360 relative to the longitude of his home British port, either toward the east or west. Because he travelled west on his first voyage, this a.m. nautical date was the morning of a civil date 14 hours slow relative to his home port (port?14h). Because the south-east coast of Australia is now regarded as being 10 hours fast relative to Britain, that date is now called Friday, 20 April.[26]\\r\\nThe landmark of this sighting is generally reckoned to be a point lying about half-way between the present-day towns of Orbost and Mallacoota on the south-eastern coast of the state of Victoria. A survey done in 1843 ignored or overlooked Cook's earlier naming of the point, giving it the name Cape Everard. On the 200th anniversary of the sighting, the name was officially changed back to Point Hicks.\\r\\nEndeavour continued northwards along the coastline, keeping the land in sight with Cook charting and naming landmarks as he went. A little over a week later, they came across an extensive but shallow inlet, and upon entering it moored off a low headland fronted by sand dunes. James Cook and crew made their first landing on the continent, at a place now known as Botany Bay, on the Kurnell Peninsula and made contact of a hostile nature with the Gweagal Aborigines, on 29 April.[b] At first Cook bestowed the name \\"Sting-Ray Harbour\\"[27] to the inlet after the many such creatures found there; this was later changed to \\"Botanist Bay\\"[27] and finally Botany Bay after the unique specimens retrieved by the botanists Joseph Banks, Daniel Solander and Herman Sp?ring.\\r\\nThis first landing site was later to be promoted (particularly by Joseph Banks) as a suitable candidate for situating a settlement and British colonial outpost. However, almost 18 years later, when Captain Arthur Phillip and the First Fleet arrived in early 1788 to establish an outpost and penal colony, they found that the bay and surrounds did not live up to the promising picture that had been painted. Instead, Phillip gave orders to relocate to a harbour a few kilometres to the north, which Cook had named Port Jackson but had not further explored. It was in this harbour, at a place Phillip named Sydney Cove, that the settlement of Sydney was established. The settlement was for some time afterwards still referred to generally as Botany Bay. The expedition's scientific members commenced the first European scientific documentation of Australian fauna and flora.\\r\\nAt Cook's original landing contact was made with the local Australian Aboriginal inhabitants. As the ships sailed into the harbour, they noticed Aborigines on both of the headlands. At about 2 pm they put the anchor down near a group of six to eight huts. Two Aborigines, a younger and an older man, came down to the boat.[citation needed] They did not accept the offer of gifts from Cook, whose lack of knowledge of Aboriginal custom may have prevented him from behaving acceptably in such exchanges. A musket was fired over their heads, which wounded the older man slightly, and he ran towards the huts. He came back with other men and threw spears at Cook's men, although they did no harm.[citation needed] They were chased off after two more rounds were fired.[citation needed] The adults had left, but Cook found several Aboriginal children in the huts, and left some beads with them as a gesture of friendship.[citation needed]\\r\\nCook continued northwards, charting along the coastline. He stopped at Bustard Bay (now known as 1770) on 24 May 1770. Cook and Banks and others went ashore. A mishap occurred when Endeavour ran aground on a shoal of the Great Barrier Reef, on 11 June 1770. The ship was seriously damaged and his voyage was delayed almost seven weeks while repairs were carried out on the beach (near the docks of modern Cooktown, at the mouth of the Endeavour River). While there, Joseph Banks, Herman Sp?ring and Daniel Solander made their first major collections of Australian flora. The crew's encounters with the local Aboriginal people were mainly peaceable; from the group encountered here the name \\"kangaroo\\" entered the English language, coming from the local Guugu Yimidhirr word for a kind of Grey Kangaroo, gangurru (pronounced [?a?uru]).[28]\\r\\nOnce repairs were complete the voyage continued, eventually passing by the northernmost point of Cape York Peninsula and then sailing through Torres Strait between Australia and New Guinea, earlier navigated by Luis Vez de Torres in 1606. Having rounded the Cape, Cook landed on Possession Island on 22 August, where he claimed the entire coastline he had just explored (later naming the region New South Wales) for the British Crown.\\r\\nIn negotiating the Torres Strait past Cape York, Cook also put an end to the speculation that New Holland and New Guinea were part of the same land mass.[29]\\r\\nAt that point in the voyage Cook had lost not a single man to scurvy, a remarkable and practically unheard-of achievement in 18th-century long-distance seafaring. Adhering to Royal Navy policy introduced in 1747, Cook persuaded his men to eat foods such as citrus fruits and sauerkraut. At that time it was known that poor diet caused scurvy but not specifically that a vitamin C deficiency was the culprit.\\r\\nSailors of the day were notoriously against innovation, and at first the men would not eat the sauerkraut. Cook used a \\"method I never once knew to fail with seamen.\\"[30] He ordered it served to himself and the officers, and left an option for crew who wanted some. Within a week of seeing their superiors set a value on it the demand was so great a ration had to be instituted.[30] In other cases, however, Cook was required to resort to traditional naval discipline. \\"Punished Henry Stephens, Seaman, and Thomas Dunster, Marine, with twelve lashes each for refusing to take their allowance of fresh beef.\\"[31]\\r\\nCook's general approach was essentially empirical, encouraging as broad a diet as circumstances permitted, and collecting such greens as could be had when making landfall. All onboard ate the same food, with Cook specifically dividing equally anything that could be divided (and indeed recommending that practice to any commander ÿ journal 4 August 1770).\\r\\nTwo cases of scurvy did occur on board, astronomer Charles Green and the Tahitian navigator Tupaia were treated, but Cook was able to proudly record that upon reaching Batavia he had \\"not one man upon the sick list\\" (journal 15 October 1770), unlike so many voyages that reached that port with much of the crew suffering illness.\\r\\nThe Endeavour then visited the island of Savu, staying for three days before continuing on to Batavia, the capital of the Dutch East Indies, to put in for repairs. Batavia was known for its outbreaks of malaria, and before they returned home in 1771 many in Cook's company succumbed to the disease and other ailments such as dysentery, including the Tahitian Tupaia, Banks' Finnish secretary and fellow scientist Herman Sp?ring, astronomer Charles Green, and the illustrator Sydney Parkinson. Cook named Sp?ring Island off the coast of New Zealand to honour Herman Sp?ring and his work on the voyage.\\r\\nCook then rounded the Cape of Good Hope and stopped at Saint Helena. On 10 July 1771 Nicholas Young, the boy who had first seen New Zealand, sighted England (specifically the Lizard) again for the first time, and the Endeavour sailed up the English Channel, passing Beachy Head at 6?am on 12 July; that afternoon Endeavour anchored in the Downs, and Cook went ashore at Deal, Kent. His return was unexpected, as newspapers and journals had long since reported fears that Endeavour had been lost at sea or destroyed in combat against the French.[32]\\r\\nCook's journals, along with those of Banks, were handed over to the Admiralty to be published upon his return. Lord Sandwich contracted, for S6,000, John Hawkesworth a literary critic, essayist, and editor of The Gentleman's Magazine to publish a comprehensive account of exploration in the Pacific: not just Cook's ventures but also those of Wallis, Byron and Carteret. Hawkesworth edited the journals of Byron, Wallis and Carteret into separate accounts as volume I and then blended Cooks and Joseph Banks journals with some of his own sentiments and produced a single first-person narrative that appeared to be the words of Cook, as Volume II.[33] The book appeared in 1773 as three volumes with the title:\\r\\nAN ACCOUNT OF THE VOYAGES undertaken by Order of His Present Majesty for making Discoveries in the Southern Hemisphere, and successively performed by Commodore Byron, Captain Wallis, Captain Carteret and Captain Cook, in the Dolphin, the Swallow and the Endeavour: Drawn up from the Journals which were kept by the several Commanders, and from the Papers of Joseph Banks, Esq.; by John Hawkesworth, LL.D. In three volumes. Illustrated with Cuts, and a great Variety of Charts and Maps relative to Countries now first discovered, or hitherto but imperfectly known.\\r\\nPrinted for W. Strahan & T. Cadell in the Strand. London: MDCCLXXIII\\r\\nThe book went on sale on 9 June 1773 but widespread criticism in the press made the publication a personal disaster for Hawkesworth. Reviewers complained that the reader had no way to tell which part of the account was Cook, which part Banks and which part Hawkesworth and others were offended by the books descriptions of the voyagers sexual encounters with the Tahitians.[34][35] Cook was at sea again before the book was published and was later much disturbed by some of the sentiments that Hawkesworth has ascribed to him. He determined to edit his own journals in future.\\r\\nIn 2001, the BBC set about making a documentary which involved a film crew, volunteers and historians retracing the voyage made by Captain Cook. One of the historians, Alexander Cook, documented the journey in his 2004 article \\"Sailing on The Ship: Re-enactment and the Quest for Popular History\\".[36]\\r\\n^[a] In today's terms, this equates to a valuation for Endeavour of approximately S265,000 and a purchase price of S326,400.[37]\\r\\n^[b] This date does not need adjustment because it occurred during the afternoon (p.m.) on 29 April in the ship's log, but was the afternoon of the civil date of 28 April, 14 hours west of port, which is now a civil date 10 hours east of port, 24 hours later, hence a modern civil date of 29 April.","input":"Who was discovered first australia or new zealand?"},{"output":"Republic","context":"This is a list of countries by system of government.

The president's degree of executive power may range from being reasonably significant to little (e.g. India), to only having certain limited reserve powers (e.g. Ireland) or none at all.

The council is elected by the parliament, but it is not subject to political confidence during its term which has a fixed duration.\\r\\nThese are systems in which the head of state is a constitutional monarch; the existence of their office and their ability to exercise their authority is established and restrained or held back by constitutional law.\\r\\nSystems in which a prime minister is the active head of the executive branch of government.

The group consisted of guitarist Jimmy Page, singer Robert Plant, bassist and keyboardist John Paul Jones, and drummer John Bonham. The band's heavy, guitar-driven sound has led them to be cited as one of the progenitors of heavy metal, though their unique style drew from a wide variety of influences, including blues, psychedelia, and folk music.\\r\\nAfter changing their name from the New Yardbirds, Led Zeppelin signed a deal with Atlantic Records that afforded them considerable artistic freedom. Although the group was initially unpopular with critics, they achieved significant commercial success with albums such as Led Zeppelin (1969), Led Zeppelin II (1969), Led Zeppelin III (1970), Led Zeppelin IV (1971), Houses of the Holy (1973), and Physical Graffiti (1975). Their fourth album, which features the song \\"Stairway to Heaven\\", is among the most popular and influential works in rock music, and it helped to secure the group's popularity.\\r\\nPage wrote most of Led Zeppelin's music, particularly early in their career, while Plant generally supplied the lyrics. Jones' keyboard-based compositions later became central to the group's catalogue, which featured increasing experimentation. The latter half of their career saw a series of record-breaking tours that earned the group a reputation for excess and debauchery. Although they remained commercially and critically successful, their output and touring schedule were limited during the late 1970s, and the group disbanded following Bonham's death from alcohol-related asphyxia in 1980. In the decades that followed, the surviving members sporadically collaborated and participated in one-off Led Zeppelin reunions. The most successful of these was the 2007 Ahmet Ertegun Tribute Concert in London, with Jason Bonham taking his late father's place behind the drums.\\r\\nLed Zeppelin are widely considered one of the most successful, innovative, and influential rock groups in history. They are one of the best-selling music artists in the history of audio recording; various sources estimate the group's record sales at 200 to 300?million units worldwide. With RIAA-certified sales of 111.5?million units, they are the second-best-selling band in the US. Each of their nine studio albums placed in the top 10 of the Billboard album chart and six reached the number-one spot. They achieved eight consecutive UK number-one albums. Rolling Stone magazine described them as \\"the heaviest band of all time\\", \\"the biggest band of the Seventies\\", and \\"unquestionably one of the most enduring bands in rock history\\". They were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1995; the museum's biography of the band states that they were \\"as influential\\" during the 1970s as the Beatles were during the 1960s.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1966, London-based session guitarist Jimmy Page joined the blues-influenced rock band the Yardbirds to replace bassist Paul Samwell-Smith. Page soon switched from bass to lead guitar, creating a dual lead guitar line-up with Jeff Beck. Following Beck's departure in October 1966, the Yardbirds, tired from constant touring and recording, began to wind down.[1] Page wanted to form a supergroup with him and Beck on guitars, and the Who's Keith Moon and John Entwistle on drums and bass, respectively.[2] Vocalists Steve Winwood and Steve Marriott were also considered for the project.[3] The group never formed, although Page, Beck, and Moon did record a song together in 1966, \\"Beck's Bolero\\", in a session that also included bassist-keyboardist John Paul Jones.[4]\\r\\nThe Yardbirds played their final gig in July 1968 at Luton College of Technology in Bedfordshire.[5] They were still committed to several concerts in Scandinavia, so drummer Jim McCarty and vocalist Keith Relf authorised Page and bassist Chris Dreja to use \\"the Yardbirds\\" name to fulfill the band's obligations. Page and Dreja began putting a new line-up together. Page's first choice for the lead singer was Terry Reid, but Reid declined the offer and suggested Robert Plant, a singer for the Band of Joy and Hobbstweedle.[6] Plant eventually accepted the position, recommending former Band of Joy drummer John Bonham.[7] Jones inquired about the vacant position at the suggestion of his wife after Dreja dropped out of the project to become a photographer.[8][nb 1] Page had known Jones since they were both session musicians and agreed to let him join as the final member.[10]\\r\\nThe four played together for the first time in a room below a record store on Gerrard Street in London.[11] Page suggested that they attempt \\"Train Kept A-Rollin'\\", originally a jump blues song popularised in a rockabilly version by Johnny Burnette, which had been covered by the Yardbirds. \\"As soon as I heard John Bonham play\\", Jones recalled, \\"I knew this was going to be great?... We locked together as a team immediately\\".[12] Before leaving for Scandinavia, the group took part in a recording session for the P. J. Proby album, Three Week Hero. The album's track \\"Jim's Blues\\", with Plant on harmonica, was the first studio track to feature all four future members of Led Zeppelin.[13]\\r\\nThe band completed the Scandinavian tour as the New Yardbirds, playing together for the first time in front of a live audience at Gladsaxe Teen Clubs in Gladsaxe, Denmark, on 7 September 1968.[13] Later that month, they began recording their first album, which was based on their live set. The album was recorded and mixed in nine days, and Page covered the costs.[14] After the album's completion, the band were forced to change their name after Dreja issued a cease and desist letter, stating that Page was allowed to use the New Yardbirds moniker for the Scandinavian dates only.[15] One account of how the new band's name was chosen held that Moon and Entwistle had suggested that a supergroup with Page and Beck would go down like a \\"lead balloon\\", an idiom for disastrous results.[16] The group dropped the 'a' in lead at the suggestion of their manager, Peter Grant, so that those unfamiliar with the term would not pronounce it \\"leed\\".[17] The word \\"balloon\\" was replaced by \\"zeppelin\\", a word which, according to music journalist Keith Shadwick, brought \\"the perfect combination of heavy and light, combustibility and grace\\" to Page's mind.[16]\\r\\nIn November 1968, Grant secured a $143,000 advance contract from Atlantic Records, which was then the biggest deal of its kind for a new band.[18] Atlantic were a label with a catalogue of mainly blues, soul, and jazz artists, but in the late 1960s they began to take an interest in British progressive rock acts. Record executives signed Led Zeppelin without having ever seen them.[19] Under the terms of their contract, the band had autonomy in deciding when they would release albums and tour, and had the final say over the contents and design of each album. They would also decide how to promote each release and which tracks to release as singles. They formed their own company, Superhype, to handle all publishing rights.[11]\\r\\nThe band began their first tour of the UK on 4 October 1968, still billed as the New Yardbirds; they played their first show as Led Zeppelin at the University of Surrey in Battersea on 25 October.[20] Tour manager Richard Cole, who would become a major figure in the touring life of the group, organised their first North American tour at the end of the year.[21][nb 2] Their debut album, Led Zeppelin, was released in the US during the tour on 12 January 1969, and peaked at number 10 on the Billboard chart;[23] it was released in the UK, where it peaked at number 6, on 31 March.[24] According to Steve Erlewine, the album's memorable guitar riffs, lumbering rhythms, psychedelic blues, groovy, bluesy shuffles and hints of English folk, made it \\"a significant turning point in the evolution of hard rock and heavy metal\\".[25]\\r\\nIn their first year, Led Zeppelin completed four US and four UK concert tours, and also released their second album, Led Zeppelin II. Recorded mostly on the road at various North American studios, it was an even greater commercial success than their first album, and reached the number one chart position in the US and the UK.[26] The album further developed the mostly blues-rock musical style established on their debut release, creating a sound that was \\"heavy and hard, brutal and direct\\", and which would be highly influential and frequently imitated.[27] Steve Waksman has suggested that Led Zeppelin II was \\"the musical starting point for heavy metal\\".[28]\\r\\nThe band saw their albums as indivisible, complete listening experiences, disliking the re-editing of existing tracks for release as singles. Grant maintained an aggressive pro-album stance, particularly in the UK, where there were few radio and TV outlets for rock music. Without the band's consent, however, some songs were released as singles, particularly in the US.[29] In 1969 an edited version of \\"Whole Lotta Love\\", a track from their second album, was released as a single in the US. It reached number four in the Billboard chart in January 1970, selling over one million copies and helping to cement the band's popularity.[30] The group also increasingly shunned television appearances, citing their preference that their fans hear and see them in live concerts.[31][32]\\r\\nFollowing the release of their second album, Led Zeppelin completed several more US tours. They played initially in clubs and ballrooms, and then in larger auditoriums as their popularity grew.[7] Some early Led Zeppelin concerts lasted more than four hours, with expanded and improvised live versions of their repertoire. Many of these shows have been preserved as bootleg recordings. It was during this period of intensive concert touring that the band developed a reputation for off-stage excess.[33][nb 3]\\r\\nIn 1970, Page and Plant retired to Bron-Yr-Aur, a remote cottage in Wales, to commence work on their third album, Led Zeppelin III.[35] The result was a more acoustic style that was strongly influenced by folk and Celtic music, and showcased the band's versatility. The album's rich acoustic sound initially received mixed reactions, with critics and fans surprised at the turn from the primarily electric arrangements of the first two albums, further fuelling the band's hostility to the musical press.[36] It reached number one in the UK and US charts, but its stay would be the shortest of their first five albums.[37] The album's opening track, \\"Immigrant Song\\", was released as a US single in November 1970 against the band's wishes, reaching the top twenty on the Billboard chart.[38]\\r\\nDuring the 1970s, Led Zeppelin reached new heights of commercial and critical success that made them one of the most influential groups of the era, eclipsing their earlier achievements.[39][33] The band's image also changed as the members began to wear elaborate, flamboyant clothing, with Page taking the lead on the flamboyant appearance by wearing a glittering moon-and-stars outfit. Led Zeppelin changed their show by using things such as lasers, professional light shows and mirror balls.[40] They began travelling in a private jet airliner, a Boeing 720 (nicknamed the Starship), rented out entire sections of hotels (including the Continental Hyatt House in Los Angeles, known colloquially as the \\"Riot House\\"), and became the subject of frequently repeated stories of debauchery. One involved John Bonham riding a motorcycle through a rented floor of the Riot House,[41] while another involved the destruction of a room in the Tokyo Hilton, leading to the group being banned from that establishment for life.[42] Although Led Zeppelin developed a reputation for trashing their hotel suites and throwing television sets out of the windows, some suggest that these tales have been exaggerated. According to music journalist Chris Welch, \\"[Led Zeppelin's] travels spawned many stories, but it was a myth that [they] were constantly engaged in acts of wanton destruction and lewd behaviour\\".[43]\\r\\nLed Zeppelin released their fourth album on 8 November 1971. In response to the treatment they had received from critics, particularly after Led Zeppelin III, the band decided to release the fourth album with no title, though it is variously referred to as Led Zeppelin IV, Untitled, IV, or, due to the four symbols appearing on the record label, as Four Symbols, Zoso or Runes.[44] In addition to lacking a title, the original cover featured no band name, as the group wished to be anonymous and to avoid easy pigeonholing by the press.[45] With 37 million copies sold, Led Zeppelin IV is one of the best-selling albums in history, and its massive popularity cemented Led Zeppelin's status as superstars in the 1970s.[46][47] By 2006, it had sold 23?million copies in the United States alone.[48] The track \\"Stairway to Heaven\\", never released as a single, was the most requested and most played song on American rock radio in the 1970s.[49] The group followed up the album's release with tours of the UK, Australasia, North America, Japan, and the UK again from late 1971 through early 1973.\\r\\nLed Zeppelin's next album, Houses of the Holy, was released in March 1973. It featured further experimentation by the band, who expanded their use of synthesisers and mellotron orchestration. The predominantly orange album cover, designed by the London-based design group Hipgnosis, depicts images of nude children climbing the Giant's Causeway in Northern Ireland. Although the children are not shown from the front, the cover was controversial at the time of the album's release. As with the band's fourth album, neither their name nor the album title was printed on the sleeve.[50]\\r\\nHouses of the Holy topped charts worldwide,[51] and the band's subsequent concert tour of North America in 1973 broke records for attendance, as they consistently filled large auditoriums and stadiums. At Tampa Stadium in Florida, they played to 56,800 fans, breaking the record set by the Beatles' 1965 Shea Stadium concert and grossing $309,000.[52] Three sold-out shows at Madison Square Garden in New York City were filmed for a motion picture, but the theatrical release of this project (The Song Remains the Same) was delayed until 1976. Before the final night's performance, $180,000 of the band's money from gate receipts was stolen from a safe deposit box at the Drake Hotel.[53]\\r\\nIn 1974, Led Zeppelin took a break from touring and launched their own record label, Swan Song, named after an unreleased song. The record label's logo, based on a drawing called Evening: Fall of Day (1869) by William Rimmer, features a picture of Apollo.[54] The logo can be found on Led Zeppelin memorabilia, especially T-shirts. In addition to using Swan Song as a vehicle to promote their own albums, the band expanded the label's roster, signing artists such as Bad Company, the Pretty Things and Maggie Bell.[55] The label was successful while Led Zeppelin existed, but folded less than three years after they disbanded.[56]\\r\\nIn 1975, Led Zeppelin's double album Physical Graffiti was their first release on the Swan Song label. It consisted of fifteen songs, of which eight had been recorded at Headley Grange in 1974 and seven had been recorded earlier. A review in Rolling Stone magazine referred to Physical Graffiti as Led Zeppelin's \\"bid for artistic respectability\\", adding that the only bands Led Zeppelin had to compete with for the title \\"The World's Best Rock Band\\" were the Rolling Stones and the Who.[57] The album was a massive commercial and critical success. Shortly after the release of Physical Graffiti, all previous Led Zeppelin albums simultaneously re-entered the top-200 album chart,[58] and the band embarked on another North American tour,[59] now employing sophisticated sound and lighting systems.[60] In May 1975, Led Zeppelin played five sold-out nights at the Earls Court Arena in London, at the time the largest arena in Britain.[59]\\r\\nFollowing their triumphant Earls Court appearances, Led Zeppelin took a holiday and planned an autumn tour in America, scheduled to open with two outdoor dates in San Francisco.[61] In August 1975, however, Plant and his wife Maureen were involved in a serious car crash while on holiday in Rhodes, Greece. Plant suffered a broken ankle and Maureen was badly injured; a blood transfusion saved her life.[62] Unable to tour, he headed to the Channel Island of Jersey to spend August and September recuperating, with Bonham and Page in tow. The band then reconvened in Malibu, California. During this forced hiatus much of the material for their next album, Presence, was written.[63]\\r\\nBy this time, Led Zeppelin were the world's number one rock attraction,[64] having outsold most bands of the time, including the Rolling Stones.[65] Presence, released in March 1976, marked a change in the Led Zeppelin sound towards more straightforward, guitar-based jams, departing from the acoustic ballads and intricate arrangements featured on their previous albums. Though it was a platinum seller, Presence received a mixed reaction among fans and the music press, with some critics suggesting that the band's excesses may have caught up with them.[7][66] Page had begun using heroin during recording sessions for the album, a habit which may have affected the band's later live shows and studio recordings, although this has been denied by Page.[63]\\r\\nBecause of Plant's injuries, Led Zeppelin did not tour in 1976. Instead, the band completed the concert film The Song Remains the Same and the accompanying soundtrack album. The film premiered in New York City on 20 October 1976, but was given a lukewarm reception by critics and fans.[7] The film was particularly unsuccessful in the UK, where, unwilling to tour since 1975 because of their tax exile status, Led Zeppelin faced an uphill battle to recapture the public's affection.[67]\\r\\nIn 1977, Led Zeppelin embarked on another major concert tour of North America. The band set another attendance record, with an audience of 76,229 at their Silverdome concert on 30 April.[68] It was, according to the Guinness Book of Records, the largest attendance to that date for a single act show.[69] Although the tour was financially profitable, it was beset by off-stage problems. On 19 April, over 70 people were arrested as about 1,000 fans tried to gatecrash Cincinnati Riverfront Coliseum for two sold-out concerts, while others tried to gain entry by throwing rocks and bottles through glass doors.[70] On 3 June, a concert at Tampa Stadium was cut short because of a severe thunderstorm, despite tickets indicating \\"Rain or Shine\\". A riot broke out, resulting in arrests and injuries.[71]\\r\\nAfter the 23 July show at the Day on the Green festival at the Oakland Coliseum in Oakland, California, Bonham and members of Led Zeppelin's support staff were arrested after a member of promoter Bill Graham's staff was badly beaten during the band's performance.[72][73] The following day's second Oakland concert was the group's final live appearance in the United States. Two days later, as they checked in at a French Quarter hotel for their 30 July performance at the Louisiana Superdome, Plant received news that his five-year-old son, Karac, had died from a stomach virus. The rest of the tour was immediately cancelled, prompting widespread speculation about Led Zeppelin's future.[7][74]\\r\\nIn November 1978, the group recorded at Polar Studios in Stockholm, Sweden. The resulting album, In Through the Out Door, featured sonic experimentation that again drew mixed reactions from critics.[75] Nevertheless, the album reached number one in the UK and the US in just its second week of release. With this album's release, Led Zeppelin's entire catalogue returned to the Billboard Top 200 in the weeks of 27 October and 3 November 1979.[76]\\r\\nIn August 1979, after two warm-up shows in Copenhagen, Led Zeppelin headlined two concerts at the Knebworth Music Festival, playing to a crowd of approximately 104,000 on the first night.[77] A brief, low-key European tour was undertaken in June and July 1980, featuring a stripped-down set without the usual lengthy jams and solos. On 27 June, at a show in Nuremberg, Germany, the concert came to an abrupt halt in the middle of the third song, when Bonham collapsed onstage and was rushed to hospital.[78] Speculation in the press suggested that his collapse had been the result of excessive alcohol and drug use, but the band claimed that he had simply overeaten.[79]\\r\\nA North American tour, the band's first since 1977, was scheduled to commence on 17 October 1980. On 24 September, Bonham was picked up by Led Zeppelin assistant Rex King to attend rehearsals at Bray Studios.[80] During the journey, Bonham asked to stop for breakfast, where he downed four quadruple vodkas (between 16 and 24 oz.), with a ham roll. After taking a bite of the ham roll he said to his assistant, \\"breakfast\\". He continued to drink heavily after arriving at the studio. The rehearsals were halted late that evening and the band retired to Page's housethe Old Mill House in Clewer, Windsor. After midnight, Bonham, who had fallen asleep, was taken to bed and placed on his side. At 1:45?pm the next day, Benji LeFevre (Led Zeppelin's new tour manager) and John Paul Jones found Bonham dead. The cause of death was asphyxiation from vomit; the finding was accidental death.[81] An autopsy found no other recreational drugs in Bonham's body. Although he had recently begun to take Motival (a cocktail of the antipsychotic fluphenazine and the tricyclic antidepressant nortriptyline) to combat his anxiety, it is unclear if these substances interacted with the alcohol in his system.[82][83] Bonham's remains were cremated and his ashes interred on 12 October 1980, at Rushock parish church, Worcestershire.\\r\\nThe planned North American tour was cancelled, and despite rumours that Cozy Powell, Carmine Appice, Barriemore Barlow, Simon Kirke, or Bev Bevan would join the group as his replacement, the remaining members decided to disband. A 4 December 1980 press statement stated that, \\"We wish it to be known that the loss of our dear friend, and the deep sense of undivided harmony felt by ourselves and our manager, have led us to decide that we could not continue as we were\\". The statement was signed simply \\"Led Zeppelin\\".[84]\\r\\nFollowing Zeppelin's dissolution, the first significant project for the members was the Honeydrippers, which Plant initially formed in 1981, and which released its only album in 1984. The group featured Page on lead guitar, along with studio musicians and friends of the pair, including Jeff Beck, Paul Shaffer, and Nile Rodgers. Plant focused on a different direction from Zeppelin, playing standards and in a more R&B style, highlighted by a cover of \\"Sea of Love\\" that peaked at number three on the Billboard chart in early 1985.[85]\\r\\nCoda ÿ a collection of Zeppelin outtakes and unused tracks ÿ was issued in November 1982. It included two tracks from the Royal Albert Hall in 1970, one each from the Led Zeppelin III and Houses of the Holy sessions, and three from the In Through the Out Door sessions. It also featured a 1976 Bonham drum instrumental with electronic effects added by Page, called \\"Bonzo's Montreux\\".[86]\\r\\nOn 13 July 1985, Page, Plant, and Jones reunited for the Live Aid concert at JFK Stadium, Philadelphia, playing a short set featuring drummers Tony Thompson and Phil Collins, and bassist Paul Martinez. Collins had contributed to Plant's first two solo albums while Martinez was a member of Plant's solo band. The performance was marred by a lack of rehearsal with the two drummers, Page's struggles with an out-of-tune guitar, poorly functioning monitors, and Plant's hoarse voice.[87][88] Page described the performance as \\"pretty shambolic\\",[89] while Plant characterised it as an \\"atrocity\\".[87]\\r\\nThe three members reunited again on 14 May 1988, for the Atlantic Records 40th Anniversary concert, with Bonham's son Jason on drums. The result was again disjointed: Plant and Page had argued immediately prior to taking the stage about whether to play \\"Stairway to Heaven\\", and Jones' keyboards were absent from the live television feed.[88][90] Page described the performance as \\"one big disappointment\\" and Plant said \\"the gig was foul\\".[90]\\r\\nThe first Led Zeppelin box set, featuring tracks remastered under Page's supervision, was released in 1990 and bolstered the band's reputation, leading to abortive discussions among members about a reunion.[91] This set included four previously unreleased tracks, including a version of Robert Johnson's \\"Travelling Riverside Blues\\".[92] The song peaked at number seven on the Billboard Album Rock Tracks chart.[93] 1992 saw the release of the \\"Immigrant Song\\"/\\"Hey, Hey, What Can I Do\\" (the original B-side) as a CD single in the US.[94] Led Zeppelin Boxed Set 2 was released in 1993; the two box sets together contained all known studio recordings, as well as some rare live tracks.[95]\\r\\nIn 1994, Page and Plant reunited for a 90-minute \\"UnLedded\\" MTV project. They later released an album called No Quarter: Jimmy Page and Robert Plant Unledded, which featured some reworked Led Zeppelin songs, and embarked on a world tour the following year. This is said to be the beginning of a rift between the band members, as Jones was not even told of the reunion.[96]\\r\\nIn 1995, Led Zeppelin were inducted into the United States Rock and Roll Hall of Fame by Steven Tyler and Joe Perry of Aerosmith. Jason and Zo? Bonham also attended, representing their late father.[97] At the induction ceremony, the band's inner rift became apparent when Jones joked upon accepting his award, \\"Thank you, my friends, for finally remembering my phone number\\", causing consternation and awkward looks from Page and Plant.[98] Afterwards, they played one brief set with Tyler and Perry, with Jason Bonham on drums, and then a second with Neil Young, this time with Michael Lee playing the drums.[97]\\r\\nIn 1997, Atlantic released a single edit of \\"Whole Lotta Love\\" in the US and the UK, the only single the band released in their homeland, where it peaked at number 21.[99] November 1997 saw the release of Led Zeppelin BBC Sessions, a two-disc set largely recorded in 1969 and 1971.[100] Page and Plant released another album called Walking into Clarksdale in 1998, featuring all new material, but after disappointing sales the partnership dissolved before a planned Australian tour.[101]\\r\\n2003 saw the release of the triple live album How the West Was Won, and Led Zeppelin DVD, a six-hour chronological set of live footage that became the best-selling music DVD in history.[102] In July 2007 Atlantic/Rhino and Warner Home Video announced three new Led Zeppelin titles to be released that November. First was Mothership, a 24-track best-of spanning the band's career, followed by a reissue of the soundtrack The Song Remains the Same, which included previously unreleased material, and a new DVD.[103] Led Zeppelin also made their catalogue legally available for digital download,[104] becoming one of the last major rock bands to do so.[105]\\r\\nOn 10 December 2007, Led Zeppelin reunited for the Ahmet Ertegun Tribute Concert at the O2 Arena in London, with Jason Bonham again taking his late father's place on drums. According to Guinness World Records 2009, Led Zeppelin set the world record for the \\"Highest Demand for Tickets for One Music Concert\\" as 20?million requests for the reunion show were rendered online.[106] Music critics praised the band's performance[107] and there was widespread speculation about a full reunion.[108] Page, Jones and Jason Bonham were reported to be willing to tour, and to be working on material for a new Led Zeppelin project.[109] Plant continued his touring commitments with Alison Krauss,[110] stating in September 2008 that he would not be recording or touring with the band.[111][112] Jones and Page reportedly looked for a replacement for Plant, considering singers including Steven Tyler from Aerosmith, and Myles Kennedy of Alter Bridge,[113] but in January 2009 it was confirmed that the project had been abandoned.[114]\\r\\nA film of the O2 performance, Celebration Day, premiered on 17 October 2012 and was released on home video on 19 November.[115] The film grossed $2 million in one night, and the live album peaked at number 4 and 9 in the UK and US, respectively.[116][117][23] Following the film's premiere, Page revealed that he had been remastering the band's discography.[118] The first wave of albums, Led Zeppelin, Led Zeppelin II, and Led Zeppelin III, were released on 2 June 2014.[119] The second wave of albums, Led Zeppelin IV and Houses of the Holy, were released on 27 October 2014.[120] Physical Graffiti was released on 23 February 2015, almost exactly forty years to the day after the original release.[121] The fourth and final wave of albums, Presence, In Through the Out Door, and Coda, were released on 31 July 2015.[122]\\r\\nThrough this remastering project, each studio album was reissued on CD and vinyl and was also available in a Deluxe Edition, which contained a bonus disc of previously unheard material (Coda's Deluxe Edition would include two bonus discs). Each album was also available in a Super Deluxe Edition Box Set, which included the remastered album and bonus disc on both CD and 180-gram vinyl, a high-definition audio download card of all content at 96?kHz/24 bit, a hard bound book filled with rare and previously unseen photos and memorabilia, and a high quality print of the original album cover.[123]\\r\\nOn 6 November 2015, the Mothership compilation was reissued using the band's newly remastered audio tracks.[124] The reissuing campaign concluded with the re-release of BBC Sessions on 16 September 2016. The reissue contained a bonus disc with nine unreleased BBC recordings, including the heavily bootlegged but never officially released \\"Sunshine Woman.\\"[125]\\r\\nLed Zeppelin's music was rooted in the blues.[7] The influence of American blues artists such as Muddy Waters and Skip James was particularly apparent on their first two albums, as was the distinct country blues style of Howlin' Wolf.[126] Tracks were structured around the twelve-bar blues on every studio album except for one, and the blues directly and indirectly influenced other songs both musically and lyrically.[127] The band were also strongly influenced by the music of the British, Celtic, and American folk revivals.[7] Scottish folk guitarist Bert Jansch helped inspire Page, and from him he adapted open tunings and aggressive strokes into his playing.[21] The band also drew on a wide variety of genres, including world music,[7] and elements of early rock and roll, jazz, country, funk, soul, and reggae, particularly on Houses of the Holy and the albums that followed.[126]\\r\\nThe material on the first two albums was largely constructed out of extended jams of blues standards[7] and folk songs.[128][129] This method led to the mixing of musical and lyrical elements of different songs and versions, as well as improvised passages, to create new material, but would lead to later accusations of plagiarism and legal disputes over copyright.[128] Usually the music was developed first, sometimes with improvised lyrics that might then be rewritten for the final version of the song.[129] From the visit to Bron-Yr-Aur in 1970, the songwriting partnership between Page and Plant became predominant, with Page supplying the music, largely via his acoustic guitar, and Plant emerging as the band's chief lyricist. Jones and Bonham then added to the material, in rehearsal or in the studio, as a song was developed.[130] In the later stages of the band's career, Page took a back seat in composition and Jones became increasingly important in producing music, often composed on the keyboard. Plant would then add lyrics before Page and Bonham developed their parts.[131][132]\\r\\nEarly lyrics drew on the band's blues and folk roots, often mixing lyrical fragments from different songs.[133] Many of the band's songs dealt with themes of romance, unrequited love and sexual conquest, which were common in rock, pop and blues music.[134] Some of their lyrics, especially those derived from the blues, have been interpreted as misogynistic.[134] Particularly on Led Zeppelin III, they incorporated elements of mythology and mysticism into their music,[7] which largely grew out of Plant's interest in legends and history.[135] These elements were often taken to reflect Page's interest in the occult, which resulted in accusations that the recordings contained subliminal satanic messages, some of which were said to be contained in backmasking; these claims were generally dismissed by the band and music critics.[136] Susan Fast argues that as Plant emerged as the band's main lyricist, the songs more obviously reflected his alignment with the West Coast counterculture of the 1960s.[137] In the later part of the band's career Plant's lyrics became more autobiographical, and less optimistic, drawing on his own experiences and circumstances.[138]\\r\\nAccording to musicologist Robert Walser, \\"Led Zeppelin's sound was marked by speed and power, unusual rhythmic patterns, contrasting terraced dynamics, singer Robert Plant's wailing vocals, and guitarist Jimmy Page's heavily distorted crunch\\".[139] These elements mean that they are often cited as one of the progenitors of hard rock[140] and heavy metal[139][141] and they have been described as the \\"definitive heavy metal band\\",[7] although the band members have often eschewed the label.[142] Part of this reputation depends on the band's use of distorted guitar riffs on songs like \\"Whole Lotta Love\\" and \\"The Wanton Song\\".[5][143] Often riffs were not doubled by guitar, bass and drums exactly, but instead there were melodic or rhythmic variations;[144] as in \\"Black Dog\\", where three different time signatures are used.[145] Page's guitar playing incorporated elements of the blues scale with those of eastern music.[146] Plant's use of high-pitched shrieks has been compared to Janis Joplin's vocal technique.[5][147] Bonham's drumming was noted for its power, his rapid rolls and his fast beats on a single bass drum.[148] Jones' basslines have been described as melodic and his keyboard playing added a classical touch to the band's sound.[149][5]\\r\\nPage stated that he wanted Led Zeppelin to produce music that had \\"light and shade\\". This began to be more clearly realised beginning with Led Zeppelin III, which made greater use of acoustic instruments.[7] This approach has been seen as exemplified in the fourth album, particularly on \\"Stairway to Heaven\\", which begins with acoustic guitar and recorder and ends with drums and heavy electric sounds.[145][150] Towards the end of their recording career, they moved to a more mellow and progressive sound, dominated by Jones' keyboard motifs.[151] They also increasingly made use of various layering and production techniques, including multi-tracking and overdubbed guitar parts.[126] Their emphasis on the sense of dynamics and ensemble arrangement[126] has been seen as producing an individualistic style that transcends any single music genre.[152][153] Ian Peddie argues that they were \\"...?loud, powerful and often heavy, but their music was also humorous, self-reflective and extremely subtle\\".[154]\\r\\nLed Zeppelin are widely considered to be one of the most successful, innovative, and influential bands in the history of rock music.[155] Rock critic Mikal Gilmore said, \\"Led Zeppelintalented, complex, grasping, beautiful and dangerousmade one of the most enduring bodies of composition and performance in twentieth-century music, despite everything they had to overpower, including themselves\\".[156]\\r\\nLed Zeppelin have influenced hard rock and heavy metal bands such as Deep Purple,[157] Black Sabbath,[158] Rush,[159] Queen,[160] Aerosmith,[161] the Black Crowes,[162] and Megadeth[163] as well as progressive metal bands like Tool[164] and Dream Theater.[165] They influenced some early punk and post-punk bands, among them the Ramones,[166] Joy Division[167][168] and the Cult.[169] They were also an important influence on the development of alternative rock, as bands adapted elements from the \\"Zeppelin sound\\" of the mid-1970s,[170][171] including the Smashing Pumpkins,[172][173] Nirvana,[174] Pearl Jam,[175] and Soundgarden.[176] Bands and artists from diverse genres have acknowledged the influence of Led Zeppelin, such as Madonna,[177] Shakira,[178] Lady Gaga,[179] Kesha,[180] and Katie Melua.[181]\\r\\nLed Zeppelin have been credited with a major impact on the nature of the music business, particularly in the development of album-orientated rock (AOR) and stadium rock.[182][183] In 1988 John Kalodner, then-A&R executive of Geffen Records, remarked that \\"In my opinion, next to the Beatles they're the most influential band in history. They influence the way music is on records, AOR radio, concerts. They set the standards for the AOR-radio format with 'Stairway to Heaven,' having AOR hits without necessarily having Top 40 hits. They're the ones who did the first real big arena concert shows, consistently selling out and playing stadiums without support. People can do as well as them, but nobody surpasses them\\".[184] Andrew Loog Oldham, the former producer and manager of the Rolling Stones, commented on how Led Zeppelin had a major influence on the record business, and the way rock concerts were managed and presented to huge audiences.[185]\\r\\nThe band have sold over 200?million albums worldwide according to some sources,[105] while others state that they have sold in excess of 300?million records,[186] including 111.5?million certified units in the United States. According to the Recording Industry Association of America, Led Zeppelin are the second-highest-selling band, the fourth highest selling music act in the US, and one of only three acts to earn five or more Diamond albums.[187] They achieved eight consecutive number-ones on the UK Albums Chart, a record for most consecutive UK number-one albums shared with ABBA.[188] Led Zeppelin remain one of the most bootlegged artists in the history of rock music.[189]\\r\\nLed Zeppelin also made a significant cultural impact. Jim Miller, editor of Rolling Stone Illustrated History of Rock & Roll, argues that \\"on one level, Led Zeppelin represents the final flowering of the sixties' psychedelic ethic, which casts rock as passive sensory involvement\\".[190] Led Zeppelin have also been described as \\"the quintessential purveyors\\"[191] of masculine and aggressive \\"cock rock\\", although this assertion has been challenged.[192] The band's fashion-sense has been seminal; Simeon Lipman, head of pop culture at Christie's auction house, has commented that \\"Led Zeppelin have had a big influence on fashion because the whole aura surrounding them is so cool, and people want a piece of that\\".[193] Led Zeppelin laid the foundation for the big hair of 1980s glam metal bands such as M?tley Cre and Skid Row.[194] Other musicians have also adapted elements from Led Zeppelin's attitude to clothes, jewellery and hair, such as the hipster flares and tight band T-shirts of Kings of Leon, shaggy hair, clingy T-shirts and bluesman hair of Jack White of the White Stripes, and Kasabian guitarist Sergio Pizzorno's silk scarves, trilbies and side-laced tight jeans.[193]\\r\\nLed Zeppelin have collected many honours and awards throughout the course of their career. They were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1995,[97] and the UK Music Hall of Fame in 2006.[195] Among the band's awards are an American Music Award in 2005, and the Polar Music Prize in 2006.[196] Led Zeppelin were the recipient of a Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award in 2005,[197] and four of their recordings have been inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame.[198] They have been awarded five Diamond albums, as well as fourteen Multi-Platinum, four Platinum and one Gold album in the United States,[48] while in the UK they have five Multi-Platinum, six Platinum, one Gold and four Silver albums.[199] In addition to listing five of their albums among \\"the 500 Greatest Albums of All Time\\", Rolling Stone named Led Zeppelin the 14th-greatest artist of all time in 2004.[200][201]\\r\\nIn 2005, Page was appointed an Officer of the Order of the British Empire in recognition of his charity work, and in 2009 Plant was honoured as a Commander of the Order of the British Empire for his services to popular music.[202] The band are ranked number one on VH1's 100 Greatest Artists of Hard Rock[203] and Classic Rock's \\"50 best live acts of all time\\".[204] They were named as the best Rock band in a poll by BBC Radio 2.[205] They were awarded an Ivor Novello Award for \\"Outstanding Contribution to British Music\\" in 1977,[206] as well as a \\"Lifetime Achievement Award\\" at the 42nd Annual Ivor Novello awards ceremony in 1997.[207] The band were honoured at the 2008 MOJO Awards with the \\"Best Live Act\\" prize for their one-off reunion, and were described as the \\"greatest rock and roll band of all time\\".[208] The three surviving members (Page, Plant, and Jones) were named as 2012 recipients of Kennedy Center Honors.[209]","input":"Who were the band members in led zeppelin?"},{"output":"September 6, 2018","context":"The 2018 NFL season will be the 99th season of the National Football League (NFL).

The Ravens, who will be making their first ever Hall of Fame Game appearance, are represented in the 2018 Hall of Fame class by former linebacker Ray Lewis, while the Bears are represented by former linebacker Brian Urlacher.\\r\\nThe 2018 regular season's 256 games will be played over a 17-week schedule which will begin on September 6. Each of the league's 32 teams plays a 16-game schedule, with one bye week for each team. The slate also features games on Monday Nights. There are games played on Thursdays, including the National Football League Kickoff game in prime time on September 6 and games on Thanksgiving Day. The regular season will conclude with a full slate games of 16 games on December 30, all of which will be intra-division matchups, as it has been since 2010.\\r\\nUnder the NFL's current scheduling formula, each team plays the other three teams in its own division twice. In addition a team plays against all four teams in one other division from each conference. The final two games on a team's schedule are against the two team's in the team's own conference in the divisions the team was not set to play which finished the previous season in the same rank in their division (e.g. the team which finished first in its division the previous season would play each other team in its conference that also finished first in its respective division). The preset division pairings for 2018 will be as follows.\\r\\n????Intra-conference\\r\\nAFC East vs AFC South\\r\\nAFC West vs AFC North\\r\\nNFC East vs NFC South\\r\\nNFC West vs NFC North\\r\\n???Inter-conference\\r\\nAFC East vs NFC North\\r\\nAFC North vs NFC South\\r\\nAFC South vs NFC East\\r\\nAFC West vs NFC West\\r\\nThe entire season schedule was released on April 19, 2018. Highlights of the 2018 season include:\\r\\nWhen the entire season schedule was released on April 19, 2018, the league announced flexible scheduling for Saturday games in weeks 15 and 16. The final kickoff times for these games will be announced no later than week 8:[65]\\r\\nThe 2018 playoffs will begin on the weekend of January 5ÿ6, 2019 with the Wild Card Playoff round the four winners of these playoff games will visit the top two seeds in each conference of the Divisional round games the weekend of January 12-13, 2019. The winners of those games will advance to the Conference championship games on January 20, 2019. The 2019 Pro Bowl will be held at Camping World Stadium in Orlando, Florida on January 27, 2019. Super Bowl LIII will be held on February 3, 2019 at Mercedes-Benz Stadium in Atlanta, Georgia, on CBS.\\r\\nOn 23 May 2018 the NFL owners agreed a new policy in relation to U.S. national anthem protests.[66] Under the new policy teams (but not players) would be fined for failing to stand and respect the national anthem. Players who do not wish to stand for the national anthem may remain in the locker room.\\r\\nTwo teams, the Carolina Panthers and Oakland Raiders, are entering the final year of their lease agreements with their current stadium.\\r\\nOn December 17, 2017, Jerry Richardson, the Panthers' founding owner, announced he was putting the team up for sale.[90][91] Richardson had previously indicated the team would be put up for sale after his death,[92] but Richardson was accused of paying hush money to cover up questionable conduct, including racial slurs and sexually suggestive requests of employees, hastening Richardson's decision.[93] The Panthers' lease on Bank of America Stadium expires after the 2018 season,[94] which would allow any incoming owner to relocate the team out of Charlotte, North Carolina, to another market if they so desired, only being liable for the remaining debt from stadium renovation. At an estimated $35 million, the debt payment would be a small expense compared to the relocation fee the NFL charged for the two teams that relocated in 2016 and 2017.[95] The two most likely candidates to buy the team as of May 2018 were David Tepper, a hedge fund manager with a higher net worth and a minority stake in the Pittsburgh Steelers but fewer ties to Charlotte; and Ben Navarro, a financial services CEO based in Charlotte who had the backing of Richardson's only living son.[96] Tepper was announced as the new owner on May 16, with the announcement coming in time for the league to vote on his bid at the owners meeting on May 19.[97]\\r\\nThe Raiders, prior to the 2017 season, committed to relocating to Las Vegas, Nevada, once a new stadium is constructed for them in 2020. In 2016, the Raiders signed a three-year extension with the Oakland Coliseum.[98] The Raiders could choose to stay in the Oakland Coliseum for 2019 with another year-to-year extension or move to Sam Boyd Stadium in Las Vegas, which is undersized but (because of the Los Angeles Chargers' use of the even smaller StubHub Center) would not be the smallest stadium in the NFL. Management at the Oakland Coliseum has indicated they are unwilling to extend their agreement with the Raiders after 2018, which could force the team to move to Sam Boyd Stadium in 2019.[99] In order to secure another season in Oakland, California, Coliseum management indicated in September 2017 that the Raiders would need to offer major concessions to compensate for the financial losses the Coliseum incurs by hosting Raiders games.[100]\\r\\nThe Broncos hope to resolve the two-season long naming rights situation for the field at Mile High Stadium II by the start of the 2018 pre-season; in the meantime, all exterior and interior signage for the defunct sporting goods chain Sports Authority has been or is in the process of being removed from the stadium, though ticketed events will continue to print the name \\"Sports Authority Field at Mile High.\\"[101][102]\\r\\nOn February 16, EverBank Field, the home field of the Jacksonville Jaguars, was renamed TIAA Bank Field, after TIAA's 2017 acquisition of EverBank. The naming rights agreement was for 10 years and $43 million.[103]\\r\\nThe Color Rush program has been discontinued, and teams will no longer be required to wear the special uniforms for Thursday Night Football. Initial plans, which will be finalized at the league's owners meeting in May, are for teams to be able to continue using the existing designs that were designed by Nike for the program as standard third jerseys. [104] [105]\\r\\nThe Tennessee Titans introduced new uniforms on April 4. Most prominent among the changes is the helmet, which is changing from the white color the team had used since the 1970s (as the Houston Oilers) to navy blue. The color patterns are also simplified, with a new number typeface inspired both by Greek lettering and the shape of the state of Tennessee.[106]\\r\\nOn April 9, the Green Bay Packers unveiled a patch to commemorate their 100th season[107]\\r\\nOn April 19, the Miami Dolphins and Jacksonville Jaguars both unveiled new uniforms. The Dolphins altered their jerseys to more take after their classic aqua-and-orange look, while Jacksonville simplified their uniforms to resemble their original teal blue jerseys used in their early years.[108][109]\\r\\nThis will be the fifth year under the current broadcast contracts with ESPN, CBS, Fox, and NBC. This includes \\"cross-flexing\\" (switching) Sunday afternoon games between CBS and Fox before or during the season (regardless of the conference of the visiting team). NBC will continue to air Sunday Night Football, the annual Kickoff game, and the primetime Thanksgiving game. ESPN will continue to air Monday Night Football and the Pro Bowl. CBS will broadcast Super Bowl LIII.\\r\\nOn January 31, the NFL announced that Fox had acquired the broadcast television rights to the Thursday Night Football package under a five-year deal (aligned with the remainder of the NFL's current broadcast contracts). Fox will air 11 games, along with the 2018 NFL Draft (the first time the event has ever aired on over-the-air television),[110] in simulcast with NFL Network,[111][112] with the remaining games in the package airing exclusively on NFL Network to satisfy its carriage contracts.[113] CBS and NBC had made bids to renew their previous contracts (CBS had held the rights since 2014, joined by NBC since 2016), but were reluctant to pay a higher rights fee due to the league's ratings downturn.[114]\\r\\nAfter several years in which Verizon held exclusive rights to carry NFL Internet broadcasts on mobile devices 7 inches (18?cm) or less in size (opting to only make them available to its own wireless subscribers), the 2018 season will be the first in which any device will be allowed to access those broadcasts. Verizon will still hold rights to stream all nationally televised games, as well as in-market Sunday afternoon games; instead of only distributing them to its own subscribers, its numerous Internet brands (such as Yahoo!, which exclusively carried two International Series games in 2015 and 2017, along with AOL, go90, complex.com) will carry the games to all devices.[115]\\r\\nOn April 26, 2018, the league announced an extension with Amazon Video that will simulcast the eleven Thursday Night Football games that are simulcast on Fox to its Amazon Prime subscribers. The agreement, which increases Amazon's rights fee by 15%, is for the 2018 and 2019 seasons. To fulfill a request that the Internet broadcast be made available freely, the games will also be made available on twitch.tv, an Amazon subsidiary.[116]\\r\\nBoth of the NFL's national radio contracts, Westwood One for English language[117] and Entravision for Spanish language,[118] expired after the 2017 season. Westwood One's parent company Cumulus Media filed for bankruptcy in November 2017[119] and began terminating national broadcast contracts in January 2018,[120][121] decreasing the likelihood that they will renew their contract.\\r\\nWith the release of the 2018 schedule, NFL.com listed ESPN Deportes Radio (which had shared NFL rights with Entravision in 2017 and had carried Super Bowl LII[122]) as the league's national Spanish-language broadcaster. The national English-language broadcaster was still identified as Westwood One, although no press release has been issued in regard to a contract extension with that network.\\r\\nESPN will introduce a fully new broadcast team for the series. Joe Tessitore will replace Sean McDonough as lead play-by-play man; McDonough will remain with ESPN as a college football announcer.[123][124] With previous color analyst Jon Gruden returning to coaching, Monday Night Football will return to its traditional three-person booth, with Jason Witten and Booger McFarland joining the broadcast team as analysts, while Lisa Salters, the sideline reporter, carries over from the previous broadcast team.[125]\\r\\nFox initially had planned to hire a new broadcast team for its Thursday Night Football, making an overture to Peyton Manning to serve as color commentator. Since Manning declined the offer, the network announced that it will be placing its existing lead broadcast team of Joe Buck and Troy Aikman on the package, while reducing the number of games the duo will call on Sundays.[126] A version of Fox NFL Sunday will serve as the lead-in to Thursday Night Football, albeit without Curt Menefee or Jimmy Johnson; the show will instead be hosted by panelist Michael Strahan from New York City, displacing Rich Eisen, the studio host for Thursday night pregame since the package's inception in 2006.[127] Strahan will be joined by fellow Fox colleagues Terry Bradshaw and Howie Long.\\r\\nThe start times for Thursday, Sunday, and Monday Night Football broadcasts will be moved up 5-15 minutes. Thursday and Sunday Night games will now kickoff at 8:20?p.m. ET, while Monday Night games will now kickoff at 8:15?p.m. ET.[65]","input":"What day does the 2018 nfl season start?"},{"output":"the national anthem of India","context":"Jana Gana Mana is the national anthem of India. It is composed in Bengali by poet Rabindranath Tagore.[1][2]. The composition consisting of the words and music of the first stanza of the late poet Rabindra Nath Tagores song known as Jana Gana Mana is the National Anthem of India. [3]\\r\\nThe song's Hindi version was adopted by the Constituent Assembly of India as the National Anthem on 24 January 1950.[4] A formal rendition of the national anthem takes approximately fifty-two seconds. A shortened version consisting of the first and last lines (and taking about 20?seconds to play) is also staged occasionally.[5] It was first publicly sung on 27 December 1911 at the Calcutta (now, Kolkata) Session of the Indian National Congress.[6] This is the first of five stanzas of Tagore's Bengali song Bharot Bhagyo Bidhata.[7]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe poem is written in a literary register of the Bengali language called sadhu bhasa. The song has been written almost entirely using nouns that also can function as verbs. Most of the nouns of the song are in use in all major languages in India. Therefore, the original song is quite clearly understandable, and in fact, remains almost unchanged in several widely different Indian languages.

Instructions have been issued from time to time about the correct versions of the Anthem, the occasions on which these are to be played or sung, and about the need for paying respect to the anthem by observance of proper decorum on such occasions. The substance of these instructions has been embodied in the information sheet issued by the government of India for general information and guidance. The approximate duration of the National Anthem of India is 52 seconds.[5]\\r\\nIn Kerala, students belonging to the Jehovah's Witnesses religious denomination were expelled by school authorities for their refusal to sing the national anthem on religious grounds, although they stood up respectfully when the anthem was sung.[12] The Kerala High Court concluded that there was nothing in it which could offend anyone's religious susceptibilities, and upheld their expulsion. On 11 August 1986,[13] the Supreme Court reversed the High Court and ruled that the High Court had misdirected itself because the question is not whether a particular religious belief or practice appeals to our reason or sentiment but whether the belief is genuinely and conscientiously held as part of the profession or practice of a religion. \\"Our personal views and reactions are irrelevant\\" The Supreme Court affirmed the principle that it is not for a secular judge to sit in judgment on the correctness of a religious belief.[14]\\r\\nSupreme Court observed in its ruling[15]\\r\\n\\"There is no provision of law which obliges anyone to sing the National Anthem nor is it disrespectful to the National Anthem if a person who stands up respectfully when the National Anthem is sung does not join the singing. Proper respect is shown to the National Anthem by standing up when the National Anthem is sung. It will not be right to say that disrespect is shown by not joining in the singing. Standing up respectfully when the National Anthem is sung but not singing oneself clearly does not either prevent the singing of the National Anthem or cause disturbance to an assembly engaged in such singing so as to constitute the offence mentioned in s. 3 of the Prevention of Insults to National Honour Act\\".\\r\\nOn 30 November 2016, Supreme Court of India ordered National Anthem must be played before movies in theaters, in order to instill \\"committed patriotism and nationalism\\".[16] On February 10, 2017, 2 Kashmiris were booked for not standing during anthem in Jammu Cinema, under provisions of the Prevention of Insults to National Honour Act, 1971. This was the first arrest of its kind made by a state government in India.[17][18]\\r\\nThe composition was first sung during a convention of the then loyalist Indian National Congress in Calcutta on 27 December 1911.[19] It was sung on the second day of the convention, and the agenda of that day devoted itself to a loyal welcome of George V on his visit to India. The event was reported thus in the British Indian press:\\r\\n\\"The Bengali poet Rabindranath Tagore sang a song composed by him specially to welcome the Emperor.\\" (Statesman, Dec. 28, 1911)\\r\\nMany historians aver that the newspaper reports cited above were misguided. The confusion arose in British Indian press since a different song, \\"Badshah Humara\\" written in Hindi by Rambhuj Chaudhary,[20] was sung on the same occasion in praise of the monarch. The nationalist Indian press stated this difference of events clearly:\\r\\n\\"The proceedings of the Congress party session started with a prayer in Bengali to praise God (song of benediction). This was followed by a resolution expressing loyalty to King George V. Then another song was sung welcoming King George V.\\" (Amrita Bazar Patrika, Dec.28,1911)\\r\\nEven the report of the annual session of the Indian National Congress of December 1911 stated this difference:\\r\\n\\"On the first day of 28th annual session of the Congress, proceedings started after singing Vande Mataram. On the second day the work began after singing a patriotic song by Babu Ravindranath Tagore. Messages from well wishers were then read and a resolution was passed expressing loyalty to King George V. Afterwards the song composed for welcoming King George V and Queen Mary was sung.\\"\\r\\nOn 10 November 1937 Tagore wrote a letter to Mr Pulin Bihari Sen about the controversy. That letter in Bengali can be found in Tagore's biography Ravindrajivani, volume II page 339 by Prabhatkumar Mukherjee.\\r\\n\\"A certain high official in His Majesty's service, who was also my friend, had requested that I write a song of felicitation towards the Emperor. The request simply amazed me. It caused a great stir in my heart. In response to that great mental turmoil, I pronounced the victory in Jana Gana Mana of that Bhagya Bidhata [ed. God of Destiny] of India who has from age after age held steadfast the reins of India's chariot through rise and fall, through the straight path and the curved. That Lord of Destiny, that Reader of the Collective Mind of India, that Perennial Guide, could never be George V, George VI, or any other George. Even my official friend understood this about the song. After all, even if his admiration for the crown was excessive, he was not lacking in simple common sense.\\"[21]\\r\\nAgain in his letter of 19 March 1939 Tagore writes:[22]\\r\\n\\"I should only insult myself if I cared to answer those who consider me capable of such unbounded stupidity as to sing in praise of George the Fourth or George the Fifth as the Eternal Charioteer leading the pilgrims on their journey through countless ages of the timeless history of mankind.\\" (Purvasa, Phalgun, 1354, p. 738.)\\r\\nMoreover, Tagore was hailed as a patriot who wrote other songs too apart from \\"Jana Gana Mana\\" lionising the Indian independence movement. He renounced his knighthood in protest against the 1919 Jallianwala Bagh Massacre. The Knighthood (i.e. the title of 'Sir') was conferred on him by the same King George V after receiving the Nobel Prize in Literature for \\"Gitanjali\\" from the government of Sweden. Two of Tagore's more politically charged compositions, \\"Chitto Jetha Bhayshunyo\\" (\\"Where the Mind is Without Fear\\", Gitanjali Poem #35) and \\"Ekla Chalo Re\\" (\\"If They Answer Not to Thy Call, Walk Alone\\"), gained mass appeal, with the latter favoured by Gandhi and Netaji.[citation needed]\\r\\nAnother controversy is that only those provinces that were under British rule, i.e. Punjab, Sindh, Gujarat, Maratha, Dravid (South India), Odisha and Bengal, were mentioned. None of the princely states ÿ Kashmir, Rajasthan, Hyderabad, Mysore or Kerala ÿ or the states in Northeast India, which are now integral parts of India were mentioned. But opponents of this proposition claim that Tagore mentioned only the border states of India to include complete India. Whether the princely states would form a part of a liberated Indian republic was a matter of debate even till Indian Independence. 'Dravida' includes the people from the south (though Dravida specifically means Tamil and even then, the same consideration is not given for the south since there are many distinct people whereas in the north each of the distinct people are named) and 'Jolodhi' (Stanza 1) is Sanskrit for \\"seas and oceans\\". Even North-East which was under British rule or holy rivers apart from Ganges and Yamuna are not mentioned to keep the song in its rhythm. India has 29 states, 7 union territories.\\r\\nIn 2005, there were calls to delete the word \\"Sindh\\" and substitute it with the word Kashmir. The argument was that Sindh was no longer a part of India, having become part of Pakistan as a result of the Partition of 1947. Opponents of this proposal hold that the word \\"Sindh\\" refers to the Indus and to Sindhi culture, and that Sindhi people are an integral part of India's cultural fabric. The Supreme Court of India declined to change the national anthem and the wording remains unchanged.\\r\\nOn 17 December 2013, MLA of Assam, Phani bhushan Choudhury cited article of 'The Times of India' published on 26 January 1950, stating that in the originally the word 'Kamarup' was included in the song, but was later changed to 'Sindhu' and claimed that Kamarup should be re-included.[23] To this, the then minister Rockybul Hussain replied that the state government would initiate steps in this regard after response from the newspaper.[23] The debate was further joined by the then minister Ardhendu Dey, mentioning 'Sanchayita' (edited by Tagore himself) etc. where he said Kamrup was not mentioned.[23]","input":"What is the raga of jana gana mana?"},{"output":"16th century","context":"","input":"When did the north american fur trade start?"},{"output":"December 9, 1965","context":"A Charlie Brown Christmas is a 1965 animated television special based on the comic strip Peanuts, by Charles M. Schulz. Produced by Lee Mendelson and directed by Bill Melendez, the program made its debut on CBS on December 9, 1965. In the special, lead character Charlie Brown finds himself depressed despite the onset of the cheerful holiday season. Lucy suggests he direct a neighborhood Christmas play, but his best efforts are ignored and mocked by his peers. After Linus tells Charlie Brown about the true meaning of Christmas, Charlie Brown cheers up, and the Peanuts gang unites to celebrate the Christmas season.\\r\\nPeanuts had become a phenomenon worldwide by the mid-1960s, and the special was commissioned and sponsored by The Coca-Cola Company. It was written over a period of several weeks, and animated on a shoestring budget in only six months. In casting the characters, the producers went an unconventional route, hiring child actors. The program's soundtrack was similarly unorthodox: it features a jazz score by pianist Vince Guaraldi. Its absence of a laugh track (a staple in US television animation in this period), in addition to its tone, pacing, music, and animation, led both the producers and network to wrongly predict the project would be a disaster preceding its broadcast.\\r\\nContrary to that apprehension, A Charlie Brown Christmas received high ratings and acclaim from critics. It has since been honored with both an Emmy and Peabody Award. It became an annual broadcast in the United States, and has been aired during the Christmas season traditionally every year since its premiere. Its success paved the way for a series of Peanuts television specials and films. Its jazz soundtrack also achieved commercial success, selling 4 million copies in the US. Live theatrical versions of A Charlie Brown Christmas have been staged. ABC currently holds the rights to the special and broadcasts it at least twice during the weeks leading up to Christmas.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Peanuts are celebrating the start of the winter season by ice skating on a frozen pond and singing \\"Christmas Time Is Here.\\" Leaning against a nearby fence, Charlie Brown tells Linus that despite all the traditions of Christmas presents, Christmas cards and decorations, he still winds up depressed, but is not sure why. Linus dismisses Charlie Brown's attitude as typical, quoting Lucy: \\"Of all the Charlie Browns in the world, you're the Charlie Browniest.\\"\\r\\nCharlie Brown's depression is only made worse by the goings-on in the neighborhood, most of which show his peers' rampant commercialism. He encounters Violet and sarcastically \\"thanks\\" her for the Christmas card he never received, only for Violet to proudly snipe back that she never sent him one. At the psychiatric booth, Lucy expresses joy in the sound of jingling money, tries to diagnose Charlie Brown with various phobias, admits she never receives her Christmas wish of real estate, and ultimately decides that Charlie Brown needs more involvement. Lucy recommends that Charlie Brown direct an upcoming Christmas play and offers to help him do so. At Snoopy's doghouse, Charlie Brown is further disgusted when he finds out that his dog has entered the doghouse into a lights and display contest with a cash prize. He is finally accosted by his sister Sally, who asks him to write her letter to Santa Claus. When she hints at having an extremely long and specific list of requests, and says she will accept large sums of money as a substitute (\\"tens and twenties\\"), Charlie Brown becomes even more dismayed and runs off.\\r\\nCharlie Brown arrives at the rehearsal, but he is unable to gain control of the situation, since everyone in the play has their own complaints, and everybody would rather dance along to the jazz-rock band (consisting of Schroeder on keyboards, Snoopy on an inaudible electric guitar and Pig-Pen on bass). The play is revealed to be quite modern, with an upbeat jazz score, a \\"Christmas queen,\\" shepherds, innkeepers and penguins but no identifiable Biblical figures. A displeased Charlie Brown decides the play needs \\"the proper mood\\" and suggests they should get a Christmas tree. Lucy instructs him, and the accompanying Linus, to get an aluminum Christmas tree that is big, shiny and pink from a nearby tree lot.\\r\\nWhen they get to the lot, filled with numerous trees fitting Lucy's description, Charlie Brown ironically and symbolically chooses the only real tree there (in disbelief that wooden Christmas trees still exist)a tiny sapling. Linus is unsure about Charlie Brown's choice, but Charlie Brown is convinced that all it needs is some decoration and it will be just right. While those two get the tree, Schroeder tries to pass off \\"Fr Elise\\" as a Christmas song, while Lucy tries to get him to play the perfect rendition of \\"Jingle Bells;\\" after two failed attempts, Schroeder tersely pecks the keys on his toy piano, which is exactly what Lucy seeks.\\r\\nLinus and Charlie Brown return to the auditorium with the tree, only to be scorned by Lucy and the other girls who, along with Snoopy, walk off laughing. At his wit's end, Charlie Brown loudly asks if anybody knows what Christmas is all about. Linus says he does and, after walking to center stage, recites the annunciation to the shepherds from the Gospel of Luke, chapter 2, verses 8 through 14, as translated by the Authorized King James Version:\\r\\n\\"8And there were in the same country shepherds abiding in the field, keeping watch over their flock by night.\\r\\n9And, lo, the angel of the Lord came upon them, and the glory of the Lord shone round about them: and they were sore afraid.\\r\\n10And the angel said unto them, Fear not; for, behold, I bring you tidings of great joy, which shall be to all people.\\r\\n11For unto you is born this day in the city of David a Savior, which is Christ the Lord.\\r\\n12And this shall be a sign unto you: Ye shall find the babe wrapped in swaddling clothes, lying in a manger.\\r\\n13And suddenly there was with the angel a multitude of the heavenly host praising God, and saying,\\r\\n14Glory to God in the highest, and on earth peace and goodwill towards men.\\"\\r\\nLinus then walks back over to Charlie Brown and gently says, \\"That's what Christmas is all about, Charlie Brown.\\"\\r\\nCharlie Brown quietly picks up the tree and walks out of the auditorium toward home, now determined not to let commercialism ruin the holiday. He stops at Snoopy's decorated doghouse, which now sports a blue ribbon for winning the display contest. He takes a large ornament from the doghouse and hangs it at the top of his tree, but the branch, seemingly unable to hold the ornament's weight, promptly droops to the ground. Believing he has killed the tree, Charlie Brown walks off in shame, believing he has ruined everything.\\r\\nLinus and the others, who realized they were too hard on Charlie Brown, quietly followed him to Snoopy's doghouse. Linus admits he always liked the tree while gently propping the drooping branch back in its upright position and wraps his blanket around its base, and when the others add the remaining decorations from Snoopy's doghouse to the tree, Lucy agrees. They start humming \\"Hark! The Herald Angels Sing\\". Charlie Brown returns, surprised at the humming and the redecorated tree, and the gang all joyously shout \\"Merry Christmas, Charlie Brown!\\" They all begin to sing \\"Hark! The Herald Angels Sing,\\" and Charlie Brown joins them as the special ends.\\r\\nBy the early 1960s, Charles M. Schulz's comic strip Peanuts had become a sensation worldwide.[2] Television producer Lee Mendelson acknowledged the strip's cultural impression and had an idea for a documentary on its success, phoning Schulz to propose the idea. Schulz, an avid baseball fan, recognized Mendelson from his documentary on ballplayer Willie Mays, A Man Named Mays, and invited him to his home in Sebastopol, California, to discuss the project.[3] Their meeting was cordial, with the plan to produce a half-hour documentary set. Mendelson wanted to feature roughly \\"one or two\\" minutes of animation, and Schulz suggested animator Bill Melendez, with whom he collaborated some years before on a spot for the Ford Motor Company.[4]\\r\\nDespite the popularity of the strip and acclaim from advertisers, networks were not interested in the special.[5] By April 1965, Time featured the Peanuts gang on its magazine cover, perhaps prompting a call from John Allen of the New York-based McCann Erickson Agency.[2] Mendelson imagined he would sell his documentary, and blindly agreed to Allen's proposal: an animated half-hour Peanuts Christmas special.[5] The Coca-Cola Company was looking for a special for advertising during the holiday season. \\"The bad news is that today is Wednesday and they'll need an outline in Atlanta by Monday,\\" Allen remarked to Mendelson.[6] He quickly contacted Schulz, and the duo got to work with plans for a Peanuts Christmas special.[2] The duo prepared an outline for the Coca-Cola executives in less than one day, and Mendelson would later recall that the bulk of ideas came from Schulz, whose \\"ideas flowed nonstop.\\"[7] According to Mendelson, their pitch to Coca-Cola consisted of \\"winter scenes, a school play, a scene to be read from the Bible, and a sound track combining jazz and traditional music.\\"[8] The outline did not change over the course of its production.[9]\\r\\nAs Allen was in Europe, the duo received no feedback on their pitch for several days.[7] When Allen got in touch with them, he informed them that Coca-Cola wanted to buy the special, but also wanted it for an early December broadcast, giving the duo just six months to scramble together a team to produce the special. Mendelson assured him ÿ without complete confidence in his statements ÿ that this would be no problem. Following this, A Charlie Brown Christmas entered production.[7]\\r\\nSchulz's main goal for a Peanuts-based Christmas special was to focus on the true meaning of Christmas.[7] He desired to juxtapose this theme with interspersed shots of snow and ice-skating, perhaps inspired by his own childhood growing up in St. Paul, Minnesota.[7] He also created the idea for the school play, and mixing jazz with traditional Christmas carols.[7] Schulz was adamant about Linus' reading of the Bible, despite Mendelson and Melendez's concerns that religion was a controversial topic, especially on television.[9] Melendez recalled Schulz turned to him and remarked \\"If we don't do it, who will?\\".[2] Schulz's estimation proved accurate, and in the 1960s, less than 9 percent of television Christmas episodes contained a substantive reference to religion, according to university researcher Stephen Lind.[10] It could also be worth noting that the Linus's recitation of Scripture was incorporated in such a way that it forms the climax of the film, thus making it impossible to successfully edit out.\\r\\nSchulz's faith in the Bible stemmed from his Midwest background and religious and historical studies;[9] as such, aspects of religion would be a topic of study throughout his life.[11] According to a 2015 \\"spiritual biography\\", Schulz's religion was personal and complex, and would be integrated in a number of his programs.[12]\\r\\nThe program's script has been described as \\"barebones\\", and was completed in only a few weeks.[13] In the days following the special's sell to Coca-Cola, Mendelson and animator Bill Melendez met with Schulz in his home to expand upon the ideas promised in the pitch. Mendelson noted that on the previous Christmas Day he and his spouse had read Hans Christian Andersen's \\"The Fir-Tree\\" to their children.[8] Schulz countered with the idea that there be a tree with the spirit of lead character Charlie Brown.[14] Mendelson suggested they employ a laugh track, a staple of television animation, but Schulz rejected this idea immediately.[14] He felt strongly that the audience should not be informed on when to laugh.[13] They spoke at length about creating an official theme that was neither jazz nor traditional to open the program. Schulz wanted a part of the special to feature the character of Schroeder performing Beethoven, and Mendelson combined this with the inclusion of Guaraldi's \\"Linus & Lucy\\" number.[14] Schulz penned the script for A Charlie Brown Christmas, with Melendez plotting out the animation via a storyboard. His storyboard contained six panels for each shot, spanning a combined eighty or-so pages.[14]\\r\\nIn casting the silent comic strip characters of Peanuts, the trio pulled from their personalities.[15] Lead character Charlie Brown's voice was decided to be downbeat and nondescript (\\"blah,\\" as Mendelson noted), while Lucy be bold and forthright.[15] Linus' voice, it was decided, would combine both sophistication with childlike innocence.[15] Mendelson recognized that the character of Snoopy was the strip's most popular character who seemed to seize \\"the best jokes,\\" but realized they could not cast a voice for the cartoon dog. \\"In the process, we gained a veritable 'canine Harpo Marx,'\\" Mendelson later wrote.[15] Melendez suggested he provide gibberish for Snoopy's mutterings, and simply speed up the tape to prevent viewers from knowing.[15] There are no adult characters in the strip or in this special. Later specials would introduce an offscreen teacher; her lines are eschewed for the sound of a trombone as the team behind the specials found it humorous.[16]\\r\\nWith this in mind, the trio set out to cast the characters, which proved to be a daunting process. Casting for Charlie Brown proved most difficult, as it required both good acting skills but also the ability to appear nonchalant.[14] The producers picked eight-year-old Peter Robbins, already known for his roles spanning television, film, and advertisements.[15] His godmother, famous Hollywood agent Hazel McMillen, discovered Christopher Shea, who would become Linus in the special.[15] His slight lisp, according to Mendelson, gave him a \\"youthful sweetness,\\" while his emotional script reading \\"gave him power and authority as well.\\"[17] Tracy Stratford played the role of Lucy, with the creators being impressed by her attitude and professionalism.[18] Kathy Steinberg was the youngest of the performers, just six years old at the time of recording. Too young to read, the producers had to give her one line at a time to recite.[18] Robbins remembered Melendez did this for him as well, joking that he also mistakenly copied his Latino accent.[2] Mendelson desired to have non-actors (not \\"Hollywood kids\\") perform on the special, and he sent tape recorders home with his employees for their children to audition.[13]\\r\\nMuch of the background cast came from Mendelson's home neighborhood in northern California.[18] According to Robbins, the children viewed the script's sophisticated dialogue as \\"edgy,\\" finding several words and phrases, among them \\"eastern syndicate\\", difficult to pronounce.[15] He recalled the recording sessions as chaotic, with excited children running rampant. Nevertheless, the recording of A Charlie Brown Christmas was completed in one day.[15] Jefferson Airplane was recording next door and came over to get the children's autographs.[2] Following the special's broadcast, the children became wildly popular in their respective elementary schools; Robbins recalled groups approaching him asking him to recite lines of dialogue.[18]\\r\\nAnimation for A Charlie Brown Christmas was created by Bill Melendez Productions. Mendelson had no idea whether or not completing a half-hour's worth of animation would be possible given the production's six-month schedule, but Melendez confirmed its feasibility.[8] In actuality, animation was only completed in the final four months of production.[19] CBS initially wanted an hour's worth of animation, but Melendez talked them down to a half-hour special, believing an hour of television animation was too much.[1] Having never worked on a half-hour special before, Melendez phoned Bill Hanna of Hanna-Barbera for advice, who declined to give any. CBS gave a budget of $76,000 to produce the show, and it went over budget, costing $96,000.[1] The first step in creating the animation was to make a pencil drawing, afterwards inking and painting the drawing onto a cel.[2] The cel was then placed onto a painted background. There are 13,000 drawings in the special, with 12 frames per second to create the illusion of movement.[2]\\r\\nMelendez had previously worked for Warner Bros. and Disney, and working on Peanuts-related material gave him a chance to animate a truly flat, cartoon design.[20] The movement of Schulz's characters, particularly the Peanuts gang, was very limited. The character of Snoopy, however, proved the exception to the rule. \\"He can do anything ÿ move and dance ÿ and he's very easy to animate,\\" said Melendez.[20]\\r\\nThe soundtrack to A Charlie Brown Christmas is an unorthodox mix of traditional Christmas music and jazz. The jazz portions were created by the Vince Guaraldi Trio. Producer Lee Mendelson, a fan of jazz, heard Guaraldi's crossover hit \\"Cast Your Fate to the Wind\\" on the radio not long after completion of his documentary Charlie Brown & Charles Schulz, and contacted the musician to produce music for the special.[4] Guaraldi composed the music for the project, creating an entire piece, \\"Linus and Lucy,\\" to serve as the theme.[5] When Coca-Cola commissioned A Charlie Brown Christmas in spring 1965, Guaraldi returned to write the music.[2] The first instrumentals for the special were recorded by Guaraldi at Glendale, California's Whitney Studio with bassist Monty Budwig and drummer Colin Bailey.[21] Recycling \\"Linus and Lucy\\" from the earlier special, Guaraldi completed two new originals for the special, \\"Skating\\", and \\"Christmas Time Is Here\\".[21] In the weeks preceding the premiere, Mendelson encountered trouble finding a lyricist for Guaraldi's instrumental intro, and penned \\"Christmas Time is Here\\" in \\"about 15 minutes\\" on the backside of an envelope.[9]\\r\\nThe special opens and closes with a choir of children, culled from St. Paul's Episcopal Church in San Rafael, California, performing \\"Christmas Time Is Here\\" and \\"Hark! The Herald Angels Sing\\".[18] One of the singers, Candace Hackett Shively, went on to become an elementary school teacher, and sent a letter of gratitude to Schulz after he announced his retirement in 2000.[18] In the letter, she recalls recording the choir at Fantasy Studios and going out for ice cream afterwards, while also noting that she tells the story to her grade-schoolers each holiday season.[16] The recording sessions were conducted in late autumn 1965, and were cut in three separate sessions over two weeks. They often ran late into the night, resulting in angry parents, some who forbade their children from returning; consequently, numerous new children were present at each session.[22] The children were directed by Barry Mineah, who demanded perfection from the choir. Mendelson and Guaraldi disagreed, desiring the \\"kids to sound like kids\\"; they used a slightly off-key version of \\"Hark! The Herald Angels Sing\\" in the final cut.[22] Children were paid five dollars for their participation. In addition, the children recorded dialogue for the special's final scene, in which the crowd of kids shout \\"Merry Christmas, Charlie Brown!\\"[22]\\r\\nThe soundtrack for the special was recorded during these sessions, with decisions regarding timing and phrasing determined quickly. Guaraldi brought in bassist Fred Marshall and drummer Jerry Granelli to record the music, and spent time later re-recording earlier tracks, including covers of \\"The Christmas Song\\" and \\"Greensleeves.\\" The eventual LP release credited Guaraldi solely, neglecting to mention the other musicians; Guaraldi was notorious for never keeping records of his session players.[23] Nearly three decades later, in an effort to correct the matter, Fantasy surmised that the recordings with Budwig and Bailey were employed in the special, while Marshall and Granelli recorded the album.[23] Despite this, other individuals have come forward claiming to have recorded the special's music: bassists Eugene Firth and Al Obidinksi, and drummers Paul Distel and Benny Barth. Firth and Distil are noted as performers on a studio-session report Guaraldi filed for the American Federation of Musicians.[23]\\r\\nA Charlie Brown Christmas was voted into the Grammy Hall of Fame in 2007,[24] and added to the Library of Congress's National Recording Registry list of \\"culturally, historically, or aesthetically important\\" American sound recordings in 2012.[25]\\r\\nA Charlie Brown Christmas was completed just ten days shy of its national broadcast premiere.[2] All involved believed the special would be an unmitigated disaster. Melendez first saw the completed animation at a showing in a theater in the days before its premiere, turning to his crew of animators and remarking, \\"My golly, we've killed it.\\"[2] Melendez was embarrassed, but one of the animators, Ed Levitt, was more positive regarding the special, telling him it was \\"the best special [he'll] ever make [...] This show is going to run for a hundred years.\\"[2][1] Mendelson was similar in his assumptions of the show's quality, and when he showed the film to network executives in New York, their opinions were also negative. Their complaints included the show's slow pace, the music not fitting, and the animation too simple. \\"I really believed, if it hadn't been scheduled for the following week, there's no way they were gonna broadcast that show,\\" Mendelson later said.[2] Executives had invited television critic Richard Burgheim of Time to view the special, and debated as to whether showing it to him would be a good idea.[9] His review, printed the following week, was positive, praising the special as unpretentious and writing that \\"A Charlie Brown Christmas is one children's special this season that bears repeating.\\"[26]\\r\\nThe program premiered on CBS on December 9, 1965, at 7:30?pm ET (pre-empting The Munsters),[27] and was viewed by 45% of those watching television that evening,[13] with the number of homes watching the special an estimated 15,490,000, placing it at number two in the ratings, behind Bonanza on NBC.[2] The special received unanimous critical acclaim: The Hollywood Reporter deemed the show \\"delightfully novel and amusing,\\" while the Weekly Variety dubbed it \\"fascinating and haunting.\\"[28] Bob Williams of the New York Post praised the \\"very neat transition from comic page to screen,\\" while Lawrence Laurent of The Washington Post declared that \\"natural-born loser Charlie Brown finally turned up a real winner last night.\\"[29] Harriet Van Horne of the New York World-Telegram hailed the scene in which Linus recites scripture, commenting, \\"Linus' reading of the story of the Nativity was, quite simply, the dramatic highlight of the season.\\"[29] Harry Harris of The Philadelphia Inquirer called the program \\"a yule classic [...] generated quiet warmth and amusement,\\" and Terrence O'Flaherty of the San Francisco Chronicle wrote, \\"Charlie Brown was a gem of a television show.\\"[28] Ben Gross of the New York Daily News praised the special's \\"charm and good taste,\\" while Rick DuBrow of United Press International predicted, \\"the Peanuts characters last night staked out a claim to a major television future.\\"[29]\\r\\nThe show's glowing reviews were highlighted with an ad in trade magazines;[30] one thanked Coca-Cola, CBS, United Features Syndicate, and the show's viewers.[28] Fantasy released the special's soundtrack the first week of December 1965, coinciding with the special's airdate.[31] United Feature Syndicate pushed hard to promote the special, while Word Publishing issued a hardcover adaption of the special.[31] CBS promptly ordered four additional Peanuts specials.[9] A Charlie Brown Christmas was awarded the Emmy Award for Outstanding Children's Program in 1966. \\"Charlie Brown is not used to winning, so we thank you,\\" Schulz joked.[2]\\r\\nAlthough originally broadcast on the CBS network from 1965 until December 25, 2000, in January 2000, the broadcast rights were acquired by ABC, which is where the special currently airs, usually twice, in December.\\r\\nThe original broadcasts included references to the sponsor, Coca-Cola.[32][33] Subsequent broadcasts and home media releases have excised all references to Coca-Cola products. Later subsequent broadcasts of the special also had some scenes, animation, including sound effects being redone for correction. Snoopy's dog bowl was given a new color, Charlie Brown no longer looked off-model in Lucy's psychiatric booth, new animation was placed in scenes where Charlie Brown was giving directions at the auditorium, the hearts when Sally gets enamored in Linus were redone, and Snoopy no longer sings like a human in the final carol.[34]\\r\\nOn December 6, 2001, a half-hour documentary on the special titled The Making of 'A Charlie Brown Christmas' (hosted by Whoopi Goldberg) aired on ABC. This documentary has been released as a special feature on the DVD and Blu-ray editions of the special.\\r\\nThe show's 40th anniversary broadcast on Tuesday, December 6, 2005, had the highest ratings in its time slot[citation needed].\\r\\nThe 50th anniversary broadcast aired on November 30, 2015, and it featured a full two-hour time slot that was padded by a special, It's Your 50th Christmas, Charlie Brown, which was hosted by Kristen Bell, and featured musical performances by Kristin Chenoweth, Matthew Morrison, Sarah McLachlan, Boyz II Men, Pentatonix, David Benoit, and the All-American Boys Chorus.[35] It also included documentary features.[36]\\r\\nIn 1987 the special was released on VHS by Hi-Tops Video. In 1992, the special was released for a limited time on VHS through Shell Oil for sale at their gas stations.[citation needed]\\r\\nIn September 1994 the special was released by Paramount on VHS. A laserdisc was released by Paramount (distributed by Pioneer) in 1996; Side 2 contained the 1979 special You're the Greatest, Charlie Brown. In September 2000 it was released on DVD. Bonus features included the 1992 special It's Christmastime Again, Charlie Brown. On September 23, 2008, Warner Home Video (to which the rights to the Peanuts specials reverted earlier in the year, due to Melendez's connections to WB) released a \\"remastered\\" DVD. Bonus features include a restored version of Christmastime Again and a new documentary titled \\"A Christmas Miracle: The Making of A Charlie Brown Christmas\\".\\r\\nOn October 6, 2009, it was released in high definition Blu-ray Disc from Warner in remastered Dolby 5.1 surround sound. This disc also contains It's Christmastime Again, A Christmas Miracle, a DVD of the special, and a Digital Copy.[37]\\r\\nSince off-network rights to this special have been transferred to Warner Bros., it has become available as a download on the iTunes Store, PlayStation Network, Amazon Instant Video, and Google Play, and includes It's Christmastime Again, Charlie Brown and It's Flashbeagle, Charlie Brown.\\r\\nIn December 2014, a 50th anniversary 2-DVD set was released. It also features the special It's Christmastime Again, Charlie Brown, and the Making of... documentary from previous editions.\\r\\nOn October 31, 2017, it was released on 4K UHD Blu-ray disc containing It's Christmastime Again, Charlie Brown and the Making of... special.\\r\\nA Charlie Brown Christmas became a Christmas staple in the United States for several decades afterward. Within the scope of future Peanuts specials, it established their style, combining thoughtful themes, jazzy scores, and simple animation.[38] It also, according to author Charles Solomon, established the half-hour animated special as a television tradition, inspiring the creation of numerous others, including How the Grinch Stole Christmas! (1966) and Frosty the Snowman (1969).[38] (Earlier animated specials such as Mr. Magoo's Christmas Carol and Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer ran a full hour.) USA Today summarized the program's appeal upon its 40th anniversary in 2005: \\"Scholars of pop culture say that shining through the program's skeletal plot is the quirky and sophisticated genius that fueled the phenomenal popularity of Schulz's work.\\"[13] Beyond its references to religion, unheard of on television at the time, the special also marked the first time children voiced animated characters.[13]\\r\\nThe special influenced dozens of young aspiring artists and animators, many of whom went on to work within both the comics and animation industries, among them Eric Goldberg (Pocahontas),[39] Pete Docter (Monsters, Inc., Up), Andrew Stanton (Finding Nemo, WALL-E),[1] Jef Mallett (Frazz),[38] and Patrick McDonnell (Mutts).[40] The show's score made an equally pervasive impact on viewers who would later perform jazz, among them David Benoit[41] and George Winston.[31] More directly, the special launched a series of Peanuts films, TV specials (many of them holiday-themed) and other works of entertainment.\\r\\nLinus' speech near the end of the special was used in the Sidewalk Prophets Christmas song \\"What a Glorious Night\\".[42]\\r\\nIn 2013 Tams-Witmark Music Library, Inc. began licensing an official stage version of the television special authorized by the Schulz family and Lee Mendelson.[43] The stage version follows the television special but includes an optional sing-along section of Christmas songs at the end. It includes all of Vince Guaraldi's music from the television special and the television script is adapted for the stage by Eric Schaeffer. It has been performed at hundreds of schools, churches and community theatres.\\r\\nThe popularity of the special practically eliminated the popularity of the aluminum Christmas tree, which was a fad from 1958 to 1965, when the special portrayed it negatively. By 1967, just two years after the special first aired, they were no longer being regularly manufactured.[44][45][46][47]\\r\\nThe \\"Charlie Brown Christmas Tree\\" has been used to comedic effect with people familiar with the special and has become synonymous with poorly executed or minimalist Christmas decorating. A model of the tree is offered by various retailers.\\r\\nThree lesser-known Christmas specials were produced decades after the 1965 original.","input":"When was a charlie brown christmas first aired?"},{"output":"Land Rover","context":"\\r\\n\\r\\nLand Rover is a car brand that specialises in four-wheel-drive vehicles, owned by British multinational car manufacturer Jaguar Land Rover, which has been owned by India's Tata Motors since 2008.[4] The Land Rover is regarded as a British icon, and was granted a Royal Warrant by King George VI in 1951.[5][6]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Land Rover name was originally used by the Rover Company for the Land Rover Series, launched in 1948. It developed into a brand encompassing a range of four-wheel-drive models, including the Defender, Discovery, Freelander, Range Rover, Range Rover Sport, and Range Rover Evoque.\\r\\n\\r\\nLand Rovers are currently assembled in England, India, China, and other markets.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe design for the original vehicle was started in 1947 by Maurice Wilks. It was simply called Land Rover (the terms \\"Series\\" and \\"Defender\\" are retroactive and only introduced in the 1990s). Wilks, chief designer at the Rover Company, on his farm in Newborough, Anglesey, working in conjunction with his brother Spencer who was the  managing director of Rover.[7] The design may have been influenced by the Jeep[8] and the prototype, later nicknamed Centre Steer, was built on a Jeep chassis and axles.[9] The early choice of colour was dictated by military surplus supplies of aircraft cockpit paint, so early vehicles only came in various shades of light green; all models until recently feature sturdy box section ladder-frame chassis. Early vehicles like the Series I were field-tested at Long Bennington and designed to be field-serviced.\\r\\n\\r\\nLand Rover as a company has existed since 1978. Prior to this, it was a product line of the Rover Company which was subsequently absorbed into the Rover-Triumph division of the British Leyland Motor Corporation (BL) following Leyland Motor Corporations takeover of Rover in 1967. The ongoing commercial success of the original Land Rover series models, and latterly the Range Rover in the 1970s in the midst of BL's well-documented business troubles prompted the establishment of a separate Land Rover company but still under the BL umbrella, remaining part of the subsequent Rover Group in 1988, under the ownership of British Aerospace after the remains of British Leyland were broken up and privatised.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1994 Rover Group PLC, including Land Rover, was acquired by BMW. In 2000, Rover Group was broken up by BMW and Land Rover was sold to Ford Motor Company, becoming part of its Premier Automotive Group.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 2006 Ford also purchased the Rover brand from BMW for around S6 million. BMW had retained ownership of the brand to protect the integrity of the Land Rover brand, with which 'Rover' might be confused in the US 4x4 market and allowed it to be used under licence by MG Rover until it collapsed in 2005, at which point it was offered to the Ford Motor Company, who by then owned Land Rover. On 11 June 2007, Ford announced that it planned to sell Land Rover along with Jaguar Cars. Private equity firms such as Alchemy Partners of the UK, TPG Capital, Ripplewood Holdings, Cerberus Capital Management and One Equity Partners of the US, Tata Motors of India and a consortium comprising Mahindra and Mahindra of India and Apollo Management all initially expressed interest in purchasing the marques from the Ford Motor Company.[10][11] On 1 January 2008, Ford formally declared that Tata was the preferred bidder.[12] In 2008, On 26 March 2008, Ford announced that it had agreed to sell its Jaguar and Land Rover operations to Tata Motors of India, and that they expected to complete the sale by the end of the second quarter of 2008.[13]\\r\\n\\r\\nOn 18 January 2008, Tata Motors, a part of the Tata Group, established Jaguar Land Rover Limited as a British-registered and wholly owned subsidiary. The new company was to be used as a holding company for the acquisition of the two businesses from Ford - Jaguar Cars Limited and Land Rover. That acquisition was completed on 2 June 2008 at a cost of S1.7?billion.[14][15][16][17] Included in the deal to buy Land Rover and Jaguar Cars were the rights to three other British brands: the Daimler marque, as well as two dormant brands Lanchester and Rover.[18]\\r\\n\\r\\nOn 1 January 2013, the group, which had been operating as two separate companies (Jaguar Cars Limited and Land Rover), although on an integrated basis, underwent a fundamental restructuring. The parent company was renamed to Jaguar Land Rover Automotive PLC, Jaguar Cars Limited was renamed to Jaguar Land Rover Limited and the assets (excluding certain Chinese interests) of Land Rover were transferred to it. The consequence was that Jaguar Land Rover Limited became responsible in the UK for the design, manufacture and marketing of both Jaguar and Land Rover branded products, and Land Rover and Jaguar Cars ceased to be separate vehicle producing entities.[19]\\r\\n\\r\\nLand Rovers were manufactured primarily at the Solihull plant, near Birmingham, but production of the Freelander was moved to the Halewood Body & Assembly plant near Liverpool, a former Ford car plant. The Freelander is also assembled in knock-down kit (CKD) form at Land Rover's facility in Pune, India.[30] As of 2015, the company continued to expand by building locally in India as well as increasing the number of models made at JLRs Chikhali facility near Pune to include the Discovery Sport and Evoque.[31]\\r\\n\\r\\nDefender models are assembled under licence in several locations worldwide, including Spain (Santana Motors), Iran (Pazhan Morattab), Brazil (Karmann), and Turkey (Otokar).[32]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn May 2010, Tata Motors announced that it plans to build Land Rover and Jaguar models in Mainland China (PRC) as the company seeks to cut costs and expand sales.[33]\\r\\n\\r\\n[34]\\r\\n\\r\\nRange Stormer ÿ Land Rover's first concept vehicle, unveiled at the 2004 North American International Auto Show, later became the Range Rover Sport.(Gritzinger, 2004).\\r\\n\\r\\nLand Rover LRX ÿ Land Rover's second concept vehicle, first unveiled at the 2008 Detroit Auto Show. Originally a vehicle with ERAD technology, the production version did not include this.

ERAD programme is one of a broad range of sustainability-focused engineering programmes that Land Rover is pursuing, brought together by the company under the collective name \\"e TERRAIN Technologies\\".[38]\\r\\n\\r\\nLand Rover presented at the 2008 London Motor Show its new ERAD diesel-electric hybrid in a pair of Freelander 2 (LR2) prototypes. The new hybrid system is being designed as a scalable and modular system that could be applied across a variety of Land Rover models and powertrains.[39]\\r\\n\\r\\nLand Rover unveiled the LRX hybrid concept at the 2008 North American International Auto Show in Detroit, for it to be going into production.[40] An ERAD will enable the car to run on electric power at speeds below 20?mph (32?km/h).[41]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn September 2011, the Range Rover Evoque was launched, though it was based on the LRX hybrid concept presented at the 2008 North American International Auto Show, it did not include the ERAD system, included in the original concept.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn February 2013, Land Rover unveiled[42][43] at the 83rd Geneva Motor Show an All-Terrain Electric Defender that produces zero emissions. The electric vehicle was developed for research purposes following successful trials of the Defender-based electric vehicle, Leopard 1. The vehicle is capable of producing 70kW and 330Nm of torque and has a range of 80 kilometres or in low speed off-road use it can last for up to eight hours before recharging.\\r\\n\\r\\nPower take-off (PTO) was integral to the Land Rover concept from 1948, enabling farm machinery and many other items to be run with the vehicle stationary. Maurice Wilks' original instruction was \\"...to have power take-offs everywhere!\\" The 1949 report by British National Institute of Agricultural Engineering and Scottish Machinery Testing Station contained this description: \\"the power take-off is driven through a Hardy Spicer propeller shaft from the main gearbox output and two interchangeable pinions giving two ratios. The PTO gearbox casing is bolted to the rear chassis cross-member and an 8 by 8 inches (200?mm G?200?mm) belt pulley driven from the PTO shaft through two bevel gears can be bolted to the PTO gearbox casing.\\" PTOs remained regular options on Series I, II and III Land Rovers up to the demise of the Series Land Rover in 1985. An agricultural PTO on a Defender is possible as a special order.\\r\\n\\r\\nLand Rovers (the Series/Defender models) are available in a variety of body styles, from a simple canvas-topped pick-up truck to a twelve-seat fully trimmed station wagon. Both Land Rover and out-of-house contractors have offered conversions and adaptations to the basic vehicle, such as fire engines, excavators, 'cherry picker' hydraulic platforms, ambulances, snowploughs, and six-wheel-drive versions, as well as one-off special builds including amphibious Land Rovers and vehicles fitted with tracks instead of wheels.\\r\\n\\r\\nVarious Land Rover models have been used in a military capacity, most notably by the British Army and Australian Army. Modifications may include military \\"blackout\\" lights, heavy-duty suspension, uprated brakes, 24?volt electrics, convoy lights, electronic suppression of the ignition system, blackout curtains and mounts for special equipment and small arms. Dedicated military models have been produced such as the 101 Forward Control and the air-portable 1/2?ton Lightweight. Military uses include light utility vehicle; communications platform; weapon platform for recoilless rifles, Anti-tank (e.g. TOW or M40 recoilless rifle) / Surface-to-Air Guided Weapons or machine guns; ambulances and workshops. The Discovery has also been used in small numbers, mostly as liaison vehicles.\\r\\n\\r\\nTwo models that have been designed for military use from the ground up are the 101 Forward Control from the early 1970s and the Lightweight or Airportable from the late 1960s. The latter was intended to be transported under a helicopter. The Royal Air Force Mountain Rescue Service (RAFMRS) teams were early users in the late 1950s and early 1960s, and their convoys of Land Rovers and larger military trucks are a sight often seen in the mountain areas of the United Kingdom. Originally RAFMRS Land Rovers had blue bodies and bright yellow tops, to be better seen from above. In 1981, the colour scheme was changed to green with yellow stripes. More recently, vehicles have been painted white, and are issued with fittings similar to civilian UK Mountain Rescue teams.\\r\\n\\r\\nAn adaptation of Land Rovers to military purposes is the \\"Pink Panther\\" models. Approximately 100 Series IIA models were adapted to reconnaissance use by British special operations forces the SAS. For desert use they were often painted pink, hence the name. The vehicles were fitted with among other gear a sun compass, machine guns, larger fuel tanks and smoke dischargers. Similar adaptations were later made to Series IIIs and 90/110/Defenders.[44]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Australian Army adapted the Land Rover Series 2 into the Long Range Patrol Vehicle for use by the Special Air Service Regiment and as an anti-tank \\"gunbuggy\\" fitted with an M40 recoilless rifle.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe 75th Ranger Regiment of the United States Army also adapted twelve versions of the Land Rover that were officially designated the Ranger Special Operations Vehicle.\\r\\n\\r\\nSeries and Defender models have also been armoured. The most widespread of these is the Shorts Shorland, built by Shorts Brothers of Belfast. The first of these were delivered in 1965 to the Royal Ulster Constabulary, the Northern Ireland police force. They were originally 109-inch (2,800?mm) wheelbase models with an armoured body and a turret from the Ferret armoured car. By 1990, there had been more than 1,000 produced.[45]\\r\\nIn the 1970s, a more conventional armoured Land Rover was built for the Royal Ulster Constabulary in Wales called the Hotspur. The Land Rover Tangi was built by the Royal Ulster Constabulary's own vehicle engineering team during the 1990s. The British Army has used various armoured Land Rovers, first in Northern Ireland but also in more recent campaigns. They first added protective panels to Series General Service vehicles (the Vehicle Protection Kit (VPK)). Later they procured the Glover Webb APV and finally the Courtaulds (later NP Aerospace) Composite Armoured Vehicle, commonly known as Snatch. These were originally based on heavy-duty V8 110 chassis but some have recently been re-mounted on new chassis from Otokar of Turkey and fitted with diesel engines and air-conditioning for Iraq. Although these now have more in common with the 'Wolf' (Defender XD) Land Rovers that many mistakenly confuse them with, the Snatch and the Wolf are different vehicles.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe most radical conversion of a Land Rover for military purposes was the Centaur half-track. It was based on a Series III with a V8 engine and a shortened belt drive from the Alvis Scorpion light tank. A small number was manufactured, and they were used by Ghana, among others.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Land Rover is used by military forces throughout the world. The current generation of Land Rover used by British Army, the Snatch 2, have upgraded and strengthened chassis and suspension compared to civilian-specification vehicles. There is also the Land Rover WMIK (weapon mounted installation kit) used by British Army. The WMIK consists of a driver, a raised gun, usually a Browning heavy machine gun or a grenade machine gun, this used for ground support, and a GPMG (general-purpose machine gunner) located next to the driver, this used for vehicle protection.\\r\\n\\r\\nHighly modified Land Rovers have competed in the Dakar Rally and won the Macmillan 4x4 UK Challenge almost every year, as well as having been the vehicle used for the Camel Trophy. Now, Land Rover has its own G4 challenge.[46]\\r\\n\\r\\nLand Rover Experience was established in 1990, and consists of a network of centres throughout the world, set up to help customers get the most out of their vehicles' on and off-road capability. The flagship centres are Land Rover's bases at Solihull, Eastnor, Gaydon and Halewood. Courses offered include off-road driving, winching and trailer handling, along with a variety of corporate and individual 'Adventure Days'. The factory centres at Solihull and Halewood have manufacturing tours, while Gaydon has an engineering tour.\\r\\n\\r\\nModel-by-model road accident statistics from the UK Department for Transport show that the Land Rover Defender is one of the safest cars on British roads as measured by chance of death in two-car injury accidents.[47]\\r\\nThe figures, which were based on data collected by police forces following accidents between 2000 and 2004 in Great Britain, showed that Defender drivers had a 1% chance of being killed or seriously injured and a 33% chance of sustaining any kind of injury. Other four-wheel-drive vehicles scored equally highly, and collectively these vehicles were much safer for their passengers than those in other classes such as passenger cars and MPVs. These figures reflect the fact that drivers of large mass vehicles are likely to be safer, often at the expense of other drivers if they collide with smaller cars.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe original Land Rover Owners Club was set up by the Rover Company in 1954. The company published the Land Rover Owners Club Review magazine for members from 1957 to 1968 when the club became the Rover Owners Association. This original association fell away when the company merged with British Leyland.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere are many Land Rover clubs throughout the UK and internationally. Land Rover clubs break down into a number of groups of varying interests.\\r\\n\\r\\nSingle Marque Clubs ÿ Bring together owners of a specific model or series of vehicle such as the Land Rover Series One Club,[48] or the Discovery Owners Club.[49]   Single marque clubs have a global membership.\\r\\n\\r\\nSpecial Vehicle Clubs ÿ At various times Land Rover have produced vehicles for specific events or on a specific theme, most notable are the Camel Trophy and G4 Challenge vehicles which have been sold on to the general public, and a range of Defenders that were loosely based on the custom vehicles produced for the Tomb Raider motion picture.\\r\\n\\r\\nRegional Clubs in the UK break down into two groups, competitive and non-competitive. The non-competitive clubs activities generally relate to social events, off-road driving or green laning on un-surfaced public highways or 'pay and play' days at off-road centres. Competitive clubs are a phenomenon almost exclusively found within the UK, who as well as the non-competitive activities detailed above run competitive events such as Tyro, Road Taxed Vehicle (RTV) and Cross Country Vehicle (CCV) trials, winch and recovery challenges or speed events such as Competitive Safaries. All UK competitive events are run within the framework of rules created by the Motor Sports Association (MSA) with further vehicle specific rules applied by the host club or association. Outside of the UK regional clubs are independent and mostly non-competitive.\\r\\n\\r\\nA number of clubs are affiliated to the Association of Land Rover Clubs (ALRC),[50] formerly known as the Association of Rover Clubs (ARC) the association applies its own vehicle regulations to all of its member clubs who have the opportunity to compete together at regional events and an annual national event with vehicles approved to the same standard.  In recent years some non-competitive clubs have dropped their affiliation fifth ALRC.  Few clubs outside of the UK are affiliated with ALRC.[51] Other than ALRC and the short lived Association of North American Rover Clubs (ANARC), which was created 1998 to celebrate Land Rover's 50th anniversary and disbanded in 2001, other groups of Land Rover clubs have affiliated with each other.\\r\\n\\r\\nLand Rover owners were also early adopters of virtual clubs that are entirely based online. Bill Caloccia [52] created the original Land Rover Owner[53] email list (LRO) as single marque offshoot of the British Cars email list in  May 1990.[54]  Bill later created email lists in the mid 1990s for Range Rovers (RRO) and various regions (e.g., UK-LRO, AU-LRO, ZA-LRO, EU-LRO, IT-LRO, NL-LRO). In California members of the LRO list created mendo_recce in 1995.[55]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 2005, under Ford ownership, Land Rover became more interested in the club environment. An internal club was formed, The Land Rover Club,[56] exclusive to employees of Ford's Premier Automotive Group (Now exclusive to the new 'Jaguar ÿ Land Rover' group since the brand moved away from the Ford stable). Also, an agreement was generated to allow other clubs to use the Land Rover green oval logo under licence. In 2006, the Bedfordshire, Hertfordshire and Cambridgeshire club were the pilot licensees for the new agreement, who now benefit from a reciprocal arrangement where their own logo is trade marked[57] and owned by Land Rover and they can refer to themselves as a 'Land Rover Approved Club'.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1995, Land Rover endorsed the production of a hand-made bicycle using its logo. The bicycle, called the Land Rover APB and manufactured by Pashley Cycles of Stratford-upon-Avon,[58] was the collapsible version of Pashley Cycles' Moulton APB (All Purpose Bicycle) model, with leading link front suspension and adjustable damping and stroke.  Two more models immediately followed: the Land Rover XCB V-20, aimed primarily at younger riders (children); and the Land Rover XCB D-26, also available as the M26 with hydraulic rim brakes, front suspension and suspension seat pillar.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn June 2004, Land Rover released a comprehensive 25 model range of bicycles. The three main ranges are the \\"Defender\\", the \\"Discovery\\", and the \\"Freelander\\", each with different attributes. The \\"Discovery\\" is an all-rounder bicycle suited to a variety of terrains, \\"Defender\\" is most suited to rugged terrain and off-road pursuits, whereas the \\"Freelander\\" is designed for an urban lifestyle. All bikes are made from lightweight aluminium.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 2010 the range was relaunched in conjunction with British manufacturer 2x2.[59]\\r\\n\\r\\nLand Rover has had its name associated with coffee since 2005, when the Land Rover Coffee company was established.[60]\\r\\n\\r\\nLand Rover gave UK pram company Pegasus a licence to produce a three-wheeler range of Land Rover ATP pushchairs. The design reflected the heritage of the marque, with a light metal frame with canvas seating, held together with push-studs and tough simple parts like brakes and hinges. They could be collapsed completely flat, with wheels removed in seconds. The basic frame could be adapted with modules to allow a baby to lie flat or a bubble windscreen to completely enclose the child. The frame also came in long or short-handled versions, and could be repaired with home tools. The design was simple, light, and rugged and able to travel in all terrains (hence the ATP for all-terrain pushchair.) It came in three military looking colours: a light blue, a sand colour and olive drab. Production was discontinued in 2002.[61]\\r\\n\\r\\n Media related to Land Rover at Wikimedia Commons","input":"What is the make of a land rover?"},{"output":"in 1940","context":"","input":"The first federal peacetime draft in u.s. history was established?"},{"output":"Fertile Crescent","context":"The term \\"cradle of civilization\\" refers to locations where, according to current arc gical data, civilization is understood to have emerged. Current thinking is that there was no single \\"cradle\\", but several civilizations that developed independently, with the Fertile Crescent (Mesopotamia and Ancient Egypt) understood to be the earliest.[1] Other civilizations arose in Asia among cultures situated along large river valleys, notably the Indus River in the Indian subcontinent[2] and the Yellow River in China.[3] The extent to which there was significant influence between the early civilizations of the Near East and those of East Asia is disputed. Scholars accept that the civilizations of Mesoamerica, mainly in modern Mexico, and Norte Chico in present-day Peru emerged independently from those in Eurasia.[4]\\r\\nScholars have defined civilization using various criteria such as the use of writing, cities, a class-based society, agriculture, animal husbandry, public buildings, metallurgy, and monumental architecture.[5][6] The term cradle of civilization has frequently been applied to a variety of cultures and areas, in particular the Ancient Near Eastern Chalcolithic (Ubaid period) and Fertile Crescent, Ancient India and Ancient China. It has also been applied to ancient Anatolia, the Levant and Iran, and used to refer to culture predecessorssuch as Ancient Greece as the predecessor of Western Civilization[7]even when such sites are not understood as an independent development of civilization, as well as within national rhetoric.[8]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe concept \\"cradle of civilization\\" is the subject of much debate. The figurative use of cradle to mean \\"the place or region in which anything is nurtured or sheltered in its earlier stage\\" is traced by the Oxford English Dictionary to Spenser (1590). Charles Rollin's Ancient History (1734) has \\"Egypt that served at first as the cradle of the holy nation\\".\\r\\nThe phrase \\"cradle of civilization\\" plays a certain role in national mysticism. It has been used in Eastern as well as Western cultures, for instance, in Hindu nationalism (In Search of the Cradle of Civilization 1995) and Taiwanese nationalism (Taiwan? The Cradle of Civilization[8] 2002). The terms also appear in esoteric pseudohistory, such as the Urantia Book, claiming the title for \\"the second Eden\\", or the pseudoarchaeology related to Megalithic Britain (Civilization One 2004, Ancient Britain: The Cradle of Civilization 1921).\\r\\nThe earliest signs of a process leading to sedentary culture can be seen in the Levant to as early as 12,000 BC, when the Natufian culture became sedentary; it evolved into an agricultural society by 10,000 BC.[9] The importance of water to safeguard an abundant and stable food supply, due to favourable conditions for hunting, fishing and gathering resources including cereals, provided an initial wide spectrum economy that triggered the creation of permanent villages.[10]\\r\\nThe earliest proto-urban settlements with several thousand inhabitants emerged in the Neolithic. The first cities to house several tens of thousands were Memphis and Uruk, by the 31st century BC (see Historical urban community sizes).\\r\\nHistoric times are marked apart from prehistoric times when \\"records of the past begin to be kept for the benefit of future generations\\";[11] which may be in written or oral form. If the rise of civilization is taken to coincide with the development of writing out of proto-writing, the Near Eastern Chalcolithic, the transitional period between the Neolithic and the Bronze Age during the 4th millennium BC, and the development of proto-writing in Harappa in the Indus Valley of South Asia around 3300 BC are the earliest incidences, followed by Chinese proto-writing evolving into the oracle bone script, and again by the emergence of Mesoamerican writing systems from about 2000 BC.\\r\\nIn the absence of written documents, most aspects of the rise of early civilizations are contained in archaeological assessments that document the development of formal institutions and the material culture. A \\"civilized\\" way of life is ultimately linked to conditions coming almost exclusively from intensive agriculture. Gordon Childe defined the development of civilization as the result of two successive revolutions: the Neolithic Revolution, triggering the development of settled communities, and the Urban Revolution, which enhanced tendencies towards dense settlements, specialized occupational groups, social classes, exploitation of surpluses, monumental public buildings and writing. Few of those conditions, however, are unchallenged by the records: dense settlements were not attested in Egypt's Old Kingdom and were absent in the Maya area;[citation needed] the Incas lacked writing altogether; and often monumental architecture preceded any indication of village settlement. For instance, in present-day Louisiana, researchers have determined that cultures that were primarily nomadic organized over generations to build earthwork mounds at seasonal settlements as early as 3400 BC. Rather than a succession of events and preconditions, the rise of civilization could equally be hypothesized as an accelerated process that started with incipient agriculture and culminated in the Oriental Bronze Age.[12]\\r\\nA traditional theory of the spread of civilization is that it began in the Fertile Crescent and spread out from there by influence.[13] Scholars more generally now believe that civilizations arose independently at several locations in both hemispheres. They have observed that sociocultural developments occurred along different timeframes. \\"Sedentary\\" and \\"nomadic\\" communities continued to interact considerably; they were not strictly divided among widely different cultural groups. The concept of a cradle of civilization has a focus where the inhabitants came to build cities, to create writing systems, to experiment in techniques for making pottery and using metals, to domesticate animals, and to develop complex social structures involving class systems.[4]\\r\\nCurrent scholarship generally identifies six sites where civilization emerged independently: Mesopotamia, the Nile River, the Indus River, the Yellow River, the Central Andes, and Mesoamerica.[6][14][15][16][17][18][19][20][21]\\r\\nAround 10,200 BC the first fully developed Neolithic cultures belonging to the phases Pre-Pottery Neolithic A (PPNA) and Pre-Pottery Neolithic B (7600 to 6000 BC) appeared in the fertile crescent and from there spread eastwards and westwards.[22] One of the most notable PPNA settlements is Jericho in the Levant region, thought to be the world's first town (settled around 8500 BC and fortified around 6800 BC).[23][24] In Mesopotamia, the convergence of the Tigris and Euphrates rivers produced rich fertile soil and a supply of water for irrigation. The civilizations that emerged around these rivers are among the earliest known non-nomadic agrarian societies. It is because of this that the fertile crescent region, and Mesopotamia in particular, are often referred to as the cradle of civilization.[25] The period known as the Ubaid period (c. 6500 to 3800 BC) is the earliest known period on the alluvial plain, although it is likely earlier periods exist obscured under the alluvium.[26][27] It was during the Ubaid period that the movement towards urbanization began. Agriculture and animal husbandry were widely practiced in sedentary communities, particularly in Northern Mesopotamia, and intensive irrigated hydraulic agriculture began to be practiced in the south.[28] Eridu is the oldest Sumerian site settled during this period, around 5300 BC, and the city of Ur also first dates to the end of this period.[29] In the south, the Ubaid period had a very long duration from around 6500 to 3800 BC; when it is replaced by the Uruk period.[30]\\r\\nSumerian civilization coalesces in the subsequent Uruk period (4000 to 3100 BC).[31] Named after the Sumerian city of Uruk, this period saw the emergence of urban life in Mesopotamia and, during its later phase, the gradual emergence of the cuneiform script. Proto-writing in the region dates to around 3500 BC, with the earliest texts dating to 3300 BC; early cuneiform writing emerged in 3000 BC.[32] It was also during this period that pottery painting declined as copper started to become popular, along with cylinder seals.[33] Uruk trade networks started to expand to other parts of Mesopotamia and as far as North Caucasus, and strong signs of governmental organization and social stratification began to emerge leading to the Early Dynastic Period (c. 2900 BC).[34][35][36] The earliest ziggurats began near the end of the Early Dynastic Period, although architectural precursors in the form of raised platforms date back to the Ubaid period,[37] and the second phase of the Early Dynastic Period (c. 2700 BC) is also when the legendary king Gilgamesh is believed to have reigned.[38]\\r\\nEannatum, the Sumerian king of Lagash, established one of the first verifiable empires in history in 2500 BC.[39] The neighboring Elam, in modern Iran, was also part of the early urbanization during the Chalcolithic period.[40] Elamite states were among the leading political forces of the Ancient Near East.[41] The emergence of Elamite written records from around 3000 BC also parallels Sumerian history, where slightly earlier records have been found.[42][43] During the 3rd millennium BC, there developed a very intimate cultural symbiosis between the Sumerians and the Akkadians.[44] Akkadian gradually replaced Sumerian as a spoken language somewhere between the 3rd and the 2nd millennia BC.[45] The Semitic-speaking Akkadian empire emerged around 2350 BC under Sargon the Great.[34] The Akkadian Empire reached its political peak between the 24th and 22nd centuries BC. Under Sargon and his successors, the Akkadian language was briefly imposed on neighboring conquered states such as Elam and Gutium. After the fall of the Akkadian Empire, the Akkadian people of Mesopotamia eventually coalesced into two major Akkadian-speaking nations: Assyria in the north, and, a few centuries later, Babylonia in the south.[46][46][47]\\r\\nThe developed Neolithic cultures belonging to the phases Pre-Pottery Neolithic A (10,200 BC) and Pre-Pottery Neolithic B (7600 to 6000 BC) appeared in the fertile crescent and from there spread eastwards and westwards.[22] Contemporaneously, a grain-grinding culture using the earliest type of sickle blades had replaced the culture of hunters, fishers, and gathering people using stone tools along the Nile. Geological evidence and computer climate modeling studies also suggest that natural climate changes around 8000 BC began to desiccate the extensive pastoral lands of northern Africa, eventually forming the Sahara. Continued desiccation forced the early ancestors of the Egyptians to settle around the Nile more permanently and to adopt a more sedentary lifestyle.[48] By about 5500 BC, small tribes living in the Nile valley had developed into a series of inter-related cultures as far south as Sudan, demonstrating firm control of agriculture and animal husbandry, and identifiable by their pottery and personal items, such as combs, bracelets, and beads. The largest of these early cultures in upper (Southern) Egypt was the Badari, which probably originated in the Western Desert; it was known for its high quality ceramics, stone tools, and use of copper.[49] The oldest known domesticated bovine in Africa are from Fayum dating to around 4400 BC.[50] The Badari cultures was followed by the Naqada culture, which brought a number of technological improvements.[51] As early as the first Naqada Period, Amratia, Egyptians imported obsidian from Ethiopia, used to shape blades and other objects from flakes.[52] By 3300 BC, just before the first Egyptian dynasty, Egypt was divided into two kingdoms, known as Upper Egypt to the south, and Lower Egypt to the north.[53]\\r\\nEgyptian civilization begins during the second phase of the Naqda culture, known as the Gerzeh period, around 3500 BC and coalesces with the unification of Upper and Lower Egypt around 3150 BC.[54] Farming produced the vast majority of food; with increased food supplies, the populace adopted a much more sedentary lifestyle, and the larger settlements grew to cities of about 5,000 residents. It was in this time that the city dwellers started using mud brick to build their cities, and the use of the arch and recessed walls for decorative effect became popular.[55] Copper instead of stone was increasingly used to make tools[55] and weaponry.[56] Symbols on Gerzean pottery also resemble nascent Egyptian hieroglyphs.[57] Early evidence also exists of contact with the Near East, particularly Canaan and the Byblos coast, during this time.[58] Concurrent with these cultural advances, a process of unification of the societies and towns of the upper Nile River, or Upper Egypt, occurred. At the same time the societies of the Nile Delta, or Lower Egypt, also underwent a unification process. During his reign in Upper Egypt, King Narmer defeated his enemies on the Delta and merged both the Kingdom of Upper and Lower Egypt under his single rule.[59]\\r\\nThe Early Dynastic Period of Egypt immediately followed the unification of Upper and Lower Egypt. It is generally taken to include the First and Second Dynasties, lasting from the Naqada III archaeological period until about the beginning of the Old Kingdom, c. 2686 BC.[60] With the First Dynasty, the capital moved from Thinis to Memphis with a unified Egypt ruled by a god-king. The hallmarks of ancient Egyptian civilization, such as art, architecture and many aspects of religion, took shape during the Early Dynastic period. The strong institution of kingship developed by the pharaohs served to legitimize state control over the land, labour, and resources that were essential to the survival and growth of ancient Egyptian civilization.[61] Major advances in architecture, art, and technology were made during the subsequent Old Kingdom, fueled by the increased agricultural productivity and resulting population, made possible by a well-developed central administration.[62] Some of ancient Egypt's crowning achievements, the Giza pyramids and Great Sphinx, were constructed during the Old Kingdom. Under the direction of the vizier, state officials collected taxes, coordinated irrigation projects to improve crop yield, drafted peasants to work on construction projects, and established a justice system to maintain peace and order. Along with the rising importance of a central administration there arose a new class of educated scribes and officials who were granted estates by the pharaoh in payment for their services. Pharaohs also made land grants to their mortuary cults and local temples, to ensure that these institutions had the resources to worship the pharaoh after his death. Scholars believe that five centuries of these practices slowly eroded the economic power of the pharaoh, and that the economy could no longer afford to support a large centralized administration.[60] As the power of the pharaoh diminished, regional governors called nomarchs began to challenge the supremacy of the pharaoh. This, coupled with severe droughts between 2200 and 2150 BC,[63] is assumed to have caused the country to enter the 140-year period of famine and strife known as the First Intermediate Period.[64]\\r\\nOne of the earliest Neolithic sites in South Asia is Bhirrana along the ancient Saraswati riverine system in the present day state of Haryana in India, dating to around 7600 BC.[65] Other early sites include Lahuradewa in the Middle Ganges region and Jhusi near the confluence of Ganges and Yamuna rivers, both dating to around the 7000 BC.[66][67] The aceramic Neolithic at Mehrgarh lasts from 7000 to 5500 BC, with the ceramic Neolithic at Mehrgarh lasting up to 3300 BC; blending into the Early Bronze Age. Mehrgarh is one of the earliest sites with evidence of farming and herding in South Asia.[68][69] It is likely that the culture centered around Mehrgarh migrated into the Indus Valley and became the Indus Valley Civilisation.[70]\\r\\nThe Indus Valley Civilisation starts around 3300 BC with what is referred to as the Early Harappan Phase (3300 to 2600 BC). The earliest examples of the Indus Script date to this period,[71][72] as well as the emergence of citadels representing centralised authority and an increasingly urban quality of life.[73] Trade networks linked this culture with related regional cultures and distant sources of raw materials, including lapis lazuli and other materials for bead-making. By this time, villagers had domesticated numerous crops, including peas, sesame seeds, dates, and cotton, as well as animals, including the water buffalo.[74][75]\\r\\n2600 BC marks the Mature Harappan Phase during which Early Harappan communities turned into large urban centres including Harappa, Dholavira, Mohenjo-Daro, Lothal, and Rakhigarhi, and more than 1,000 towns and villages, often of relatively small size.[76] Mature Harappans evolved new techniques in metallurgy and produced copper, bronze, lead, and tin and displayed advanced levels of engineering.[77] The ancient Indus systems of sewerage and drainage that were developed and used in cities throughout the Indus region were far more advanced than any found in contemporary urban sites in the Middle East and even more efficient than those in many areas of Pakistan and India today. The advanced architecture of the Harappans is shown by their impressive dockyards, granaries, warehouses, brick platforms, and protective walls. The massive walls of Indus cities most likely protected the Harappans from floods and may have dissuaded military conflicts.[78]\\r\\nAround 1800 BC, signs of a gradual decline began to emerge, and by around 1700 BC most of the cities had been abandoned. Many scholars believe that drought and a decline in trade with Egypt and Mesopotamia caused the collapse of the Indus Civilisation.[79] The migration of Aryan peoples into the region at this time is also notable; however, the idea of a violent invasion is no longer widely accepted.[80] The Indus Valley Civilisation did not disappear suddenly and many elements of the civilisation continue in later South Asian and Vedic cultures.[81]\\r\\nEarly evidence for Chinese millet agriculture is dated to around 7000 BC,[82] with the earliest evidence of cultivated rice found at Chengtoushan near the Yangtze River, dated to 6500 BC. Chengtoushan may also be the site of the first walled city in China.[83] This Neolithic Revolution gave rise to the Jiahu culture (7000 to 5800 BC).[84] Some scholars have suggested that the Jiahu symbols (6600 BC) are the earliest form of proto-writing in China.[85] However, it is likely that they should not be understood as writing itself, but as features of a lengthy period of sign-use which led eventually to a fully-fledged system of writing.[86] Excavation of a Peiligang culture site in Xinzheng county, Henan, found a community that flourished in 5500 to 4900 BC, with evidence of agriculture, constructed buildings, pottery, and burial of the dead.[87] With agriculture came increased population, the ability to store and redistribute crops, and the potential to support specialist craftsmen and administrators.[84] In late Neolithic times, the Yellow River valley began to establish itself as a center of Yangshao culture (5000 to 3000 BC), and the first villages were founded. Later, Yangshao culture was superseded by the Longshan culture, which was also centered on the Yellow River from about 3000 to 2000 BC.[88] The earliest bronze artifacts have been found in the Majiayao culture site (3100 to 2700 BC).[89][90]\\r\\nChinese civilization begins during the second phase of the Erlitou period (1900 to 1500 BC), with Erlitou considered the first state level society of East Asia.[91] There is considerable debate whether Erlitou sites correlate to the semi-legendary Xia dynasty. The Xia dynasty (2070 to 1600 BC) is the first dynasty to be described in ancient Chinese historical records such as the Bamboo Annals, first published more than a millennium later during the Western Zhou period. Although Xia is an important element in Chinese historiography, there is to date no archeological evidence to corroborate the dynasty. Erlitou saw an increase in bronze metallurgy and urbanization and was a rapidly growing regional center with palatial complexes that provide evidence for social stratification.[92] The earliest traditional Chinese dynasty for which there is both archeological and written evidence is the Shang dynasty (1600 to 1046 BC). Shang sites have yielded the earliest known body of Chinese writing, the oracle bone script, mostly divinations inscribed on bones. These inscriptions provide critical insight into many topics from the politics, economy, and religious practices to the art and medicine of this early stage of Chinese civilization.[93] Some historians argue that Erlitou should be considered an early phase of the Shang dynasty. The U.S. National Gallery of Art defines the Chinese Bronze Age as the period between about 2000 and 771 BC; a period that begins with the Erlitou culture and ends abruptly with the disintegration of Western Zhou rule.[94] The Sanxingdui culture is another Chinese Bronze Age society, contemporaneous to the Shang dynasty, however they developed a different method of bronze-making from the Shang.[95]\\r\\nThe Shang dynasty was succeeded by the Zhou dynasty (1046 to 256 BC). The succession of dynasties, known as the dynastic cycle, is an important political theory in Chinese history. This theory sees a continuity in Chinese history from early times to the present by looking at the succession of empires or dynasties. Emperors would legitimize their rule by invoking the Mandate of Heaven.[96][97] During the Zhou dynasty, Chinese script evolved into its almost-modern form with the use of a clerical script that emerged during the late Warring States period.[98] In 221 BC, China became culturally and politically unified under a large centralized empire, the Qin Dynasty, founded by Emperor Qin Shi Huang Di. Successive dynasties in Chinese history developed bureaucratic systems that enabled the Emperor of China to control the large territory from the center.[99][100]\\r\\nThe earliest evidence of agriculture in the Andean region dates to around 4700 BC at Huaca Prieta and Paredones.[101][102][103] The oldest evidence of canal irrigation in South America dates to 4700 to 2500 BC in the Za?a Valley of northern Peru.[104] The earliest urban settlements of the Andes, as well as North and South America, are dated to 3500 BC at Huaricanga, in the Fortaleza area,[4] and Sechin Bajo near the Sechin River.[105][106]\\r\\nThe Norte Chico civilization proper is understood to have emerged around 3200 BC, as it is at that point that large-scale human settlement and communal construction across multiple sites becomes clearly apparent.[107] Since the early 21st century, it has been established as the oldest known civilization in the Americas. The civilization flourished at the confluence of three rivers, the Fortaleza, the Pativilca, and the Supe. These river valleys each have large clusters of sites. Further south, there are several associated sites along the Huaura River.[108] Notable settlements include the cities of Caral, the largest and most complex Preceramic site, and Aspero.[109]\\r\\nNorte Chico is unusual in that it completely lacked ceramics and apparently had almost no visual art. Nevertheless, the civilization exhibited impressive architectural feats, including large earthwork platform mounds and sunken circular plazas, and an advanced textile industry.[4][110] The platform mounds, as well as large stone warehouses, provide evidence for a stratified society and a centralized authority necessary to distribute resources such as cotton.[4] However, there is no evidence of warfare or defensive structures during this period.[111] Originally, it was theorized that, unlike other early civilizations, Norte Chico developed by relying on maritime food sources in place of a staple cereal. This hypothesis, the Maritime Foundation of Andean Civilization, is still hotly debated; however, most researches now agree that agriculture played a central role in the civilization's development while still acknowledging a strong supplemental reliance on maritime proteins.[112][113][114]\\r\\nThe discovery of quipu, string-based recording devices, at Caral can be understood as a form of \\"proto-writing\\" at Norte Chico.[115] However, the exact use of quipu in this and later Andean cultures has been widely debated.[4] Additionally, the image of the Staff God has been found on a gourd dated to 2250 BC. The Staff God is a major deity of later Andean cultures. The presence of quipu and the commonality of religious symbols suggests a cultural link between Norte Chico and later Andean cultures.[116][117]\\r\\nCirca 1800 BC, the Norte Chico civilization began to decline, with more powerful centers appearing to the south and north along the coast and to the east inside the belt of the Andes.[118] Pottery eventually developed in the Amazon Basin and spread to the Andean culture region around 2000 BC. The next major civilization to arise in the Andes would be the Chavn culture at Chavn de Huantar, located in the Andean highlands of the present-day Ancash Region. It is believed to have been built around 900 BC and was the religious and political center of the Chavn people.[119]\\r\\nThe Coxcatlan caves in the Valley of Tehuacn provide evidence for agriculture in components dated between 5000 and 3400 BC.[120] Similarly, sites such as Sipacate in Guatemala provide maize pollen samples dating to 3500 BC.[121] It is estimated that fully domesticated maize developed in Mesoamerica around 2700 BC.[122] Mesoamericans during this period likely divided their time between small hunting encampments and large temporary villages.[123] What would become the Olmec civilization had its roots in early farming cultures of Tabasco, which began around 5100 to 4600 BC.[124]\\r\\nThe emergence of the Olmec civilization has traditionally been dated to around 1600 to 1500 BC. Olmec features first emerged in the city of San Lorenzo Tenochtitln, fully coalescing around 1400 BC. The rise of civilization was assisted by the local ecology of well-watered alluvial soil, as well as by the transportation network provided by the Coatzacoalcos River basin.[124] This environment encouraged a densely concentrated population, which in turn triggered the rise of an elite class and an associated demand for the production of the symbolic and sophisticated luxury artifacts that define Olmec culture.[125] Many of these luxury artifacts were made from materials such as jade, obsidian, and magnetite, which came from distant locations and suggest that early Olmec elites had access to an extensive trading network in Mesoamerica. The aspect of Olmec culture perhaps most familiar today is their artwork, particularly the Olmec colossal heads.[126]\\r\\nSan Lorenzo was all but abandoned around 900 BC at about the same time that La Venta rose to prominence. A wholesale destruction of many San Lorenzo monuments occurred around 950 BC. La Venta continued as the center of Olmec culture until its abandonment around 400 BC; constructing monumental architectural achievements such as the Great Pyramid of La Venta.[126][124] The exact cause of the decline of the Olmec culture is uncertain. Between 400 and 350 BC, the population in the eastern half of the Olmec heartland dropped precipitously.[127] This depopulation was probably the result of serious environmental changes that rendered the region unsuited for large groups of farmers, in particular changes to the riverine environment that the Olmec depended upon for agriculture, hunting and gathering, and transportation. These changes may have been triggered by tectonic upheavals or subsidence, or the silting up of rivers due to agricultural practices.[126][124] Within a few hundred years of the abandonment of the last Olmec cities, successor cultures became firmly established. The Tres Zapotes site, on the western edge of the Olmec heartland, continued to be occupied well past 400 BC, but without the hallmarks of the Olmec culture. This post-Olmec culture, often labeled Epi-Olmec, has features similar to those found at Izapa, some 550?km (330?miles) to the southeast.[128]\\r\\nThe Olmecs are sometimes referred to as the mother culture of Mesoamerica, as they were the first Mesoamerican civilization and laid many of the foundations for the civilizations that followed.[129] However, the causes and degree of Olmec influences on Mesoamerican cultures has been a subject of debate over many decades.[130] Practices introduced by the Olmec include ritual bloodletting and the Mesoamerican ballgame; hallmarks of subsequent Mesoamerican societies such as the Maya and Aztec.[129] Although the Mesoamerican writing system would fully develop later, early Olmec ceramics show representations that may be interpreted as codices.[124]\\r\\nThe following timeline shows the approximate dates of the emergence of civilization (as discussed in the article) in the featured areas and the primary cultures associated with these early civilizations. It is important to note that the timeline is not indicative of the beginning of human habitation, the start of a specific ethnic group, or the development of Neolithic cultures in the area; which often occurred significantly earlier than the emergence of civilization proper.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere is academic consensus that Classical Greece is the seminal culture which provided the foundation of modern Western culture, democracy, art, theatre, philosophy and science. For this reason it is known as the cradle of Western Civilization.[a] Along with Greece, Rome has sometimes been described as a birthplace or as the cradle of Western Civilization because of the role the city had in politics, republicanism, law, architecture, warfare and Western Christianity.[b]","input":"When did the first civilizations in the world arise?"},{"output":"Monty Norman","context":"The \\"James Bond Theme\\" is the main signature theme of the James Bond films and has featured in every Eon Productions Bond film since Dr. No, released in 1962. The piece has been used as an accompanying fanfare to the gun barrel sequence in almost every James Bond film.\\r\\nThe \\"James Bond Theme\\" has accompanied the opening titles twice, as part of the medley that opens Dr. No and then again in the opening credits of From?Russia with Love (1963). It has been used as music over the end credits for Dr. No, Thunderball (1965), On?Her Majesty's Secret Service (1969), The World Is Not Enough (1999), Casino Royale (2006), Quantum of Solace (2008), Skyfall (2012), and Spectre (2015).\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nMonty Norman has been credited with writing the \\"James Bond Theme\\", and has received royalties since 1962. Norman collected around S485,000 in royalties between the years 1976 and 1999. For Dr. No, the tune was arranged by John Barry, who would later go on to compose the soundtracks for eleven James Bond films. Courts have ruled twice that the theme was written by Monty Norman, despite claims and testimony by Barry that he had actually written the theme. Norman has consequently won two libel actions against publishers for claiming that Barry wrote the theme, most recently against The Sunday Times in 2001.\\r\\nNorman describes the distinctive rhythm of the guitar in the first few bars of the \\"James Bond Theme\\" as \\"Dum di-di dum dum\\". He claims that it was inspired by the song \\"Good Sign Bad Sign\\" sung by Indian characters in A House for Mr Biswas, a musical he composed based on a novel by V.S. Naipaul set in the Indian community in Trinidad. Norman showed his manuscript music from A House for Mr Biswas in a filmed interview and sang its lyrics. In 2005, Norman released an album called Completing the Circle that features \\"Good Sign Bad Sign\\", the \\"James Bond Theme,\\" and a similar-sounding song titled \\"Dum Di-Di Dum Dum.\\" For these songs Norman added lyrics that explain the origin and history of the \\"James Bond Theme\\".\\r\\nThough the \\"James Bond Theme\\" is identified with John Barry's jazz arrangement, parts of it are heard throughout Monty Norman's score for Dr. No in non-jazzy guises. Barry's arrangement is repeated (\\"tracked\\") in various scenes of the first Bond film. This is consistent with the account given by Barry and some of the film makers, contained in supplementary material on the DVD release of Dr. No: Barry was called in to make an arrangement of Norman's motif after Norman had completed the score. There is no information about the distinctive ostinati, countermelodies, and bridges introduced by Barry that are juxtaposed with Norman's motif in order to flesh out the arrangement. These added musical figures have become as recognizable to listeners as Norman's motif, which is probably responsible for the controversy over the authorship of the \\"James Bond Theme\\" as listeners have come to know it.\\r\\nThe \\"James Bond Theme\\" was recorded on 21 June 1962, using five saxophones, nine brass instruments, a solo guitar and a rhythm section.[1] The guitar riff heard in the original recording of the theme was played by Vic Flick on a 1939 English Clifford Essex Paragon Deluxe guitar plugged into a Fender Vibrolux amplifier. Flick was paid a one-off fee of S6 for recording the famous James Bond Theme riff.[2] John Scott played the saxophone. Barry, who was paid S250 for his work, was surprised that his theme appeared so often in Dr. No. He was told by Noel Rogers, the head of United Artists Music, that though the producers would not give him any more money or a writing credit they would get in touch with him if there was another Bond film made.[3]\\r\\nWithin the Bond films themselves, many different arrangements of the theme have been used, often reflecting the musical tastes of the specific times. The electric guitar version of the theme is most associated with the Sean Connery era although it was also used in some Roger Moore films, in Timothy Dalton's final film Licence to Kill and in the Bond films starring Pierce Brosnan with scores composed by David Arnold. For every Bond movie which John Barry scored, he orchestrated a slightly different version of the Bond theme, as can be heard during the gun barrel sequence. These specialised Bond themes often reflected the style and locations featured in the movie, and the actor playing Bond.\\r\\nThe \\"James Bond Theme\\" and its variations found in the movies are played during many different types of scenes. Early in the series, the theme provided background music to Connery's entrances. It was not until Goldfinger that John Barry began to use the theme as an action cue. Since then, the primary use of the \\"James Bond Theme\\" has been with action scenes.\\r\\nThe first appearance of the \\"James Bond Theme\\" was in Dr. No. There it was used as part of the actual gunbarrel and main title sequence.\\r\\nIn From Russia with Love, the \\"James Bond Theme\\" appears not only in the gunbarrel pre-title sequence, but as part of the main title theme and in the track \\"James Bond with Bongos\\". It is a slower, jazzier, somewhat punchier rendition than the original orchestration. The original Barry arrangement from Dr. No is heard during a check of Bond's room for listening devices.\\r\\nIn Goldfinger, the \\"James Bond Theme\\" can be heard on the soundtrack in \\"Bond Back in Action Again\\" (gunbarrel and pre-title sequence). The \\"James Bond Theme\\" for this movie is heavily influenced by the brassy, jazzy theme song sung by Shirley Bassey.\\r\\nThunderball featured a full orchestral version of the theme in the track \\"Chateau Flight\\". Another full orchestral version was intended for the end titles of the film.\\r\\nYou Only Live Twice featured a funereal orchestration with Bond's \\"burial\\" at sea sequence in Hong Kong harbour. A full orchestral version of the theme was used in the Little Nellie autogyro fight scene.\\r\\nThe George Lazenby film On Her Majesty's Secret Service used a unique high-pitched arrangement with the melody played on a Moog synthesizer. The cue is called \\"This Never Happened to the Other Feller\\" and a similar recording was used over the film's end credits. The film has a downbeat ending and the explosive burst of the \\"James Bond Theme\\" at the film's very end suggests Bond will return in spite of the situation he finds himself in at the climax of this movie.\\r\\nWith the return of Sean Connery in Diamonds Are Forever, the guitar made a comeback along with a full orchestral version during a hovercraft sequence. On the soundtrack this track is named \\"Mr. Wint and Mr. Kidd/Bond to Holland.\\"\\r\\nWhen Roger Moore came to the role, the \\"James Bond Theme\\" became a string orchestra driven piece. Likewise, in Live and Let Die, the James Bond theme was featured in a Funk-inspired version of the tune reflecting the music of Blaxploitation films popular at the time. After that in 1974 John Barry composed the theme and song but sung by Lulu. The brief quote of the theme in the pre-credits music of The Spy Who Loved Me, titled \\"Bond 77\\", featured a disco sound, reflecting a style of music which was very popular at the time. The Spy Who Loved Me returned briefly to using the surf-rock guitar associated with the theme from the early days. One unusual instance occurred in Octopussy, when Bond's contact, who is disguised as a snake charmer played a few notes of the tune for Roger Moore's James Bond, presumably as a pre-arranged identification signal; this is an example of the tune being used as diegetic music. In the last Bond film of Roger Moore, A View to a Kill the melody of the theme was played on strings.\\r\\nTimothy Dalton's first film The Living Daylights, which was the last Bond film scored by Barry, used a symphonic version with the melody played on strings. This version of the Bond theme is notable for its introduction of sequenced electronic rhythm tracks overdubbed with the orchestra - at the time, a relatively new innovation.\\r\\nIn Licence to Kill, the Bond theme was arranged by Michael Kamen using rock drums to symbolize a harder and more violent Bond. This gunbarrel is the first one since Dr. No not starting with the Bond theme but orchestral hits though the surf guitar makes returns soon after.\\r\\nThe gunbarrel of the Pierce Brosnan film GoldenEye opened with a synthesized arrangement by ric Serra which plays the guitar riff on (almost indistinct) kettle drums. A more traditional rendition by John Altman is heard in the film during the tank chase in St. Petersburg. This version of the \\"James Bond Theme\\" is not included in the GoldenEye soundtrack.\\r\\nDavid Arnold's gunbarrel arrangements in Tomorrow Never Dies and The World Is Not Enough dropped the guitar melody line, jumping straight from the tune's opening to its concluding bars. An electronic rhythm was added to the gunbarrel of The World Is Not Enough. The typical Bond guitar line can be heard during some action scenes.\\r\\nThe Die Another Day gunbarrel recalls the version of From Russia with Love but with a more techno-influenced rhythm. It also contains the guitar riff of the \\"James Bond Theme\\".\\r\\nCraig's first James Bond film, Casino Royale, does not feature the \\"James Bond Theme\\" in its entirety until the very end of the movie during a climactic scene. In Casino Royale, the main notes of the song \\"You Know My Name\\" are played throughout the film as a substitute for the \\"James Bond Theme\\". A new recording of the classic theme, titled \\"The Name's BondJames Bond\\", only plays during the end credits to signal the beginning of the character's new arc as the 21st century version of James Bond. Although that is the first time the theme is played in its entirety, the first bars of the song (the chord progression) appeared as a slow background music in seven moments throughout the movie: after Bond's conversation with M (during his flight), after winning the Aston Martin, when he makes his first appearance in a tuxedo (accompanied by a few bars of the bridge), after he has survived the poisoned martini, when he wins the final match at Casino Royale, when Bond is following Vesper and one last time when Bond speaks with M on the phone. Then at the end of Quantum of Solace, the theme appears with Craig's new official gun-barrel sequence, unusually shown at the end of the film. The theme here is very similar to the classic style in Casino Royale. It appears sparingly throughout the score itself, never in an immediately recognizable variation. David Arnold said in an interview on the DVD extras for Tomorrow Never Dies that hearing the \\"James Bond Theme\\" is what he expects to hear as an audience member in action scenes, yet his scores for Casino Royale and Quantum of Solace only use it during the end credits.\\r\\nThe next film, Skyfall, includes the theme as part of the harmony to Adele's vocals and is used as the chord progression, including a faint surf guitar riff. Also, similar to Quantum of Solace, the gun-barrel sequence is shown at the end of Skyfall. The theme that plays along with the sequence and into the end credits is David Arnold's Casino Royale track \\"The Name's BondJames Bond\\". Despite this, the film's score was composed by Thomas Newman, who also incorporated the \\"James Bond Theme\\" throughout the entire film. In Spectre, the theme appears at the beginning of the film as part of the opening gunbarrel sequence, indicating a return to the franchise's classic roots of 1962 - 2002.\\r\\nOver 70 cover versions of the \\"James Bond Theme\\" have been recorded by artists such as:\\r\\nAmerican electronica musician Moby produced a remixed version of the theme entitled \\"James Bond Theme (Moby's Re-Version)\\" for the Bond film Tomorrow Never Dies. It first appeared as the second track on I Like to Score, a compilation of Moby's songs used in films, and later featured as the fifteenth and final track on the Tomorrow Never Dies soundtrack album. Moby has said \\"It did feel a little strange remixing something that was perfect in its original state\\",[attribution needed] further admitting that he \\"still thinks the original is miles better than the version I did\\".[attribution needed]\\r\\nReleased as a single, \\"James Bond Theme (Moby's Re-Version)\\" charted at number eight on the UK Singles Chart, besting \\"Go\\"'s number 10 peak six years earlier to become, at the time, Moby's highest-peaking single on the chart.[4]\\r\\nThe song features two samples of dialogue from the Bond films: Pierce Brosnan saying \\"Bond, James Bond\\" as heard in GoldenEye, and the conversation between Bond and Auric Goldfinger in Goldfinger: \\"Do you expect me to talk?\\" / \\"No, Mr. Bond. I expect you to die.\\"","input":"Who wrote the original james bond theme song?"},{"output":"one NCAA Championship","context":"The Michigan Wolverines men's basketball team is the intercollegiate men's basketball program representing the University of Michigan. The school competes in the Big Ten Conference in Division I of the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA). The Wolverines play home basketball games at the Crisler Center in Ann Arbor, Michigan on the university campus. Michigan has won one NCAA Championship as well as two National Invitation Tournaments (NIT), 14 Big Ten Conference championships and two Big Ten Tournament titles. In addition, it has won an NIT title and a Big Ten Tournament that were vacated due to NCAA sanctions.[2] The team is currently coached by John Beilein.\\r\\nMichigan has had 31 All-Americans, selected 44 times. Eight of these have been consensus All-Americans, which are Cazzie Russell (two times), Rickey Green, Gary Grant, Chris Webber, Trey Burke, as well as Harry Kipke, Richard Doyle and Bennie Oosterbaan (two-times) who were retroactively selected by the Helms Foundation.[3] Twelve All-Americans have been at least two-time honorees. Russell was the only three-time All-American.[4]\\r\\nMichigan basketball players have been successful in professional basketball. Fifty-eight have been drafted into the National Basketball Association (NBA); twenty-six of those were first round draft picks, including both Cazzie Russell and Chris Webber who were drafted first overall. The 1990 NBA draft in which Rumeal Robinson was selected 10th, Loy Vaught was selected 13th, and Terry Mills was selected 16th made Michigan the third of only ten schools that have ever had three or more players selected in the first round of the same draft.[5] Five players have gone on to become NBA champions for a total of nine times and eight players have become NBA All-Stars a total of 17 times. Rudy Tomjanovich coached both the 1994 and 1995 NBA Finals Champions.[5] Not only has Glen Rice won both an NBA and NCAA championship, he is also one of only nine basketball players to have won a state high school championship, NCAA title and NBA championship.[6]\\r\\nDuring the 1990s Michigan endured an NCAA violations scandal, described as involving one of the largest amounts of illicit money in NCAA history, when Ed Martin loaned four players a reported total of $616,000.[7] Due to NCAA sanctions, records from the 1992 Final Four, the 1992ÿ93 season, and 1995ÿ99 seasons have been vacated.[8] Throughout this article asterisks denote awards, records and honors that have been vacated.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nAs a result of public and alumni demand for a basketball team, Michigan fielded a team of members of the then-current student body and achieved a 1ÿ4 record for the 1908ÿ09 season. However, after three years of demanding a basketball program, the student body did not attend the games and the program was terminated due to low attendance.[9] Basketball returned in 1917 in what was considered the inaugural season of varsity basketball. The team was coached by Elmer Mitchell who instituted the intramural sports program at Michigan. The team finished 6ÿ12 overall (0ÿ10, Big Ten). The following year Mitchell led the team to a 16ÿ8 (5ÿ5) record.[9]\\r\\nE. J. Mather coached the team to three Big Ten titles in his nine seasons as coach. After inheriting Mitchell's team, which he led to a 10ÿ13 overall (3ÿ9, Big Ten) record during the 1919ÿ20 season, he led the team to an 18ÿ4 overall (8ÿ4, Big Ten) record during the 1920ÿ21 season.[9] This 1921 team won its first eight and last eight games to tie the Wisconsin Badgers and Purdue Boilermakers for the Big Ten title.[10] The team won back-to-back championships in 1925ÿ26 and 1926ÿ27.[9] The 1926 squad, which was captained by Richard Doyle who became the team's first All-American, tied with Purdue, the Iowa Hawkeyes and Indiana Hoosiers for the conference championship. The 1927 team had a new All-American, Bennie Oosterbaan, and won the school's first back-to-back championships and first outright championship with a 14ÿ3 overall (10ÿ2, Big Ten) record.[9][10] Mather died after a lengthy battle with cancer in August 1928.[9]\\r\\nGeorge F. Veenker compiled the highest overall and highest Big Ten winning percentages of any coach in school history during his three years as coach. He earned 1st(tied), 3rd and 2nd(tied) finishes during his three seasons, which included the 1928ÿ29 conference championship. During Veenker's first season his team compiled a 13ÿ3 overall (10ÿ2, Big Ten) record to win the conference, and Veenker continues to be the only coach in school history to win a conference championship in his first season.[10][11] The championship team, which finished tied with Wisconsin, was captained by the school's third All-American Ernie McCoy.[10] Veenker resigned to become the Iowa State Cyclones football head coach.[11]\\r\\nFranklin Cappon had a long history of association with Michigan athletics starting with his service as a four-time letterman in football and basketball from 1919 to 1923. In 1928, he became assistant football and basketball coach and in 1929 he served as Fielding H. Yost's assistant Athletic Director.[12] Although the highlight of Cappon's tenure as coach was a 16ÿ4 (9ÿ3) third place 1936ÿ37 Big Ten finish, he coached John Townsend who in his 1937ÿ38 senior season became last All-American for at least 10 years.[4][13] The team finished third in two other seasons with less impressive records of 10ÿ8 overall (8ÿ4, Big Ten) in 1932ÿ33 and 15ÿ5 overall (7ÿ5, Big Ten) 1935ÿ36,[14] and Cappon's overall record was 78ÿ57 overall (44ÿ40, Big Ten).[12] A notable captain during the Cappon era was 1933ÿ34 captain Ted Petoskey, a two-time football All-American end and eventual Major League Baseball player.[15]\\r\\nIn 1938 Michigan coaching duties were assumed by one of its greatest athletes. Bennie Oosterbaan had been an All-American in both football and basketball and held various coaching positions at Michigan in both of those sports as well as baseball. In basketball, he implemented a fast-paced attack as coach, and his teams' best overall record was 13ÿ7 in 1939ÿ40. That season he tied with his final season for his best Big Ten record at 6ÿ6. He resigned after eight seasons to concentrate on his football coaching duties.[12]\\r\\nUnder Ozzie Cowles, during the 1947ÿ48 season, Michigan ended the longest (19 years) consecutive year period without a conference championship in school history. They also became the first contestants in the NCAA Division I Men's Basketball Tournament during Cowles second of two seasons.[16] The 1947ÿ48 team posted a 16ÿ6 overall (10ÿ2, Big Ten) record. This team also posted the first undefeated home performance in school history with a 9ÿ0 overall (6ÿ0, Big Ten) record.[14]\\r\\nErnie McCoy became the second former All-American Wolverine player to coach the team.[3] Like Oosterbaan before him, he became a football and baseball coach at Michigan. He also served as assistant Athletic Director under Fritz Crisler. During his four seasons as basketball coach, Michigan's best finish was during the 1948ÿ49 season when they finished 15ÿ6 overall (7ÿ5, Big Ten) and earned a third place Big Ten Conference finish. He coached Michigan's first All-Big Ten basketball players that season in Pete Elliot and captain Bob Harrison who were both selected to the first team.[17] Harrison returned the following season as the first repeat first-team All-Big Ten basketball player and Elliot was a second-team honoree.[18] McCoy served as a football scout at the same time.[17]\\r\\nBill Perigo took over the Michigan coaching job after having served three seasons as Western Michigan basketball coach. Despite previous success as a conference basketball champion coach at Western and subsequent success as a Michigan High School Athletic Association (MHSAA) champion basketball coach, his Michigan teams endured several mediocre seasons.[17] His best Big Ten records came in 1956ÿ57 and 1958ÿ59 when his teams compiled 8ÿ6 conference records. The latter team was tied for second in the conference and was 15ÿ7 overall (8ÿ6, Big Ten).[19] It also had Perigo's only first-team All-Big Ten athlete in M. C. Burton.[18] Team captain and two-time football consensus All-American Ron Kramer was third-team All-Big Ten in 1957 after being second-team All-Big Ten in both 1955 and 1956.[18]\\r\\nDave Strack, a former team 1945ÿ46 captain, had become the freshman basketball team coach in 1948 and later had become a variety assistant to Perigo.[20] He led the team to three consecutive Big Ten Championships from 1963ÿ66 and a third-place finish in the 1964 NCAA tournament. During 1964ÿ65 the team compiled a 24ÿ4 overall (13ÿ1, Big Ten) record while completing an undefeated 11ÿ0 overall (7ÿ0, Big Ten) home season and was the national runner-up, falling to John Wooden's UCLA in the 1965 championship game. Strack earned United Press International (UPI) National Coach of the Year honors. The team ended the season listed number one in both the UPI and Associated Press (AP) national rankings. He recruited All-Americans Russell and Buntin to anchor his mid-1960s teams.[20] Tomjanovich also became a Wolverine at the end of Strack's career and became second team All-Big Ten in 1968 subsequent later stardom.[18] The 1964 team, which went 23ÿ5 overall (11ÿ3, Big Ten), tied with Ohio State with sophomore Russell and junior Buntin. In 1965, Buntin became the first Wolverine to be drafted by the NBA. In 1966, Russell led the team to its third straight conference championship and NCAA selection on his way to National Player of the Year honors.[16]\\r\\nIn Johnny Orr's twelve seasons, he twice (1973ÿ74 and 1976ÿ77) earned Big Ten Coach of the Year honors with Big Ten championships. His teams earned four consecutive NCAA selections from 1974ÿ77. The 25ÿ7 overall (14ÿ4, Big Ten) 1976 team lost to an undefeated Indiana team in the NCAA championship game, and Orr earned National Association of Basketball Coaches Coach of the Year honors that season. The 26ÿ4 overall (16ÿ2, Big Ten) 1977 team finished first in both the AP and UPI national rankings, and Orr won Basketball Weekly National Coach of the Year honors.[21] During Orr's tenure, six players earned a total of seven All-American recognitions, which is the most of any Michigan coach.[3] Steve Grote became Michigan's only three-time first-team Academic All-American from 1975ÿ77 and with a second team All Big Ten as well as three honorable mentions was the first four-time All-Big Ten honoree.[22]\\r\\nBill Frieder, who had been an assistant coach for seven years, took over from Orr in 1980. He coached the school's first post-season basketball champions during the 1983ÿ84 season and the following two teams were back-to-back conference champions. The 1983ÿ84 team compiled a 24ÿ9 overall (11ÿ7, Big Ten) record on their way to a NIT championship victory over Notre Dame. The 1984ÿ85 team went 26ÿ4 overall (16ÿ2, Big Ten), which earned Frieder Big Ten and AP National Coach of the Year honors. The 1985ÿ86 team, which finished 28ÿ5 overall (14ÿ4, Big Ten), started the season with sixteen victories to make a total of thirty-three consecutive regular season victories. Frieder earned five of Michigan's six consecutive NCAA births from 1985ÿ90, currently the longest streak in program history.[23] Roy Tarpley led the 1985 team as Big Ten MVP.[23] Frieder resigned, upon request,[24] immediately prior to the 1989 NCAA tournament to assume the coaching job for the Arizona State Sun Devils men's basketball team.[25]\\r\\nSteve Fisher assumed the coaching position immediately before the 1989 NCAA Division I Men's Basketball Tournament from Frieder after having served and led the team to six straight victories and the championship. Fisher also signed the most famous recruiting class known as the Fab Five (Chris Webber, Juwan Howard, Jalen Rose, Jimmy King and Ray Jackson). He would take these players to the NCAA championship game as Freshmen and Sophomores.[26] In their sophomore 1992ÿ93 season they compiled a 31ÿ5 overall (15ÿ3, Big Ten) record,[26] which has since been vacated. Fisher also won the 1997 NIT tournament with a team that compiled a 25ÿ9 overall (11ÿ5) record.[26][27] Many of Fisher's accomplishments were tarnished by NCAA sanctions. He left the job due to the University of Michigan basketball scandal.[28]\\r\\nBrian Ellerbe assumed the title of interim coach less than five months after becoming an assistant coach. He was named full-time coach following the 25ÿ9 (11ÿ5) 1997ÿ98 season in which he led the team to victories over Iowa, Minnesota and Purdue to capture the Big Ten Conference Men's Basketball Tournament championship. His subsequent teams never finished better than seventh in the conference.[29]\\r\\nTommy Amaker inherited a team that imposed sanctions on itself after his first year at the helm of the program.[30] Nonetheless, he coached the team to the postseason three times including both an NIT championship in 2004 and a runner-up finish in 2006. During the 2005ÿ06, when the team compiled a 22ÿ11 overall (8ÿ8, Big Ten) record, he led them to their first national ranking in eight years when they reached the #20 position.[31] Despite his successes, the team never won a Big Ten Championship and never made the NCAA tournament, which led to his firing after six seasons.[7]\\r\\nJohn Beilein's 10ÿ22 overall (5ÿ13 Big Ten) inaugural season featured the most losses in Michigan's history. However, in Beilein's second season, the team posted impressive non-conference victories over top-five ranked opponents UCLA and Duke. Beilein led Michigan to the 2009 NCAA Tournament, its first appearance since 1998 and the first that was not vacated since 1995.[32] After upsetting Clemson in the first round, the Wolverines were eliminated by Oklahoma in Round 2 by a final score of 73ÿ63.[33]\\r\\nFollowing a disappointing 15ÿ17 season in 2009ÿ10, the Wolverines bounced back to return to the NCAA Tournament in 2011, advancing to the round of 32 before losing to top-seeded Duke, 73ÿ71. The 2010ÿ11 Wolverines, who swept rival Michigan State for the first time since 1997, finished the season 21ÿ14. In the 2011ÿ12 season, Michigan split the season series with both Ohio State and Michigan State and went on to be co-Big Ten champs along with the Buckeyes and Spartans. It was the program's first Big Ten title for Michigan since 1986. The Wolverines finished the season 24-10 and 13-5 in conference play, losing in the opening round of the NCAA Tournament.\\r\\nThe 2012ÿ13 Michigan team earned a #1 ranking in the AP Poll on January 28, 2013, marking the first time since November 30, 1992, that Michigan held that position.[34] The team also made program history for the best season start, at 21ÿ2. On March 31, The Wolverines defeated Florida by a score of 79ÿ59 to make their first Final Four appearance since the 1992ÿ93 season. The Wolverines then defeated Syracuse by a score of 61ÿ56 in the Final Four. In the 2013 National Championship game, the Wolverines lost against Louisville by the score of 82ÿ76.\\r\\nThe 2013ÿ14 team had another strong season, winning Michigan's first outright Big Ten championship since 1986 and advancing to the Elite Eight of the NCAA tournament, where it lost to Kentucky, 75ÿ72.\\r\\nDuring the 2016ÿ17 season, Beilein became the winningest coach in school history, passing Johnny Orr with his 210th win, 75ÿ55 over Illinois on March 9 in the opening round of the 2017 Big Ten Tournament. Michigan went on to win the tournament, its first since the vacated 1998 title, winning four games in four days as the #8 seed and capping it off with a 71ÿ56 championship victory over Wisconsin.\\r\\nDuring the 2017ÿ18 season, Beilein's Wolverines again won four games in four days to win back-to-back Big Ten Tournament championships for the first time in school history. The team went on to win the West regional title and advance to the Final Four following its win over Florida State, 58-54. The win improved the team's record to 32-7, marking a new school record for victories. The 2017ÿ18 Michigan Wolverines men's basketball team moved on to the NCAA tournament championship, where they lost against Villanova to a score of 79-62.\\r\\nAs of March 3, 2018\\r\\n ÿ Conference co-champions\\r\\n*Later vacated by NCAA\\r\\nTotals through March 4, 2018\\r\\nThe Fab Five, the 1991 recruiting class of five freshman starters, were Chris Webber, Juwan Howard, Jalen Rose, Jimmy King, and Ray Jackson. They were notable for having gone to the championship game of the 1992 and 1993 NCAA Division I Men's Basketball Tournament as freshmen and sophomores, for having started the trend of wearing baggy gym shorts,[36][37] which was later popularized by Michael Jordan,[38] and for wearing black athletic socks.[38][39] Due to the Ed Martin scandal, the records from their 1992 Final Four appearance and the entire following season have been forfeited.[38] Although Webber was the only member of the Fab Five officially implicated with the scandal, the reputation of the whole group has been tarnished.[40] Webber (1993), Howard (1994) and Rose (1992, 1994) were college basketball All-Americans.[3][41] and both King (1995 3rd team and 1993 & 1994 honorable mention) and Jackson (1995 2nd team & 1994 honorable mention) achieved All-Big Ten honors.[18] All but Jackson played in the NBA.[42] They were the subject of Mitch Albom's book entitled Fab Five: Basketball, Trash Talk, the American Dream,[43] which at one point was under development by Fox Television as a made-for-television movie.[44] In March 2011 ESPN broadcast a documentary, Fab Five, that was the network's highest-rated in its history.\\r\\nDuring the University of Michigan basketball scandal the Big Ten Conference, National Collegiate Athletic Association, Federal Bureau of Investigation, Internal Revenue Service, and United States Department of Justice investigated the relationship between the University of Michigan, its men's basketball teams and basketball team booster Ed Martin. The program was punished for NCAA rules violations, principally involving payments booster Martin made to several players to launder money from an illegal gambling operation. It is one of the largest incidents involving payments to college athletes in American collegiate history.[45] It was described as one of the three or four worst violations of NCAA bylaws in history up to that time by the NCAA infractions committee chairman and the largest athlete payment scandal ever by ESPN.[45][46]\\r\\nThe case began when the investigation of an automobile rollover accident during Mateen Cleaves' 1996 Michigan Wolverines recruiting trip revealed a curious relationship between Martin and the team. Several Michigan basketball players were implicated over the next few years and by 1999 several were called before a federal grand jury. Four eventual professional basketball players (Chris Webber, Maurice Taylor, Robert Traylor and Louis Bullock) were discovered to have borrowed a total of $616,000 from Martin.[45] During the investigation, Webber claimed not to have had any financial relationship with Martin. Eventually he confessed to having accepted some of the money he was charged with having borrowed. For his perjury during a federal grand jury investigation, he was both fined in the legal system and briefly suspended by National Basketball Association after performing public service.[47][48]\\r\\nIn 2002, the University punished itself when it became apparent that its players were guilty by declaring itself ineligible for post season play immediately, returning post season play monetary rewards, vacating five seasons of games, removing commemorative banners, and placing itself on a two-year probation.[49] The following year, the NCAA accepted these punishments, doubled both the probation period and the post-season ineligibility, penalized the school one scholarship for four seasons, and ordered disassociation from the four guilty players until 2012.[46][50] The disasociation formally ended on May 8, 2013.[51] The additional year of post-season ineligibility was overturned on appeal.[52][53]\\r\\nThe punishment cost the 17ÿ13 2002ÿ03 team its post-season eligibility, cost past teams the 1997 National Invitation Tournament and the 1998 Big Ten Tournament championships as well as 1992 and 1993 NCAA Division I Men's Basketball Tournament Final Four recognition. It cost Traylor his MVP awards in the 1997 NIT and 1998 Big Ten Tournament, as well as Bullock's standing as the school's third all-time leading scorer and all-time leader in 3-point field goals. Steve Fisher lost his job as Michigan head coach as a result of the scandal.[8]\\r\\nBelow are lists of important players and coaches in the history of Michigan Wolverines men's basketball.

The song's lyrics describe the basic premise of the television series.\\r\\nThe full-length version, which is 2 minutes, 54 seconds in length, was included on the show's soundtrack, released in October 2006. For the TV version of the theme, which lasts only 50 seconds, only the first two stanzas and the last two were used.\\r\\n\\"Just Like You\\" and \\"The Other Side of Me\\" were originally tested for the opening theme song, before \\"Best of Both Worlds\\" was chosen as the theme.

Kim is the second child of Kim Jong-il (1941ÿ2011) and Ko Yong-hui.[7] Before taking power, Kim was rarely seen in public, and many of the activities of Kim and his government remain unknown.[8] Even details such as what year he was born, and whether he did indeed attend a Western school under a pseudonym, are difficult to confirm.\\r\\nKim was declared the supreme leader following the state funeral of his father on 28 December 2011. Kim holds the titles of Chairman of the Workers' Party of Korea, Chairman of the Central Military Commission, Chairman of the State Affairs Commission, Supreme Commander of the Korean People's Army,[1] and presidium member of the Presidium of the Workers' Party of Korea.[9] Kim was promoted to the rank of Marshal of North Korea in the Korean People's Army on 18 July 2012, consolidating his position as the Supreme Commander of the Armed Forces[10] and is often referred to as Marshal Kim Jong-un or \\"the Marshal\\" by state media.[11] Kim obtained two degrees, one in physics at Kim Il-sung University, and another as an Army officer at the Kim Il-sung Military University.[12][13]\\r\\nOn 12 December 2013, official North Korean news outlets released reports that due to alleged \\"treachery,\\" he had ordered the execution of his uncle Jang Song-thaek.[14] On 9 March 2014, Kim Jong-un was elected unopposed to the Supreme People's Assembly. He is the first North Korean leader to have been born after the country's founding. Kim Jong-un is widely believed to have ordered the assassination of his half-brother, Kim Jong-nam in Malaysia in February 2017.[15][16]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nScarce information on Kim Jong-un's early life comes from North Korean defectors and people who have claimed to witness him abroad, such as during his school attendance in Switzerland. Some of the information has been conflicting and contradictory, perhaps confusing him with his brother, Kim Jong-chul, who also attended school in Switzerland around the same time. Nevertheless, there has been some consensus on information about his early life. North Korean authorities have stated that his birthdate is 8 January 1982, but South Korean intelligence officials believe the actual date is a year later. Former basketball star Dennis Rodman said that the birthdate is 8 January 1983 after meeting Kim in September 2013 in North Korea.[2] Kim Jong-Un was the second of three children Ko Yong-hui bore to Kim Jong-il; his elder brother Kim Jong-chul was born in 1981, while his younger sister, Kim Yo-jong, is believed to have been born in 1987.[17][18]\\r\\nAccording to reports first published in Japanese newspapers, he went to school in Switzerland near Bern. First reports claimed he attended the private English-language International School in Gmligen under the name \\"Chol-pak\\" or \\"Pak-chol\\" from 1993 to 1998.[19] He was described as shy, a good student who got along well with his classmates and was a basketball fan.[20] He was chaperoned by an older student, who was thought to be his bodyguard.[21]\\r\\nLater, it was reported that Kim Jong-un attended the Liebefeld Steinh?lzli school in K?niz near Bern under the name \\"Pak-un\\" or \\"Un-pak\\" from 1998 until 2000 as the son of an employee of the North Korean embassy in Bern. Authorities of K?niz confirmed that a student from North Korea, registered as the son of a member of the embassy, attended the school from August 1998 until the autumn of 2000, but were unable to give details about his identity. Pak-un first attended a special class for foreign-language children and later attended the regular classes of the 6th, 7th, 8th, and part of the final 9th year, leaving the school abruptly in the autumn of 2000. He was described as a well-integrated and ambitious student who liked to play basketball.[22] However, his grades and attendance rating are reported to have been poor.[23] The ambassador of North Korea in Switzerland, Ri Chol, had a close relationship with him and acted as a mentor.[24] One of Pak-un's classmates told reporters that he had told him that he was the son of the leader of North Korea.[25][26] According to some reports, Jong-un was described by classmates as a shy child who was awkward with girls and indifferent to political issues, but who distinguished himself in sports and had a fascination with the American National Basketball Association and Michael Jordan. One friend claimed that he had been shown pictures of Pak-un with Kobe Bryant and Toni Kuko?.[27]\\r\\nIn April 2012, new documents came to light indicating that Kim Jong-un had lived in Switzerland since 1991 or 1992, earlier than previously thought.[28]\\r\\nThe Laboratory of Anatomic Anthropology at the University of Lyon, France, after comparing the picture of the boy Pak-un taken at the Liebefeld Steinh?lzli school in 1999 with a picture of Kim Jong-un from 2012 came to the conclusion that the two faces show a conformity of 95%. The head of the institute, Raoul Perrot, a forensic anthropologist, considers it most likely that the two pictures show the same person.[29]\\r\\nIt is believed that the student at the Gmligen International School may not have been Kim Jong-un, but his elder brother Kim Jong-chul. It is not known whether the student known as Pak-un in Liebefeld Steinh?lzli lived in Switzerland prior to 1998.[30] All the children of Kim Jong-il are said to have lived in Switzerland, as well as the mother of the two youngest sons, who lived in Geneva for some time.[24]\\r\\nMost analysts agree that Kim Jong-un attended Kim Il-sung University, a leading officer-training school in Pyongyang, from 2002 to 2007.[31]\\r\\nFor many years, only one confirmed photograph of him was known to exist outside North Korea, apparently taken in the mid-1990s, when he was eleven.[32] Occasionally other supposed images of him surfaced but were often disputed.[33] It was only in June 2010, shortly before he was given official posts and publicly introduced to the North Korean people, that more pictures were released of Kim, taken when he was attending school in Switzerland.[34] The first official image of him as an adult was a group photograph released on 30 September 2010, at the end of the party conference that effectively anointed him, in which he is seated in the front row, two places from his father. This was followed by newsreel footage of him attending the conference.[35]\\r\\nIn 2013, Kim Jong-un was awarded an honorary doctorate in Economics by HELP University, a private Malaysian university.[36]\\r\\nKim Jong-un's eldest half-brother, Kim Jong-nam, had been the favorite to succeed, but reportedly fell out of favor after 2001, when he was caught attempting to enter Japan on a fake passport to visit Tokyo Disneyland.[37] Kim Jong-nam was killed in Malaysia in 2017 by suspected North Korean agents.[38]\\r\\nKim Jong-il's former personal chef, Kenji Fujimoto, revealed details regarding Kim Jong-un, with whom he had a good relationship,[39] stating that he was favored to be his father's successor. Fujimoto also said that Jong-un was favored by his father over his elder brother, Kim Jong-chul, reasoning that Jong-chul is too feminine in character, while Jong-un is \\"exactly like his father\\".[40] Furthermore, Fujimoto stated that \\"If power is to be handed over then Jong-un is the best for it. He has superb physical gifts, is a big drinker and never admits defeat.\\" Also, according to Fujimoto, Jong-un smokes Yves Saint Laurent cigarettes, loves Johnnie Walker whisky and has a Mercedes-Benz 600 luxury sedan.[41] When Jong-un was 18, Fujimoto described an episode where Jong-un once questioned his lavish lifestyle and asked, \\"We are here, playing basketball, riding horses, riding jet skis, having fun together. But what of the lives of the average people?\\"[40] On 15 January 2009 the South Korean news agency Yonhap reported that Kim Jong-il had appointed Kim Jong-un to be his successor.[37][42]\\r\\nOn 8 March 2009, BBC News reported that Kim Jong-un was on the ballot for elections to the Supreme People's Assembly, the rubber stamp parliament of North Korea.[43] Subsequent reports indicated that his name did not appear on the list of lawmakers,[44] but he was later elevated to a mid-level position in the National Defense Commission, which is a branch of the North Korean military.[45]\\r\\nFrom 2009, it was understood by foreign diplomatic services that Kim was to succeed his father Kim Jong-il as the head of the Korean Workers' Party and de facto leader of North Korea.[47] He has been named \\"Y?ngmy?ng-han Tongji\\" (??? ??), which loosely translates to \\"Brilliant Comrade\\".[48] His father had also asked embassy staff abroad to pledge loyalty to his son.[49] There have also been reports that citizens in North Korea were encouraged to sing a newly composed \\"song of praise\\" to Kim Jong-un, in a similar fashion to that of praise songs relating to Kim Jong-il and Kim Il-sung.[50] Later, in June, Kim was reported to have visited China secretly to \\"present himself\\" to the Chinese leadership, who later warned against North Korea conducting another nuclear test.[51] The Chinese foreign ministry has strongly denied that this visit occurred.[52]\\r\\nIn September 2009, it was reported that Kim Jong-il had secured support for the succession plan, after a propaganda campaign.[53] It is believed by some that Kim Jong-un was involved in the Cheonan sinking[54] and the bombardment of Yeonpyeong[55] to strengthen his military credentials and facilitate a successful transition of power from his father.[56]\\r\\nKim Jong-un was made a daejang, the equivalent of a four-star general in the United States,[57] on 27 September 2010, a day ahead of a rare Workers' Party of Korea conference in Pyongyang, the first time North Korean media had mentioned him by name and despite his having no previous military experience.[58] Despite the promotion, no further details, including verifiable portraits of Kim, were released.[59] On 28 September 2010, he was named vice chairman of the Central Military Commission and appointed to the Central Committee of the Workers' Party, in an apparent nod to become the successor to Kim Jong-il.[60]\\r\\nOn 10 October 2010, alongside his father, Kim Jong-un attended the ruling Workers' Party's 65th anniversary celebration. This was seen as confirming his position as the next leader of the Workers' Party. Unprecedented international press access was granted to the event, further indicating the importance of Kim Jong-un's presence.[61] In January 2011, the regime reportedly began purging around 200 protgs of both Jong-un's uncle-in-law Jang Song-thaek and O Kuk-ryol, the vice chairman of the National Defence Commission, by either detention or execution to further prevent either man from rivaling Jong-un.[62]\\r\\nOn 17 December 2011, Kim Jong-il died. Despite the elder Kim's plans, it was not immediately clear after his death whether Jong-un would in fact take full power, and what his exact role in a new government would be.[63] Some analysts had predicted that when Kim Jong-il died, Jang Song-thaek would act as regent, as Jong-un was too inexperienced to immediately lead the country.[64][65]\\r\\nFollowing his father's death, Kim Jong-un was hailed as the \\"great successor to the revolutionary cause of Juche\\", \\"outstanding leader of the party, army and people\\"[66] and \\"respected comrade who is identical to Supreme Commander Kim Jong-il\\",[67] and was made chairman of the Kim Jong-il funeral committee. The Korean Central News Agency described Kim Jong-un as \\"a great person born of heaven\\", a propaganda term only his father and grandfather had enjoyed.[68] And the ruling Workers' Party said in an editorial, \\"We vow with bleeding tears to call Kim Jong-un our supreme commander, our leader.\\"[69]\\r\\nHe was publicly declared Supreme Commander of the Korean People's Army on 24 December 2011[70] and formally appointed to the position on 30 December when the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the Workers' Party \\"courteously proclaimed that the dear respected Kim Jong Un, vice-chairman of the Central Military Commission of the WPK, assumed the supreme commandership of the Korean People's Army\\".[1]\\r\\nOn 26 December 2011, the leading North Korean newspaper Rodong Sinmun reported that Kim Jong-un had been acting as chairman of the Central Military Commission,[71] and supreme leader of the country, following his father's demise.[72]\\r\\nOn 9 January 2012, a large rally was held by Korean People's Army in front of Kumsusan Palace of the Sun to honor Kim Jong-un and demonstrate loyalty.[73]\\r\\nIn 2013, Forbes named Kim Jong-un the World's 46th Most Powerful Person.[74]\\r\\nOn 27 March 2012, Kim was elected to the Fourth Conference of the Workers' Party of Korea. On 11 April, that conference elected him as leader of the party under the newly created title of First Secretary. This position replaced the post of general secretary, which was awarded \\"eternally\\" to Kim Jong-il. At the conference, Kim Jong-un also took his father's post as Chairman of the Central Military Commission, as well as his father's old seat on the Presidium of the Workers' Party of Korea.[75] In a speech made prior to the Conference, Kim Jong-un declared that \\"Imbuing the whole society with Kimilsungism-Kimjongilism is the highest programme of our Party\\". On 13 April 2012, the 5th Session of the 12th Supreme People's Assembly appointed Kim Jong-un Chairman of the National Defence Commission.\\r\\nOn 15 April 2012, during a military parade to commemorate Kim Il-sung's centenary, Kim Jong-un made his first public speech.[76] That speech became the basis of \\"Onwards Toward the Final Victory\\".[77]\\r\\nIn July 2012,[78] Kim Jong-un was promoted to wonsu (roughly translated to marshal), the highest active rank in the military. The decision was jointly issued on by the Central Committee and the Central Military Commission of the Workers' Party of Korea, the National Defence Commission, and the Presidium of the Supreme People's Assembly, the Korean Central News Agency subsequently announced.[10] The only higher rank is Dae Wonsu (roughly translated as Grand Marshal or Generalissimo) which was held by Kim's grandfather, Kim Il-sung, and which was awarded posthumously to his father, Kim Jong-il, in February 2012.[10][78] The promotion confirmed Kim's role as top leader of the North Korean military and came days after the replacement of Chief of General Staff Ri Yong-ho by Hyon Yong-chol.[10]\\r\\nIn November 2012, satellite photos revealed a half-kilometer-long (1,600?ft) propaganda message carved into a hillside in Ryanggang Province, reading, \\"Long Live General Kim Jong-un, the Shining Sun!\\".[79]\\r\\nKim Jong-il's personal chef Kenji Fujimoto stated, \\"Stores in Pyongyang were brimming with products and people in the streets looked cheerful. North Korea has changed a lot since Kim Jong-un assumed power. All of this is because of leader Kim Jong-un.\\"[80]\\r\\nOfficially, Kim Jong-un is part of a triumvirate heading the executive branch of the North Korean government along with Premier Pak Pong-ju and parliament chairman Kim Yong-nam (no relation). Each nominally holds powers equivalent to a third of a president's powers in most other presidential systems. Kim Jong-un commands the armed forces, Pak Pong-ju heads the government, and Kim Yong-nam handles foreign relations. Nevertheless, it is generally understood that Kim Jong-un, like his father and grandfather before him, exercises absolute control over the government and the country. Indeed, a constitutional amendment enacted by his father explicitly named the NDC (first) chairman as \\"the supreme leader of the Democratic People's Republic of North Korea\\".[81]\\r\\nOn 30 November 2012, Kim met with Li Jianguo, who \\"briefed Kim on the 18th National Congress of the Communist Party of China\\", according to the state's official news agency, the Korean Central News Agency.[82] A letter from Xi Jinping was hand-delivered during the discussion.[82]\\r\\nIn 2013, Kim re-established his grandfather's style when he made his first New Year's address, a break from the approach of his father. Kim Jong-il never made televised addresses during his 17 years in power.[83] In lieu of delivering a speech, Kim Jong-il contributed to and approved a New Year's Day editorial, jointly published by Rodong Sinmun (the daily newspaper of the Korean Workers' Party), Joson Inmingun (the newspaper of the Korean People's Army), and Chongnyon Jonwi (the newspaper of the Kimilsungist-Kimjongilist Youth League).[84] At the extraordinary meeting with his top defense and security officials on 26 January 2013, Kim issued orders on preparations for a new nuclear test and introduced martial law in North Korea effective from 29 January.[85]\\r\\nOn 9 March 2014, Kim Jong-un was elected to a seat in the Supreme People's Assembly, the country's unicameral legislature. He ran unopposed, but voters had the choice of voting yes or no. There was a record turnout of voters and, according to government officials, all voted \\"yes\\" in his home district of Mount Paekdu.[86] The Supreme People's Assembly subsequently elected him first chairman of the National Defense Commission.[87]\\r\\nIn May 2014, following the collapse of an apartment building in Pyongyang, Kim Jong-un was said to be very upset at the loss of life that resulted. A statement issued by the country's official news agency the Korean Central News Agency used the rare expression \\"profound consolation and apology\\". An unnamed government official was quoted by the BBC as saying Kim Jong-un had \\"sat up all night, feeling painful\\".[88] While the height of the building and the number of casualties was not released, media reports described it is a 23-story building and indicated that more than a hundred people may have died in the collapse.[89]\\r\\nIn August 2012, Kim Jong-un announced economics reforms similar to China's.[90] Kim began to be mentioned by the North Korean state media as \\"supreme leader\\" (chego ryongdoja) at this time.\\r\\nA set of comprehensive economic measures, the \\"Socialist Corporate Responsible Management System\\", were introduced in 2013.[91] The measures increase the autonomy of enterprises by granting them \\"certain rights to engage in business activities autonomously and elevate the will to labor through appropriately implementing the socialist distribution system\\". Another priority of economic policies that year was agriculture, where the pojon (vegetable garden) responsibility system was implemented. The system reportedly achieved a major increase in output in some collective farms.[91]\\r\\nNorth Korean media were describing the economy as a \\"flexible collectivist system\\" where enterprises were applying \\"active and evolutionary actions\\" to achieve economic development.[92] These reports reflect Kim's general economic policy of reforming management, increasing the autonomy and incentives for economic actors. This set of reforms known as the \\"May 30th measures\\" reaffirms both socialist ownership and \\"objective economic laws in guidance and management\\" to improve living standards. Other objectives of the measures are to increase the availability of domestically manufactured goods on markets, introduction of defence innovations into the civilian sector and boost international trade.[92]\\r\\nUnder Kim Jong-un, North Korea has continued to develop nuclear weapons. At a plenary meeting of the WPK Central Committee held on 31 March 2013, Kim Jong-un announced that North Korea will adopt \\"a new strategic line on carrying out economic construction and building nuclear armed forces simultaneously\\".[93] According to several analysts, North Korea sees the nuclear arsenal as vital to deter an attack, and it is unlikely that North Korea would launch a nuclear war.[94] According to a RAND Corporation senior researcher, Kim Jong-un believes that nuclear weapons are his guarantee of regime survival.[95] During the 7th Congress of the Workers' Party of Korea in 2016, Kim Jong-un stated that North Korea would \\"not use nuclear weapons first unless aggressive hostile forces use nuclear weapons to invade on our sovereignty\\".[96] However, on other occasions, North Korea has threatened \\"pre-emptive\\" nuclear attacks against a US-led attack.[97]\\r\\nNorth Korea probably does possess a dozen or so nuclear bombs.[98] However, there is no consensus on whether it has acquired intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs) with nuclear warheads, capable of reaching the United States.[99] It is estimated that North Korea will have sixty nuclear warheads by 2020.[100] North Korea has rockets strong enough to power ICBMs, and, according to the US Defense Intelligence Agency, has nuclear warheads miniaturized enough to be delivered by ICBM,[101] but, according to the South Korean defense department, the ICBMs would not be able to re-enter the atmosphere intact.[102] If North Korea has sufficient nuclear warhead miniaturization technology, its Rodong-1 medium-range missiles could probably launch nuclear strikes as far as Japan.[103]\\r\\nIn December 2015, in a release from the official Korean Central News Agency, Kim announced that his country had developed a hydrogen bomb. Kim's claim is considered unlikely.[104] Kim stated that his family \\"turned the DPRK into a powerful nuclear weapons state ready to detonate a self-reliant A-bomb and H-bomb to reliably defend its sovereignty and the dignity of the nation\\".[105]\\r\\nAs of 2016, the United Nations has enacted five cumulative rounds of sanctions against North Korea for its nuclear program and missile tests.[106]\\r\\nAs with all reporting on North Korea, reports of purges and executions are difficult to verify.[107] In May 2016, analysts were surprised to find that General Ri Yong-gil, reported by South Korea to have been executed earlier in the year, was, in fact, alive and well.[108]\\r\\nIn December 2013, Kim Jong-un's uncle Jang Song-thaek was arrested and executed for treachery.[109] Jang is believed to have been executed by firing squad. Yonhap has stated that, according to multiple unnamed sources, Kim Jong-un has also put to death members of Jang's family, to completely destroy all traces of Jang's existence through \\"extensive executions\\" of his family, including the children and grandchildren of all close relatives. Those reportedly killed in Kim's purge include Jang's sister Jang Kye-sun, her husband and ambassador to Cuba, Jon Yong-jin, and Jang's nephew and ambassador to Malaysia, Jang Yong-chol. The nephew's two sons were also said to have been killed.[110] At the time of Jang's removal, it was announced that \\"the discovery and purge of the Jang group ... made our party and revolutionary ranks purer ...\\"[111] and after his execution on 12 December 2013 state media warned that the army \\"will never pardon all those who disobey the order of the Supreme Commander\\".[112]\\r\\nO Sang-hon (Chos?n'g?l:????; RR:?O Sangheon; MR:?O Sangh?n) was a deputy security minister in the Ministry of People's Security in the government of North Korea who was reportedly killed in a political purge in 2014. According to the Korean newspaper The Chosun Ilbo, O was executed by flamethrower for his role in supporting Kim Jong-un's uncle Jang Song-taek.[113]\\r\\nHuman rights violations under the leadership of Kim Jong-il were condemned by the UN General Assembly.[114] Press reports indicate that they are continuing under Kim Jong-un.[115]\\r\\nThe 2013 report on the situation of human rights in North Korea[116] by United Nations Special Rapporteur Marzuki Darusman proposed a United Nations commission of inquiry[117] to document the accountability of Kim Jong-un and other individuals in the North Korean government for alleged crimes against humanity.[118] The report of the commission of inquiry[119] was published in February 2014 and recommends making him accountable for crimes against humanity at the International Criminal Court.[120]\\r\\nIn July 2016, the United States Department of the Treasury imposed personal sanctions on Kim. Although his involvement in human rights abuses was cited as the reason,[121] officials said the sanctions target the country's nuclear and missile programs.[122]\\r\\nIn May 2017, the North Korean government stated that the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) of the United States and the South Korean National Intelligence Service (NIS) hired a North Korean lumberjack who worked in Russia to assassinate Kim Jong-un with a \\"biochemical weapon\\" that was both radioactive and nano-poisonous, and whose effect would have been delayed by a few months.[123] North Korea said that it would seek extradition of anyone involved in the assassination attempt.[124]\\r\\nKenji Fujimoto, a Japanese chef who used to work as Kim Jong-il's personal cook, described Kim Jong-un as \\"a chip off the old block, a spitting image of his father in terms of face, body shape, and personality\\".[125]\\r\\nThe Washington Post reported in 2009 that Kim Jong-un's school friends recalled he \\"spent hours doing meticulous pencil drawings of Chicago Bulls superstar Michael Jordan\\".[126] He was obsessed with basketball and computer games.[27][127] On 26 February 2013, Kim Jong?un met Dennis Rodman,[128] leading many reporters to speculate that Rodman was the first American that Kim had met.[129] Rodman described his trip to Kim Jong-un's private island, \\"It's like Hawaii or Ibiza, but he's the only one that lives there.\\"[130] Kim Jong-uns net worth is estimated at US$5 billion.[131]\\r\\nIn July 2012, Kim Jong-un showed a change in cultural policy from his father by attending a Moranbong Band concert. The concert contained several elements of pop culture from the West, particularly the United States. Kim used this event to debut his wife to the public, an unprecedented move in North Korea.[132]\\r\\nAccording to diplomatic sources, \\"Kim Jong-un likes to drink and party all night like his father and ordered the [imported sauna] equipment to help him beat hangovers and fatigue.\\"[133] Kim Jong-un is reportedly recruiting young, female companions to form a pleasure troupe to entertain him.[134]\\r\\nDuring Dennis Rodman's trip, Vice magazine correspondent Ryan Duffy observed that \\"the leader was 'socially awkward' and didn't make eye contact when shaking hands\\".[135]\\r\\nAccording to Cheong Seong-chang of the Sejong Institute, Kim Jong-un has greater visible interest in the welfare of his people and engages in greater interaction with them than his father did.[136]\\r\\nIn 2009, reports suggested that Kim Jong-un was a diabetic and suffered from hypertension.[49][137] He is also known to smoke cigarettes.[138]\\r\\nKim Jong-un did not appear in public for six weeks in September and October 2014. State media reported that he was suffering from an \\"uncomfortable physical condition\\". Previously he had been seen limping.[139] When he reappeared, he was using a walking stick.[140]\\r\\nIn September 2015, the South Korean government commented that Kim appeared to have gained 30?kg in body fat over the previous five years, reaching a total estimated body weight of 130?kg (290?lb).[141]\\r\\nOn 25 July 2012, North Korean state media reported for the first time that Kim Jong-un is married to Ri Sol-ju (???).[142][143] Ri, who appears to be in her early 20s, had been accompanying Kim Jong-un to public appearances for several weeks prior to the announcement.[143] According to a South Korean analyst, Kim Jong-il had hastily arranged the marriage after suffering a stroke in 2008, the two married in 2009, and they had a child in 2010.[144] Dennis Rodman, after visiting in 2013, reported that they had a daughter named Ju-ae.[145][146] However, South Korean sources speculated that they could have many children.[147]\\r\\nKim is sometimes accompanied by his younger sister Kim Yo-jong,[17][18] who is said to be instrumental in creating his public image and organising public events for him.[148]\\r\\nOn 13 February 2017, Kim Jong-nam, the exiled half-brother of Kim Jong-un, was assassinated with the nerve agent VX while walking through Terminal 2 at Kuala Lumpur International Airport.[149]","input":"Where was the dictator of north korea educated?"},{"output":"the collective community of Islamic peoples","context":"Ummah (Arabic: ???? [??m.m?]) is an Arabic word meaning \\"community\\". It is distinguished from Sha?b (??? [???b]) which means a nation with common ancestry or geography. Thus, it can be said to be a supra-national community with a common history.\\r\\nIt is a synonym for ummat al-Islm (??? ???????, 'the Islamic community'), and it is commonly used to mean the collective community of Islamic peoples. In the Quran the ummah typically refers to a single group that shares common religious beliefs, specifically those that are the objects of a divine plan of salvation.[1][2] In the context of pan-Islamism and politics, the word ummah can be used to mean the concept of a Commonwealth of the Believers (??? ???????? ummat al-mu?minؐn).\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe word Ummah (pl. umam) means Nation in Arabic. For example the Arabic term for the United Nations in Arabic is ????? ??????? Al-Umam Al-Mutahedah, and the term ????? ??????? Al-Ummah Al-Arabeyah is used to refer to \\"The Arabic Nation\\". [3]\\r\\nThe Word Ummah differs from the concept of a country or people. In it is greater context it is used to describe a larger group of people. For example, in Arabic the world ??? Sha'ab (\\"people\\") would be used to describe the citizens of Turkey. However, the term Ummah is used to describe the Turkic Nation as a whole, which includes Turkey, Turkmenistan, Kazakhstan, Azerbaijan, and other countries and ethnic groups in Central Asia.\\r\\nThe phrase Ummah Whidah in the Quran (??? ?????, \\"One Nation\\") refers to all the Islamic world as it existed at the time. The Quran says: \\"You [Muslims] are the best nation brought out for Mankind, commanding what is righteous (????? Ma'rf, lit. \\"recognized [as good]\\") and forbidding what is wrong (???? Munkar, lit. \\"recognized [as evil]\\")\\" [3:110].\\r\\nThe usage is further clarified by the Constitution of Medina, an early document said to have been negotiated by Muhammad in CE 622 with the leading clans of Medina, which explicitly refers to Jewish, Christians and pagan citizens of Medina as members of the Ummah.[4][5][6][7]\\r\\nAt the time of Muhammad, before the conception of the ummah, Arab communities were typically governed by kinship.[8] In other words, the political ideology of the Arabs centered around tribal affiliations and blood-relational ties.[8] In the midst of a tribal society, the religion of Islam emerged and along with it the concept of the ummah. The ummah emerged according to the idea that a messenger or prophet has been sent to a community.[1] But unlike earlier messengers who had been sent to various communities in the past (as can be found among the Prophets in the Old Testament), Muhammad had been given the task to develop a universal ummah and not only for the Arabs.[1] Muhammad's purpose as messenger to them was to transmit a divine message, and lead the Islamic community to salvation.[1] Since Muhammad is the messenger for the ummah, it indicates there is a divine message, which further implies that God is directing the life affairs of the ummah.[8] Accordingly, the purpose of the ummah was to be based on religion, following the commands of God, rather than kinship.[8]\\r\\nPolitical\\r\\nMilitant\\r\\n Islam portal\\r\\nThere are a total of sixty-two instances that the term ummah is mentioned in the Qur'an.[9] The use of ummah in the Qur'an almost always refers to ethical, linguistic, or religious bodies of people who are subject to the divine plan of salvation.[1][10] The meaning of the term ummah in the Qur'an appears to transform throughout the chronology of the Qur'an.[9] When it is first used in the Qur'an it is hardly distinguishable from the term qawm which can be translated to 'people'.[11] The Qur'an recognizes that each ummah has a messenger that has been sent to relay a divine message to the community and that all ummahs await God's ultimate judgment.[8][10] Although the meaning of the ummah begins simply with a general application of the word, it gradually develops to reference a general religious community and then evolves to specifically refer to the Muslim community.[9] Before it refers exclusively to Muslims, the ummah encompasses Jewish and Christian communities as one with the Muslims and refers to them as the People of the Book.[8][10] This is supplemented by the Constitution of Medina which declares all members of the ummah, regardless of religion, to be of one ummah.'[8] In these passages of the Qur'an, ummah may be referring to a unity of mankind through the shared beliefs of the monotheistic religions.[9] However, Denny points out that the most recent ummah that receives a messenger from God is the Arab ummah.[10] As the Muslims became stronger during their residence in Medina, the Arab ummah narrowed into an ummah exclusively for Muslims.[10] This is evidenced by the resacralization of the Kaaba and Muhammad's command to take a pilgrimage to Mecca, along with the redirection of prayer from Jerusalem to Mecca.[10] The period in which the term ummah is used most often is within the Third Meccan Period followed by the Medinian period.[10] The extensive use of the term during these two time periods indicates that Muhammad was beginning to arrive at the concept of the ummah to specify the genuine Muslim community.[10] Furthermore, the early Meccan passages generally equate ummah as religion, whereas in the Medinan period the passages of the Qur'an refer more specifically to the relation of the ummah and religion.[10] The final passage that refers to ummah in the Qur'an refers to the Muslims as the \\"best community\\" and accordingly led to ummah as an exclusive reference to Islam.[10]\\r\\nA verse in the Qur'an also mentions the ummah, in the context of all of the messengers, that this ummah (nation) of theirs is one ummah and that God is their Lord entirely.\\r\\n\\"O messengers, eat from the good foods and work righteousness. Indeed, I, of what you do, am Knowing. And indeed this, your ummah (nation), is one ummah (nation), and I am your Lord, so fear Me.\\" [Qur'an, Surah Al-Mu'minun (The believers) (23:51-52)] [12]\\r\\nInitially it did not appear that the new Muslim community would oppose the tribes that already existed in Mecca.[13] The first Muslims did not need to make a break with traditional Quraysh customs since the vision for the new community included moral norms that were not unfamiliar to the tribal society of Mecca.[13] However, what distinguished this community from the tribes was its focus of the place of those morals within a person's life.[13]\\r\\nAfter Muhammad and the first converts to Islam were forced to leave Mecca, the community was welcomed in Medina by the Ansar, a group of Pagans who had converted to Islam.[1][14] Despite Medina already being occupied by numerous Jewish and polytheistic tribes, the arrival of Muhammad and his followers provoked no opposition from Medina's residents.[14] Upon arriving in Medina, Muhammad established the Constitution of Medina with the various tribal leaders in order to form the Meccan immigrants and the Medinan residents into a single community, the ummah. Rather than limiting members of the ummah to a single tribe or religious affiliation as had been the case when the ummah first developed in Mecca, the Constitution of Medina ensured that the ummah was composed of a variety of people and beliefs essentially making it to be supra-tribal.[15] Islamic historian, Tabari, suggested that Muhammad's initial intentions upon arriving in Medina was to establish a mosque, however this is unlikely [16] Tabari also claimed that Muhammad observed the first Friday prayer in Medina.[17] It occurred on Friday because Friday served as a market day in Medina to enable Jews to observe the sabbath.[17] Membership to the ummah was not restricted to adhering to the Muslim faith but rather encompassed all of the tribes as long as they vowed to recognize Muhammad as the community and political figure of authority.[16][18] The Constitution of Medina declared that the Jewish tribes and the Muslims from Medina formed 'one ummah.' [8] It is possible that the Medinan ummah was purely secular (compared to the later transformation of the ummah in Mecca) due to its variety of beliefs and practices of its members.[16] The purpose of the Constitution of Medina was to uphold political obligations and social relations between the various tribes.[16] The community members in Medina, although not derived from the same faith, were committed to each other through a desire to defend the common good of the community.[16] In other words, the community was united according to preserve its shared interests.[16] The people of other religious beliefs, particularly those that are considered to be \\"People of the Book\\" were granted the special protection of God through the dhimmah contract.[8] These other religious groups were guaranteed security by God and Muhammad because of their common religious history as being the \\"People of the Book.\\" The dhimmah served as a sort of alliance between Muslims and non-Muslims.[8] In the earlier treaties of the dhimmah, both groups were viewed as equal in status and both were obligated to help the other. However, in later treaties, after Islam had gained more power throughout Arabia, the dhimmah was perceived as the fulfilment of the religious duties of Muslims along with the payment of zakat. With the new contract of dhimmah, non-Muslims' protection by God and Muhammad became dependent on their payment.\\r\\nThe Constitution of Medina is a document created by Muhammad to regulate social and political life in Medina.[19] It deals with various tribal issues such as the organization and leadership of the participating tribal groups, warfare, blood money, ransom of captives, and war expenditures.[20] It is at the beginning of the document that the Muslims from the Quraysh (those from Mecca) and the Muslims from Yathrib (those from Medina) are declared to be an ummah or one community.[20] The word ummah appears again when the document refers to the treaty of the Jews and states that the Yahd Banؐ ' Awf, or Jews, are an ummah that exists alongside the ummah of the Muslims or may be included in the same ummah as the Muslims.[20] The document does state that the Jews who join the Muslims will receive aid and equal rights.[20] In addition, the Jews will be guaranteed security from the Muslims, and are granted to maintain their own religion just as the Muslims will maintain theirs.[20] This implies that the ummah is not strictly a religious community in Medina.[8] The Constitution of Medina lists the various Medinan tribes derived from the Aws and Khazraj as well as the several Jewish tribes that are granted to keep their tribal organization and leadership.[20] The document also reveals that each group, the Muslims and the Jews, is responsible for its own finances except during time of war, when the two are able to share expenses.[8][20]\\r\\nAfter the Muslim takeover of Mecca, membership in the ummah required a commitment to Islam.[16] This happened as a result of Islam beginning to distinguish itself not just from Paganism but also Judaism and Christianity by emphasizing a model of community based on Abraham.[13][13] The membership of the ummah was now based on two main principles; the first is to worship God alone and secondly, in order to worship God properly one must be in a guided community.[13]\\r\\nThe essentials of the new society were the new relations between human beings and God and between human beings and one another. The society was held together by the Prophet. Feuding among Muslim clans was forbidden.[13] Muhammad's community was designed to transform the world itself through action in the world.[13]","input":"What does the arabic word ummah refer to?"},{"output":"Paracelsus (1493ÿ1541)","context":"The doctrine of signatures, dating from the time of Dioscorides and Galen, states that herbs resembling various parts of the body can be used by herbalists to treat ailments of those body parts.

He suggested that God marked objects with a sign, or \\"signature\\", for their purpose.[2] Plants bearing parts that resembled human body-parts, animals, or other objects were thought to have useful relevance to those parts, animals or objects. The \\"signature\\" could sometimes also be identified in the environments or specific sites in which plants grew. B?hme's 1621 book The Signature of All Things gave its name to the doctrine.[1] The English physician-philosopher Sir Thomas Browne in his discourse The Garden of Cyrus (1658) uses the Quincunx pattern as an archetype of the 'doctrine of signatures' pervading the design of gardens and orchards, botany and the Macrocosm at large.\\r\\nThe botanist William Coles (1626ÿ1662) supposed that God had made 'Herbes for the use of men, and hath given them particular Signatures, whereby a man may read?... the use of them.'[1] Coles's The Art of Simpling and Adam in Eden, stated that walnuts were good for curing head ailments because in his opinion, \\"they Have the perfect Signatures of the Head\\". Regarding Hypericum, he wrote, \\"The little holes whereof the leaves of Saint Johns wort are full, doe resemble all the pores of the skin and therefore it is profitable for all hurts and wounds that can happen thereunto.\\"[2]\\r\\nA theological justification was made for this philosophy: \\"It was reasoned that the Almighty must have set his sign upon the various means of curing disease which he provided\\".[3]\\r\\nFor the late medieval viewer, the natural world was vibrant with images of the Deity: 'as above, so below,' a Hermetic principle expressed as the relationship between macrocosm and microcosm; the principle is rendered sicut in terra.

It is a member of the Microsoft Office suite of applications, included in the Professional and higher editions or sold separately.\\r\\nMicrosoft Access stores data in its own format based on the Access Jet Database Engine. It can also import or link directly to data stored in other applications and databases.[1]\\r\\nSoftware developers, data architects and power users can use Microsoft Access to develop application software. Like other Microsoft Office applications, Access is supported by Visual Basic for Applications (VBA), an object-based programming language that can reference a variety of objects including DAO (Data Access Objects), ActiveX Data Objects, and many other ActiveX components. Visual objects used in forms and reports expose their methods and properties in the VBA programming environment, and VBA code modules may declare and call Windows operating system operations.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nMicrosoft's first attempt to sell a relational database product was during the mid 1980s, when Microsoft obtained the license to sell R:Base.[2] In the late 1980s Microsoft developed its own solution codenamed Omega.[3] It was confirmed in 1988 that a database product for Windows and OS/2 was in development.[4][5] It was going to include the \\"EB\\" Embedded Basic language,[3] which was going to be the language for writing macros in all Microsoft applications,[6] but the unification of macro languages did not happen until the introduction of Visual Basic for Applications (VBA). Omega was also expected to provide a front end to the Microsoft SQL Server.[7] The application was very resource-hungry, and there were reports that it was working slowly on the 386 processors that were available at the time.[8] It was scheduled to be released in the 1st quarter of 1990,[9] but in 1989 the development of the product was reset[2][10] and it was rescheduled to be delivered no sooner than in January 1991.[11] Parts of the project were later used for other Microsoft projects: Cirrus (codename for Access) and Thunder (codename for Visual Basic, where the Embedded Basic engine was used).[2][3] After Access's premiere, the Omega project was demonstrated in 1992 to several journalists and included features that were not available in Access.[12]\\r\\nAfter the Omega project was scrapped, some of its developers were assigned to the Cirrus project (most were assigned to the team which created Visual Basic).[2] Its goal was to create a competitor for applications like Paradox or dBase that would work on Windows.[13] After Microsoft acquired FoxPro, there were rumors that the Microsoft project might get replaced with it,[14] but the company decided to develop them in parallel. It was assumed that the project would make use of Extensible Storage Engine (Jet Blue)[15] but, in the end, only support for Microsoft Jet Database Engine (Jet Red) was provided. The project used some of the code from both the Omega project and a pre-release version of Visual Basic.[3] In July 1992, betas of Cirrus shipped to developers[16] and the name Access became the official name of the product.[17]\\r\\n1992: Microsoft released Access version 1.0 on November 13, 1992, and an Access 1.1 release in May 1993 to improve compatibility with other Microsoft products and to include the Access Basic programming language.\\r\\n1994: Microsoft specified the minimum hardware requirements for Access v2.0 as: Microsoft Windows v3.1 with 4 MB of RAM required, 6 MB RAM recommended; 8 MB of available hard disk space required, 14 MB hard disk space recommended. The product shipped on seven 1.44 MB diskettes. The manual shows a 1994 copyright date.\\r\\nWith Office 95, Microsoft Access 7.0 (a.k.a. \\"Access 95\\") became part of the Microsoft Office Professional Suite, joining Microsoft Excel, Word, and PowerPoint and transitioning from Access Basic to VBA. Since then, Microsoft has released new versions of Microsoft Access with each release of Microsoft Office. This includes Access 97 (version 8.0), Access 2000 (version 9.0), Access 2002 (version 10.0), Access 2003 (version 11.5), Access 2007 (version 12.0), Access 2010 (version 14.0), and Access 2013 (version 15.0).\\r\\nVersions 3.0 and 3.5 of Microsoft Jet database engine (used by Access 7.0 and the later-released Access 97 respectively) had a critical issue which made these versions of Access unusable on a computer with more than 1 GB of memory.[18] While Microsoft fixed this problem for Jet 3.5/Access 97 post-release, it never fixed the issue with Jet 3.0/Access 95.\\r\\nThe native Access database format (the Jet MDB Database) has also evolved over the years. Formats include Access 1.0, 1.1, 2.0, 7.0, 97, 2000, 2002, and 2007. The most significant transition was from the Access 97 to the Access 2000 format; which is not backward compatible with earlier versions of Access. As of 2011[update] all newer versions of Access support the Access 2000 format. New features were added to the Access 2002 format which can be used by Access 2002, 2003, 2007, and 2010.\\r\\nMicrosoft Access 2000 increased the maximum database size to 2GB from 1GB in Access 97.\\r\\nMicrosoft Access 2007 introduced a new database format: ACCDB. It supports links to SharePoint lists and complex data types such as multivalue and attachment fields. These new field types are essentially recordsets in fields and allow the storage of multiple values or files in one field. Microsoft Access 2007 also introduced File Attachment field, which stored data more efficiently than the OLE (Object Linking and Embedding) field.\\r\\nMicrosoft Access 2010 introduced a new version of the ACCDB format supported hosting Access Web solutions on a SharePoint 2010 server. For the first time, this allowed Access solutions to be run without having to install Access on their PC and was the first support of Mac users. Any user on the SharePoint site with sufficient rights could use the Access Web solution. A copy of Access was still required for the developer to create the Access Web solution, and the desktop version of Access remained part of Access 2010. The Access Web solutions were not the same as the desktop solutions. Automation was only through the macro language (not VBA) which Access automatically converted to JavaScript. The data was no longer in an Access database but SharePoint lists. An Access desktop database could link to the SharePoint data, so hybrid applications were possible so that SharePoint users needing basic views and edits could be supported while the more sophisticated, traditional solutions could remain in the desktop Access database.\\r\\nMicrosoft Access 2013 offers traditional Access desktop solutions plus a significantly updated SharePoint 2013 web solution.[19] The Access Web model in Access 2010 was replaced by a new architecture that stores its data in actual SQL Server databases. Unlike SharePoint lists, this offers true relational database design with referential integrity, scalability, extensibility and performance one would expect from SQL Server.[20] The database solutions that can be created on SharePoint 2013 offer a modern user interface designed to display multiple levels of relationships that can be viewed and edited, along with resizing for different devices and support for touch. The Access 2013 desktop is similar to Access 2010 but several features were discontinued including support for Access Data Projects (ADPs), pivot tables, pivot charts, Access data collections, source code control, replication, and other legacy features.[21] Access desktop database maximum size remained 2GB (as it has been since the 2000 version).\\r\\nPrior to the introduction of Access, Borland (with Paradox and dBase) and Fox (with FoxPro) dominated the desktop database market. Microsoft Access was the first mass-market database program for Windows. With Microsoft's purchase of FoxPro in 1992 and the incorporation of Fox's Rushmore query optimization routines into Access, Microsoft Access quickly became the dominant database for Windows - effectively eliminating the competition which failed to transition from the MS-DOS world.[22]\\r\\nAccess's initial codename was Cirrus; the forms engine was called Ruby. This was before Visual Basic. Bill Gates saw the prototypes and decided that the BASIC language component should be co-developed as a separate expandable application, a project called Thunder. The two projects were developed separately.\\r\\nAccess was also the name of a communications program from Microsoft, meant to compete with ProComm and other programs. This proved a failure and was dropped.[23] Years later, Microsoft reused the name for its database software.\\r\\nIn addition to using its own database storage file, Microsoft Access also may be used as the 'front-end' of a program while other products act as the 'back-end' tables, such as Microsoft SQL Server and non-Microsoft products such as Oracle and Sybase. Multiple backend sources can be used by a Microsoft Access Jet Database (ACCDB and MDB formats). Similarly, some applications such as Visual Basic, ASP.NET, or Visual Studio .NET will use the Microsoft Access database format for its tables and queries. Microsoft Access may also be part of a more complex solution, where it may be integrated with other technologies such as Microsoft Excel, Microsoft Outlook, Microsoft Word, Microsoft PowerPoint and ActiveX controls.\\r\\nAccess tables support a variety of standard field types, indices, and referential integrity including cascading updates and deletes. Access also includes a query interface, forms to display and enter data, and reports for printing. The underlying Jet database, which contains these objects, is multi-user and handles record-locking.\\r\\nRepetitive tasks can be automated through macros with point-and-click options. It is also easy to place a database on a network and have multiple users share and update data without overwriting each other's work. Data is locked at the record level which is significantly different from Excel which locks the entire spreadsheet.\\r\\nThere are template databases within the program and for download from Microsoft's website. These options are available upon starting Access and allow users to enhance a database with predefined tables, queries, forms, reports, and macros. Database templates support VBA code but Microsoft's templates do not include VBA code.\\r\\nProgrammers can create solutions using VBA, which is similar to Visual Basic 6.0 (VB6) and used throughout the Microsoft Office programs such as Excel, Word, Outlook and PowerPoint. Most VB6 code, including the use of Windows API calls, can be used in VBA. Power users and developers can extend basic end-user solutions to a professional solution with advanced automation, data validation, error trapping, and multi-user support.\\r\\nThe number of simultaneous users that can be supported depends on the amount of data, the tasks being performed, level of use, and application design. Generally accepted limits are solutions with 1 GB or less of data (Access supports up to 2 GB) and it performs quite well with 100 or fewer simultaneous connections (255 concurrent users are supported). This capability is often a good fit for department solutions. If using an Access database solution in a multi-user scenario, the application should be \\"split\\". This means that the tables are in one file called the back end (typically stored on a shared network folder) and the application components (forms, reports, queries, code, macros, linked tables) are in another file called the front end. The linked tables in the front end point to the back end file. Each user of the Access application would then receive his or her own copy of the front end file.\\r\\nApplications that run complex queries or analysis across large datasets would naturally require greater bandwidth and memory. Microsoft Access is designed to scale to support more data and users by linking to multiple Access databases or using a back-end database like Microsoft SQL Server. With the latter design, the amount of data and users can scale to enterprise-level solutions.\\r\\nMicrosoft Access's role in web development prior to version 2010 is limited. User interface features of Access, such as forms and reports, only work in Windows. In versions 2000 through 2003 an Access object type called Data Access Pages created publishable web pages. Data Access Pages are no longer supported. The Microsoft Jet Database Engine, core to Access, can be accessed through technologies such as ODBC or OLE DB. The data (i.e., tables and queries) can be accessed by web-based applications developed in ASP.NET, PHP, or Java. With the use of Microsoft's Terminal Services and Remote Desktop Application in Windows Server 2008 R2, organizations can host Access applications so they can be run over the web.[24] This technique does not scale the way a web application would but is appropriate for a limited number of users depending on the configuration of the host.\\r\\nAccess 2010 allows databases to be published to SharePoint 2010 web sites running Access Services. These web-based forms and reports run in any modern web browser. The resulting web forms and reports, when accessed via a web browser, don't require any add-ins or extensions (e.g. ActiveX, Silverlight).\\r\\nAccess 2013 can create web applications directly in SharePoint 2013 sites running Access Services. Access 2013 web solutions store its data in an underlying SQL Server database which is much more scalable and robust than the Access 2010 version which used SharePoint lists to store its data.\\r\\nA compiled version of an Access database (File extensions: .MDE /ACCDE or .ADE; ACCDE only works with Access 2007 or later) can be created to prevent user from accessing the design surfaces to modify module code, forms, and reports. An MDE or ADE file is a Microsoft Access database file with all modules compiled and all editable source code removed. Both the .MDE and .ADE versions of an Access database are used when end-user modifications are not allowed or when the applications source code should be kept confidential.\\r\\nMicrosoft also offers developer extensions for download to help distribute Access 2007 applications, create database templates, and integrate source code control with Microsoft Visual SourceSafe.\\r\\nUsers can create tables, queries, forms and reports, and connect them together with macros. Advanced users can use VBA to write rich solutions with advanced data manipulation and user control. Access also has report creation features that can work with any data source that Access can access.\\r\\nThe original concept of Access was for end users to be able to access data from any source. Other features include: the import and export of data to many formats including Excel, Outlook, ASCII, dBase, Paradox, FoxPro, SQL Server and Oracle. It also has the ability to link to data in its existing location and use it for viewing, querying, editing, and reporting. This allows the existing data to change while ensuring that Access uses the latest data. It can perform heterogeneous joins between data sets stored across different platforms. Access is often used by people downloading data from enterprise level databases for manipulation, analysis, and reporting locally.\\r\\nThere is also the Jet Database format (MDB or ACCDB in Access 2007) which can contain the application and data in one file. This makes it very convenient to distribute the entire application to another user, who can run it in disconnected environments.\\r\\nOne of the benefits of Access from a programmer's perspective is its relative compatibility with SQL (structured query language)  queries can be viewed graphically or edited as SQL statements, and SQL statements can be used directly in Macros and VBA Modules to manipulate Access tables. Users can mix and use both VBA and \\"Macros\\" for programming forms and logic and offers object-oriented possibilities. VBA can also be included in queries.\\r\\nMicrosoft Access offers parameterized queries. These queries and Access tables can be referenced from other programs like VB6 and .NET through DAO or ADO. From Microsoft Access, VBA can reference parameterized stored procedures via ADO.\\r\\nThe desktop editions of Microsoft SQL Server can be used with Access as an alternative to the Jet Database Engine. This support started with MSDE (Microsoft SQL Server Desktop Engine), a scaled down version of Microsoft SQL Server 2000, and continues with the SQL Server Express versions of SQL Server 2005 and 2008.\\r\\nMicrosoft Access is a file server-based database. Unlike clientÿserver relational database management systems (RDBMS), Microsoft Access does not implement database triggers, stored procedures, or transaction logging. Access 2010 includes table-level triggers and stored procedures built into the ACE data engine. Thus a Client-server database system is not a requirement for using stored procedures or table triggers with Access 2010. Tables, queries, forms, reports and macros can now be developed specifically for web base application in Access 2010. Integration with Microsoft SharePoint 2010 is also highly improved.\\r\\nThe 2013 edition of Microsoft Access introduced a mostly flat design and the ability to install apps from the Office Store, but it did not introduce new features. The theme was partially updated again for 2016, but no dark theme was created for Access.\\r\\nASP.NET web forms can query a Microsoft Access database, retrieve records and display them on the browser.[25]\\r\\nSharePoint Server 2010 via Access Services allows for Access 2010 databases to be published to SharePoint, thus enabling multiple users to interact with the database application from any standards-compliant Web browser. Access Web databases published to SharePoint Server can use standard objects such as tables, queries, forms, macros, and reports. Access Services stores those objects in SharePoint.[26]\\r\\nAccess 2013 offers the ability to publish Access web solutions on SharePoint 2013. Rather than using SharePoint lists as its data source, Access 2013 uses an actual SQL Server database hosted by SharePoint or SQL Azure.[27] This offers a true relational database with referential integrity, scalability, maintainability, and extensibility compared to the SharePoint views Access 2010 used. The macro language is enhanced to support more sophisticated programming logic and database level automation.[20]\\r\\nMicrosoft Access can also import or link directly to data stored in other applications and databases.[1] Microsoft Office Access 2007 and newer can import from or link to:\\r\\nMicrosoft offers free runtime versions of Microsoft Access which allow users to run an Access desktop application without needing to purchase or install a retail version of Microsoft Access. This allows Access developers to create databases that can be freely distributed to an unlimited number of end-users. These runtime versions of Access 2007 and later can be downloaded for free from Microsoft.[30] The runtime versions for Access 2003 and earlier were part of the Office Developer Extensions/Toolkit and required a separate purchase.\\r\\nThe runtime version allows users to view, edit and delete data, along with running queries, forms, reports, macros and VBA module code. The runtime version does not allow users to change the design of Microsoft Access tables, queries, forms, reports, macros or module code. The runtime versions are similar to their corresponding full version of Access and usually compatible with earlier versions; for example Access Runtime 2010 allows a user to run an Access application made with the 2010 version as well as 2007 through 2000. Due to deprecated features in Access 2013, its runtime version is also unable to support those older features. During development one can simulate the runtime environment from the fully functional version by using the /runtime command line option.[31]\\r\\nAccess stores all database tables, queries, forms, reports, macros, and modules in the Access Jet database as a single file.\\r\\nFor query development, Access offers a \\"Query Designer\\", a graphical user interface that allows users to build queries without knowledge of structured query language. In the Query Designer, users can \\"show\\" the datasources of the query (which can be tables or queries) and select the fields they want returned by clicking and dragging them into the grid. One can set up joins by clicking and dragging fields in tables to fields in other tables. Access allows users to view and manipulate the SQL code if desired. Any Access table, including linked tables from different data sources, can be used in a query.\\r\\nAccess also supports the creation of \\"pass-through queries\\". These snippets of SQL code can address external data sources through the use of ODBC connections on the local machine. This enables users to interact with data stored outside the Access program without using linked tables or Jet.[32] Users construct the pass-through queries using the SQL syntax supported by the external data source.\\r\\nWhen developing reports (in \\"Design View\\") additions or changes to controls cause any linked queries to execute in the background and the designer is forced to wait for records to be returned before being able to make another change. This feature cannot be turned off.\\r\\nNon-programmers can use the macro feature to automate simple tasks through a series of drop-down selections. Macros allow users to easily chain commands together such as running queries, importing or exporting data, opening and closing forms, previewing and printing reports, etc. Macros support basic logic (IF-conditions) and the ability to call other macros. Macros can also contain sub-macros which are similar to subroutines. In Access 2007, enhanced macros included error-handling and support for temporary variables. Access 2007 also introduced embedded macros that are essentially properties of an object's event. This eliminated the need to store macros as individual objects. However, macros were limited in their functionality by a lack of programming loops and advanced coding logic until Access 2013. With significant further enhancements introduced in Access 2013, the capabilities of macros became fully comparable to VBA. They made feature rich web-based application deployments practical, via a greatly enhanced Microsoft SharePoint interface and tools, as well as on traditional Windows desktops.\\r\\nIn common with other products in the Microsoft Office suite, the other programming language used in Access is Microsoft VBA. It is similar to Visual Basic 6.0 (VB6) and code can be stored in modules, classes, and code behind forms and reports. To create a richer, more efficient and maintainable finished product with good error handling, most professional Access applications are developed using the VBA programming language rather than macros, except where web deployment is a business requirement.\\r\\nTo manipulate data in tables and queries in VBA or macros, Microsoft provides two database access libraries of COM components:\\r\\nAs well as DAO and ADO, developers can also use OLE DB and ODBC for developing native C/C++ programs for Access.[33] For ADPs and the direct manipulation of SQL Server data, ADO is required. DAO is most appropriate for managing data in Access/Jet databases, and the only way to manipulate the complex field types in ACCDB tables.\\r\\nIn the database container or navigation pane in Access 2007 and later versions, the system automatically categorizes each object by type (e.g., table, query, macro). Many Access developers use the Leszynski naming convention, though this is not universal; it is a programming convention, not a DBMS-enforced rule.[34][35] It is particularly helpful in VBA where references to object names may not indicate its data type (e.g. tbl for tables, qry for queries).\\r\\nDevelopers deploy Microsoft Access most often for individual and workgroup projects (the Access 97 speed characterization was done for 32 users).[36] Since Access 97, and with Access 2003 and 2007, Microsoft Access and hardware have evolved significantly. Databases under 1 GB in size (which can now fit entirely in RAM) and 200 simultaneous users are well within the capabilities of Microsoft Access.[37] Of course, performance depends on the database design and tasks. Disk-intensive work such as complex searching and querying take the most time.\\r\\nAs data from a Microsoft Access database can be cached in RAM, processing speed may substantially improve when there is only a single user or if the data is not changing. In the past, the effect of packet latency on the record-locking system caused Access databases to run slowly on a virtual private network (VPN) or a wide area network (WAN) against a Jet database. As of 2010[update] broadband connections have mitigated this issue. Performance can also be enhanced if a continuous connection is maintained to the back-end database throughout the session rather than opening and closing it for each table access. If Access database performance over VPN or WAN suffers, then a client using Remote Desktop Protocol (such as Microsoft Terminal Services) can provide an effective solution. Access databases linked to SQL Server or to Access Data Projects work well[citation needed] over VPNs and WANs.\\r\\nIn July 2011, Microsoft acknowledged an intermittent query performance problem with all versions of Access and Windows 7 and Windows Server 2008 R2 due to the nature of resource management being vastly different in newer operating systems.[38] This issue severely affects query performance on both Access 2003 and earlier with the Jet Database Engine code, as well as Access 2007 and later with the Access Database Engine (ACE).[38] Microsoft has issued hotfixes KB2553029 for Access 2007 and KB2553116 for Access 2010, but will not fix the issue with Jet 4.0 as it is out of mainstream support.[38]\\r\\nIn earlier versions of Microsoft Access, the ability to distribute applications required the purchase of the Developer Toolkit; in Access 2007, 2010 and Access 2013 the \\"Runtime Only\\" version is offered as a free download,[39] making the distribution of royalty-free applications possible on Windows XP, Vista, 7 and Windows 8.x.[40]\\r\\nMicrosoft Access applications can adopt a split-database architecture. The single database can be divided into a separate \\"back-end\\" file that contains the data tables (shared on a file server) and a \\"front-end\\" (containing the application's objects such as queries, forms, reports, macros, and modules). The \\"front-end\\" Access application is distributed to each user's desktop and linked to the shared database. Using this approach, each user has a copy of Microsoft Access (or the runtime version) installed on their machine along with their application database. This reduces network traffic since the application is not retrieved for each use. The \\"front-end\\" database can still contain local tables for storing a user's settings or temporary data. This split-database design also allows development of the application independent of the data. One disadvantage is that users may make various changes to their own local copy of the application and this makes it hard to manage version control. When a new version is ready, the front-end database is replaced without impacting the data database. Microsoft Access has two built-in utilities, Database Splitter[41] and Linked Table Manager, to facilitate this architecture.\\r\\nLinked tables in Access use absolute paths rather than relative paths, so the development environment either has to have the same path as the production environment or a \\"dynamic-linker\\" routine can be written in VBA.\\r\\nFor very large Access databases, this may have performance issues and a SQL backend should be considered in these circumstances. This is less of an issue if the entire database can fit in the PC's RAM since Access caches data and indexes.\\r\\nTo scale Access applications to enterprise or web solutions, one possible technique involves migrating to Microsoft SQL Server or equivalent server database. A clientÿserver design significantly reduces maintenance and increases security, availability, stability, and transaction logging.\\r\\nAccess 2010 included a feature called the Upsizing Wizard that allowed users to upgrade their databases to Microsoft SQL Server, an ODBC clientÿserver database. This feature was removed from Access 2013. An additional solution, the SQL Server Migration Assistant for Access (SSMA), continues to be available for free download from Microsoft.[42]\\r\\nA variety of upgrading options are available.[43] After migrating the data and queries to SQL Server, the Access database can be linked to the SQL database. However, certain data types are problematic, most notably \\"Yes/No\\". In Microsoft Access there are three states for the Yes/No (True/False) data type: empty, no/false (zero) and yes/true (-1). The corresponding SQL Server data type is binary, with only two states, permissible values, zero and 1. Regardless, SQL Server is still the easiest migration, and most appropriate especially if the user does not have rights to create objects such as stored procedures on SQL Server. Retrieving data from linked tables is optimized to just the records needed, but this scenario may operate less efficiently than what would otherwise be optimal for SQL Server. For example, in instances where multi-table joins still require copying the whole table across the network.\\r\\nIn previous versions of Access, including Access 2010, databases can also be converted to Access Data Projects (ADP) which are tied directly to one SQL Server database. This feature was removed from Access 2013. ADP's support the ability to directly create and modify SQL Server objects such as tables, views, stored procedures, and SQL Server constraints. The views and stored procedures can significantly reduce the network traffic for multi-table joins. Fortunately, SQL Server supports temporary tables and links to other data sources beyond the single SQL Server database.\\r\\nFinally, some Access databases are completely replaced by another technology such as ASP.NET or Java once the data is converted. However any migration may dictate major effort since the Access SQL language is a more powerful superset of standard SQL. Further, Access application procedures, whether VBA and macros, are written at a relatively higher level versus the currently available alternatives that are both robust and comprehensive. Note that the Access macro language, allowing an even higher level of abstraction than VBA, was significantly enhanced in Access 2010 and again in Access 2013.\\r\\nIn many cases, developers build direct web-to-data interfaces using ASP.NET, while keeping major business automation processes, administrative and reporting functions that don't need to be distributed to everyone in Access for information workers to maintain.\\r\\nWhile all Access data can migrate to SQL Server directly, some queries cannot migrate successfully. In some situations, you may need to translate VBA functions and user defined functions into TÿSQL or .NET functions / procedures. Crosstab queries can be migrated to SQL Server using the PIVOT command.\\r\\nMicrosoft Access applications can be made secure by various methods, the most basic being password access control; this is a relatively weak form of protection.\\r\\nA higher level of protection is the use of workgroup security requiring a user name and password. Users and groups can be specified along with their rights at the object type or individual object level. This can be used to specify people with read-only or data entry rights but may be challenging to specify. A separate workgroup security file contains the settings which can be used to manage multiple databases. Workgroup security is not supported in the Access 2007 and Access 2010 ACCDB database format, although Access 2007 and Access 2010 still support it for MDB databases.\\r\\nDatabases can also be encrypted. The ACCDB format offers significantly advanced encryption from previous versions.[44]\\r\\nAdditionally, if the database design needs to be secured to prevent changes, Access databases can be locked/protected (and the source code compiled) by converting the database to a .MDE file. All changes to the VBA project (modules, forms, or reports) need to be made to the original MDB and then reconverted to MDE. In Access 2007 and Access 2010, the ACCDB database is converted to an ACCDE file. Some tools are available for unlocking and \\"decompiling\\", although certain elements including original VBA comments and formatting are normally irretrievable.\\r\\nMicrosoft Access saves information under the following file formats:\\r\\nThere are no Access versions between 2.0 and 7.0 because the Office 95 version was launched with Word 7. All of the Office 95 products have OLE 2 capabilities, and Access 7 shows that it was compatible with Word 7.\\r\\nVersion number 13 was skipped.\\r\\nThis article is based on material taken from the Free On-line Dictionary of Computing prior to 1 November 2008 and incorporated under the \\"relicensing\\" terms of the GFDL, version 1.3 or later.","input":"What programming language is used in microsoft access?"},{"output":"South America","context":"Gondwana ( /?nd?w?n?/),[1] or Gondwanaland,[2] was a supercontinent that existed from the Neoproterozoic (about 550 million years ago) until the Carboniferous (about 320 million years ago). It was formed by the accretion of several cratons. Eventually, Gondwana became the largest piece of continental crust of the Paleozoic Era, covering an area of about 100,000,000?km2 (39,000,000?sq?mi).[3] During the Carboniferous, it merged with Euramerica to form a larger supercontinent called Pangaea. Gondwana (and Pangaea) gradually broke up during the Mesozoic Era. The remnants of Gondwana make up about two-thirds of today's continental area, including South America, Africa, Antarctica, Australia, and the Indian Subcontinent.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe formation of Gondwana began c.?800?to?650 Ma with the East African Orogeny?ÿ the collision of India and Madagascar with East Africa?ÿ and was completed c. 600?to?530 Ma with the overlapping Brasiliano and Kuunga orogenies?ÿ the collision of South America with Africa and the addition of Australia and Antarctica, respectively.[4]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe continent of Gondwana was named by Austrian scientist Eduard Suess, after the Gondwana region of central northern India which is derived from Sanskrit for \\"forest of the Gonds\\". The name had been previously used in a geological context, first by H.B. Medlicott in 1872,[5] from which the Gondwana sedimentary sequences (Permian-Triassic) are also described.\\r\\nThe term \\"Gondwanaland\\" is preferred by some scientists in order to make a clear distinction between the region and the supercontinent.[6]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe assembly of Gondwana was a protracted process  during the Neoproterozoic and Paleozoic, which however remains incompletely understood because of the lack of paleo-magnetic data.  Several orogenies, collectively known as the Pan-African orogeny, led to the amalgamation of most of the continental fragments of a much older supercontinent, Rodinia.  One of those orogenic belts, the Mozambique Belt, formed 800?to?650 Ma and was originally interpreted as the suture between East (India, Madagascar, Antarctica, and Australia) and West Gondwana (Africa and South America). Three orogenies were recognized during the 1990s: the East African Orogeny (650?to?800 Ma) and Kuunga orogeny (including the Malagasy Orogeny in southern Madagascar) (550 Ma) ÿ the collision between East Gondwana and East Africa in two steps, and the Brasiliano orogeny (660?to?530 Ma) ÿ the collision between South American and African cratons.[8]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe final stages of Gondwanan assembly overlapped with the opening of the Iapetus Ocean between Laurentia and western Gondwana.[9] During this interval, the Cambrian explosion occurred.\\r\\nLaurentia was docked against the western shores of a united Gondwana for a short period near the Precambrian/Cambrian boundary, forming the short-lived and still disputed supercontinent Pannotia.[10]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Mozambique Ocean separated the CongoÿTanzaniaÿBangweulu Block of central Africa from Neoproterozoic India (India, the Antongil Block in far eastern Madagascar, the Seychelles, and the Napier and Rayner Complexes in East Antarctica). The Azania continent[11] (much of central Madagascar, the Horn of Africa and parts of Yemen and Arabia) was an island in the Mozambique Ocean.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Australia/Mawson continent was still separated from India, eastern Africa, and Kalahari by c. 600 Ma, when most of western Gondwana had already been amalgamated. By c. 550?Ma, India had reached its Gondwanan position, which initiated the Kuunga orogeny (also known as the Pinjarra orogeny). Meanwhile, on the other side of the newly forming Africa, Kalahari collided with Congo and Rio de la Plata which closed the Adamastor Ocean.  c. 540ÿ530?Ma, the closure of the Mozambique Ocean brought India next to AustraliaÿEast Antarctica, and both North and South China were located in proximity to Australia.[12]\\r\\n\\r\\nOther blocks which helped to form parts of the Southern Cone of South America, including a piece transferred from Laurentia when the west edge of Gondwana scraped against southeast Laurentia in the Ordovician.[13] This is the Cuyania or Precordillera terrane of the Famatinian orogeny in northwest Argentina which may have continued the line of the Appalachians southwards.[14]\\r\\n\\r\\nAs the rest of Gondwana formed, a complex series of orogenic events assembled the eastern parts of Gondwana (eastern Africa, Arabian-Nubian Shield, Seychelles, Madagascar, India, Sri Lanka, East Antarctica, and Australia) c. 750?to?530 Ma. First the Arabian-Nubian Shield collided with eastern Africa (in the Kenya-Tanzania region) in the East African Orogeny c.750?to?620 Ma. Then Australia and East Antarctica were merged with the remaining Gondwana c. 570?to?530 Ma in the Kuunga Orogeny.[15]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe later Malagasy orogeny at about 550ÿ515?Mya affected Madagascar, eastern East Africa and southern India. In it, Neoproterozoic India collided with the already combined Azania and CongoÿTanzaniaÿBangweulu Block, suturing along the Mozambique Belt.[16]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe 18,000?km (11,000?mi)-long Terra Australis Orogen developed along Gondwana's western, southern, and eastern margins.[17]\\r\\nProto-Gondwanan Cambrian arc belts from this margin have been found in eastern Australia, Tasmania, New Zealand, and Antarctica.  Though these belts formed a continuous arc chain, the direction of subduction was different between the Australian-Tasmanian and New Zealand-Antarctica arc segments.[18]\\r\\n\\r\\nGondwana and Laurasia formed the Pangaea supercontinent during the Carboniferous.  Pangaea began to break up in the Mid-Jurassic when the Central Atlantic opened.[20]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the western end of Pangaea, the collision between Gondwana and Laurasia closed the Rheic and Palaeo-Tethys oceans.  The obliquity of this closure resulted in the docking of some northern terranes in the Marathon, Ouachita, Alleghanian, and Variscan orogenies, respectively.  Southern terranes, such as Chortis and Oaxaca, on the other hand, remained largely unaffected by the collision along the southern shores of Laurentia.  Some Peri-Gondwanan terranes, such as Yucatn and Florida, were buffered from collisions by major promontories.  Other terranes, such as Carolina and Meguma, were directly involved in the collision.  The final collision resulted in the Variscan-Appalachian Mountains, stretching from present-day Mexico to southern Europe. Meanwhile, Baltica collided with Siberia and Kazakhstania which resulted in the Uralian orogeny and Laurasia.  Pangaea was finally amalgamated in the Late Carboniferous-Early Permian, but the oblique forces continued until Pangaea began to rift in the Triassic.[21]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the eastern end collisions occurred slightly later.  The North China, South China, and Indochina blocks rifted from Gondwana during the middle Paleozoic and opened the Proto-Tethys Ocean.  North China docked with Mongolia and Siberia during the CarboniferousÿPermian, followed by South China.  The Cimmerian blocks then rifted from Gondwana to form the Palaeo-Thethys and Neo-Tethys oceans in the Late Carboniferous, and docked with Asia during the Triassic and Jurassic.  Western Pangaea began to rift while the eastern end was still being assembled.[22]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe formation of Pangaea and its mountains had a tremendous impact on global climate and sea levels, which resulted in glaciations and continent-wide sedimentation.  In North America, the base of the Absaroka sequence coincides with the Alleghanian and Ouachita orogenies and are indicative of a large-scale change in the mode of deposition far away from the Pangaean orogenies.  Ultimately, these changes contributed to the PermianÿTriassic extinction event and left large deposits of hydrocarbons, coal, evaporite, and metals.[23]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe break-up of Pangaea began with the Central Atlantic magmatic province (CAMP) between South America, Africa, North America, and Europe.  CAMP covered more than seven million square kilometres over a few million years, reached its peak at c. 200 Ma, and coincided with the TriassicÿJurassic extinction event.[24]\\r\\nThe reformed Gondwanan continent was not precisely the same as that which had existed before Pangaea formed; for example, most of Florida and southern Georgia and Alabama is underlain by rocks that were originally part of Gondwana, but this region stayed attached to North America when the Central Atlantic opened.[25]\\r\\n\\r\\nA large number of terranes were accreted to Eurasia during Gondwana's existence but the Cambrian or Precambrian origin of many of these terranes remains uncertain.  For example, some Palaeozoic terranes and microcontinents that now make up Central Asia, often called the \\"Kazakh\\" and \\"Mongolian terranes\\", were progressively amalgamated into the continent Kazakhstania in the Late Silurian.  Whether these blocks originated on the shores of Gondwana is not known.[26]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the Early Palaeozoic the Armorican terrane, which today form large parts of France, was part of either Peri-Gondwana or core Gondwana; the Rheic Ocean closed in front of it and the Palaeo-Tethys Ocean opened behind it.  Precambrian rocks from the Iberian Peninsula suggest it too probably formed part of core Gondwana before its detachment as an orocline in the Variscan orogeny close to the CarboniferousÿPermian boundary.[27]\\r\\n\\r\\nSouth-east Asia is made of Gondwanan and Cathaysian continental fragments that were assembled during the Mid-Palaeozoic and Cenozoic.  This process can be divided into three phases of rifting along Gondwana's northern margin: firstly, in the Devonian, North and South China, together with Tarim and Quidam (north-western China) rifted, opening the Palaeo-Tethys behind them.  These terranes accreted to Asia during Late Devonian and Permian.  Secondly, in the Late Carboniferous to Early Permian, Cimmerian terranes opened Meso-Tethys Ocean; Sibumasu and Qiantang were added to south-east Asia during Late Permian and Early Jurassic.  Thirdly, in the Late Triassic to Late Jurassic, Lhasa, West Burma, Woyla terranes opened the Neo-Tethys Ocean; Lhasa collided with Asia during the Early Cretaceous, and West Burma and Woyla during the Late Cretaceous.[28]\\r\\n\\r\\nDuring the Neoproterozoic to Palaeozoic phase of the Terra Australis orogen a series of terranes were rafted from the Andean margin when the Iapteus Ocean opened, to be added back to Gondwana during the closure of that ocean.[29]\\r\\n\\r\\nGondwana's long, northern margin had remained a mostly passive margin throughout the Palaeozoic.  The Early Permian opening of the Neo-Tethys Ocean along this margin produced a long series of terranes, many of which were and still are being deformed in the Himalaya Orogeny.  From Turkey to north-eastern India: the Taurides in southern Turkey; the Lesser Caucasus Terrane in Georgia; the Sanand, Alborz, and Lut terranes in Iran; the Mangysglak or Kopetdag Terrane in the Caspian Sea; the Afghan Terrane; the Karakorum Terrane in northern Pakistan; and the Lhasa and Qiangtang terranes in Tibet.  The PermianÿTriassic widening of the Neo-Tethys pushed all these terranes across the Equator and over to Eurasia.[30]\\r\\n\\r\\nAntarctica, the centre of the supercontinent, shared boundaries with all other Gondwana continents and the fragmentation of Gondwana propagated clockwise around it.  The break-up was the result of one of the Earth's most extensive large igneous provinces c. 200?to?170 Ma, but the oldest magnetic anomalies between South America, Africa, and Antarctica are found in what is now the southern Weddell Sea where initial break-up occurred during the Jurassic c. 160?to?180 Ma.[31]\\r\\n\\r\\nGondwana began to break up in the early Jurassic following the extensive and fast emplacement of the Karoo-Ferrar flood basalts c. 184 Ma.  Before the Karoo plume initiated rifting between Africa and Antarctica, it separated a series of smaller continental blocks from Gondwana's southern, Proto-Pacific margin (along what is now the Transantarctic Mountains): the Antarctic Peninsula, Marie Byrd Land, Zealandia, and Thurston Island; the Falkland Islands and EllsworthÿWhitmore Mountains (in Antarctica) were rotated 90 in opposite directions; and South America south of the Gastre Fault (often referred to as Patagonia) was pushed westward.[32] The history of the Africa-Antarctica break-up can be studied in great detail in the fracture zones and magnetic anomalies flanking the Southwest Indian Ridge.[33]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Madagascar block and the Mascarene Plateau, stretching from the Seychelles to Runion, were broken off India; elements of this breakup nearly coincide with the CretaceousÿPaleogene extinction event. The IndiaÿMadagascarÿSeychelles separations appear to coincide with the eruption of the Deccan basalts, whose eruption site may survive as the Runion hotspot.  The Seychelles and the Maldives are now separated by the Central Indian Ridge.\\r\\n\\r\\nDuring the initial break-up in the Early Jurassic a marine transgression swept over the Horn of Africa covering Triassic planation surfaces with sandstone, limestone, shale, marls and evaporites.[34][35]\\r\\n\\r\\nEast Gondwana, comprising Antarctica, Madagascar, India, and Australia, began to separate from Africa. East Gondwana then began to break up c. 132.5?to?96 Ma when India moved northwest from Australia-Antarctica.[36] The Indian Plate and the Australian Plate are now separated by the Capricorn Plate and its diffuse boundaries.[37]\\r\\nDuring the opening of the Indian Ocean, the Kerguelen hotspot first formed the Kerguelen Plateau on the Antarctic Plate c. 118?to?95 Ma and then the Ninety East Ridge on the Indian Plate at c. 100 Ma.[38] The Kerguelen Plateau and the Broken Ridge, the southern end of the Ninety East Ridge, are now separated by the Southeast Indian Ridge.\\r\\n\\r\\nSeparation between Australia and East Antarctica began c. 132 Ma with sea-floor spreading occurring c. 96 Ma.  A shallow seaway developed over the South Tasman Rise during the Early Cenozoic and as oceanic crust started to separate the continents during the Eocene c. 35.5 Ma global ocean temperature dropped significantly.[39]\\r\\nA dramatic shift from arc- to rift magmatism c. 100 Ma separated Zealandia, including New Zealand, the Campbell Plateau, Chatham Rise, Lord Howe Rise, Norfolk Ridge, and New Caledonia, from West Antarctica c. 84 Ma.[40]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe opening of the South Atlantic Ocean divided West Gondwana (South America and Africa), but there is a considerable debate over the exact timing of this break-up.  Rifting propagated from south to north along TriassicÿEarly Jurassic lineaments, but intra-continental rifts also began to develop within both continents in JurassicÿCretaceous sedimentary basins; subdividing each continent into three sub-plates.  Rifting began c. 190 Ma at Falkland latitudes, forcing Patagonia to move relative to the still static remainder of South America and Africa, and this westward movement lasted until the Early Cretaceous 126.7 Ma.  From there rifting propagated northward during the Late Jurassic c. 150 Ma or Early Cretaceous c. 140 Ma most likely forcing dextral movements between sub-plates on either side.  South of the Walvis Ridge and Rio Grande Rise the Paran and Etendeka magmatics resulted in further ocean-floor spreading c. 130?to?135 Ma and the development of rifts systems on both continents, including the Central African Rift System and the Central African Shear Zone which lasted until c. 85 Ma.  At Brazilian latitudes spreading is more difficult to assess because of the lack of palaeo-magnetic data, but rifting occurred in Nigeria at the Benue Trough c. 118 Ma.  North of the Equator the rifting began after 120.4 Ma and continued until c. 100?to?96 Ma.[41]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe first phases of Andean orogeny in the Jurassic and Early Cretaceous were characterized by extensional tectonics, rifting, the development of back-arc basins and the emplacement of large batholiths.[42][43] This development is presumed to have been linked to the subduction of cold oceanic lithosphere.[43] During the mid to Late Cretaceous (ca. 90 million years ago) the Andean orogeny changed significantly in character.[42][43] Warmer and younger oceanic lithosphere is believed to have started to be subducted beneath South America around this time. Such kind of subduction is held responsible not only for the intense contractional deformation that different lithologies were subject to, but also the uplift and erosion known to have occurred from the Late Cretaceous onward.[43] Plate tectonic reorganization since the mid-Cretaceous might also have been linked to the opening of the South Atlantic Ocean.[42] Another change related to mid-Cretaceous plate tectonic changes was the change of subduction direction of the oceanic lithosphere that went from having south-east motion to having a north-east motion at about 90 million years ago.[44] While subduction direction changed it remained oblique (and not perpendicular) to the coast of South America, and the direction change affected several subduction zone-parallel faults including Atacama, Domeyko and Liqui?e-Ofqui.[43][44]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Indian subcontinent began to collide with Asia c. 70 Ma since when more than 1,400?km (870?mi) of crust has been absorbed by the Himalayan-Tibetan orogen.  During the Cenozoic the orogen resulted in the construction of the Tibetan Plateau between the Tethyan Himalayas in the south and the Kunlun and Qilian mountains in the north.[45]\\r\\n\\r\\nLater, South America was connected to North America via the Isthmus of Panama, cutting off a circulation of warm water and thereby making the Arctic colder,[46] as well as allowing the Great American Interchange.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe breakup of Gondwana can be said to continue in eastern Africa at the Afar Triple Junction, which separates the Arabian, Nubian, and Somali plates, resulting in rifting in the Red Sea and East African Rift.[47]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the Early Cenozoic Australia was still connected to Antarctica c. 35ÿ40 south of its current location and both continents were largely unglaciated.  A rift between the two developed but remained an embayment until the Eocene-Oligocene boundary when the Circumpolar Current developed and the glaciation of Antarctica began.[48]\\r\\n\\r\\nAustralia was warm and wet during the Palaeocene and dominated by rainforest.  The opening of the Tasman Gateway at the Eocene-Oligocene boundary (33 Ma) resulted in abrupt cooling but the Oligocene became a period of high rainfall with swamps in southeast Australia.  During the Miocene a warm and humid climate developed with pockets of rainforests in central Australia but before the end of the period colder and drier climate severely reduced this rainforest.  A brief period of increased rainfall in the Pliocene was followed by drier climate which favoured grassland.  Since then the fluctuation between wet interglacial periods and dry glacial periods has developed into the present arid regime.  Australia has thus experienced various climate changes over a 15 million year period with a gradual decrease in precipitation.[49]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Tasman Gateway between Australia and Antarctica began to open c. 40?to?30 Ma.  Palaeontological evidences indicate the Antarctic Circumpolar Current (ACC) was established in the Late Oligocene c. 23 Ma with the full opening of the Drake Passage and the deepening of the Tasman Gateway.  The oldest oceanic crust in the Drake Passage, however, is 34?to?29 Ma-old which indicates spreading between the Antarctic and South American plates began near the Eocene/Oligocene boundary.[50]\\r\\nDeep sea environments in Tierra del Fuego and the North Scotia Ridge during the Eocene and Oligocene indicate a \\"Proto-ACC\\" opened during this period.  Later, 26?to?14 Ma, a series of events severally restricted the Proto-ACC: change to shallow marine conditions along the North Scotia Ridge; closure of the Fuegan Seaway, the deep sea that existed in Tierra del Fuego; and uplift of the Patagonian Cordillera.  This, together with the reactivated Iceland plume, contributed to global warming.  During the Miocene, the Drake Passage began to widen and as water flow between South America and the Antarctic Peninsula increased, the renewed ACC resulted in cooler global climate.[51]\\r\\n\\r\\nSince the Eocene the northward movement of the Australian Plate has resulted in an arc-continent collision with the Philippine and Caroline plates and the uplift of the New Guinea Highlands.[52]  From the Oligocene to the late Miocene, the climate in Australia, dominated by warm and humid rainforests before this collision, began to alternate between open forest and rainforest before the continent became the arid or semiarid landscape it is today.[53]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe adjective \\"Gondwanan\\" is in common use in biogeography when referring to patterns of distribution of living organisms, typically when the organisms are restricted to two or more of the now-discontinuous regions that were once part of Gondwana, including the Antarctic flora.[6] For example, the plant family Proteaceae, known from all continents in the Southern Hemisphere, has a \\"Gondwanan distribution\\" and is often described as an archaic, or relict, lineage.  The distributions in Proteaceae is, nevertheless, the result of both Gondwanan rafting and later oceanic dispersal.[54]\\r\\n\\r\\nDuring the Silurian Gondwana extended from the Equator (Australia) to the South Pole (North Africa and South America) whilst Laurasia was located on the Equator opposite to Australia.  A short-lived Late Ordovician glaciation was followed by a Silurian Hot House period.[55]\\r\\nThe End-Ordovician extinction, which resulted in 27% of marine invertebrate families and 57% of genera going extinct, occurred during this shift from Ice House to Hot House.[56]\\r\\n\\r\\nBy the end of the Ordovician Cooksonia, a slender, ground-covering plant, became the first vascular plant to establish itself on land.  This first colonisation occurred exclusively around the Equator on landmasses then limited to Laurasia and, in Gondwana, to Australia.  In the Late Silurian two distinctive linages, zosterophylls and rhyniophytes, had colonised the tropics.  The former evolved into the lycopods, that were to dominate the Gondwanan vegetation over a long period, whilst the latter evolved into horsetails and gymnosperms.  Most of Gondwana was located far from the Equator during this period and remained a lifeless and barren landscape.[57]\\r\\n\\r\\nWest Gondwana drifted north during the Devonian which brought Gondwana and Laurasia close together.  Global cooling contributed to the Late Devonian extinction (19% of marine families and 50% of genera went extinct) and glaciation occurred in South America.  Before Pangaea had formed terrestrial plants, such as pteridophytes, began to diversify rapidly resulting in the colonisation of Gondwana.  The Baragwanathia Flora, found only in the Yea Beds of Victoria, Australia, occurs in two strata separated by 1,700?m (5,600?ft) or 30?Ma; the upper assemblage is more diverse and includes Baragwanathia, the first primitive herbaceous lycopod to evolve from the zosterophylls.  During the Devonian giant club mosses replaced the Baragwanathia Flora, introducing the first trees, and by the Late Devonian this first forest was accompanied by the progymnosperms, including the first large trees Archaeopteris.[58]\\r\\nThe Late Devonian extinction probably also resulted in osteolepiform fishes evolving into the amphibian tetrapods, the earliest land vertebrates, in Greenland and Russia.  The only traces of this evolution in Gondwana are amphibian footprints and a single jaw from Australia.[59]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe closure of the Rheic Ocean and the formation of Pangaea in the Carboniferous resulted in the rerouting of ocean currents which initiated an Ice House period.  As Gondwana began to rotate clockwise, Australia shifted south to more temperate latitudes.  An ice cap initially covered most of southern Africa and South America but began to spread to eventually cover most of the supercontinent, save for northern-most Africa-South America and eastern Australia.  Giant lycopod and horsetail forests continued to evolve in tropical Laurasia together with a diversified assemblage of true insects.  In Gondwana, in contrast, ice and, in Australia, volcanism decimated the Devonian flora to a low-diversity seed fern flora?ÿ the pteridophytes were increasingly replaced by the gymnosperms which were to dominate until the Mid-Cretaceous.  Australia, however, was still located near the Equator during the Early Carboniferous and during this period temnospondyl and lepospondyl amphibians and the first amniote reptilians evolved, all closely related to the Laurasian fauna, but spreading ice eventually drove these animals away from Gondwana entirely.[60]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Gondwana ice sheet melted and sea levels dropped during the Permian and Triassic global warming.  During this period, the extinct glossopterids colonised Gondwana and reached peak diversity in the Late Permian when coal-forming forests covered much of Gondwana.  The period also saw the evolution of Voltziales; one of the few plant orders to survive the end-Permian extinction (57% of marine families and 83% of genera went extinct) which came to dominate in the Late Permian and from whom true conifers evolved.  Tall lycopods and horsetails dominated the wetlands of Gondwana in the Early Permian.\\r\\nInsects co-evolved with glossopterids across Gondwana and diversified with more than 200 species in 21 orders by the Late Permian, many known from South Africa and Australia.  Beetles and cockroaches remained minor elements in this fauna.  Tetrapod fossils from the Early Permian have only been found in Laurasia but they became common in Gondwana later during the Permian.  The arrival of the therapsids resulted in the first plant-vertebrate-insect ecosystem.[61]\\r\\n\\r\\nDuring the Mid- to Late Triassic hot house conditions coincided with a peak in biodiversity? the end-Permian extinction was enormous and so was the radiation that followed.  Two families of conifers, Podocarpaceae and Araucariaceae, dominated Gondwana in the Early Triassic, but Dicroidium, an extinct genus of fork-leaved seed ferns, dominated woodlands and forests of Gondwana during most of the Triassic.  Conifers evolved and radiated during the period with six of eight extant families already present before the end of it.  Bennettitales and Pentoxylales, two now extinct orders of gymnospermous plants, evolved in the Late Triassic and became important in the Jurassic and Cretaceous.  It is possible that gymnosperm biodiversity surpassed later angiosperm biodiversity and that the evolution of angiosperms began during the Triassic but, if so, in Laurasia rather than in Gondwana.  Two Gondwanan classes, lycophytes and sphenophytes, saw a gradual decline during the Triassic while ferns, though never dominant, managed to diversify.[62]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe brief ice house of the TriassicÿJurassic extinction event had a dramatic impact on dinosaurs but left plants largely unaffected.  The Jurassic was mostly a hot house and while vertebrates managed to diversify in this environment, plants have left little evidence of such development, with the exception of Cheiroleidiacean conifers and Caytoniales and other groups of seed ferns.  In terms of biomass the Jurassic flora was dominated by conifers families and other gymnosperms that had evolved during the Triassic.  The Pteridophytes, that had dominated during the Palaeozoic, were now marginalised, except for ferns.  In contrast to Laurentia, very few insect fossils have been found in Gondwana to a large extent because of widespread deserts and volcanism.  While plants had a cosmopolitan distribution, dinosaur evolved and diversified in a pattern that reflects  the Jurassic break-up of Panagaea.[63]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Cretaceous saw the arrival of the angiosperms, or flowering plants, a group that probably evolved in western Gondwana (South America-Africa).  From there the angiosperms diversified in two stages: the monocots and magnoliids evolved in the Early Cretaceous followed by the hammamelid dicots.  By the Mid-Cretaceous angiosperms constituted half of the flora in northeastern Australia.  There is, however, no obvious connection between this spectacular angiosperm radiation and an extinction event nor vertebrate/insect evolution.  Insect orders associated with pollination, such as beetles, flies, butterflies and moths, and wasps, bees, and ants, radiated continuously from the Permian-Triassic long before the arrival of the angiosperms. Well-preserved insect fossils have been found in the lake deposits of the Santana Formation in Brazil, the Koonwarra Lake fauna in Australia, and the Orapa diamond mine in Botswana.[64]\\r\\nDinosaurs continued to prosper but, as the angiosperm diversified, conifers, bennettitaleans and pentoxylaleans disappeared from Gondwana c. 115?Ma together with the specialised herbivorous ornithischians whilst generalist browsers such as several families of sauropodomorph Saurischia prevailed.  The CretaceousÿPaleogene extinction event killed off all dinosaurs except birds, but plant evolution in Gondwana was hardly affected by the event.[64]\\r\\nGondwanatheria is an extinct group of non-therian mammals with a Gondwanan distribution (South America, Africa, Madagascar, India, and Antarctica) during the Late Cretaceous and Palaeogene.[65] Xenarthra and Afrotheria, two placental clades, are of Gondwanan origin and probably began to evolve separately c. 105 Ma when Africa and South America separated.[66]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe laurel forest of Australia, New Caledonia, and New Zealand have a number of other related species of the laurissilva de Valdivia, through the connection of the Antarctic flora as gymnosperms and deciduous angiosperm Nothofagus. Corynocarpus laevigatus is called the bay of New Zealand, Laurelia novae-zelandiae belongs to the same genus Laurelia. The sempervirens tree niaouli grows in Australia, New Caledonia, and New Zealand.  New Caledonia and New Zealand ecoregions became separated from Australia by continental drift 85 million years ago. The islands still retain plants that originated in Gondwana and spread to the Southern Hemisphere continents later. However, strong evidence exists of glaciation during the Carboniferous to Permian time, especially in South Africa.[citation needed]\\r\\n\\r\\nAfrica\\r\\n\\r\\nAntarctica\\r\\n\\r\\nAsia\\r\\n\\r\\nAustralia\\r\\n\\r\\nEurope\\r\\n\\r\\nNorth America\\r\\n\\r\\nSouth America\\r\\n\\r\\nAfro-Eurasia\\r\\n\\r\\nAmerica\\r\\n\\r\\nEurasia\\r\\n\\r\\nOceania","input":"Name the areas that were once part of gondwanaland?"},{"output":"Motorola","context":"The history of mobile phones covers mobile communication devices that connect wirelessly to the public switched telephone network.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhile the transmission of speech by radio has a long history, the first devices that were wireless, mobile, and also capable of connecting to the standard telephone network are much more recent. The first such devices were barely portable compared to today's compact hand-held devices, and their use was clumsy.\\r\\n\\r\\nAlong with the process of developing a more portable technology, and a better interconnections system, drastic changes have taken place in both the networking of wireless communication and the prevalence of its use, with smartphones becoming common globally and a growing proportion of Internet access now done via mobile broadband.\\r\\n\\r\\nBefore the devices existed that are now referred to as mobile phones or cell phones, there were some precursors. In 1908, a Professor Albert Jahnke and the Oakland Transcontinental Aerial Telephone and Power Company claimed to have developed a wireless telephone. They were accused of fraud and the charge was then dropped, but they do not seem to have proceeded with production.[2] Beginning in 1918, the German railroad system tested wireless telephony on military trains between Berlin and Zossen.[3] In 1924, public trials started with telephone connection on trains between Berlin and Hamburg. In 1925, the company Zugtelephonie AG was founded to supply train telephony equipment and, in 1926, telephone service in trains of the Deutsche Reichsbahn and the German mail service on the route between Hamburg and Berlin was approved and offered to first-class travelers.[4]\\r\\n\\r\\nFiction anticipated the development of real world mobile telephones. In 1906, the English caricaturist Lewis Baumer published a cartoon in Punch magazine entitled \\"Forecasts for 1907\\" in which he showed a man and a woman in London's Hyde Park each separately engaged in gambling and dating on wireless telephony equipment.[5] Then, in 1926, the artist Karl Arnold created a visionary cartoon about the use of mobile phones in the street, in the picture \\"wireless telephony\\", published in the German satirical magazine Simplicissimus.[6]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Second World War made military use of radio telephony links. Hand-held radio transceivers have been available since the 1940s. Mobile telephones for automobiles became available from some telephone companies in the 1940s. Early devices were bulky, consumed high power, and the network supported only a few simultaneous conversations. Modern cellular networks allow automatic and pervasive use of mobile phones for voice and data communications.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the United States, engineers from Bell Labs began work on a system to allow mobile users to place and receive telephone calls from automobiles, leading to the inauguration of mobile service on 17 June 1946 in St. Louis, Missouri. Shortly after, AT&T offered Mobile Telephone Service. A wide range of mostly incompatible mobile telephone services offered limited coverage area and only a few available channels in urban areas. The introduction of cellular technology, which allowed re-use of frequencies many times in small adjacent areas covered by relatively low powered transmitters, made widespread adoption of mobile telephones economically feasible.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the USSR, Leonid Kupriyanovich, an engineer from Moscow, in 1957-1961 developed and presented a number of experimental pocket-sized communications radio. The weight of one model, presented in 1961, was only 70 g and could fit on a palm.[7][8] However, in the USSR the decision at first to develop the system of the automobile \\"Altai\\" phone was made.[9]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1965, the Bulgarian company \\"Radioelektronika\\" presented a mobile automatic phone combined with a base station at the Inforga-65 international exhibition in Moscow. Solutions of this phone were based on a system developed by Leonid Kupriyanovich. One base station, connected to one telephone wire line, could serve up to 15 customers.[10]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe advances in mobile telephony can be traced in successive generations from the early \\"0G\\" services like MTS and its successor Improved Mobile Telephone Service, to first-generation (1G) analog cellular network, second-generation (2G) digital cellular networks, third-generation (3G) broadband data services to the state-of-the-art, fourth-generation (4G) native-IP networks.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1949, AT&T commercialized Mobile Telephone Service. From its start in St. Louis, Missouri, in 1946, AT&T introduced Mobile Telephone Service to one hundred towns and highway corridors by 1948. Mobile Telephone Service was a rarity with only 5,000 customers placing about 30,000 calls each week. Calls were set up manually by an operator and the user had to depress a button on the handset to talk and release the button to listen. The call subscriber equipment weighed about 80 pounds (36?kg)[11]\\r\\n\\r\\nSubscriber growth and revenue generation were hampered by the constraints of the technology. Because only three radio channels were available, only three customers in any given city could make mobile telephone calls at one time.[12] Mobile Telephone Service was expensive, costing 15 USD per month, plus 0.30 to 0.40 USD per local call, equivalent to about 176 USD per month and 3.50 to 4.75 per call in 2012 USD.[11]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the UK, there was also a vehicle-based system called \\"Post Office Radiophone Service,\\"[13] which was launched around the city of Manchester in 1959, and although it required callers to speak to an operator, it was possible to be put through to any subscriber in Great Britain. The service was extended to London in 1965 and other major cities in 1972.\\r\\n\\r\\nAT&T introduced the first major improvement to mobile telephony in 1965, giving the improved service the obvious name of Improved Mobile Telephone Service. IMTS used additional radio channels, allowing more simultaneous calls in a given geographic area, introduced customer dialing, eliminating manual call setup by an operator, and reduced the size and weight of the subscriber equipment.[11]\\r\\n\\r\\nDespite the capacity improvement offered by IMTS, demand outstripped capacity. In agreement with state regulatory agencies, AT&T limited the service to just 40,000 customers system wide. In New York City, for example, 2,000 customers shared just 12 radio channels and typically had to wait 30 minutes to place a call.[11]\\r\\n\\r\\nRadio Common Carrier[14] or RCC was a service introduced in the 1960s by independent telephone companies to compete against AT&T's IMTS. RCC systems used paired UHF 454/459?MHz and VHF 152/158?MHz frequencies near those used by IMTS. RCC based services were provided until the 1980s when cellular AMPS systems made RCC equipment obsolete.\\r\\n\\r\\nSome RCC systems were designed to allow customers of adjacent carriers to use their facilities,  but equipment used by RCCs did not allow the equivalent of modern \\"roaming\\" because technical standards were not uniform.  For example, the phone of an Omaha, Nebraskaÿbased RCC service would not be likely to work in Phoenix, Arizona. Roaming was not encouraged, in part, because there was no centralized industry billing database for RCCs. Signaling formats were not standardized. For example, some systems used two-tone sequential paging to alert a mobile of an incoming call. Other systems used DTMF. Some used Secode 2805, which transmitted an interrupted 2805?Hz tone (similar to IMTS signaling) to alert mobiles of an offered call. Some radio equipment used with RCC systems was half-duplex, push-to-talk LOMO equipment such as Motorola hand-helds or RCA 700-series conventional two-way radios. Other vehicular equipment had telephone handsets and rotary dials or pushbutton pads, and operated full duplex like a conventional wired telephone. A few users had full-duplex briefcase telephones (radically advanced for their day)\\r\\n\\r\\nAt the end of RCC's existence, industry associations were working on a technical standard that would have allowed roaming, and some mobile users had multiple decoders to enable operation with more than one of the common signaling formats (600/1500, 2805, and Reach). Manual operation was often a fallback for RCC roamers.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1969 Penn Central Railroad equipped commuter trains along the 360 kilometres (220?mi) New York-Washington route with special pay phones that allowed passengers to place telephone calls while the train was moving.  The system re-used six frequencies in the 450?MHz band in nine sites.[12]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the UK, Channel Islands and elsewhere the \\"Rabbit\\" phone system was briefly used, being a hybrid of \\"cell\\" base stations and handsets. One major limitation was that you had to be less than 300 feet (closer with buildings) from a base due to power limitations on a portable device. \\r\\n[15][better?source?needed]\\r\\nWith modern technology a similar variant is being considered for Apple's new 4G \\"smart watch\\" so they can be used in large events in a broadly similar way to a femtocell.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn Europe, several mutually incompatible mobile radio services were developed.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1966 Norway had a system called OLT which was manually controlled. Finland's ARP, launched in 1971, was also manual as was the Swedish MTD. All were replaced by the automatic NMT, (Nordic Mobile Telephone) system in the early 1980s.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn July 1971 Readycall was introduced in London by Burndept after obtaining a special concession to break the Post Office monopoly to allow selective calling to mobiles of calls from the public telephone system. This system was available to the public for a subscription of S16 month. A year later the service was extended to two other UK towns.[16]\\r\\n\\r\\nWest Germany had a network called A-Netz launched in 1952 as the country's first public commercial mobile phone network. In 1972 this was displaced by B-Netz which connected calls automatically.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn December 1947, Douglas H. Ring and W. Rae Young, Bell Labs engineers, proposed hexagonal cells for mobile phones in vehicles.[17]   At this stage, the technology to implement these ideas did not exist, nor had the frequencies been allocated.  Two decades would pass before Richard H. Frenkiel, Joel S. Engel and Philip T. Porter of Bell Labs expanded the early proposals into a much more detailed system plan. It was Porter who first proposed that the cell towers use the now-familiar directional antennas to reduce interference and increase channel reuse (see picture at right)[18] Porter also invented the dial-then-send method used by all cell phones to reduce wasted channel time.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn all these early examples, a mobile phone had to stay within the coverage area serviced by one base station throughout the phone call, i.e. there was no continuity of service as the phones moved through several cell areas.  The concepts of frequency reuse and handoff, as well as a number of other concepts that formed the basis of modern cell phone technology, were described in the late 1960s, in papers by Frenkiel and Porter. In 1970 Amos E. Joel, Jr., a Bell Labs engineer,[19] invented a \\"three-sided trunk circuit\\" to aid in the \\"call handoff\\" process from one cell to another.  His patent contained an early description of the Bell Labs cellular concept, but as switching systems became faster, such a circuit became unnecessary and was never implemented in a system.\\r\\n\\r\\nA cellular telephone switching plan was described by Fluhr and Nussbaum in 1973,[20] and a cellular telephone data signaling system was described in hipatitas by Hachenburg et al.[21]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe first fully automated mobile phone system for vehicles was launched in Sweden in 1956. Named MTA (Mobiltelefonisystem A), it allowed calls to be made and received in the car using a rotary dial. The car phone could also be paged. Calls from the car were direct dial, whereas incoming calls required an operator to locate the nearest base station to the car. It was developed by Sture Laurn and other engineers at Televerket network operator. Ericsson provided the switchboard while Svenska Radioaktiebolaget (SRA) and Marconi provided the telephones and base station equipment. MTA phones consisted of vacuum tubes and relays, and weighed 40 kilograms (88?lb). In 1962, an upgraded version called Mobile System B (MTB) was introduced. This was a push-button telephone, and used transistors and DTMF signaling to improve its operational reliability. In 1971 the MTD version was launched, opening for several different brands of equipment and gaining commercial success.[22][23] The network remained open until 1983 and still had 600 customers when it closed.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1958 development began on a similar system for motorists in the USSR.[24] The \\"Altay\\" national civil mobile phone service was based on Soviet MRT-1327 standard. The main developers of the Altay system were the Voronezh Science Research Institute of Communications (VNIIS) and the State Specialized Project Institute (GSPI). In 1963 the service started in Moscow, and by 1970 was deployed in 30 cities across the USSR. Versions of the Altay system are still in use today as a trunking system in some parts of Russia.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1959 a private telephone company in Brewster, Kansas, USA, the S&T Telephone Company, (still in business today) with the use of Motorola Radio Telephone equipment and a private tower facility, offered to the public mobile telephone services in that local area of NW Kansas. This system was a direct dial up service through their local switchboard, and was installed in many private vehicles including grain combines, trucks, and automobiles. For some as yet unknown reason, the system, after being placed online and operated for a very brief time period, was shut down. The management of the company was immediately changed, and the fully operable system and related equipment was immediately dismantled in early 1960, not to be seen again.[citation needed]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1966, Bulgaria presented the pocket mobile automatic phone RAT-0,5 combined with a base station RATZ-10 (RATC-10) on Interorgtechnika-66 international exhibition. One base station, connected to one telephone wire line, could serve up to six customers (\\"Radio\\" magazine, 2, 1967; \\"Novosti dnya\\" newsreel, 37, 1966).\\r\\n\\r\\nOne of the first successful public commercial mobile phone networks was the ARP network in Finland, launched in 1971. Posthumously, ARP is sometimes viewed as a zero generation (0G) cellular network, being slightly above previous proprietary and limited coverage networks.[citation needed]\\r\\n\\r\\nPrior to 1973, mobile telephony was limited to phones installed in cars and other vehicles.[19] Motorola was the first company to produce a handheld mobile phone.  On April 3, 1973, Martin Cooper, a Motorola researcher and executive, made the first mobile telephone call from handheld subscriber equipment, placing a call to Dr. Joel S. Engel of Bell Labs, his rival.[25][26][27]  The prototype handheld phone used by Dr. Cooper weighed 1.1 kilograms (2.4?lb) and measured 23 by 13 by 4.5 centimetres (9.1 by 5.1 by 1.8?in). The prototype offered a talk time of just 30 minutes and took 10 hours to re-charge.[28]\\r\\n\\r\\nJohn F. Mitchell,[29][30][31] Motorola's chief of portable communication products and Cooper's boss in 1973, played a key role in advancing the development of handheld mobile telephone equipment. Mitchell failed to push Motorola into developing wireless communication products that would be small enough to use anywhere and participated in the design of the cellular phone.[32][33]\\r\\n\\r\\nNewer technology has been developed and rolled out in a series of waves or generations. The \\"generation\\" terminology only became widely used when 3G was launched, but is now used retroactively when referring to the earlier systems.\\r\\n\\r\\nFirst automatic analogue cellular systems deployed were NTT's system first used in Tokyo in 1979, later spreading to the whole of Japan, and NMT in the Nordic countries in 1981.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe first analogue cellular system widely deployed in North America was the Advanced Mobile Phone System (AMPS).[34] It was commercially introduced in the Americas in 13 October 1983, Israel in 1986, and Australia in 1987. AMPS was a pioneering technology that helped drive mass market usage of cellular technology, but it had several serious issues by modern standards. It was unencrypted and easily vulnerable to eavesdropping via a scanner; it was susceptible to cell phone \\"cloning\\" and it used a Frequency-division multiple access (FDMA) scheme and required significant amounts of wireless spectrum to support.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn 6 March 1983, the DynaTAC 8000X mobile phone launched on the first US 1G network by Ameritech.  It cost $100m to develop, and took over a decade to reach the market.[35] The phone had a talk time of just thirty-five minutes and took ten hours to charge. Consumer demand was strong despite the battery life, weight, and low talk time, and waiting lists were in the thousands.[36][37]\\r\\n\\r\\nMany of the iconic early commercial cell phones such as the Motorola DynaTAC Analog AMPS were eventually superseded by Digital AMPS (D-AMPS) in 1990, and AMPS service was shut down by most North American carriers by 2008.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn February 1986 Australia launched its Cellular Telephone System by Telecom Australia. Peter Reedman was the first Telecom Customer to be connected on 6 January 1986 along with five other subscribers as test customers prior to the official launch date of 28 February.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the 1990s, the 'second generation' mobile phone systems emerged. Two systems competed for supremacy in the global market: the European developed GSM standard and the U.S. developed CDMA standard. These differed from the previous generation by using digital instead of analog transmission, and also fast out-of-band phone-to-network signaling. The rise in mobile phone usage as a result of 2G was explosive and this era also saw the advent of prepaid mobile phones.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1991 the first GSM network (Radiolinja) launched in Finland. In general the frequencies used by 2G systems in Europe were higher than those in America, though with some overlap. For example, the 900?MHz frequency range was used for both 1G and 2G systems in Europe, so the 1G systems were rapidly closed down to make space for the 2G systems. In America the IS-54 standard was deployed in the same band as AMPS and displaced some of the existing analog channels.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1993, IBM Simon was introduced. This was possibly the world's first smartphone. It was a mobile phone, pager, fax machine, and PDA all rolled into one. It included a calendar, address book, clock, calculator, notepad, email, and a touchscreen with a QWERTY keyboard.[38]  The IBM Simon had a stylus you used to tap the touch screen with. It featured predictive typing that would guess the next characters as you tapped. It had applications, or at least a way to deliver more features by plugging a PCMCIA 1.8 MB memory card into the phone.[39]\\r\\nCoinciding with the introduction of 2G systems was a trend away from the larger \\"brick\\" phones toward tiny 100ÿ200 grams (3.5ÿ7.1?oz) hand-held devices. This change was possible not only through technological improvements such as more advanced batteries and more energy-efficient electronics, but also because of the higher density of cell sites to accommodate increasing usage. The latter meant that the average distance transmission from phone to the base station shortened, leading to increased battery life while on the move.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe second generation introduced a new variant of communication called SMS or text messaging. It was initially available only on GSM networks but spread eventually on all digital networks. The first machine-generated SMS message was sent in the UK on 3 December 1992 followed in 1993 by the first person-to-person SMS sent in Finland. The advent of prepaid services in the late 1990s soon made SMS the communication method of choice among the young, a trend which spread across all ages.\\r\\n\\r\\n2G also introduced the ability to access media content on mobile phones. In 1998 the first downloadable content sold to mobile phones was the ring tone, launched by Finland's Radiolinja (now Elisa). Advertising on the mobile phone first appeared in Finland when a free daily SMS news headline service was launched in 2000, sponsored by advertising.\\r\\n\\r\\nMobile payments were trialed in 1998 in Finland and Sweden where a mobile phone was used to pay for a Coca-Cola vending machine and car parking. Commercial launches followed in 1999 in Norway. The first commercial payment system to mimic banks and credit cards was launched in the Philippines in 1999 simultaneously by mobile operators Globe and Smart.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe first full internet service on mobile phones was introduced by NTT DoCoMo in Japan in 1999.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs the use of 2G phones became more widespread and people began to use mobile phones in their daily lives, it became clear that demand for data (such as access to browse the internet) was growing. Further, experience from fixed broadband services showed there would also be an ever-increasing demand for greater data speeds. The 2G technology was nowhere near up to the job, so the industry began to work on the next generation of technology known as 3G. The main technological difference that distinguishes 3G technology from 2G technology is the use of packet switching rather than circuit switching for data transmission.[40] In addition, the standardization process focused on requirements more than technology (2 Mbit/s maximum data rate indoors, 384 kbit/s outdoors, for example).\\r\\n\\r\\nInevitably this led to many competing standards with different contenders pushing their own technologies, and the vision of a single unified worldwide standard looked far from reality. The standard 2G CDMA networks became 3G compliant with the adoption of Revision A to EV-DO, which made several additions to the protocol while retaining backwards compatibility:\\r\\n\\r\\nAll these were put in place to allow for low latency, low bit rate communications such as VoIP.[41]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe first pre-commercial trial network with 3G was launched by NTT DoCoMo in Japan in the Tokyo region in May 2001. NTT DoCoMo launched the first commercial 3G network on 1 October 2001, using the WCDMA technology. In 2002 the first 3G networks on the rival CDMA2000 1xEV-DO technology were launched by SK Telecom and KTF in South Korea, and Monet in the US. Monet has since gone bankrupt. By the end of 2002, the second WCDMA network was launched in Japan by Vodafone KK (now Softbank). European launches of 3G were in Italy and the UK by Three/Hutchison group, on WCDMA. 2003 saw a further eight commercial launches of 3G, six more on WCDMA and two more on the EV-DO standard.\\r\\n\\r\\nDuring the development of 3G systems, 2.5G systems such as CDMA2000 1x and GPRS were developed as extensions to existing 2G networks. These provide some of the features of 3G without fulfilling the promised high data rates or full range of multimedia services. CDMA2000-1X delivers theoretical maximum data speeds of up to 307 kbit/s. Just beyond these is the EDGE system which in theory covers the requirements for 3G system, but is so narrowly above these that any practical system would be sure to fall short.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe high connection speeds of 3G technology enabled a transformation in the industry: for the first time, media streaming of radio (and even television) content to 3G handsets became possible,[42]  with companies such as RealNetworks[43] and Disney[44] among the early pioneers in this type of offering.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the mid-2000s (decade), an evolution of 3G technology began to be implemented, namely High-Speed Downlink Packet Access (HSDPA). It is an enhanced 3G (third generation) mobile telephony communications protocol in the High-Speed Packet Access (HSPA) family, also coined 3.5G, 3G+ or turbo 3G, which allows networks based on Universal Mobile Telecommunications System (UMTS) to have higher data transfer speeds and capacity. Current HSDPA deployments support down-link speeds of 1.8, 3.6, 7.2 and 14.0 Mbit/s.\\r\\n\\r\\nBy the end of 2007, there were 295 million subscribers on 3G networks worldwide, which reflected 9% of the total worldwide subscriber base. About two thirds of these were on the WCDMA standard and one third on the EV-DO standard. The 3G telecoms services generated over $120 billion of revenues during 2007 and at many markets the majority of new phones activated were 3G phones. In Japan and South Korea the market no longer supplies phones of the second generation.\\r\\n\\r\\nAlthough mobile phones had long had the ability to access data networks such as the Internet, it was not until the widespread availability of good quality 3G coverage in the mid-2000s (decade) that specialized devices appeared to access the mobile web. The first such devices, known as \\"dongles\\", plugged directly into a computer through the USB port. Another new class of device appeared subsequently, the so-called \\"compact wireless router\\" such as the Novatel MiFi, which makes 3G Internet connectivity available to multiple computers simultaneously over Wi-Fi, rather than just to a single computer via a USB plug-in.\\r\\n\\r\\nSuch devices became especially popular for use with laptop computers due to the added portability they bestow. Consequently, some computer manufacturers started to embed the mobile data function directly into the laptop so a dongle or MiFi wasn't needed. Instead, the SIM card could be inserted directly into the device itself to access the mobile data services. Such 3G-capable laptops became commonly known as \\"netbooks\\". Other types of data-aware devices followed in the netbook's footsteps. By the beginning of 2010, E-readers, such as the Amazon Kindle and the Nook from Barnes & Noble, had already become available with embedded wireless Internet, and Apple had announced plans for embedded wireless Internet on its iPad tablet devices later that year.\\r\\n\\r\\nBy 2009, it had become clear that, at some point, 3G networks would be overwhelmed by the growth of bandwidth-intensive applications like streaming media.[45] Consequently, the industry began looking to data-optimized 4th-generation technologies, with the promise of speed improvements up to 10-fold over existing 3G technologies. The first two commercially available technologies billed as 4G were the WiMAX standard (offered in the U.S. by Sprint) and the LTE standard, first offered in Scandinavia by TeliaSonera.\\r\\n\\r\\nOne of the main ways in which 4G differed technologically from 3G was in its elimination of circuit switching, instead employing an all-IP network. Thus, 4G ushered in a treatment of voice calls just like any other type of streaming audio media, utilizing packet switching over Internet, LAN or WAN networks via VoIP.[46]\\r\\n\\r\\nBefore a universal charger standard was agreed upon in the late 2000s users needed an adaptor which was often the same brand as their phone to recharge the battery.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs of  14?June?2007[update], all new mobile phones applying for a license in China are required to use a USB port as a power port for battery charging.[48][49] This was the first standard to use the convention of shorting D+ and D?.[50]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn September 2007, the Open Mobile Terminal Platform group (a forum of mobile network operators and manufacturers such as Nokia, Samsung, Motorola, Sony Ericsson, and LG) announced that its members had agreed on Micro-USB as the future common connector for mobile devices.[51][52]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe GSM Association (GSMA) followed suit on 17 February 2009,[53][53][54][55][56] and on 22 April 2009, this was further endorsed by the CTIA ÿ The Wireless Association,[57] with the International Telecommunication Union (ITU) announcing on 22 October 2009 that it had also embraced the Universal Charging Solution as its \\"energy-efficient one-charger-fits-all new mobile phone solution,\\" and added: \\"Based on the Micro-USB interface, UCS chargers will also include a 4-star or higher efficiency ratingup to three times more energy-efficient than an unrated charger.\\"[58]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn June 2009, many of the world's largest mobile phone manufacturers signed an EC-sponsored Memorandum of Understanding (MoU), agreeing to make most data-enabled mobile phones marketed in the European Union compatible with a common External Power Supply (common EPS). The EU's common EPS specification (EN 62684:2010) references the USB Battery Charging Specification and is similar to the GSMA/OMTP and Chinese charging solutions.[59][60] In January 2011, the International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) released its version of the (EU's) common EPS standard as IEC 62684:2011.[61]\\r\\n\\r\\nAs well as the now-common cellular phone, there is also the very different approach of connecting directly from the handset to an Earth-orbiting satellite. Such mobile phones can be used in remote areas out of reach of wired networks or where construction of a cellular network is uneconomic.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Inmarsat system is the oldest, originally developed in 1979 for safety of life at sea, and uses a series of satellites in geostationary orbits to cover the majority of the globe. Several smaller operators use the same approach with just one or two satellites to provide a regional service. An alternative approach is to use a series of low Earth orbit satellites much closer to Earth. This is the basis of the Iridium and Globalstar satellite phone services.","input":"Who invented mobile phone for the first time?"},{"output":"March 1930","context":"Biltmore Estate is a large (6950.4 acre or 10.86 square miles) private estate and tourist attraction near Asheville, North Carolina. Biltmore House, the main residence, is a Chateauesque-style mansion built by George Washington Vanderbilt II between 1889 and 1895 and is the largest privately owned house in the United States, at 178,926 square feet (16,622.8?m2)[2] of floor space (135,280 square feet (12,568?m2) of living area). Still owned by George Vanderbilt's descendants, it stands today as one of the most prominent remaining examples of the Gilded Age.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the 1880s, at the height of the Gilded Age, George Washington Vanderbilt II, youngest son of William Henry Vanderbilt, began to make regular visits with his mother, Maria Louisa Kissam Vanderbilt (1821ÿ1896), to the Asheville, North Carolina, area. He loved the scenery and climate so much that he decided to create his own summer estate in the area, which he called his \\"little mountain escape\\", just as his older brothers and sisters had built opulent summer houses in places such as Newport, Rhode Island, and Hyde Park, New York. Vanderbilt named his estate Biltmore derived from \\"Bildt,\\" Vanderbilt's ancestors' place of origin in Holland, and \\"More\\", Anglo-Saxon for open, rolling land.[3] A portion of the estate was once the African-American community of Shiloh.[4] Vanderbilt bought almost 700 parcels of land, including over 50 farms and at least five cemeteries. A spokesperson for the estate said in 2017 that archives show much of the land \\"was in very poor condition, and many of the farmers and other landowners were glad to sell.\\"[5]\\r\\nConstruction of the house began in 1889 and continued well into 1896. In order to facilitate such a large project, a woodworking factory and brick kiln, which produced 32,000 bricks a day, were built onsite, and a three-mile railroad spur was constructed to bring materials to the building site. Construction on the main house required the labor of well over 1,000 workers and 60 stonemasons.[6] Vanderbilt went on extensive buying trips overseas as construction on the house was in progress. He returned to North Carolina with thousands of furnishings for his newly built home including tapestries, hundreds of carpets, prints, linens, and decorative objects, all dating between the 15th century and the late 19th century. Among the few American-made items were the more practical oak drop-front desk, rocking chairs, a walnut grand piano, bronze candlesticks and a wicker wastebasket.[7]\\r\\nGeorge Vanderbilt opened his opulent estate on Christmas Eve 1895 to invited family and friends from across the country, who were encouraged to enjoy leisure and country pursuits. Notable guests to the estate over the years included author Edith Wharton, novelist Henry James, ambassadors Joseph Hodges Choate and Larz Anderson, and Presidents William McKinley, Theodore Roosevelt, and Woodrow Wilson. George married Edith Stuyvesant Dresser in 1898 in Paris, France; their only child, Cornelia Stuyvesant Vanderbilt, was born at Biltmore in the Louis XV room in 1900, and grew up at the estate.\\r\\nDriven by the impact of the newly imposed income taxes, and the fact that the estate was getting harder to manage economically, Vanderbilt initiated the sale of 87,000 acres (352?km2) to the federal government. After Vanderbilt's unexpected death in 1914 of complications from an emergency appendectomy, his widow completed the sale to carry out her husband's wish that the land remain unaltered, and that property became the nucleus of the Pisgah National Forest.[6] Overwhelmed with running such a large estate, Edith began consolidating her interests and sold Biltmore Estate Industries in 1917 and Biltmore Village in 1921. Edith intermittently occupied the house, living in an apartment carved out of the former Bachelors' Wing, until the marriage of her daughter to John Francis Amherst Cecil in April 1924. The Cecils went on to have two sons who were born in the same room as their mother.\\r\\nIn an attempt to bolster the estate's financial situation during the Great Depression, Cornelia and her husband opened Biltmore to the public in March 1930 at the request of the City of Asheville, which hoped the attraction would revitalize the area with tourism.[8] Biltmore closed during World War II and in 1942, 62 paintings and 17 sculptures were moved to the estate by train from the National Gallery of Art in Washington, D.C. to protect them in the event of an attack on the United States. The Music Room on the first floor was never finished, so it was used for storage until 1944, when the possibility of an attack became more remote. Among the works stored were the Gilbert Stuart portrait of George Washington and works by Rembrandt, Raphael, and Anthony van Dyck. David Finley, the gallery director, was a friend of Edith Vanderbilt and had stayed at the estate.[9]\\r\\nAfter the divorce of the Cecils in 1934, Cornelia left the estate never to return; however, John Cecil maintained his residence in the Bachelors' Wing until his death in 1954. Their eldest son George Henry Vanderbilt Cecil, occupied rooms in the wing until 1956. At this point Biltmore House ceased to be a family residence and has continued to be operated as a historic house museum.\\r\\nYounger son William A. V. Cecil, Sr. returned to the estate in 1960 and joined his brother to manage the estate and make it a profitable and self-sustaining enterprise like his grandfather envisioned. He eventually inherited the estate upon the death of his mother, Cornelia, in 1976, while his brother, George, inherited the then more profitable dairy farm which was split off into Biltmore Farms. In 1995, while celebrating the 100th anniversary of the estate, Cecil turned over control of the company to his son, William A.V. Cecil, Jr. The Biltmore Company is privately held and of the 4,306.86 acres that make up Biltmore Estate, only 1.36 acres are in the city limits of Asheville, and the Biltmore House is not part of any municipality.[10]\\r\\nThe estate was designated a National Historic Landmark in 1963,[11] and remains a major tourist attraction in Western North Carolina with over 1 million visitors each year.[12]\\r\\nVanderbilt commissioned prominent New York architect Richard Morris Hunt, who had previously designed houses for various Vanderbilt family members, to design the house in the Chateauesque style, using French Renaissance chateaus that Vanderbilt and Hunt had visited in early 1889, including Chateau de Blois, Chenonceau and Chambord in France and Waddesdon Manor in England, as inspiration with their steeply pitched roofs, turrets and sculptural ornamentation.[13] Hunt sited the four-story Indiana limestone-built home to face east with a 375-foot facade to fit into the mountainous topography behind. The facade is asymmetrically balanced with two projecting wings connecting to the entrance tower with an open loggia to the left side and a windowed arcade to the right which held the Winter Garden that was fashionable during the Victorian era. The entrance tower contains a series of windows with decorated jambs that extend from the front door to the most decorated dormer at Biltmore on the fourth floor. The carved decorations include trefoils, flowing tracery, rosettes, gargoyles, and at prominent lookouts, grotesques. The staircase is one of the more prominent features of the east facade, with its three-story, highly decorated winding balustrade with carved statues of St. Louis and Joan of Arc by the Austrian-born architectural sculptor Karl Bitter.\\r\\nThe south facade has the smallest dimensions for the house and is dominated by three large dormers on the east side and a polygonal turret on the west side. An arbor is attached to the house and is accessed from the library which is located on the ground floor. On the north end of the house, Hunt placed the attached stables, carriage house and its courtyard to protect the house and gardens from the wind. The 12,000-square-foot complex housed Vanderbilt's prized driving horses and the carriage house opposite the stables stored his 20 carriages in addition to any of his guest's carriages.\\r\\nThe rear western elevation is less elaborate than the front facade, with some windows not having any decoration at all. Two matching polygonal towers in the center are connected to the polygonal south turret by an open loggia that opens the main rooms of the house to the views of the Blue Ridge Mountains in the distance. The loggia is decorated overhead with terracotta tiles set in a herringbone pattern. The self-supporting ceramic tile vault and arch system was used extensively inside and outside of Biltmore, and was patented by Rafael Guastavino, a Spanish architect and engineer, who personally supervised the installation. The limestone columns were carved to reflect the sunlight in aesthetically pleasing and varied ways per Vanderbilt's wish. The rusticated base is a contrast to the smooth limestone used on the remainder of the house.\\r\\nThe steeply pitched roof is punctuated by 16 chimneys and covered with slate tiles that were affixed one by one. Each tile was drilled at the corners and wired onto the attics steel infrastructure. Copper flashing was then installed at the junctions to prevent water from penetrating. The fanciful flashing on the ridge of the roof was embossed with George Vanderbilts initials and motifs from his family crest, though the original gold leaf no longer survives.[14]\\r\\nBiltmore House had electricity from the time it was built. With electricity less safe and fire more of a danger at the time, the house had six separate sections divided by brick fire walls.[15]\\r\\nVanderbilt paid little attention to the family business or his own investments, and it is believed that the construction and upkeep of Biltmore depleted much of his inheritance.[citation needed]\\r\\nBiltmore has four acres of floor space and a total of 250 rooms in the house including 35 bedrooms for family and guests, 43 bathrooms, 65 fireplaces, three kitchens and 19th-century novelties such as electric elevators, forced-air heating, centrally controlled clocks, fire alarms, and a call-bell system.[13] The principal rooms of the house are located on the ground floor. To the right of the marbled Entrance Hall, the octagonal, sunken Winter Garden is surrounded by stone archways with a ceiling of architecturally sculptured wood and multifaceted glass. The centerpiece is a marble and bronze fountain sculpture titled Boy Stealing Geese created by Karl Bitter. On the walls just outside the Winter Garden are copies of the Parthenon frieze. The Banquet Hall is the largest room in the house, measuring 42 feet wide and 72 feet long, with a 70-foot-high barrel-vaulted ceiling. The table could seat 64 guests surrounded by rare Flemish tapestries and a triple fireplace that spans one end of the hall. On the opposite end of the hall is an organ gallery that houses a 1916 Skinner pipe organ. Left unfinished with bare brick walls, the Music Room was not completed and opened to the public until 1976. It showcases a mantle designed by Hunt, and a large engraving by Albrecht Drer called the Triumphal Arch commissioned by Holy Roman Emperor Maximilian I. The mantle had been stored in the stable for over 80 years. To the left of the entrance hall is the 90-foot-long Tapestry Gallery, which leads to the Library, featuring three 16th-century tapestries representing The Triumph of Virtue Over Vice. Elsewhere on the walls are family portraits by John Singer Sargent, Giovanni Boldini and James Whistler. The two-story Library contains over 10,000 volumes in eight languages, reflecting George Vanderbilt's broad interests in classic literature as well as works on art, history, architecture, and gardening. The second-floor balcony is accessed by an ornate walnut spiral staircase. The baroque detailing of the room is enhanced by the rich walnut paneling and the ceiling painting, The Chariot of Aurora, brought to Biltmore by Vanderbilt from the Palazzo Pisani Moretta in Venice, Italy. The painting by Giovanni Antonio Pellegrini is the most important work by the artist still in existence.[16]\\r\\nThe second floor is accessed by the cantilevered Grand Staircase of 102 steps spiraling around a four-story, wrought-iron chandelier holding 72 light bulbs.[17] The Second Floor Living Hall is an extension of the grand staircase as a formal hall and portrait gallery, and was restored to its original configuration in 2013. Several large-scale masterpieces are displayed in the hall, including two John Singer Sargent portraits of Biltmore's architect, Richard Morris Hunt, and landscaper, Frederick Law Olmsted, both commissioned for the home by Vanderbilt.[18] Located nearby in the south tower is George Vanderbilt's gilded bedroom with furniture designed by Hunt. His bedroom connects to his wife's Louis XV-style, oval-shaped bedroom in the north tower through a Jacobean carved oak paneled sitting room with an intricate ceiling.\\r\\nThe suite of rooms includes the Damask Room; the Claude Room, named after one of Vanderbilt's favorite artists, Claude Lorrain; the Tyrolean Chimney Room; and the most grand, the Louis XV Room, so named due to its architectural scheme and furnishings that were very popular in the late nineteenth century. The suite was restored and opened to the public for the first time in 100 years in 2011.[19]\\r\\nThe third floor has a number of guest rooms with names that describe the furnishing or artist that they were decorated with. The fourth floor has 21 bedrooms that were inhabited by housemaids, laundresses, and other female servants. Also included on the fourth floor is an Observatory with a circular staircase that leads to a wrought iron balcony with doorways to the rooftop where Vanderbilt could view his estate. Male servants were not housed here, however, but instead resided in rooms above the stable and complex.[13]\\r\\nThe Billiard Room is decorated with an ornamental plaster ceiling and rich oak paneling and was equipped with both a custom-made pool table and a carom table (table without pockets). The room was mainly frequented by men, but ladies were welcome to enter as well. Secret door panels on either side of the fireplace lead to the private quarters of the Bachelors Wing where female guests and staff members were not allowed. The wing includes the Smoking Room, which was fashionable for country houses, and the Gun Room, which held mounted trophies and displayed George Vanderbilts gun collection.[13]\\r\\nGuests of the estate could enjoy other activities that were found on the basement level, including an indoor 70,000-gallon (265,000-litre and 265-cubic meter) heated swimming pool with underwater lighting, one of the nation's first bowling alleys installed in a private residence, and a gymnasium with once state-of-the-art fitness equipment. The service hub of the house is also found in the largest basement in the US, as the location for the main kitchen, pastry kitchen, rotisserie kitchen, walk-in refrigerators that provided an early form of mechanical refrigeration, the servants' dining hall, laundry rooms and additional bedrooms for staff.\\r\\nWanting the best, Vanderbilt envisioned a park-like setting for his home and employed landscape architect Frederick Law Olmsted to design the grounds. However, Olmsted was not impressed with the condition of the 125,000 acres (195?sq?mi; 510?km2) and advised for a park surrounding the house, establishing farms along the river and replanting the rest as a commercial timber forest, a plan to which Vanderbilt agreed. Gifford Pinchot and later Carl A. Schenck were hired to manage the forests, with Schenck establishing the first forestry education program in the U.S., the Biltmore Forest School, on the estate grounds in 1898.\\r\\nAnother important aspect of the landscaping was the intentionally rustic three-mile (5?km) Approach Road that began at the brick quoined and pebbledash stucco Lodge Gate at the edge of Biltmore Village, and ended at the sphinx-topped stone pillars at the Esplanade. In between, the lane was densely filled with natural and uncultivated looking foliage and shrubbery to provide a relaxing journey for guests. Olmsted made sure to incorporate 75 acres (30?ha) of formal gardens that had been requested by Vanderbilt for the grounds directly surrounding the house. He constructed an Italian formal garden, a walled garden, a shrub and rose garden, fountains, and a conservatory with individual rooms for palms and orchids. There was also a bowling green, an outdoor tea room, and a terrace to incorporate the European statuary that Vanderbilt had brought back from his travels. At the opposite end of the Esplanade is the Rampe Douce, a graduated stairway zigzagging along a rough-cut limestone wall that leads to the grassy slope known as the Vista, topped with a statue of Diana, the goddess of the hunt.[13]\\r\\nWater features were an important aspect of Victorian landscaping and Olmsted incorporated two for the estate: the Bass Pond created from an old creek-fed millpond and the Lagoon. Each was used for guest recreation like fishing and rowing. To supply water for the estate, Olmsted engineered two reservoirs. One was a spring-fed man-made lake on nearby Busbee Mountain. The other was a man-made, brick-lined reservoir, located behind the statue of Diana in the Vista, at an elevation of approximately 266 feet above the Esplanade.[20]\\r\\nVanderbilt's idea was to replicate the working estates of Europe. He asked Hunt and Olmsted to design a village with architecturally compatible buildings and picturesque landscaping as a source of income through building rental, a place to help carry out philanthropic programs, and an easy point of access between the estate and the train station.[21] The result was Biltmore Village. The village included rental cottages complete with plumbing and central heating, a post office, shops, doctor's office, school, and a church, known today as the Cathedral of All Souls.[22] Intending that the estate could be self-supporting, Vanderbilt set up scientific forestry programs, poultry farms, cattle farms, hog farms, and a dairy. His wife, Edith, also enthusiastically supported agricultural reform and promoted the establishment of a state agricultural fair. In 1901, the Vanderbilts provided financial assistance to Biltmore Industries, started by Biltmore Village resident Eleanor Vance, which taught young people how to make hand-carved furniture, woven baskets, homespun wool fabric, and more.[23]\\r\\nThe estate today covers approximately 8,000 acres (13?sq?mi; 32?km2) and is split in half by the French Broad River, overseen by The Biltmore Company, a trust set up by the family. The company is a large enterprise that is one of the largest employers in the Asheville area. Restaurants were opened in 1979 and 1987 as well as four gifts shops in 1993. The former dairy barn was converted into the popular Biltmore Winery in 1985. The AAA four-diamond 210-room Inn on Biltmore Estate opened in 2001, and in 2010, the estate debuted Antler Hill Village, as well as a remodeled winery, and connected farmyard.\\r\\nThe Biltmore Estate licenses its name and design elements to a line of housewares, linens, and luggage called \\"Biltmore For Your Home\\", marketed exclusively by Belk stores.[24]\\r\\nThe house has been featured in \\"Empires of the Smoky Skies\\", a scenario in Sid Meier's Civilization V. The estate and its surrounding forest make up the setting of Robert Beatty's 2015 middle-grade novel Serafina and the Black Cloak and its 2016 sequel Serafina and the Twisted Staff.[25]\\r\\nThe grounds and buildings of Biltmore Estate have appeared in a number of major motion pictures and TV series:","input":"When did biltmore house open to the public?"},{"output":"September 22, 1994","context":"\\r\\n\\r\\nFriends is an American television sitcom, created by David Crane and Marta Kauffman, which aired on NBC from September 22, 1994 to May 6, 2004, lasting ten seasons. With an ensemble cast starring Jennifer Aniston, Courteney Cox (who became Courteney Cox Arquette partway through the series' run), Lisa Kudrow, Matt LeBlanc, Matthew Perry and David Schwimmer, the show revolves around six 20ÿ30-something friends living in Manhattan. The series was produced by Bright/Kauffman/Crane Productions, in association with Warner Bros. Television. The original executive producers were Kevin S. Bright, Marta Kauffman, and David Crane.\\r\\n\\r\\nKauffman and Crane began developing Friends under the title Insomnia Cafe between November and December 1993. They presented the idea to Bright, and together they pitched a seven-page treatment of the show to NBC. After several script rewrites and changes, including a title change to Six of One,[1] and, Friends Like Us, the series was finally named Friends.[2]\\r\\n\\r\\nFilming of the show took place at Warner Bros. Studios in Burbank, California. All ten seasons of Friends ranked within the top ten of the final television season ratings; ultimately reaching the number one spot in its eighth season. The series finale, aired on May 6, 2004, was watched by around 52.5 million American viewers, making it the fifth most-watched series finale in television history,[3][4][5] and the most-watched television episode of the 2000s decade.[6][7]\\r\\n\\r\\nFriends received acclaim throughout its run, becoming one of the most popular television shows of all time.[8] The series was nominated for 62 Primetime Emmy Awards, winning the Outstanding Comedy Series award in 2002 for its eighth season. The show ranked no. 21 on TV Guide's 50 Greatest TV Shows of All Time,[9] and no. 7 on Empire magazine's The 50 Greatest TV Shows of All Time.[10][11] In 1997, the episode \\"The One with the Prom Video\\" was ranked no. 100 on TV Guide's 100 Greatest Episodes of All-Time.[12] In 2013, Friends ranked no. 24 on the Writers Guild of America's 101 Best Written TV Series of All Time,[13] and no. 28 on TV Guide's 60 Best TV Series of All Time.[14]\\r\\n\\r\\nRachel Green flees her wedding day and finds childhood friend Monica Geller, a New York City chef. They become roommates, and Rachel joins Monica's group of single people in their mid-20s: Struggling actor Joey Tribbiani, business professional Chandler Bing, masseuse and musician Phoebe Buffay, and newly divorced palaeontologist Ross Geller, Monica's older brother. Rachel becomes a waitress at fictitious Manhattan coffeehouse Central Perk; when not there, the group is usually at Monica and Rachel's nearby West Village apartment, or Joey and Chandler's across the hall.\\r\\n\\r\\nEpisodes depict the friends' comedic and romantic adventures and career issues, such as Joey auditioning for roles or Rachel seeking jobs in the fashion industry. The six characters each have many dates and serious relationships, such as Monica with Richard Burke and Ross with Emily Waltham. Ross and Rachel's intermittent relationship is the most often-recurring storyline; during the ten seasons of the show they repeatedly date and break up, while Ross briefly marries Emily, he and Rachel have a child, Chandler and Monica date and marry each other, and Phoebe marries Mike Hannigan. Other frequently recurring characters include Ross and Monica's parents in Long Island, Ross's ex-wife and their son, Central Perk barista Gunther, Chandler's ex-girlfriend Janice, and Phoebe's twin sister Ursula.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn their original contracts for the first season, cast members were paid $22,500 per episode.[23] The cast members received different salaries in the second season, beginning from the $20,000 range to $40,000 per episode.[23][24] Before their salary negotiations for the third season, the cast decided to enter collective negotiations, despite Warner Bros.' preference for individual deals.[25] The actors were given the salary of the least-paid cast member, meaning Aniston and Schwimmer had their salaries reduced. The stars were paid $75,000 per episode in season three, $85,000 in season four, $100,000 in season five, $125,000 in season six, $750,000 in seasons seven and eight, and $1?million in seasons nine and ten, making Aniston, Cox, and Kudrow the highest-paid TV actresses of all time.[26][27][28] The cast also received syndication royalties beginning in 2000 after renegotiations. At the time, that financial benefit of a piece of the show's lucrative back-end profits had only been given out to stars who had ownership rights in a show, like Jerry Seinfeld and Bill Cosby.[29]\\r\\n\\r\\nSeries creator David Crane wanted all six actors to be equally prominent,[30] and the series was lauded as being \\"the first true 'ensemble' show.\\"[31] The cast members made efforts to keep the ensemble format and not allow one member to dominate;[31] they entered themselves in the same acting categories for awards,[32] opted for collective salary negotiations,[31] and asked to appear together on magazine cover photos in the first season.[33] The cast members also became best friends off-screen,[34] so much so that recurring guest star Tom Selleck reported that he sometimes felt left out.[35]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe cast remained good friends after the series run, most notably Cox and Aniston, with Aniston being godmother to Cox and David Arquette's daughter, Coco.[36] In the official farewell commemorative book Friends 'Til the End, each separately acknowledged in interviews that the cast had become their family.[37][38]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe first season introduces the six main characters: Rachel, Monica, Phoebe, Joey, Chandler, and Ross. Rachel arrives at Central Perk after running away from her wedding to her fianc Barry and moves into an apartment with her friend Monica from high school. Ross, who has had a crush on Rachel since the two of them were in high school, constantly attempts to tell her how he feels about her. However, many obstacles stand in his way, such as the fact that he is expecting a baby with his lesbian ex-wife, Carol. Joey is shown to be a bachelor and struggling actor, while Phoebe works as a masseuse and portrays a sort of \\"crazy\\" attribute to her personality based on her troubles as a child after her mother committed suicide. However, the rest of the group loves her regardless. Chandler breaks up with girlfriend Janice (Maggie Wheeler), who frequently returns in later seasons. Carol delivers a baby boy who is named Ben. At the end of the season, Chandler accidentally reveals that Ross loves Rachel, who realizes that she feels the same way. The season ends with Rachel waiting at the airport for Ross arrival from a trip.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe second season begins with Rachel waiting at the gate for Ross to declare her love for him. However, she discovers that he is dating Julie (Lauren Tom), someone he knew from graduate school. Rachel's attempts to tell Ross she likes him mirror his failed attempts in the first season, although the characters eventually begin a relationship. Joey gets cast in a part in a fictional version of the soap opera Days of Our Lives, but his character is killed off after conflicts with the show's writers, claiming that he writes many of his own lines. Chandler gets back with Janice, his ex-girlfriend from season one. Monica begins dating Richard (Tom Selleck), a recently divorced family friend and 21 years her senior but they eventually break up.\\r\\n\\r\\nSeason three takes on a significantly greater serialized format. Rachel begins working at Bloomingdale's, an upscale department store chain, and Ross becomes jealous of her colleague, Mark. Rachel decides to take a break from their relationship; and Ross, hurt and drunk sleeps with Chloe, the hot girl from the Xerox place, causing Rachel to break up with him. In the meantime, Chandler has a hard time dealing with their breakup because it reminds him of his parents' divorce. After believing she has no family except her twin sister Ursula (Lisa Kudrow), Phoebe becomes acquainted with her half-brother (Giovanni Ribisi) and birth mother (Teri Garr). Joey develops a relationship with his acting partner Kate (Dina Meyer), and Monica begins a relationship with millionaire Pete Becker (Jon Favreau) which ends because of the disagreements between the two.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the fourth-season premiere, Ross and Rachel briefly reconcile after Ross pretends to read a long letter that Rachel wrote for him, but continues to insist that the two were on a break so they break up again. Joey dates Kathy (Paget Brewster), a girl that Chandler has a crush on. Kathy and Chandler later kiss, which causes drama between Chandler and Joey. Joey forgives Chandler only after he spends a day in a box as punishment. Phoebe becomes a surrogate mother for her brother and his wife Alice (Debra Jo Rupp). Monica and Rachel are forced to switch apartments with Joey and Chandler after losing a bet during a quiz game, but manage to switch back by bribing them with Knicks season tickets and a one-minute kiss (off-screen) between the girls. Ross begins dating an English woman named Emily (Helen Baxendale), and the season finale features their wedding in London.

The camera's last view is of all of the characters' keys to the apartment on the counter table, finishing with a shot of the apartment's purple door.\\r\\n\\r\\nDavid Crane and Marta Kauffman began developing three new television pilots that would premiere in 1994 after their sitcom Family Album was cancelled by CBS in 1993.[41] Kauffman and Crane decided to pitch the series about \\"six people in their 20s making their way in Manhattan\\" to NBC, since they thought it would fit best there.[42] Crane and Kauffman presented the idea to their production partner Kevin Bright, who had served as executive producer on their HBO series Dream On.[43] The idea for the series was conceived when Crane and Kauffman began thinking about the time when they had finished college and started living by themselves in New York; Kauffman believed they were looking at a time when the future was \\"more of a question mark.\\"[40] They found the concept to be interesting, as they believed \\"everybody knows that feeling\\",[40] and because it was also how they felt about their own lives at the time.[40] The team titled the series Insomnia Cafe, and pitched the idea as a seven-page treatment to NBC in December 1993.[40][42]\\r\\n\\r\\nAt the same time, Warren Littlefield, the then-president of NBC Entertainment, was seeking a comedy involving young people living together and sharing expenses. Littlefield wanted the group to share memorable periods of their lives with friends, who had become \\"new, surrogate family members.\\"[18] However, Littlefield found difficulty in bringing the concept to life, and found the scripts developed by NBC to be terrible. When Kauffman, Crane and Bright pitched Insomnia Cafe, Littlefield was impressed that they knew who their characters were.[18] NBC bought the idea as a put pilot, meaning they risked financial penalties if the pilot was not filmed.[44] Kauffman and Crane took three days to write the pilot script for a show they titled Friends Like Us.[40][45] Littlefield wanted the series to \\"represent Generation X and explore a new kind of tribal bonding\\", but the rest disagreed. Crane argued that it was not a series for one generation, and wanted to produce a series that everyone would enjoy watching.[18] NBC liked the script and ordered the series. They changed the title to Six of One, mainly because they felt Friends Like Us was to similar to the ABC sitcom These Friends of Mine.[46]\\r\\n\\r\\nOnce it became apparent that the series was a favored project at NBC, Littlefield reported that he was getting calls from every agent in town, wanting their client to be a part of the series.[18] Auditions for the lead roles took place in New York and Los Angeles.[47] The casting director shortlisted 1,000 actors who had applied for each role down to 75. Those who received a callback read again in front of Crane, Kauffman and Bright. At the end of March, the number of potential actors had been reduced to three or four for each part, and were asked to read for Les Moonves, then-president of Warner Bros. Television.[48]\\r\\n\\r\\nHaving worked with David Schwimmer in the past,[47] the series creators wrote the character of Ross with him in mind, and he was the first actor cast.[49] Cox wanted to play the role of Monica, but the producers had her in mind to play Rachel because of her \\"cheery, upbeat energy\\", which was not how they envisioned Monica; after Cox's audition, though, Kauffman agreed with Cox, and she got the role.[40][50] When Matt LeBlanc auditioned for Joey, he put a \\"different spin\\" on the character.[40] He played Joey more simple-minded than intended and gave the character heart. Although Crane and Kauffman did not want LeBlanc for the role at the time, they were told by the network to cast him.[40] Jennifer Aniston, Matthew Perry and Lisa Kudrow were cast based on their auditions.[47]\\r\\n\\r\\nMore changes occurred to the series' storylines during the casting process. The writers found that they had to adjust the characters they had written to suit the actors, and the discovery process of the characters occurred throughout the first season. Kauffman acknowledged that Joey's character became \\"this whole new being\\", and that \\"it wasn't until we did the first Thanksgiving episode that we realized how much fun Monica's neuroses are.\\"[51]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the weeks after NBC's pick up of Friends, Crane, Kauffman and Bright reviewed sent-in scripts that writers had originally prepared for other series, mainly unproduced Seinfeld episodes.[52] Kauffman and Crane hired a team of seven young writers because \\"When you're 40, you can't do it anymore. The networks and studios are looking for young people coming in out of college.\\"[53] The creators felt that using six equal characters, rather than emphasizing one or two, would allow for \\"myriad storylines and give the show legs.\\"[30] The majority of the storyline ideas came from the writers, although the actors added ideas.[47] Although the writers originally planned the big love story to be between Joey and Monica, the idea of a romantic interest between Ross and Rachel emerged during the period when Kauffman and Crane wrote the pilot script.[40]\\r\\n\\r\\nDuring the production of the pilot, NBC requested that the script be changed to feature one dominant storyline and several minor ones, but the writers refused, wanting to keep three storylines of equal weight.[46] NBC also wanted the writers to include an older character to balance out the young ones. Crane and Kauffman were forced to comply and wrote a draft of an early episode that featured \\"Pat the Cop.\\" who would be used to provide advice to the other characters. Crane found the storyline to be terrible, and Kauffman joked, \\"You know the kids book, Pat the Bunny? We had Pat the Cop.\\" NBC eventually relented and dropped the idea.[40]\\r\\n\\r\\nEach summer (June, July, and August in the US), the producers would outline the storylines for the subsequent season.[54] Before an episode went into production, Kauffman and Crane would revise the script written by another writer, mainly if something concerning either the series or a character felt foreign.[52] Unlike other storylines, the idea for a relationship between Joey and Rachel was decided on halfway through the eighth season. The creators did not want Ross and Rachel to get back together so soon, and while looking for a romantic impediment, a writer suggested Joey's romantic interest in Rachel. The storyline was incorporated into the season; However, when the actors feared that the storyline would make their characters unlikable, the storyline was wrapped up, until it again resurfaced in the season's finale. For the ninth season, the writers were unsure about the amount of storyline to give to Rachel's baby, as they wanted the show neither to revolve around a baby nor pretend there to be none.[54] Crane said that it took them a while to accept the idea of a tenth season, which they decided to do because they had enough stories left to tell to justify the season. Kauffman and Crane would not have signed on for an eleventh season, even if all the cast members had wanted to continue.[51]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe episode title format\\"The One...\\"[55]was created when the producers realized that the episode titles would not be featured in the opening credits, and therefore would be unknown to most of the audience. Episode titles officially begin with \\"The One...\\" except the title of the pilot episode and the series finale \\"The Last One.\\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe first season was shot on Stage 5 at Warner Bros. Studios in Burbank, California.[56] NBC executives had worried that the coffee house setting was too hip and asked for the series to be set in a diner, but eventually consented to the coffee house concept.[40] The opening title sequence was filmed in a fountain at the Warner Bros. Ranch at 4:00?am, while it was particularly cold for a Burbank morning.[57] At the beginning of the second season, production moved to the larger Stage 24, which was renamed \\"The Friends Stage\\" after the series finale.[58] Filming for the series began during the summer (June, July, and August in the US) of 1994 in front of a live audience, who were given a summary of the series to familiarize themselves with the six main characters;[40] a hired comedian entertained the studio audience between takes.[33] Each 22-minute episode took six hours to filmtwice the length of most sitcom tapingsmainly due to the several retakes and rewrites of the script.[33]\\r\\n\\r\\nAlthough the producers always wanted to find the right stories to take advantage of being on location, Friends was never shot in New York. Bright felt that filming outside the studio made episodes less funny, even when shooting on the lot outside, and that the live audience was an integral part of the series.[47] When the series was criticized for incorrectly depicting New York, with the financially struggling group of friends being able to afford huge apartments, Bright noted that the set had to be big enough for the cameras, lighting, and \\"for the audience to be able to see what's going on\\";[47] the apartments also needed to provide a place for the actors to execute the funny scripts.[47] The fourth-season finale was shot on location in London because the producers were aware of the series' popularity in the UK.[47] The scenes were shot in a studio with three audiences each made up of 500 people. These were the show's largest audiences throughout its run. The fifth-season finale, set in Las Vegas, was filmed at Warner Bros. Studios, although Bright met people who thought it was filmed on location.[59]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe series' creators completed the first draft of the hour-long finale in January 2004, four months before its original airing. Crane, Kauffman and Bright watched the finales of other sitcoms to prepare the episode's outline, paying attention to what worked and what did not. They liked the ones that stayed true to the series, citing the finale of The Mary Tyler Moore Show as the gold standard. Crane, Kauffman, and Bright had difficulty writing the finale. They did not want to do \\"something high concept, or take the show out of the show.\\"[61] The most critical parts of the finale were shot without an audience, and with a minimum number of crew members. The main cast enjoyed the finale and were confident that the fans would react similarly:[61]\\r\\n\\r\\nIt's exactly what I had hoped. We all end up with a sense of a new beginning and the audience has a sense that it's a new chapter in the lives of all these characters. \\r\\nNBC heavily promoted the series finale, which was preceded by weeks of media hype.[62] Local NBC affiliates organized viewing parties around the U.S., including an event at Universal CityWalk featuring a special broadcast of the finale on an outdoor Astrovision screen.[63] The finale was the subject of two episodes of Dateline NBC, a weekly television newsmagazine, one of which ran for two hours. A one-hour retrospective of clips from previous episodes was shown before to the airing of the episode. Following the finale, The Tonight Show with Jay Leno was filmed on the set of the Friends' Central Perk coffee house, which featured the series' cast as guests.[64][65] The advertising rates for the finale averaged $2?million for 30 seconds of commercial time, breaking the record held by the Seinfeld finale at $1.7?million.[63]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the U.S., 52.5?million viewers watched the finale on May 6, 2004, making it the most-watched entertainment telecast since the Seinfeld finale in 1998.[64] Although it was not the series' most-watched episode,[66] the finale was the fourth most-watched series finale in television history, only behind the finales of M*A*S*H, Cheers and Seinfeld, which were respectively watched by 105, 80.4 and 76.2?million viewers. The retrospective episode was watched by fewer than 36?million viewers, and the finale was the second most-watched television broadcast of the year, only behind the Super Bowl.[64] Following the finales of Friends and Frasier, media critics speculated about the fate of the sitcom genre. Expressed opinions varied between a signalling of the end of the sitcom genre, a small decline in the large history of the genre,[63] and a general reduction of scripted television in favor of reality shows.[62]\\r\\n\\r\\nEarly reviews of the series were mixed; and it holds a Metacritic score of 59 out of 100, based on 20 sampled reviews, indicating \\"mixed to average reviews.\\"[67] Tom Feran of The Plain Dealer wrote that the series traded \\"vaguely and less successfully on the hanging-out style of Seinfeld\\",[68] while Ann Hodges of the Houston Chronicle called it \\"the new Seinfeld wannabe, but it will never be as funny as Seinfeld.\\"[69] In the Los Angeles Daily News, Ray Richmond named the series as \\"one of the brighter comedies of the new season\\",[70] and the Los Angeles Times called it \\"flat-out the best comedy series of the new season.\\"[71]\\r\\n\\r\\nChicago Sun-Times' Ginny Holbert found Joey and Rachel's characteristics to be underdeveloped,[72] while Richmond commended the cast as a \\"likeable, youth ensemble\\" with \\"good chemistry.\\"[70] Robert Bianco of USA Today was complimentary of Schwimmer, calling him \\"terrific.\\" He also praised the female leads, but was concerned that Perry's role as Chandler was \\"undefined\\" and that LeBlanc was \\"relying too much on the same brain-dead stud routine that was already tired the last two times he tried it.\\"[73] The authors of Friends Like Us: The Unofficial Guide to Friends thought that the cast was \\"trying just a little too hard\\", in particular, Perry and Schwimmer.[74]\\r\\n\\r\\nAs the series progressed, reviews became more positive, and Friends became one of the most popular sitcoms of its time. It is now often ranked among the all-time best TV shows.[8][9][10] Critics commended the series as having consistently sharp writing and the chemistry between the main actors.[75] Noel Holston of Newsday, who had dismissed the pilot as a \\"so-so Seinfeld wannabe\\" in 1994, repudiated his earlier review after rewatching the episode, and felt like writing an apology to the writers.[51] Heather Havrilesky of Salon.com thought that the series \\"hit its stride\\" in the second season. Havrilesky found the character-specific jokes and situations \\"could reliably make you laugh out loud a few times each episode\\", and the quality of writing allowed the stories to be \\"original and innovative.\\"[76] Bill Carter of The New York Times called the eighth season a \\"truly stunning comeback.\\" Carter found that by \\"generating new hot storylines and high-decibel laughs\\", the series made its way \\"back into the hearts of its fans.\\"[77] However, Liane Bonin of Entertainment Weekly felt that the direction of the ninth season was a \\"disappointing buzzkill\\", criticizing it for the non-stop celebrity guest spots and going into jump the shark territory. Although disappointed with the season, Bonin noted that \\"the writing [was] still sharp.\\"[78] Havrilesky thought that the tenth season was \\"alarmingly awful, far worse than you would ever imagine a show that was once so good could be.\\"[76] Friends was featured on Time's list of \\"The 100 Best TV Shows of All-Time\\", saying, \\"the well-hidden secret of this show was that it called itself Friends, and was really about family.\\"[79]\\r\\n\\r\\nReviews of the series finale were mixed. USA Today's Robert Bianco described the finale as entertaining and satisfying, and praised it for deftly mixing emotion and humor while highlighting each of the stars.[80] Sarah Rodman of the Boston Herald praised Aniston and Schwimmer for their acting, but felt that their characters' reunion was \\"a bit too neat, even if it was what most of the show's legions of fans wanted.\\"[81] Roger Catlin of the Hartford Courant felt that newcomers to the series would be \\"surprised at how laughless the affair could be, and how nearly every strained gag depends on the sheer stupidity of its characters.\\"[82] Ken Parish Perkins, writing for Fort Worth Star-Telegram, pointed out that the finale was \\"more touching than comical, more satisfying in terms of closure than knee-slappingly funny.\\"[83]\\r\\n\\r\\nTo maintain the series' ensemble format, the main cast members decided to enter themselves in the same acting categories for awards.[32] Beginning with the series' eighth season, the actors decided to submit themselves in the lead actor balloting, rather than in the supporting actor fields.[84] The series was nominated for 62 Primetime Emmy Awards,[85] winning six. Aniston and Kudrow are the only main cast members to win an Emmy, while Cox is the only actor not to be nominated. The series won the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Comedy Series in 2002, receiving nominations in 1995, 1996, 1999, 2000, and 2003.[86] The series also won an American Comedy Award,[87] one GLAAD Media Award,[88] one Golden Globe Award,[89] three Logie Awards,[90][91] six People's Choice Awards,[92][93] one Satellite Award,[94] and one Screen Actors Guild Award.[95]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe table below shows the ratings of Friends in the United States, where it consistently ranked within the top ten of the final television season ratings.[96] \\"Rank\\" refers to how well Friends rated compared to other television series that aired during primetime hours of the corresponding television season. It is shown in relation to the total number of series airing on the then-six major English-language networks in a given season. \\"Viewers\\" refers to the average number of viewers for all original episodes, broadcast during the television season in the series' regular timeslot. The \\"season premiere\\" is the date that the first episode of the season aired, and the \\"season finale\\" is the date that the final episode of the season aired. So far, Friends has been the last sitcom to reach the no. 1 spot on television, as its successors were CSI: Crime Scene Investigation, American Idol, NBC Sunday Night Football and NCIS.\\r\\n\\r\\nBecause of syndication revenue, Friends continues to generate approximately $1 billion each year for Warner Bros. That translates into about $20 million in annual residuals each for Jennifer Aniston, Courteney Cox, Lisa Kudrow, Matt LeBlanc, Matthew Perry and David Schwimmer, who each get 2% of syndication income for Friends.[99] The series has a syndication deal through multiple networks including Nickelodeon, TBS, and Paramount (formerly known as Spike).\\r\\n\\r\\nAlthough the producers thought of Friends as \\"only a TV show\\", numerous psychologists investigated the cultural impact of Friends during the series' run. Aniston's hairstyle was nicknamed \\"The Rachel\\", and copied around the world.[18] Joey's catchphrase, \\"How you doin'?\\", became a popular part of Western English slang, often used as a pick-up line or when greeting friends.[100] The series also influenced the English language, according to a study by the University of Toronto that found that the characters used the emphasized word \\"so\\" to modify adjectives more often than any other intensifier. Although the preference had already made its way into the American vernacular, usage on the series may have accelerated the change.[31] Chandler's habit of ending a sentence unfinished for sarcasm also influenced viewers' speech.[101] Following the September 11 attacks, ratings increased 17% over the previous season.[77]\\r\\n\\r\\nFriends is parodied in the twelfth season Murder, She Wrote episode \\"Murder Among Friends.\\" In the episode, amateur sleuth Jessica Fletcher (Angela Lansbury) investigates the murder of a writer for Buds, a fictional television series about the daily lives of a group of city friends. The episode was devised after CBS moved Murder, She Wrote from its regular Sunday night timeslot to a Thursday night timeslot directly opposite Friends on NBC; Angela Lansbury was quoted by Bruce Lansbury, her brother and Murder, She Wrote's supervising producer, as having \\"a bit of an attitude\\" about the move to Thursday, but he saw the plot as \\"a friendly setup, no mean-spiritedness.\\"[102] Jerry Ludwig, the writer of the episode, researched the \\"flavor\\" of Buds by watching episodes of Friends.[102]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Central Perk coffee house, one of the principal settings of the series, has inspired various imitations worldwide. In 2006, Iranian businessman Mojtaba Asadian started a Central Perk franchise, registering the name in 32 countries. The decor of the coffee houses is inspired by Friends, featuring replica couches, counters, neon signage and bricks. The coffee houses also contain paintings of the various characters from the series, and televisions playing Friends episodes. James Michael Tyler, who plays the Central Perk manager in the series, Gunther, attended the grand opening of the Dubai cafe, where he worked as a waiter.[103] Central Perk was rebuilt as part of a museum exhibit at Warner Bros. Studios, and was shown on The Ellen DeGeneres Show in October 2008. Jennifer Aniston revisited the set for the first time since the series finale in 2004.[104] From September 24 to October 7, 2009, a Central Perk replica was based at Broadwick Street, Soho, London. The coffee house sold real coffee to customers and featured a display of Friends memorabilia and props, such as the Geller Cup from the season three episode \\"The One with the Football.\\"[105] In Beijing, business owner Du Xin opened a coffee shop named Central Perk in March 2010.[106] In India, there are six Friends themed cafes, located in Chandigarh (named Central Perk), Kolkata (named F.R.I.E.N.D.S. Cafe) which features many icons from the original T.V. series for example, Chandler and Joey's ugly dog statue, the orange sofa, the purple door of Monica and Rachel's apartment and Phoebe's pink bicycle. The other three cafes are located in Delhi, Gurgaon, Bhubaneswar and Pune.[107][108] There are two Friends themed cafes in Pakistan as wellone in Lahore known as \\"Friends Cafe\\" and the other in Peshawar called \\"Central Perk\\". Both of those cafes have an iconic couch, a guitar and foosball table, quotes from the show on the walls and even episode reruns on a projector. They're also planning to have their own Gunther at the bar.[109] In 2016, a Central Perk replica was opened in Outram, Singapore. It is the only Central Perk that has been given the intellectual property rights by Warner Bros. outside of the United States. The cafe also includes feature walls, replicating the walls of the main characters' apartments and memorabilias and props used on the show.[110] [111]\\r\\n\\r\\nFriends has also developed an alternative family lifestyle by representing young people that live unconventional domestic lives. It presents the idea that \\"all you need is good friends\\" and can construct families through choice. The audience is able to identify with the program through the troubles seen on weekly episodes. It portrays a new way of living life and developing relationships which are not normally seen in conventional society.[112] According to a pop-culture expert at the University at Buffalo, Friends is \\"one of those rare shows that marked a change in American culture.\\" The images of youth and the roles they portray are better defined and represent a lifestyle that centres around creating and sustaining relationships between friends running their own lives and seeking help from each other.[113]\\r\\n\\r\\nVox  stated that Friends impacted the creation of other conflictless \\"hangout sitcoms\\", with groups of adult friends who are funny and have similar character traits. One example of this is How I Met Your Mother, which The Guardian's TV and radio blog notes also shares its setting with Friends, Manhattan. Other examples include The Big Bang Theory, New Girl, and Happy Endings.[114][115][116][117]\\r\\n\\r\\nReaders of TV Guide voted the cast of Friends their Best Comedy cast of all time, ranking at 29% of the votes, beating Seinfeld, which registered 18%.[118] A poll undertaken by 60 Minutes and Vanity Fair named Friends the third greatest sitcom of all time.[119] In 2014, the series was ranked by Mundo Estranho the Best TV Series of All Time.[120]\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter the produced pilot lived up to NBC's hopes, the series premiered with the name Friends on September 22, 1994, in the coveted Thursday 8:30?p.m. timeslot. The pilot aired between Mad About You and Seinfeld,[18] and was watched by almost 22?million American viewers.[40] The series was a huge success throughout its run, and was a staple of NBC's Thursday night line-up, dubbed by the network as Must See TV.[121] When Crane told reporters in 2001 that the ninth season was a possibility, critics believed that he was posturing, and that at least two of the cast members would not sign on for another season.[77] When it was confirmed that Friends would return for a ninth season, the news was mainly about the amount of money$7?million per episodethat it took to bring the series back for another season.[77]\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter year-long expectations that the ninth season would be the series' last, NBC signed a deal in late December 2002 to bring the series back for a final tenth season. The series' creative team did not want to extend negotiations into the next year, and wanted to start writing the rest of the ninth-season episodes and a potential series finale.[122] NBC agreed to pay $10?million to Warner Bros. for the production of each tenth-season episode, the highest price in television history for a 30-minute series.[75] Although NBC was unable to bring in enough advertising revenue from commercials to cover the costs, the series was integral to the Thursday night schedule, which brought high ratings and profits to the other television series.[122] The cast demanded that the tenth season be reduced from the usual 24 episodes to 18 episodes to allow them to work on outside projects.[78]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn fall 2001, Warner Bros. Domestic Cable made a deal with sister network TBS (both are owned by Time Warner) to air the series in rerun syndication. Warner Bros. Domestic Cable announced that it had sold additional cable rights to Friends to Nick at Nite which began airing in the fall of 2011 (unlike the TBS and broadcast syndication airings, Nick at Nite broadcasts of the series, which began airing as part of a seven-night launch marathon on September 5, 2011, replace the end credit tag scenes with marginalized credits featuring promotions for the series and other Nick at Nite programs). Warner Bros. was expected to make $200?million in license fees and advertising from the deal. Nick at Nite paid $500,000 per episode to air the episodes after 6?p.m. ET for six years through fall 2017. In syndication until 2005, Friends had earned $4?million per episode in cash license fees for a total of $944?million.[123]\\r\\n\\r\\nBeginning on March 5, 2012, high definition versions of all 236 Friends episodes were made available to local broadcast stations, starting with the pilot episode. For the remastered episodes, Warner Bros. restored previously cropped images on the left and right sides of the screen, using the original 35 mm film source, to use the entire 16:9 widescreen frame.[124] These masters had been airing in New Zealand on TV2 since January 2011.[125] Netflix added all ten seasons of Friends in high definition to their streaming service in the United States on January 1, 2015.\\r\\n\\r\\nFriends has aired on different channels in the UK in their original, unedited international versions prior to their being re-edited for US broadcast and syndication. These versions, with additional footage not seen domestically, have aired on such stations as Channel 4, Sky1, E4, and Comedy Central UK.[126][127][128][129][130] On September 4, 2011, Friends officially ended on E4 after the channel re-ran the series since 2004. Comedy Central took over the rights to air the program from October 2011. In the Republic of Ireland, each season of the show made its European debut on RT2. After 2004 RT2 began to repeat the series from the start before moving over to TV3 and its digital channel 3e in 2010.[131][132] As of February 2015, repeats of the show have returned to RT2 while also broadcasting on Comedy Central Ireland.[133][134]\\r\\n\\r\\nFriends has aired in Australia on the Seven Network (season 1 only), Nine Network (season 2ÿ10), Network Ten (2007ÿ09, repeats), on GEM (a sub-channel of the Nine Network), and on pay TV channel TV Hits formerly aired on Arena, 111 Hits.[135][136] The show is broadcast on TV2 in New Zealand.[137]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn Canada, the series was broadcast on Global. In later years, it was syndicated on several of its cable sibling networks, including Slice, DTour, and TVTropolis, its previous incarnation.[138][139]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn India, the show is broadcast by Comedy Central at various times.

The show became available on Netflix from January 1, 2015.[146] The Netflix airings are in the versions as aired on NBC rather than the longer international versions, as discussed below.\\r\\n\\r\\nAll ten seasons have been released on DVD individually and as a box set. Each Region 1 season release contains special features and are presented in their aforementioned original international broadcast versions, although Region 2 releases are as originally aired domestically. For the first season, each episode is updated with color correction and sound enhancement.[47] A wide range of Friends merchandise has been produced by various companies. In September 1995, WEA Records released the first album of music from Friends, the Friends Original TV Soundtrack, containing music featured in previous and future episodes. The soundtrack debuted on the Billboard 200 at number 46,[147] and sold 500,000 copies in November 1995.[148] In 1999, a second soundtrack album entitled Friends Again was released.[149] Other merchandise includes a Friends version of the DVD game \\"Scene It?\\", and a quiz video game for PlayStation 2 and PC entitled Friends: The One with All the Trivia.[150][151] On September 28, 2009, a box set was released in the UK celebrating the series' 15th anniversary. The box set contained extended episodes, an episode guide, and original special features.[152]\\r\\n\\r\\nWarner Home Video released a complete series collection on Blu-ray on November 13, 2012.[153] The collection does not feature the extra deleted scenes and jokes that were included on prior DVD releases, and are therefore presented in their NBC broadcast versions.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter the series finale in 2004, LeBlanc signed on for the spin-off series, Joey, following Joey's move to Los Angeles to pursue his acting career. Kauffman and Crane were not interested in the spin-off, although Bright agreed to executive produce the series with Scott Silveri and Shana Goldberg-Meehan.[181] NBC heavily promoted Joey and gave it Friends' Thursday 8:00?pm timeslot.[182][183] The pilot was watched by 18.60?million American viewers,[184] but ratings continually decreased throughout the series' two seasons, averaging 10.20?million viewers in the first season and 7.10?million in the second.[59] The final broadcast episode on March 7, 2006, was watched by 7.09?million viewers;[185] NBC cancelled the series on May 15, 2006, after two seasons.[186] Bright blamed the collaboration between NBC executives, the studio and other producers for quickly ruining the series:[59]\\r\\n\\r\\nOn Friends, Joey was a womanizer, but we enjoyed his exploits. He was a solid friend, a guy you knew you could count on. Joey was deconstructed to be a guy who couldn't get a job, couldn't ask a girl out. He became a pathetic, mopey character. I felt he was moving in the wrong direction, but I was not heard. \\r\\nArticles concerning the cultural influence of the programme:","input":"When did friends air for the first time?"},{"output":"Mexico","context":"Decisive Texian victory;\\r\\nThe Battle of San Jacinto, fought on April 21, 1836, in present-day Harris County, Texas, was the decisive battle of the Texas Revolution. Led by General Sam Houston, the Texian Army engaged and defeated General Antonio L܇pez de Santa Anna's Mexican army in a fight that lasted just 18 minutes.\\r\\nSanta Anna, the President of Mexico, was captured the following day and held as a prisoner of war. Three weeks later, he signed the peace treaty that dictated that the Mexican army leave the region, paving the way for the Republic of Texas to become an independent country. These treaties did not specifically recognize Texas as a sovereign nation, but stipulated that Santa Anna was to lobby for such recognition in Mexico City. Sam Houston became a national celebrity, and the Texans' rallying cries from events of the war, \\"Remember the Alamo!\\" and \\"Remember Goliad!,\\" became etched into Texan history and legend.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nGeneral Antonio L܇pez de Santa Anna was a proponent of governmental federalism when he helped oust Mexican president Anastasio Bustamante in December 1832. Upon his election as president in April 1833,[3] Santa Anna switched his political ideology and began implementing centralist policies that increased the authoritarian powers of his office.[4] His abrogation of the Constitution of 1824, correlating with his abolishing local-level authority over Mexico's state of Coahuila y Tejas (Coahuila and Texas), became a flashpoint in the growing tensions between the central government and its Tejano and Anglo citizens in Texas. While in Mexico City awaiting a meeting with Santa Anna, Texian empresario Stephen F. Austin wrote to the Bxar ayuntamiento (city council) urging a break-away state. In response, the Mexican government kept him imprisoned for most of 1834.[5][6]\\r\\nColonel Juan Almonte was appointed Director of Colonization in Texas,[7] ostensibly to ease relations with the colonists and mitigate their anxieties about Austin's imprisonment.[8] He delivered promises of self-governance, and conveyed regrets that the Mexican congress deemed it constitutionally impossible for Texas to be a separate state. Behind the rhetoric, his covert mission was to identify the local power brokers, obstruct any plans for rebellion, and supply the Mexican government with data that would be of use in a military conflict. For nine months in 1834, under the guise of serving as a government liaison, Almonte traveled through Texas and compiled an all-encompassing intelligence report on the population and its environs, including an assessment of their resources and defense capabilities.[9]\\r\\nIn consolidating his power base, Santa Anna installed General Martn Perfecto de Cos as the governing military authority over Texas in 1835.[10][11] Cos established headquarters in San Antonio on October 9, triggering what became known as the Siege of Bxar.[12] After two months of trying to repel the Texian forces, Cos raised a white flag on December 9, and signed surrender terms two days later.[13] The surrender of Cos effectively removed the occupying Mexican army from Texas. Many believed the war was over, and volunteers began returning home.[14]\\r\\nIn compliance with orders from Santa Anna, Mexico's Minister of War Jos Mara Tornel issued his December 30 \\"Circular No. 5\\", often referred to as the Tornel Decree, aimed at dealing with United States intervention in the uprising in Texas. It declared that foreigners who entered Mexico for the purpose of joining the rebellion were to be treated as \\"pirates\\", to be put to death if captured. In adding \\"since they are not subjects of any nation at war with the republic nor do they militate under any recognized flag,\\" Tornel avoided declaring war on the United States.[15][16]\\r\\nThe Mexican Army of Operations numbered 6,019 soldiers[17] and was spread out over 300 miles (480?km) on its march to Bxar. General Joaqun Ramrez y Sesma was put in command of the Vanguard of the Advance that crossed into Texas.[18] Santa Anna and his aide-de-camp Almonte[19] forded the Rio Grande at Guerrero, Coahuila on February 16, 1836,[20] with General Jos de Urrea and 500 more troops following the next day at Matamoros.[21] Bxar was captured on February 23 and when the assault commenced, attempts at negotiation for surrender were initiated from inside the fortress. Travis sent Albert Martin to request a meeting with Almonte, who replied that he did not have the authority to speak for Santa Anna.[22] Bowie dispatched Green B. Jameson with a letter, translated into Spanish by Juan Segun, requesting a meeting with Santa Anna, who immediately refused. Santa Anna did, however, extend an offer of amnesty to Tejanos inside the fortress. Alamo non-combatant survivor Enrique Esparza said that most Tejanos left when Bowie advised them to take the offer.[23]\\r\\nCos, in violation of his surrender terms, forded into Texas at Guerrero on February 26 to join with the main army at Bxar.[24] Urrea proceeded to secure the Gulf Coast, and was victorious in two skirmishes with Texian detachments serving under Fannin at Goliad. On February 27 a foraging detachment under Frank W. Johnson at San Patricio was attacked by Urrea. Sixteen were killed, and 21 taken prisoner, but Johnson and 4 others escaped.[25][26] Urrea sent a company to Agua Dulce searching for James Grant and Plcido Benavides who were leading a company of Anglos and Tejanos towards an invasion of Matamoros. The Mexicans set a trap, killing Grant and most of the company. Benavides and 4 others escaped, and 6 were taken prisoner.[27][28]\\r\\nThe Convention of 1836 met at Washington-on-the-Brazos on March 1.[29] The following day, Sam Houston's 42nd birthday, the 59 delegates signed the Texas Declaration of Independence, and chose an ad interim government.[29][30] When news of the declaration reached Goliad, Benavides informed Fannin that in spite of his opposition to Santa Anna, he was still loyal to Mexico and did not wish to help Texas break away. Fannin discharged him from his duties and sent him home.[31] On March 4 Houston's military authority was expanded to include \\"the land forces of the Texian army both Regular, Volunteer, and Militia.\\"[32]\\r\\nAt 5 a.m. on March 6, the Mexican troops launched their final assault on the Alamo. The guns fell silent 90 minutes later; the Alamo had fallen.[33] Survivors Susannah Dickinson, her daughter Angelina, Travis' slave Joe, and Almonte's cook Ben were spared by Santa Anna and sent to Gonzales, where Texian volunteers had been assembling.[34]\\r\\nThe same day that Mexican troops departed Bxar, Houston arrived in Gonzales and informed the 374 volunteers (some without weapons) gathered there that Texas was now an independent republic.[35] Just after 11 p.m. on March 13, Susanna Dickinson and Joe brought news that the Alamo garrison had been defeated and the Mexican army was marching towards Texian settlements. A hastily convened council of war voted to evacuate the area and retreat. The evacuation commenced at midnight and happened so quickly that many Texian scouts were unaware the army had moved on. Everything that could not be carried was burned, and the army's only two cannons were thrown into the Guadalupe River.[36] When Ramrez y Sesma reached Gonzales the morning of March 14, he found the buildings still smoldering.[37]\\r\\nMost citizens fled on foot, many carrying their small children. A cavalry company led by Segun and Salvador Flores were assigned as rear guard to evacuate the more isolated ranches and protect the civilians from attacks by Mexican troops or Indians.[38] The further the army retreated, the more civilians joined the flight.[39] For both armies and the civilians, the pace was slow; torrential rains had flooded the rivers and turned the roads into mud pits.[40]\\r\\nAs news of the Alamo's fall spread, volunteer ranks swelled, reaching about 1,400 men on March 19.[40] Houston learned of Fannin's defeat on March 20 and realized his army was the last hope for an independent Texas. Concerned that his ill-trained and ill-disciplined force would be good for only one battle, and aware that his men could easily be outflanked by Urrea's forces, Houston continued to avoid engagement, to the immense displeasure of his troops.[41] By March 28, the Texian army had retreated 120 miles (190?km) across the Navidad and Colorado Rivers.[42] Many troops deserted; those who remained grumbled that their commander was a coward.[41]\\r\\nOn March 31, Houston paused his men at Groce's Landing, roughly 15 miles (24?km) north of San Felipe.[Note 1] Two companies that refused to retreat further than San Felipe were assigned to guard the crossings on the Brazos River.[43] For the next two weeks, the Texians rested, recovered from illness, and, for the first time, began practicing military drills. While there, two cannons, known as the Twin Sisters, arrived from Cincinnati, Ohio.[44] Interim Secretary of War Thomas Rusk joined the camp, with orders from President David G. Burnet to replace Houston if he refused to fight. Houston quickly persuaded Rusk that his plans were sound.[44] Secretary of State Samuel P. Carson advised Houston to continue retreating all the way to the Sabine River, where more volunteers would likely flock from the United States and allow the army to counterattack.[Note 2][45] Unhappy with everyone involved, Burnet wrote to Houston: \\"The enemy are laughing you to scorn. You must fight them. You must retreat no further. The country expects you to fight. The salvation of the country depends on your doing so.\\"[44] Complaints within the camp became so strong that Houston posted notices that anyone attempting to usurp his position would be court-martialed and shot.[46]\\r\\nSanta Anna and a smaller force had remained in Bxar. After receiving word that the acting president, Miguel Barragn, had died, Santa Anna seriously considered returning to Mexico City to solidify his position. Fear that Urrea's victories would position him as a political rival convinced Santa Anna to remain in Texas to personally oversee the final phase of the campaign.[47] He left on March 29 to join Ramrez y Sesma, leaving only a small force to hold Bxar.[48] At dawn on April 7, their combined force marched into San Felipe and captured a Texian soldier, who informed Santa Anna that the Texians planned to retreat further if the Mexican army crossed the Brazos River.[49] Unable to cross the Brazos due to the small company of Texians barricaded at the river crossing, on April 14 a frustrated Santa Anna led a force of about 700 troops to capture the interim Texas government.[50][51] Government officials fled mere hours before Mexican troops arrived in Harrisburgh (now Harrisburg, Houston) and Santa Anna sent Colonel Juan Almonte with 50 cavalry to intercept them in New Washington. Almonte arrived just as Burnet shoved off in a rowboat, bound for Galveston Island. Although the boat was still within range of their weapons, Almonte ordered his men to hold their fire so as not to endanger Burnet's family.[52]\\r\\nAt this point, Santa Anna believed the rebellion was in its final death throes. The Texian government had been forced off the mainland, with no way to communicate with its army, which had shown no interest in fighting. He determined to block the Texian army's retreat and put a decisive end to the war.[52] Almonte's scouts incorrectly reported that Houston's army was going to Lynchburg Crossing, on Buffalo Bayou, in preparation for joining the government in Galveston, so Santa Anna ordered Harrisburg burned and pressed on towards Lynchburg.[52]\\r\\nThe Texian army had resumed their march eastward. On April 16, they came to a crossroads; one road led north towards Nacogdoches, the other went to Harrisburg. Without orders from Houston and with no discussion amongst themselves, the troops in the lead took the road to Harrisburg. They arrived on April 18, not long after the Mexican army's departure.[53] That same day, Deaf Smith and Henry Karnes captured a Mexican courier carrying intelligence on the locations and future plans of all of the Mexican troops in Texas. Realizing that Santa Anna had only a small force and was not far away, Houston gave a rousing speech to his men, exhorting them to \\"Remember the Alamo\\" and \\"Remember Goliad\\". His army then raced towards Lynchburg.[54] Out of concern that his men might not differentiate between Mexican soldiers and the Tejanos in Segun's company, Houston originally ordered Segun and his men to remain in Harrisburg to guard those who were too ill to travel quickly. After loud protests from Segun and Antonio Menchaca, the order was rescinded, provided the Tejanos wear a piece of cardboard in their hats to identify them as Texian soldiers.[55]\\r\\nThe area along Buffalo Bayou had many thick oak groves, separated by marshes. This type of terrain was familiar to the Texians and quite alien to the Mexican soldiers.[56] Houston's army, comprising 900 men, reached Lynch's Ferry mid-morning on April 20; Santa Anna's 700-man force arrived a few hours later. The Texians made camp in a wooded area along the bank of Buffalo Bayou; while the location provided good cover and helped hide their full strength, it also left the Texians no room for retreat.[57][58] Over the protests of several of his officers, Santa Anna chose to make camp in a vulnerable location, a plain near the San Jacinto River, bordered by woods on one side, marsh and lake on another.[56][59] The two camps were approximately 500 yards (460?m) apart, separated by a grassy area with a slight rise in the middle.[60] Colonel Pedro Delgado later wrote that \\"the camping ground of His Excellency's selection was in all respects, against military rules. Any youngster would have done better.\\"[61]\\r\\nOver the next several hours, two brief skirmishes occurred. Texians won the first, forcing a small group of dragoons and the Mexican artillery to withdraw.[56][62] Mexican dragoons then forced the Texian cavalry to withdraw. In the melee, Rusk, on foot to reload his rifle, was almost captured by Mexican soldiers, but was rescued by newly arrived Texian volunteer Mirabeau B. Lamar.[62] Over Houston's objections, many infantrymen rushed onto the field. As the Texian cavalry fell back, Lamar remained behind to rescue another Texian who had been thrown from his horse; Mexican officers \\"reportedly applauded\\" his bravery.[63] Houston was irate that the infantry had disobeyed his orders and given Santa Anna a better estimate of their strength; the men were equally upset that Houston had not allowed a full battle.[64]\\r\\nThroughout the night, Mexican troops worked to fortify their camp, creating breastworks out of everything they could find, including saddles and brush.[65] At 9 a.m. on April 21, Cos arrived with 540 reinforcements, bringing the Mexican force to 1,200 men, which outnumbered the Texians.[66] Cos' men were raw recruits rather than experienced soldiers, and they had marched steadily for more than 24 hours, with no rest and no food.[67] As the morning wore on with no Texian attack, Mexican officers lowered their guard. By afternoon, Santa Anna had given permission for Cos' men to sleep; his own tired troops also took advantage of the time to rest, eat, and bathe.[68]\\r\\nNot long after the Mexican reinforcements arrived, Houston ordered Smith to destroy Vince's Bridge, 5?mi (8?km) away, to slow down any further Mexican reinforcements.[69] At 4 p.m. the Texians began creeping quietly through the tall grass, pulling the cannon behind them.[70] The Texian cannon fired at 4:30, beginning the battle of San Jacinto.[71] After a single volley, Texians broke ranks and swarmed over the Mexican breastworks to engage in hand-to-hand combat. Mexican soldiers were taken by surprise. Santa Anna, Castrill܇n, and Almonte yelled often conflicting orders, attempting to organize their men into some form of defense.[72] Within 18 minutes, Mexican soldiers abandoned their campsite and fled for their lives.[73] The killing lasted for hours.[74]\\r\\nMany Mexican soldiers retreated through the marsh to Peggy Lake.[Note 3] Texian riflemen stationed themselves on the banks and shot at anything that moved. Many Texian officers, including Houston and Rusk, attempted to stop the slaughter, but they were unable to gain control of the men. Texians continued to chant \\"Remember the Alamo! Remember Goliad!\\" while frightened Mexican infantry yelled \\"Me no Alamo!\\" and begged for mercy to no avail.[75] In what historian Davis called \\"one of the most one-sided victories in history\\",[76] 650 Mexican soldiers were killed and 300 captured.[77] Eleven Texians died, with 30 others, including Houston, wounded.[78]\\r\\nAlthough Santa Anna's troops had been thoroughly vanquished, they did not represent the bulk of the Mexican army in Texas. An additional 4,000 troops remained under the commands of Urrea and General Vicente Filisola.[79] Texians had won the battle due to mistakes made by Santa Anna, and Houston was well aware that his troops would have little hope of repeating their victory against Urrea or Filisola.[80] As darkness fell, a large group of prisoners was led into camp. Houston initially mistook the group for Mexican reinforcements and shouted out that all was lost.[81]\\r\\nSanta Anna had escaped towards Vince's Bridge.[82] Finding the bridge destroyed, he hid in the marsh and was captured the following day.[77] He was brought before Houston, who had been shot in the ankle and badly wounded.[79][Note 4] Texian soldiers gathered around, calling for the Mexican general's immediate execution. Bargaining for his life, Santa Anna suggested that he order the remaining Mexican troops to stay away.[83] In a letter to Filisola, who was now the senior Mexican official in Texas, Santa Anna wrote that \\"yesterday evening [we] had an unfortunate encounter\\" and ordered his troops to retreat to Bxar and await further instructions.[80]\\r\\nUrrea urged Filisola to continue the campaign. He was confident that he could challenge the Texian troops. According to Hardin, \\"Santa Anna had presented Mexico with one military disaster; Filisola did not wish to risk another.\\"[84] Spring rains had ruined the ammunition and rendered the roads nearly impassable, with troops sinking to their knees in mud. The Mexican troops were soon out of food and began to fall ill from dysentery and other diseases.[85] Their supply lines had broken down, leaving no hope of further reinforcements.[86] Filisola later wrote that \\"Had the enemy met us under these cruel circumstances, on the only road that was left, no alternative remained but to die or surrender at discretion\\".[85]\\r\\nFor several weeks after San Jacinto, Santa Anna continued to negotiate with Houston, Rusk, and then Burnet.[87] Santa Anna suggested two treaties, a public version of promises made between the two countries, and a private version that included Santa Anna's personal agreements. The Treaties of Velasco required that all Mexican troops withdraw south of the Rio Grande and that all private property be respected and restored. Prisoners of war would be released unharmed and Santa Anna would be given immediate passage to Veracruz. He secretly promised to persuade the Mexican Congress to acknowledge the Republic of Texas and to recognize the Rio Grande as the border between the two countries.[88]\\r\\nWhen Urrea began marching south in mid-May, many families from San Patricio who had supported the Mexican army went with him. When Texian troops arrived in early June, they found only 20 families remaining. The area around San Patricio and Refugio suffered a \\"noticeable depopulation\\" in the Republic of Texas years.[89] Although the treaty had specified that Urrea and Filisola would return any slaves their armies had sheltered, Urrea refused to comply. Many former slaves followed the army to Mexico, where they could be free.[90] By late May, the Mexican troops had crossed the Nueces.[85] Filisola fully expected that the defeat was temporary and that a second campaign would be launched to retake Texas.[86]\\r\\nWhen Mexican authorities received word of Santa Anna's defeat at San Jacinto, flags across the country were lowered to half staff and draped in mourning.[92] Denouncing any agreements signed by a prisoner, Mexican authorities refused to recognize the Republic of Texas.[93] Filisola was derided for leading the retreat and quickly replaced by Urrea. Within months, Urrea gathered 6,000 troops in Matamoros, poised to reconquer Texas. His army was redirected to address continued federalist rebellions in other regions.[94]\\r\\nMost in Texas assumed the Mexican army would return quickly.[95] So many American volunteers flocked to the Texian army in the months after the victory at San Jacinto that the Texian government was unable to maintain an accurate list of enlistments.[96] Out of caution, Bxar remained under martial law throughout 1836. Rusk ordered that all Tejanos in the area between the Guadalupe and Nueces Rivers migrate either to east Texas or to Mexico.[95] Some residents who refused to comply were forcibly removed. New Anglo settlers moved in and used threats and legal maneuvering to take over the land once owned by Tejanos.[93][97] Over the next several years, hundreds of Tejano families resettled in Mexico.[93]\\r\\nFor years, Mexican authorities used the reconquering of Texas as an excuse for implementing new taxes and making the army the budgetary priority of the impoverished nation.[98] Only sporadic skirmishes resulted.[99] Larger expeditions were postponed as military funding was consistently diverted to other rebellions, out of fear that those regions would ally with Texas and further fragment the country.[98][Note 5] The northern Mexican states, the focus of the Matamoros Expedition, briefly launched an independent Republic of the Rio Grande in 1839.[100] The same year, the Mexican Congress considered a law to declare it treasonous to speak positively of Texas.[101] In June 1843, leaders of the two nations declared an armistice.[102]\\r\\nOn June 1, Santa Anna boarded a ship to travel back to Mexico. For the next two days, crowds of soldiers, many of whom had arrived that week from the United States, gathered to demand his execution. Lamar, by now promoted to Secretary of War, gave a speech insisting that \\"Mobs must not intimidate the government. We want no French Revolution in Texas!\\", but on June 4 soldiers seized Santa Anna and put him under military arrest.[103] Burnet called for elections to ratify the constitution and elect a Congress,[104] the sixth set of leaders for Texas in a twelve-month period.[105] Voters overwhelmingly chose Houston the first president, ratified the constitution drawn up by the Convention of 1836, and approved a resolution to request annexation to the United States.[106] Houston issued an executive order sending Santa Anna to Washington, D.C., and from there he was soon sent home.[107]\\r\\nDuring his absence, Santa Anna had been deposed. Upon his arrival, the Mexican press wasted no time in attacking him for his cruelty towards those executed at Goliad. In May 1837, Santa Anna requested an inquiry into the event.[108] The judge determined the inquiry was only for fact-finding and took no action; press attacks in both Mexico and the United States continued.[109] Santa Anna was disgraced until the following year, when he became a hero of the Pastry War.[110]\\r\\nAlthough the Texian interim governments had vowed to eventually compensate citizens for goods that were impressed during the war efforts, for the most part livestock and horses were not returned.[111] Veterans were guaranteed land bounties; in 1879, surviving Texian veterans who served more than three months from October 1, 1835, through January 1, 1837, were guaranteed an additional 1,280 acres (520?ha) in public lands.[112] Over 1.3 million acres (559 thousand ha) of land were granted; some of this was in Greer County, which was later determined to be part of Oklahoma.[113]\\r\\nWhen Republic President Burnet unknowingly escaped death at New Washington, Almonte had found him by following courier Mike McCormick,[114] whose widowed mother Peggy was the owner of the land on which the battle was subsequently fought.[58] Although she sought financial restitution from the Republic of Texas for loss of livestock and other goods during the battle, McCormick died without recompense. Decades after her death, the state of Texas purchased part of her acreage for a commemoration site.[115]\\r\\nThe San Jacinto Battleground State Historic Site was designated a National Historic Landmark in 1960.[116] The site includes the 570?ft (170?m)[117] San Jacinto Monument, which was erected by the Public Works Administration. Authorized April 21, 1936, and dedicated April 21, 1939, the monument cost $1.5 million (equivalent to $26.39 million in 2015).[118][119] The site hosts a San Jacinto Day festival and battle re-enactment each year in April.[120]\\r\\nBoth the Texas Navy and the United States Navy have commissioned ships named after the Battle of San Jacinto: the Texan schooner San Jacinto and three ships named USS?San Jacinto. There has been one civilian passenger ship named SS San Jacinto.\\r\\nWhen the veteran battleship USS Texas was decommissioned in 1948 and made into a museum ship, it was decided to give her a permanent new anchorage near the San Jacinto Monument, at San Jacinto State Park. Her arrival from Baltimore, where she was decommissioned, was timed for April 21, 1948 ÿ the anniversary of the Battle of San Jacinto.","input":"Who fought in the battle of san jacinto?"},{"output":"Wesley Edens","context":"The Milwaukee Bucks are an American professional basketball team based in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. The Bucks compete in the National Basketball Association (NBA) as a member club of the league's Eastern Conference Central Division.

Former U.S. Senator Herb Kohl was the long-time owner of the team, but on April 16, 2014, a group led by billionaire hedge fund managers Wesley Edens and Marc Lasry agreed to purchase a majority interest in the team from Kohl, a sale which was approved by the owners of the NBA and its Board of Governors one month later on May 16.[10] The team is managed by Jon Horst, the team's former Director of Basketball Operations, who took over for John Hammond in May 2017.

The Bucks' record that year earned them a coin flip against their expansion cousins, the Phoenix Suns, to see who would get the first pick in the upcoming draft. It was a foregone conclusion that the first pick in the draft would be Lew Alcindor of UCLA. The Bucks won the coin flip, but had to win a bidding war with the upstart American Basketball Association (ABA) to secure him.[13]\\r\\nDespite the Bucks' stroke of fortune in landing Alcindor, no one expected what happened in 1969ÿ70. They finished with a 56ÿ26 record ÿ a nearly exact reversal of the previous year and good enough for the second-best record in the league, behind the New York Knicks. The 29-game improvement was the best in league history ÿ a record which would stand for 10 years until the Boston Celtics jumped from 29 wins in 1978ÿ79 to 61 in 1979ÿ80 (the difference again being a highly touted rookie, Larry Bird). The Bucks defeated the Philadelphia 76ers in five games in the Eastern semifinals, only to be dispatched in five by the Knicks in the Eastern finals. Alcindor was a runaway selection for NBA Rookie of the Year.\\r\\nThe following season, the Bucks got an unexpected gift when they acquired Oscar Robertson, known as the \\"Big O\\", in a trade with the Cincinnati Royals. Subsequently, in only their third season, the Bucks finished 66ÿ16 ÿ the second-most wins in NBA history at the time, and still the most in franchise history. During the regular season, the Bucks recorded a then-NBA record 20-game win streak. They then steamrolled through the playoffs with a dominating 12ÿ2 record, winning the NBA Championship on April 30, 1971, by sweeping the Baltimore Bullets in four games. By winning it all in only their third season, the Bucks became the fastest expansion team in the history of North American sports to win a championship. It remains, as of 2017, the only title in team history.\\r\\nThe Bucks remained a powerhouse for the first half of the 1970s. In 1972, they recorded their third consecutive 60-win season, the first NBA team to do so. During the year, Lew Alcindor converted to Islam and changed his name to Kareem Abdul-Jabbar. Milwaukee beat the Warriors in the playoffs 4ÿ1, but lost the conference finals to Los Angeles 4ÿ2. Injuries resulted in an early 1973 playoff exit, but the Bucks were back in the 1974 NBA Finals against the Boston Celtics. In game six of the series, Abdul-Jabbar made his famous \\"sky hook\\" shot to end a classic double-overtime victory for the Bucks. The Bucks lost game seven and the series to the Celtics; as of 2016, they had not returned to the NBA Finals. As the 1974ÿ1975 season began, Abdul-Jabbar suffered a hand injury and the team got off to a 3ÿ13 start. After his return, other injuries befell Milwaukee, sending them to the bottom of their division with 38 wins and 44 losses. When the season ended, Abdul-Jabbar made the stunning announcement that he no longer wished to play for the Bucks, stating that he needed the big city, requesting a trade to either Los Angeles or New York. The front office was unable to convince him otherwise and on June 16, 1975, the Bucks pulled a mega-trade by sending Abdul-Jabbar to the Lakers for Elmore Smith, Junior Bridgeman, Brian Winters and David Meyers. The trade triggered a series of events that led to a change in the team's ownership. Jim Fitzgerald, the Bucks largest stockholder, opposed the trade and wanted to sell his stock. Although Fitzgerald was the largest stockholder, he did not own enough stock to control the team.\\r\\nAfter the deal, the Bucks had several seasons in transition, but most of these players would go on to help the team. After being sold to cable television executive Jim Fitzgerald and several partners in 1976, the Bucks would enter into another era of greatness. It began with Don Nelson who became head coach in November 1976 after Larry Costello abruptly resigned. In the 1977 draft, the Bucks had three first round picks and drafted Kent Benson, Marques Johnson and Ernie Grunfeld. Johnson would become a staple in the Bucks for years to come. Rookie Sidney Moncrief made his debut in 1979. Don Nelson went on to win two NBA Coach of the Year awards with the Bucks, both during seasons where the team won division titles, in 1983 and 1985.\\r\\nOn October 18, 1977, Abdul-Jabbar, playing with the Lakers, punched Benson during a game. Abdul-Jabbar broke his hand in the process.[14] Benson had been aggressive under the boards and Abdul-Jabbar, a martial arts blackbelt, snapped. Abdul-Jabbar was fined $5,000 by the NBA and missed the next 20 games. Meanwhile, Benson never played as aggressively again and the Bucks traded him to the Detroit Pistons in 1980 for veteran center Bob Lanier to fill in the hole left by the departure of Abdul-Jabbar. They then won the Midwest Division title in 1980. After losing to Seattle in the semi-finals, the Bucks moved to the Eastern Conference's Central Division.\\r\\nThere, they would win six straight division titles and have .500 seasons for the next 11 years. Within those years, the Bucks became perennial Eastern Conference contenders, primarily due to the strong play of Moncrief, Paul Pressey, Craig Hodges and the arrival of Terry Cummings, Ricky Pierce and Jack Sikma from trades with the Los Angeles Clippers and Seattle SuperSonics respectively. However, the Bucks were unable to make it to the NBA Finals again, being eliminated by either the Celtics or the Sixers each time.\\r\\nFor much of the 1970s the Bucks colors were forest green, deep red and white. In 1978, they added various shades of green to the uniforms, and in 1985, they eliminated red from the team colors.\\r\\nNoteworthy for the 1980s Bucks is that in 1983 they became the first, and until 2003, only team in NBA history to sweep the Boston Celtics in a best-of-seven playoff series, being the first team to meet and defeat Michael Jordan in a playoff series (during Jordan's rookie year), and hosting Julius Erving's final NBA game in the 1987 NBA Playoffs, which would see the Bucks advancing with a game five first-round playoff victory.\\r\\nIn 1985, Fitzgerald and his partners (one of which was Stuart Shadel) decided to sell the Bucks. He was having health problems and some of his investors wanted to get out. The Bucks were playing in the smallest arena in the NBA and the city did not want to build a new one. Milwaukee businessman and U.S. Senator Herb Kohl bought the Bucks after fears that out-of-town investors could buy the team and move it out of Milwaukee. Before the transaction was complete, Jane and Lloyd Pettit of Milwaukee announced they were donating a new arena called the Bradley Center. In 2003, after considering selling the team, Kohl announced that he had decided against selling the Bucks to Michael Jordan and would \\"continue to own them, improve them and commit them to remaining in Wisconsin\\".\\r\\nOn May 21, 2012, it was announced that the naming rights of the Bradley Center had been sold to the BMO Harris Bank division of Bank of Montreal, which had purchased the assets of M&I Bank a year earlier, and after the heirs to the Bradley fortune gave their approval, the arena was renamed as the \\"BMO Harris Bradley Center\\".[15]\\r\\nFor most of the 1990s, the Bucks franchise was mired in mediocrity under coaches Frank Hamblen, Mike Dunleavy, and Chris Ford. From 1991 through 1998, the Bucks suffered seven straight seasons of losing records. During this period, the Bucks drafted Glenn Robinson with the first overall pick in the 1994 NBA Draft and in 1996 acquired rookie Ray Allen in a draft day trade with the Minnesota Timberwolves. Both players would have prominent roles in the Bucks resurgence during the late 1990s.\\r\\nAfter the franchise's 25th anniversary in 1993, the Bucks overhauled their logo and uniforms. The colors were green, purple, and silver. The old logo, which featured a cartoonish deer, was replaced in favor of a more realistic one. The primary color scheme was altered as well, when red was supplanted by purple. Purple road uniforms replaced the former green away uniforms.\\r\\nIn 1997, the Bucks sent all-star forward Vin Baker in a three-team trade to the Seattle SuperSonics, and they would acquire Cleveland Cavaliers guard Terrell Brandon and forward Tyrone Hill. They also traded their 10th overall pick Danny Fortson, guard Johnny Newman, and center Joe Wolf to the Denver Nuggets for center Ervin Johnson. The 1997ÿ98 Bucks finished their season with a 36-46 record, yet failing to make the playoffs for the seventh consecutive time.\\r\\nAfter a decade of dwelling near the bottom of the NBA's standings, the Bucks looked to add credibility to their basketball operations. In 1998, the team hired veteran coach George Karl, who had reached the NBA Finals with the Seattle SuperSonics. Under the leadership of Karl and general manager Ernie Grunfeld, and with the steady addition of talent such as Tim Thomas and Sam Cassell, the Bucks developed into an elite team in the Eastern Conference. The nucleus of the \\"big three\\"consisting of Ray Allen, Cassell, and Robinsonalong with Karl, created a successful renaissance era in Milwaukee. The team reached its zenith in 2000ÿ2001, winning 52 games and the Central Division title. The Bucks reached the 2001 Eastern Conference finals, which they lost in seven games to the 76ers.\\r\\nAfter coming close to an NBA Finals appearance in 2001, the Bucks sought to make key off-season player additions to put the team in the NBA Finals. Behind the strong encouragement of George Karl, the Bucks acquired forward Anthony Mason at the beginning of the 2001ÿ02 season. On paper, this move made the Bucks the team to beat in the East. However, Mason battled with his weight and had a tough time finding his role.[16] The Bucks, who at the season's midway point were the fourth seed in the Eastern Conference, began to free-fall. The collapse culminated with a loss to the Detroit Pistons on the final night of the season, which eliminated the Bucks from the playoffs and gave the division to the Pistons. The fallout created tension between the team's players and coach, resulting in a trade of Glenn Robinson to Atlanta (for Toni Kuko? and a 2003 first-round draft pick, used to select T. J. Ford).\\r\\nDuring the 2002ÿ03 season, the Bucks traded Ray Allen and backup Ronald \\"Flip\\" Murray to the Seattle SuperSonics for Gary Payton and Desmond Mason. The trade allowed emerging star Michael Redd to see increased playing time, and with Payton in the backcourt, they finished the season with a 42ÿ40 record. The Bucks made the playoffs, but lost in the first round to the New Jersey Nets in six games. That offseason, team leaders Sam Cassell and Ervin Johnson were traded to Minnesota (for Joe Smith). Payton left via free agency, after playing only 28 games for the Bucks. Coach Karl's tenure also ended after the season. Within a one-year period, the team had lost the coach and players most responsible for the team's success during that era.\\r\\nUnder the direction of new general manager Larry Harris, the Bucks struggled with inconsistency and injury for the next six years. During that period, they reached the playoffs twice, first under coach Terry Porter in 2004 and then under Terry Stotts in 2006. In both instances, they were defeated by the Detroit Pistons in five games. During that period, Michael Redd blossomed into an all-star and a perimeter shooting threat, becoming the new \\"face of the franchise\\".[17] The Bucks received the first pick in the 2005 NBA draft, and used it to select center Andrew Bogut. Bogut struggled with both inconsistency and injuries in his first four years in Milwaukee, but over time became a key contributor to the Bucks.\\r\\nIn 2006, the team finished 40ÿ42, last in their division, 24 games behind Detroit, but still made the playoffs in a season where every team in their division did. They were paired as the eighth seed versus the 64ÿ18 conference-leading Pistons. They won game three at home, but lost the other four in a 4ÿ1 series loss.\\r\\nAlso in March, the Bucks announced that they would not renew general manager Larry Harris's contract, which was to expire in June. In April, the Bucks hired John Hammond, formerly vice-president of basketball operations for the Pistons, as their new GM,[18] giving the Milwaukee team a fresh director recently associated with success.\\r\\nAlso in April, the Bucks announced that Larry Krystkowiak, the third and final head coach hired by Larry Harris, had been relieved of his duties. Scott Skiles, formerly of the Chicago Bulls and Phoenix Suns, became head coach.\\r\\nOn June 26, 2008, the Bucks acquired Richard Jefferson from the New Jersey Nets in a trade for 2007 first-round draft pick Yi Jianlian and Bobby Simmons.[19] Later that day, the Bucks selected West Virginia's Joe Alexander with the eighth pick of the NBA draft. Alexander was the first Taiwanese-born player in the NBA.\\r\\nIn the 2009 NBA draft, the Milwaukee Bucks selected point guard Brandon Jennings, who had not gone to college but played in Italy the previous year. Midway through the season, Bucks GM John Hammond traded Hakim Warrick to Chicago, and acquired John Salmons. In a Bucks uniform, Salmons averaged a team-leading 19.9 points per game. The play of Jennings, along with the improvement of Andrew Bogut, the improved Ersan ?lyasova, and the Salmons trade, catapulted the team to be a playoff contender. At the beginning of the season, the Bucks had low playoffs expectations; they had not been in four years.[20] In October, the Bucks quickly fell behind the Cleveland Cavaliers in the Central Division, but Milwaukee ultimately clinched a playoff berth on April 6, 2010, with a road win over the Chicago Bulls. It was during that time that the phrase \\"Fear the Deer\\" started, most likely by an ESPN commentator, and adopted on message boards and within Andrew Bogut's Squad 6.[21] The slogan rang well with Bucks fans, who started bringing signs with the phrase to games. The slogan became the team's battle cry in the NBA playoffs. The Bucks finished the regular season with a record of 46ÿ36. The Bucks clinched the sixth seed and were eliminated in a seven-game series against the Atlanta Hawks. It was the farthest Milwaukee had gotten in the post-season since 2001. The Bucks short playoff run was also in part due to Bogut suffering a broken arm after making an awkward fall after a dunk in a late-season game, thus ending his season. In the 2010ÿ11 season, the Bucks finished ninth in the Eastern Conference, just out of reach of the playoffs.[22]\\r\\nWith Bogut sidelined for the rest of the season and Stephen Jackson and head coach Scott Skiles not seeing eye-to-eye, the Bucks decided to trade both players. On March 13, 2012, 48 hours before the trade deadline, the Bucks traded Bogut and Jackson to the Golden State Warriors in exchange for Monta Ellis, Ekpe Udoh, and Kwame Brown.\\r\\nBefore the 2012 NBA draft, the Bucks sent a first-round pick, Shaun Livingston, Jon Brockman, and Jon Leuer to the Houston Rockets for a first-round pick and Samuel Dalembert. In the 2012 draft, the Bucks selected Doron Lamb and John Henson.\\r\\nAfter 32 games of the 2012ÿ13 season, the Bucks fired Skiles, their coach since 2008. Jim Boylan was announced as the interim head coach and led the Bucks to a 22ÿ28 record to finish the season at 38ÿ44. The Bucks qualified as the eighth seed, where they were quickly swept 4ÿ0 by the reigning, and eventual, champions, the Miami Heat.\\r\\nJim Boylan was relieved of his coaching duties and ex-Atlanta Hawks coach Larry Drew was hired. On June 27, 2013, the Bucks chose Greek forward Giannis Antetokounmpo with the 15th overall pick of the 2013 NBA draft. They also traded the 43rd pick, Ricky Ledo, for Nate Wolters. In the 2013 free agency campaign, they brought in O. J. Mayo, Carlos Delfino, Zaza Pachulia, and Gary Neal as well as seeing Monta Ellis opt out of the final year of his contract. The Bucks also agreed to sign-and-trade Brandon Jennings to the Detroit Pistons in exchange for Brandon Knight, Khris Middleton, and Viacheslav Kravtsov. The Bucks later extended their contract with Larry Sanders with a four-year, $44 million contract and traded Ish Smith and Kravtsov to the Phoenix Suns for Caron Butler. By the start of the 2013ÿ14 season, the Bucks only had four players on their roster from the previous season. The season itself was a struggle, as the Bucks finished with the worst record in the league at 15ÿ67, the worst record in team history.\\r\\nOn April 16, 2014, long-time Bucks owner Herb Kohl agreed to sell a majority interest of the team to New York-based billionaires Wesley Edens, and Marc Lasry for $550 million, but Kohl still retains a significant minority interest in the team. The new owners are expected to keep the team in Milwaukee, and are also expected to contribute $100 million toward building a new arena for the franchise.[23] Approval from the NBA Board of Governors came on May 15, a month later.[10][24]\\r\\nOn June 26, 2014, the Bucks chose Duke forward Jabari Parker with the second overall pick of the 2014 NBA draft.\\r\\nOn July 1, 2014, the Milwaukee Bucks secured the coaching rights for Jason Kidd from the Brooklyn Nets in exchange for two second-round draft picks in the 2015 NBA draft, and the 2019 NBA draft.[25] With the acquisition of Kidd, the team fired coach Larry Drew.\\r\\nWith the many changes to the Bucks in ownership, coaches, and acquiring new young players to rebuild the team, the Bucks' new slogan for the 2014ÿ15 season became \\"Own The Future\\".\\r\\nThe Bucks' overall play vastly improved, and on December 26, the Bucks beat the Atlanta Hawks 107-77 for their 15th win, matching their win total of the previous season just 30 games in. The Bucks then went on a stretch from January 24 to February 20, where they went 10-2. The Bucks beat the Sacramento Kings on February 11 for their 30th win of the year, and also became the first ever NBA team to double their win total from the previous season before the All-Star Break.\\r\\nOff the court, the Bucks made several changes to their roster, releasing Larry Sanders after several off-court incidents that led to multiple suspensions. On February 19, in the final minutes of the trade deadline, the Bucks became part of a 3-way deal with the Philadelphia 76ers and the Phoenix Suns, sending Brandon Knight, who was in the final year of his contract, to the Suns, and receiving reigning Rookie of the Year Michael Carter-Williams, Miles Plumlee, and Tyler Ennis. The Bucks also lost expected superstar Jabari Parker to a season-ending knee injury on December 15 in a game against the Phoenix Suns.\\r\\nOn January 25, the NBA passed the 'Jay-Z Rule', prohibiting ownership groups from consisting of more than 25 individuals, and also mandating that no ownership interest in a team be smaller than 1%. Both Lasry and Edens had sold chunks of Bucks ownership to family, friends, and prominent members of the Milwaukee community.[26]\\r\\nThe Bucks finished the 2014ÿ15 season with a 41-41 record. Their 26-game improvement from the previous season was the second highest in franchise history. The Bucks made the 2015 NBA Playoffs as the 6th seed in the Eastern Conference, where they faced the Chicago Bulls in the first round, losing in six games.\\r\\nOn July 6, 2015, Bucks president Peter Feigin stated if public funding for a new arena falls through, the NBA may buy the team and move it to Las Vegas or Seattle. The latter city could be the frontrunner, as the city had a proven fanbase with the Seattle SuperSonics (a name the Bucks would more than likely pick up with a move to the city), and the NBA only needs a $25 million profit to buy the Bucks and move them to one of the two aforementioned cities. Current Bucks owners Wes Edens, Marc Lasry and Jamie Dinan combined with Herb Kohl to pledge $250 million for the new arena and are seeking a match from the public. Of those funds, $93 million would come from the Wisconsin Center District in the form of new debt on Milwaukee citizens. The district wouldn't commence repaying the bonds until 13 years thereafter.[27]\\r\\nOn July 9, 2015, the Bucks confirmed their signing of center Greg Monroe to a three-year, $50 million contract. The Bucks also announced the club's re-signing of Khris Middleton to a five-year, $70 million contract.\\r\\nOn July 15, 2015, the future for the Bucks in Milwaukee was solidified after the Wisconsin state senate voted 21-10 in favor of a proposal to use public money to help finance a new arena. The Bucks' new arena would replace the BMO Harris Bradley Center, which as of 2016 is the third-oldest arena currently used by an NBA team, behind Oracle Arena, and Madison Square Garden. The arena opened in 1988, and has been used by the Bucks for 27 consecutive seasons.[28][29]\\r\\nOn the court, the young roster of the Bucks went through a step backward, to a 33ÿ49 record in the 2015ÿ16 season, though Giannis Antetokounmpo had an encouraging stretch in the final half of the season, accumulating 5 triple-doubles.\\r\\nOn June 18, 2016, ground was broken for the Bucks' new arena, which is expected to be completed by the autumn of 2018.[30]\\r\\nOn September 19, 2016, the Bucks and Giannis Antetokounmpo agreed to a 4-year, $100 million contract extension. In addition, the team would add new young improvements to the roster in drafting Thon Maker and Malcolm Brogdon, and made trades to bring in Tony Snell and Michael Beasley. When the 2016ÿ17 season began, the Bucks were without Khris Middleton, who suffered a torn hamstring during a practice. Even so, the Bucks remained competitive, staying around .500 for the first half of the season, with both Antetokounmpo and Jabari Parker leading the offense. While Parker missed making the All-Star team, Giannis was voted in as a starter, becoming the first Bucks All-Star since Michael Redd in 2004. In January, the Bucks slumped, though fans anticipated a turnaround with Middleton's return on February 8 against the Miami Heat. In the same game, however, Parker tore his ACL for the second time in 3 seasons, ending his season. Even so, Middleton's return still sparked a turnaround in March. During the month, the Bucks went 14-4, putting the team back in the thick of the playoff race. On April 8, 2017, the Bucks beat the Philadelphia 76ers 90-82, clinching the Bucks a playoff spot. On April 10, the Bucks beat the Charlotte Hornets 89-79 to clinch only the third winning season for the Bucks since 2001. The team finished the 2016-17 regular season with a 42-40 record. Giannis Antetokounmpo made history, becoming only the 5th player in NBA history to lead his team in all five major statistical categories, and was the first in NBA history to finish in the top-20 in the league in each category. The Bucks were the #6 seed in the Eastern Conference playoffs, and lost in the opening round to the Toronto Raptors, 4-2.\\r\\nOn May 23, 2017, Bucks general manager John Hammond stepped down to become general manager with the Orlando Magic.\\r\\nAs of July 16, 2015, the following individuals and groups are among the owners of the Bucks:\\r\\nFirst draft choice\\r\\nFirst game\\r\\nFirst win\\r\\nFirst NBA championship\\r\\nFirst Bradley Center game\\r\\nFirst Bradley Center win\\r\\nThe Bucks' official mascot is Bango. The word \\"Bango\\" was originally coined by Eddie Doucette, the longtime play-by-play announcer for the Bucks. Doucette used the word whenever a Bucks player connected on a long-range basket. It was often used for sharpshooter Jon McGlocklin. When it came time for the Bucks to choose a name for their new mascot, the name \\"Bango\\" won the contest.[citation needed]\\r\\nBango has been the Bucks' official mascot since on October 18, 1977, which was Milwaukee's home opener of the 1977ÿ78 NBA season. In addition to the date being Bango's home debut, the game itself pitted Milwaukee against former Bucks center Kareem Abdul-Jabbar and his Los Angeles Lakers at the Milwaukee Arena. Bango has worked hard to become popular with Bucks fans throughout the state of Wisconsin over the years, appearing at schools, parades, and festivals as a goodwill ambassador for the team. His high-flying acrobatic layups, daring rebounds, and other entertaining antics still play an important role in energizing Bucks fans at the BMO Harris Bradley Center.[citation needed] Since 2001, Bango has also made perennial appearances at the NBA All-Star Game.\\r\\nAt the 2009 All-Star Weekend in Phoenix, Arizona, Bango suffered an injury during a mascot-participative skit. While standing on one basket's rim, Bango's right leg slipped through the hoop, and he fell on the rim. He then slipped further and fell through the basket entirely. Bango tore his ACL due to the fall and was unable to perform for the remainder of the 2008ÿ09 season, periodically making appearances at games in a wheelchair. A video of Bango's injury at the 2009 Mascot Challenge was uploaded onto YouTube shortly after the incident occurred.[39]\\r\\nDuring game four of the 2009ÿ10 first-round playoff series between the Milwaukee Bucks and the Atlanta Hawks, Bango successfully performed a back-flip dunk from the top of a 16-foot ladder, a feat similar to the Seattle SuperSonics' mascot Squatch's feat during a March 19, 2008, game between the SuperSonics and the Phoenix Suns.\\r\\nThe Bucks' first uniforms were based on the Boston Celtics' uniforms[citation needed], featuring block lettering and numbers. The hunter green road uniforms featured the city name and numbers in white with red trim. The home white uniforms featured the team nickname and numbers in hunter green with red trim; the color scheme was reversed for the 1971ÿ72 NBA season. In the 1973ÿ74 NBA season, the road uniforms featured a script \\"Milwaukee\\" and numbers in red with white trim; two seasons later they used the same design for their home uniforms. In the 1976ÿ77 NBA season the road uniforms reverted to the block \\"Milwaukee\\" lettering while retaining the script home uniform. The shorts featured the alternate Bucks logo on the left leg.\\r\\nCoinciding with the debut of Robert Indiana's iconic MECCA court in the 1977ÿ78 NBA season, the Bucks redesigned their uniforms. It now featured side stripes of kelly, lime and hunter green (a.k.a. the \\"Irish Rainbows\\"), inspired by the \\"Rainbow Guts\\" uniforms of the Houston Astros[citation needed]. Both the hunter green and white uniforms featured the streamlined \\"Bucks\\" lettering from the team logo and block lettering. They removed the color red prior to the 1985ÿ86 NBA season.\\r\\nThe Bucks changed their logo and uniforms for the 1993ÿ94 NBA season. The purple road uniforms featured a modernized \\"Bucks\\" lettering from their logo and numbers in silver with hunter green trim, with green side stripes. The home white uniforms featured the same lettering and numbers in hunter green with silver trim, with purple side stripes. The stripes were extended to the jersey in the 2001ÿ02 NBA season.\\r\\nIn the 1995ÿ96 NBA season the Bucks unveiled a hunter green alternate uniform. The script \\"Bucks\\" lettering was in white fading to silver and purple and numbers were in white with green and purple trim. The uniform featured the graphic deer logo on the right side. They were retired after the 1998ÿ99 NBA season. It would be resurrected for the 2012ÿ13 NBA season during Hardwood Classics Nights, to updated uniform standards.\\r\\nThe uniforms were changed again for the 2006ÿ07 NBA season. The new home uniform was white with hunter green stripes on the sides. Inside each green stripe is a thinner red stripe that splits into two stripes near the shoulders. The numbers are green with a red outline. Milwaukee had two road uniforms as part of this set. The primary one was hunter green and a similar design to the home uniform with white numbers with a silver highlight and red outline. Both uniforms jerseys said \\"BUCKS\\" across the chest in beveled block letters, the 'B' and 'S' slightly larger than the rest of the letters. A secondary road uniform was introduced in the 2008ÿ09 NBA season. Consisting of red jersey and shorts, it was made to resemble the 1968ÿ73 uniforms. It says \\"Milwaukee\\" in white and silver writing, along with the numbers. The uniform set was tweaked for the 2014ÿ15 NBA season, with the addition of a gold tab commemorating their 1971 championship and the move of the NBA logo to the back. The 'Bucks' lettering was tweaked to make all the letters the same height.\\r\\nDuring the 2014ÿ15 season, hints were made by the Bucks that their logo and uniforms were going to be redesigned. For one home game, it was anticipated that new uniforms were going to be revealed with hunter orange replacing red as the secondary color. It turned out to be an April Fool's joke, though the Bucks did announce that a new logo and colors would be revealed on April 13, 2015.[5]\\r\\nOn April 13, 2015, the Milwaukee Bucks unveiled new primary and secondary logos, as well as a new color scheme. The new branding will take effect beginning with the 2015ÿ16 NBA season. The Bucks' new official colors are Good Land Green (a reference to \\"Milwaukee\\" being supposedly based off an Algonquian word meaning \\"The Good Land\\"), Cream City Cream (based on Milwaukee's old nickname of \\"the Cream City\\", which came from the cream-colored bricks that were used for constructing many of Milwaukee's buildings back during the late 19th century), Great Lakes Blue, Black, and White.[5]\\r\\nOn June 6, 2015, the Milwaukee Bucks unveiled their new home and road uniforms, to be worn beginning with the 2015ÿ16 NBA season. The new uniforms remained white at home and green on the road, but red is now replaced by cream. The 'Milwaukee' city name also returned to the road uniforms for the first time since 1977. In addition, the jerseys feature a unique color block pattern on the sides, titled the \\"Cream City Rainbow\\". The pattern consists of the team's new colors of green, cream, royal blue and black, which the Bucks described as an homage to the \\"Irish Rainbow\\" design of the 1980s. Blue was also included inside the collar, representing Milwaukee and Wisconsin's \\"blue collar\\" citizens, while the inscription \\"Fear the Deer\\" was written on the bottom left upside down. The back collar features a small gold tab above the NBA logo, commemorating the Bucks' 1971 NBA championship.[40][41]\\r\\nOn October 3, 2015, the Milwaukee Bucks unveiled a new black alternate uniform. In conjunction with the alternate uniform unveiling, the team also unveiled a new alternate court design, a first in NBA history. The team plans to wear the black alternate uniform and play on the alternate court design for four (4) home games during the 2015ÿ16 season.[42]\\r\\nRoster ? Transactions\\r\\nLast transaction: 2017ÿ10ÿ20\\r\\nThe Bucks hold the draft rights to the following unsigned draft picks who have been playing outside the NBA. A drafted player, either an international draftee or a college draftee who isn't signed by the team that drafted him, is allowed to sign with any non-NBA team. In this case, the team retains the player's draft rights in the NBA until one year after the player's contract with the non-NBA team ends.[43] This list includes draft rights that were acquired from trades with other teams.\\r\\nNotes:\\r\\nSince the 2007ÿ08 season, all Bucks games not nationally broadcast have aired exclusively on regional cable television over Fox Sports Wisconsin, with selected games also airing on the FS Wisconsin Plus feed, in case of Milwaukee Brewers conflicts. Bucks games produced by Fox Sports are also carried on the Fox Sports Go application within the team's broadcast territory.\\r\\nPrior to the Fox Sports Wisconsin exclusivity, the Bucks split their television broadcasts between FS Wisconsin (which through various incarnations have televised Bucks games since 1996) and WCGV (Channel 24) from 1999 to 2007, and prior that, WVTV (Channel 18) was the over-the-air partner from 1994 to 1999. WCGV also previously carried Bucks games from 1988 to 1994, and WVTV again, this time from 1976 to 1988; these two stations are currently owned by the Sinclair Broadcast Group. The telecasts during each station's tenures as the over-the-air TV home of the Bucks consisted of almost exclusively road games; very few Bucks home games on either station were televised through the years, as the Bucks were one of the last NBA teams to regularly televise home games. The Bucks, along with their respective TV partners, co-produced and distributed the over-the-air telecasts to stations throughout Wisconsin.\\r\\nIn the franchise's early years, Bucks games were carried on then-ABC affiliate WITI (Channel 6), from 1968 to 1971, and on then-CBS affiliate WISN-TV (Channel 12) from 1971 to 1976; both respective runs also coincided with NBA coverage already carried by their networks at the time--ABC (1965-1973) and CBS (1973-1990). The two stations swapped networks in March 1977, with WISN since remaining with ABC, and WITI switching from CBS to Fox in December 1994.\\r\\nSince 1986, Jim Paschke has been the team's television play-by-play announcer, with former Buck Jon McGlocklin providing color commentary for the team since 1976. Since the 2015ÿ16 season, veteran announcer Gus Johnson and former Buck Marques Johnson (no relation) have called selected games alongside Paschke and McGlocklin on a rotating basis. Veteran sportscaster Eddie Doucette served as the team's original play-by-play voice, working in that capacity from 1968 to 1984; he also called selected Bucks games on WITI, WISN-TV, and during most of WVTV's first tenure with the Bucks. He and McGlocklin also co-founded the Midwest Athletes Against Childhood Cancer (MACC) Fund in 1976, which raises money to help cancer research.\\r\\nOn the radio side the team has been carried by WTMJ (620) and throughout the state on the Bucks Radio Network (which is sponsored by Marshfield Clinic) for most of the team's history. Ted Davis announces, with former WTMJ-TV sports director Dennis Krause providing color and serving as solo announcer on nights where Davis has a broadcasting assignment elsewhere.[44]","input":"Who are the owners of the milwaukee bucks?"},{"output":"average lifespan at 9.4 years","context":"The Chesapeake Bay Retriever is a large-sized breed of dog belonging to the Retriever, Gundog, and Sporting breed groups.[1][2][3] Members of the breed may also be referred to as a Chessie, CBR, or Chesapeake. The breed was developed in the United States Chesapeake Bay area during the 19th century. Historically used by area market hunters to retrieve waterfowl, it is primarily a family pet and hunting companion. They are often known for their love of water and their ability to hunt. It is a medium to large sized dog similar in appearance to the Labrador Retriever. The Chesapeake have a wavy coat, rather than the Labrador's smooth coat. They are described as having a bright and happy disposition, courage, willingness to work, alertness, intelligence, and love of water as some of their characteristics.[4]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nDistinctive features include eyes that are very clear, of yellowish or amber hue, hindquarters as high or a trifle higher than the shoulders, and a double-coat that tends to wave on shoulders, neck, back, and loins. The waterproof coat feels slightly oily and is often associated with a slight musky odor. Three basic colors are generally seen in the breed: brown, which includes all shades from a light to a deep dark brown; sedge, which varies from a reddish yellow through a bright red to chestnut shades; and deadgrass in all its shades, varying from a faded tan to a dull straw color. The breed standard states that white may also appear but it must be limited to the breast, belly, toes, or back of the feet. The head is round and broad with a medium stop and muzzle. The lips are thin, and the ears are small and of medium leather. The forelegs should be straight with good bone. The hindquarters are especially strong and the toes webbed since excellent swimming ability is important for the Chesapeake. This breed is also known for its large and powerful chest, used to break apart ice when diving into cold water while duck hunting.\\r\\nThe coat of the Chesapeake Bay Retriever is given the most consideration of any trait listed on the Positive Scale of Points in the Breed Standard. However the AKC Standard also reads \\"The question of coat and general type of balance takes precedence over any scoring table which could be drawn up. The Chesapeake should be well proportioned, an animal with a good coat and well balanced in other points being preferable to one excelling in some but weak in others.\\" The hair on the face and legs should be very short and straight with a tendency to wave, never curl, on the shoulders, neck, back, and loins only and nowhere over 1.5?inches long. Moderate feathering on the rear of the hindquarters and tail is permissible although not longer than 1.75?inches long.[5] The texture of the thick double-coat is important in protecting the dog from cold water and icy conditions. The oil in the harsh outer coat and woolly undercoat resists water, keeping the dog dry and warm. Maintenance of the coat is minimal and mainly consists of brushing with a short-tooth brush once a week. It is difficult to get a Chesapeake Bay Retriever thoroughly wet, but they should be bathed every 3ÿ4 months using a suitably mild shampoo, then dried thoroughly. Brushing or bathing more often can ruin the texture since it strips the protective oil from the coat and may even remove the undercoat.[6][7][8] The color of the coat must be similar to the working surroundings. Any color of brown, sedge or deadgrass is acceptable and one color is not preferred over another. The American Chesapeake Club includes a discussion on color:\\r\\nA white spot on the breast (not extending above the sternum), belly, toes or back of the feet is permissible, but the smaller the spot the better. White beyond these areas and black anywhere on the body is not allowed in the breed standard.[5]\\r\\nThe quintessential Chesapeake Bay Retriever has a bright and happy disposition, intelligence, quiet good sense, and an affectionate protective nature. Some can be quite vocal when happy, and some will 'smile' by baring their front teeth in a peculiar grin - this is not a threat but a sign of joy or submissiveness.\\r\\nChesapeake Bay Retrievers can make excellent family dogs when socialized properly. Some Chesapeakes are assertive and willful and may be reserved with strangers, but others are passive and outgoing with people.\\r\\nThe Chesapeake Bay Retriever is a versatile breed competing in field trials, hunt tests, conformation, obedience, agility and tracking, yet remains true to its roots as a hunting dog of great stamina and ability. The Chesapeake Bay Retriever is an intelligent breed and learns at a high speed. Historically considered stubborn and difficult to train, many trainers thought this breed required more physical discipline than other retriever breeds.[10] Some trainers now recommend that the Chesapeake Bay Retriever owner use consistent, daily obedience training with play time before and after to keep the dog wanting to work with little or no physical discipline required.[11]\\r\\nThe breed is subject to a number of hereditary diseases. These include, but are not limited to:\\r\\nA UK Kennel Club survey puts the median lifespan of the breed at 10.75 years (average 9.85).[17] A US breed club survey puts the average lifespan at 9.4 years. 1 in 4 lived to 13 years or more while 1 in 5 don't live past 5 years.[18]\\r\\nChesapeake Bay Retrievers trace their history to two pups who were rescued from a foundering ship in Maryland in 1807. The male \\"Sailor\\" and female \\"Canton\\" were described as Newfoundland dogs, but were more accurately Lesser Newfoundland or St. John's water dogs. These two lived in different parts of the bay area and there is no record of a litter being produced together. They were bred with area dogs, with more consideration given to ability than to breed, to create the beginnings of the Chesapeake Bay Retriever breed. There are few records of the breeds of these early dogs, but spaniels and hounds were included. Dogs from both Chesapeake Bay shores were recognized as one of three types of Chesapeake Bay Ducking Dog in 1877. In 1918 a single type, called the Chesapeake Bay Retriever, was recognized by the American Kennel Club, and there have been few changes to the breed standard since then.\\r\\nGeorge Law, who rescued the pups, wrote this account in 1845 which appears on the website of the American Chesapeake Bay Retriever Club:\\r\\nMercer is said to have described Sailor:\\r\\nIn 1964, it was declared the official dog of Maryland.[20]\\r\\nIt is the mascot of the University of Maryland, Baltimore County.\\r\\nMembers of the breed were owned by General George Armstrong Custer, President Theodore Roosevelt, and actors Paul Walker and Tom Felton.[21]","input":"What is the life expectancy of a chesapeake bay retriever?"},{"output":"October 1, 2017","context":"On the night of October 1, 2017, a gunman opened fire on a crowd of concertgoers at the Route 91 Harvest music festival on the Las Vegas Strip in Nevada, leaving 58 people dead and 546 injured. Between 10:05 and 10:15?p.m. PDT, 64-year-old Stephen Paddock of Mesquite, Nevada, fired hundreds of rifle rounds from his suite on the 32nd floor of the nearby Mandalay Bay hotel. About an hour after Paddock fired his last shot into the crowd, he was found dead in his room from a self-inflicted gunshot wound. His motive is unknown.\\r\\nThe incident is the deadliest mass shooting committed by an individual in the United States. The shooting reignited the debate about gun laws in the U.S. with attention focused on bump fire stocks, which Paddock used to allow his semi-automatic rifles to fire at a rate similar to that of a fully automatic weapon.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Las Vegas Strip is a stretch of Las Vegas Boulevard in Clark County, Nevada, immediately south of the City of Las Vegas. It is known for its concentration of casinos and resort hotels, including the 43-story Mandalay Bay southeast of its intersection with Mandalay Bay Road, in the unincorporated town of Paradise.[2]\\r\\nDiagonally across the intersection to the northeast is Las Vegas Village, a 15-acre (6.1-hectare) lot used for outdoor performances.[2][3] The annual Route 91 Harvest country music festival was held there since 2014; 2017's festival ran from September 29 to October 1.[3][a]\\r\\nPaddock may have researched the possibility of attacking other outdoor concerts. He reserved a room that overlooked the August 2017 Lollapalooza festival in Chicago, but did not use it.\\r\\nHe appears to have stayed in Downtown Las Vegas from September 14 until the night of the shooting. Between the 22nd and 24th, he rented rooms at The Ogden, which overlooked the open-air Life Is Beautiful festival.[4]\\r\\nOn September 25, 2017, Paddock arrived at the Mandalay Bay hotel and booked into a comped room. Three days later, he moved to the 32nd floor suite, which overlooked Las Vegas Village.[5][b] He placed a \\"Do not disturb\\" sign on the door, organized the room, and stockpiled an arsenal of weapons.[6][7] Clark County Sheriff Joe Lombardo said Paddock carried more than ten suitcases into his hotel suite during his preparation for the shooting.[6]\\r\\nTwenty-three firearms, a large quantity of ammunition, and numerous high-capacity magazines capable of holding up to 100 rounds apiece were found in the suite.[8][9] The firearms included four DDM4 rifles, three FN-15 rifles, one AR-15 rifle with forward front grip, one .308-caliber AR-10 rifle, one Kalashnikov, and at least one made-to-order LMT rifle and one handgun.[10][11][12] Two of the rifles were equipped with telescopic sights and mounted on bipods.[13][14] Bump fire stocks were found on twelve of the guns,[10] which allowed for recoil to actuate their triggers at a rate of 90 bullets in 10 seconds.[15] The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives determined that the firearms found in his hotel room, along with more guns found in his homes, were legal and had been legally purchased in the states of Nevada, California, Texas, and Utah.[16] In the month preceding the shooting, he had attempted to purchase a large quantity of tracer ammunition, but the gun dealer he approached did not have the item in stock.[17]\\r\\nInvestigators found hidden surveillance cameras that were placed inside and outside the hotel room, presumably so Paddock could monitor the arrival of others.[18] The cameras were not in record mode.[19] Police said a handwritten note found in the room indicated Paddock had been calculating the distance, wind, and trajectory from his 32nd floor hotel suite to the concertgoers he was targeting on the festival lot.[20][21]\\r\\nAt a press conference on October 4, Sheriff Lombardo stated there was evidencewhich he declined to discussthat Paddock intended to escape the scene, and that he may have had assistance from an accomplice.[22] Investigators searched Paddock's room and found a bulletproof vest and breathing apparatus, which were survival gear that Paddock never used.[23]\\r\\nDuring subsequent investigations, ammonium nitrate, which is often used in improvised explosive devices, was found in the trunk of his Hyundai Tucson SUV, along with 1,600 rounds of ammunition and 50 pounds (23?kg) of Tannerite, a binary explosive used to make explosive targets for gun ranges.[24][25] Undersheriff Kevin McMahill said that while Paddock had \\"nefarious intent\\" with the material, he did not appear to have assembled an explosive device.[17][26]\\r\\nThe mass shooting occurred between 10:05 and 10:15 p.m. PDT on October 1, 2017, which was the third and final night of the festival. When the shooting began, country music singer Jason Aldean was giving the closing performance before an audience of about 22,000.[27]\\r\\nShortly before 10?p.m., hotel security guard Jesus Campos was sent to the 32nd floor to investigate an open-door alert. He encountered a barricaded door that prevented him from immediately accessing the floor. After arriving on the floor, he heard drilling from Paddock's room and went to investigate. At approximately 10:05 he was hit in the right thigh by one of about 200 bullets which Paddock fired through his suite's door. After Campos was hit he immediately informed the hotel by radio and cellphone that he had been shot. At the same time, maintenance worker Stephen Schuck was on the same floor to check out a report about a jammed fire door. Campos, who was already injured, encountered Schuck and told him to take cover. Schuck contacted hotel dispatchers over his radio, informed them of the ongoing shooting, and told them to call the police.[28][29][30][31] Neither Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department nor MGM Resorts International, the Mandalay Bay's owner, have confirmed when information about the initial shooting was relayed to the police.[32][33][34][35]\\r\\nPaddock used a hammer to break two of his suite's windows and began shooting through them at 10:05?p.m., ultimately firing hundreds of rifle rounds[36][37] approximately 490 yards (450?m) into the festival audience.[38][39][40][c] Many people in the crowd initially mistook the gunfire for fireworks.[41] During the shooting, a security fence hindered concertgoers from fleeing the 15-acre concrete lot.[42] The gunfire continued, with some momentary pauses, over the span of ten minutes and ended by 10:15?p.m.[43][44]\\r\\nTwo of the bullets fired by Paddock struck a large aviation fuel tank at McCarran International Airport 2,000 feet (600?m) away. One of the bullets penetrated the tank, but the fuel did not ignite or explode, and was unlikely to have done so.[45]\\r\\nDuring the shooting, police officers were initially confused whether the shots were coming from the Mandalay Bay, the nearby Luxor hotel, or the festival grounds.[42] There were also multiple false reports of additional shooters at other hotels on the Strip.[46] Officers eventually spotted multiple flashes of gunfire in the middle of the Mandalay Bay, on the northern side, and responded to the hotel. At 10:12?p.m., two officers on the 31st floor reported the sounds of gunfire on the floor above them.[42] When officers arrived on the 32nd floor at 10:17?p.m. and encountered Campos a minute later, he directed them to Paddock's room and helped others evacuate. Campos was then directed to seek medical attention for himself.[29][31]\\r\\nBetween 10:26 and 10:30?p.m., an additional eight officers arrived at the 32nd floor. They could no longer hear gunfire and moved systematically down the hallway, searching and clearing each room, using a master key that was provided by Campos. At 10:55?p.m., the officers finished evacuating guests. At 11:20?p.m., police breached Paddock's room with explosives.[44][42][47] Paddock was found dead, having shot himself in the head before the police entered.[48][49] While entering the hotel suite, an officer accidentally fired off a round from his weapon, which hit no one.[50] At 11:27?p.m., officers announced over the police radio that one suspect was down.[44][51] Early on October 2, Sheriff Lombardo identified the suspect as Stephen Paddock.[52]\\r\\nThere have been several changes in the official account and timeline of Paddock's shooting of hotel security guard Campos. Police officials described these adjustments as \\"minute changes\\" that are common in complex investigations.[29]\\r\\nIn a first statement about the incident, police officials inaccurately reported that Campos arrived on the scene after Paddock began firing into the crowd. In a second statement, police officials reported, again inaccurately, that Campos was shot six minutes before Paddock began firing into the crowd. That report had been based on a 9:59?p.m. notation in a hotel security log, which in a third statement was determined to have been the time when Campos encountered the barricaded door.[28][30]\\r\\nSheriff Lombardo dismissed allegations that the changing timeline is the result of some kind of conspiracy between the police department, the FBI, and MGM Resorts International saying \\"Nobody is attempting to hide anything in reference to this investigation. The dynamics and the size of this investigation requires us to go through voluminous amounts of information in order to draw an accurate picture.\\"[28]\\r\\nFifty-eight people (excluding Paddock) died as a result of the shooting, most by gunshot wounds.[53][54][55] They included 36 women and 22 men.[53] The oldest was 67, the youngest 20.[56] Six were from Nevada, 35 from California, 13 from other states, and four from Canada.[57] An additional 546 people were injured.[34] In the aftermath, many victims were sent to area hospitals, which included University Medical Center of Southern Nevada, Sunrise Hospital & Medical Center, and at least one of the six hospitals of Valley Health System.[58][59][60]\\r\\nThe incident is the deadliest mass shooting committed by an individual in the United States, surpassing the death toll of the 2016 Orlando nightclub shooting, where 49 died, excluding the gunman.[53][61][62]\\r\\nStephen Craig Paddock (April 9, 1953?ÿ October 1, 2017)[63] was a former auditor and real estate businessman,[64] who had been living in a retirement community in Mesquite, Nevada.[65] Paddock was a high-stakes gambler who placed bets at a high enough level to earn valuable compsfree benefits such as rooms and meals. He was a familiar figure to casino hosts in Las Vegas, but was not well known among other high-stakes gamblers since he mostly played video poker.[66] He reportedly kept to himself and was a heavy drinker.[67] Police said he had made casino transactions in the tens of thousands of dollars prior to the shooting, but did not specify whether these transactions were losses or wins.[68] Sheriff Lombardo said Paddock had lost a significant amount of his wealth over the previous two years, which might have been a \\"determining factor\\" in the attack, but added that his motive may never truly be understood.[69]\\r\\nCourt records show Paddock married and divorced twice. He had no known children.[70] Paddock's father was Benjamin Hoskins Paddock, a bank robber who was on the FBI's most-wanted list between 1969 and 1977, and whose wanted poster stated he had been \\"diagnosed as psychopathic\\" and reportedly had \\"suicidal tendencies\\".[71]\\r\\nPolice believe Paddock acted alone and have not determined his motive, despite following more than a thousand leads.[49][17][72] His younger brother and others who were in close contact with him described him as having no apparent religious or political affiliation.[70] Police said they had no investigative information or criminal history indicating that he was dangerous. His only recorded interaction with law enforcement was a minor traffic citation years before the shooting, which he settled in court.[73][74]\\r\\nMuch of Las Vegas Boulevard was closed as police SWAT teams combed the venue and neighboring businesses. McCarran International Airport, adjacent to the shooting site, was shut down for several hours.[75] Approximately 300 people entered the airport property as they fled to safety from the shooting.[41] This prompted officials to shut down all four runways. More than 25 flights were rerouted to ensure that no aircraft would be hit by gunfire,[46] while other flights were canceled before airfield operations resumed at 12:40?a.m. on October 2.[76] At approximately 2:45?p.m. PDT on October 2, a state of emergency was declared in Clark County.[77][78]\\r\\nThe morning after the shooting, lines to donate blood in Las Vegas stretched for blocks. Wait times were as much as six hours or more.[79] Millions of dollars have also been raised to help victims and their families.[80]\\r\\nNevada Governor Brian Sandoval called the shooting \\"a tragic and heinous act of violence that has shaken the Nevada family\\".[81] Jason Aldean, who was performing when the shooting started, posted his condolences on Instagram and noted all of those working with him at the show had survived the attack.[82]\\r\\nAt a press conference, President Donald Trump described Paddock as \\"a very very sick individual\\", and \\"a demented man, [with] a lot of problems\\". He added, \\"the police department has done such an incredible job, and we'll be talking about gun laws as time goes by\\".[83][84] A White House official talking points memo, distributed to Trump allies, opposed tightening gun control since \\"new laws won't stop a mad man\\", but \\"will curtail the freedoms of law abiding citizens\\".[85] On October 2, Trump issued a proclamation to honor the victims and their families.[86][87] On October 4, Trump visited the shooting victims and first responders.[88] On October 7, Vice President Mike Pence participated in a unity prayer walk and ceremony in Las Vegas in honor of the dead.[89]\\r\\nThe terrorist group Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIS) claimed that Paddock was their \\"soldier\\", and that he had answered Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi's call to attack coalition countries,[90] but an FBI agent said they had found \\"no connection with an international terrorist group.\\"[91] ISIS provided no evidence for its claim, and terrorism experts noted that since Mosul liberation in October 2016, ISIS or Amaq News Agency has on at least two other occasions made false claims of responsibility for attacks with which they had no connection.[92][93][94]\\r\\nStock prices of firearms manufacturers rose the day after the shooting, as has happened after similar incidents. Investors expect gun sales will increase over concerns that such an event could lead to more stringent gun-control legislation and a rush of customers wishing to defend themselves against future attacks.[95][96]\\r\\nThe name \\"1 October\\" was declared the official title of the mass shooting for investigators, according to authorities with the Clark County Commissioner.[97] The future of the Las Vegas Village site remains undetermined.[98]\\r\\nThe shooting prompted support in the U.S. Congress for legislation that would ban bump fire stocks. The National Rifle Association (NRA) came out in favor of administrative bump fire stock regulations.[53] Many Congressional Democrats and some Republicans expressed their support of a prohibition of bump fire stocks.[99] Senator Dianne Feinstein introduced a senate bill, which gained 39 co-sponsors, all Democrats. In the House, two bipartisan bills have been introduced. As of November no Congressional action has been taken, because House leaders say the issue should be decided by the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms, which originally approved them.[100] On November 6, 2017, the state of Massachusetts banned the sale, possession, or use of the devices.[101]\\r\\nAfter the shooting, 18 Democratic U.S. Senators introduced a bill, the Keep Americans Safe Act, which would ban gun magazines that hold more than 10 rounds of ammunition.[102]\\r\\nIn the hours after the shooting, false information about the shooter's identity and motive went viral on social media. The fake news was circulated in Internet forums such as 4chan.[103] The website The Gateway Pundit misidentified the shooter when they named a different man and described him as a registered Democrat.[104] The 4chan thread on which this misinformation was based was briefly featured in the \\"Top Stories\\" section of a Google search for the man's name.[105] The fake news website YourNewsWire spread false information about a second gunman who was shooting from the fourth floor of the hotel.[106] Two of Facebook's top trending pages were items from Sputnik, a Russian government news agency.[107][108] These included one story that falsely claimed the FBI had linked the shooter to a terrorist group.[109] The stories were later removed with an apology.[110] Stories linking the shooter to Antifa have also been discredited.[111]\\r\\nGoogle and Facebook were criticized for displaying such false news stories in some of their search results.[110][112][113] The two technology companies were said to have failed in their responsibility of keeping false stories from reaching the public.[114] Facebook later said its algorithms were designed to detect and remove false stories, but failed to work adequately in this instance.[112]\\r\\nAn October 2017 article in The Wall Street Journal referenced the shooting and stated, \\"After searches on YouTube about the mass shooting this month in Las Vegas surfaced videos peddling conspiracy theories, the site said it was tweaking its search algorithm to promote more authoritative news sources.\\"[115] Survivors of the shooting have received death threats on social media, along with accusations of being paid actors.[116]","input":"When did the shootings happen in las vegas?"},{"output":"platypus","context":"Perry the Platypus (also known as Agent P or simply Perry) is an anthropomorphic platypus from the American animated series Phineas and Ferb. Perry was created by the series' co-founders, Dan Povenmire and Jeff \\"Swampy\\" Marsh. He first appeared along with the majority of the main cast in the pilot episode \\"Rollercoaster.\\" Perry is featured as the star of the B-plot for every episode of the series, alongside his nemesis Dr. Heinz Doofenshmirtz. A mostly silent character, his lone vocal characteristic (a rattling of Perry's beak) was provided by Dee Bradley Baker.\\r\\nPerry is the pet platypus of the Flynn-Fletcher family, and is perceived as mindless and domesticated. In secret, however, he lives a double life as a member of an all-animal espionage organization referred to as O.W.C.A. (Organization Without a Cool Acronym). Many secret entrances to his underground lair exist all around the house; such as the side of the house, most notably the tree that his owners sit under in the backyard, and several other everyday objects that seem to elude the family's attention. Perry also has entrances in Hawaii and North Dakota. He engages in daily battles with Dr. Heinz Doofenshmirtz, an evil scientist who desires to take over the Tri-state area with obscure contraptions that work perfectly according to his intended function but fail in his application of them every time.\\r\\nPerry was made a platypus because of the animal's striking appearance and the lack of public knowledge of the animal, which allowed the writers to make things up about the species. Critical reception for the character from both professionals and fans have been considerably positive. Merchandising of the character include plush toys, t-shirts, wooden toys, glasses, and coloring books, along with appearances in literature and a 2009 video game for the Nintendo DS.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nPerry is the docile pet platypus of the blended Flynn-Fletcher family, who adopted him because his unfocused gaze made it seem as if he were looking at both Phineas and Ferb at the same time, as shown in the 2011 movie, Phineas and Ferb the Movie: Across the 2nd Dimension.[1][2] Unbeknownst to them, Perry lives a double life as a crime-fighting spy working for the \\"Organization Without a Cool Acronym\\"/The OWCA, going by the codename \\"Agent P.\\"[3][4][5] He reports to his superior, Major Monogram, via telecast in his large, high-tech, underground hideout. Every day, he engages in battles with the evil scientist Dr. Heinz Doofenshmirtz, who tries using inventions to take over the tri-state area.[6][7] Perry is always able to foil Doofenshmirtz's plans and in doing so accidentally leads to the destruction of whatever form of contraption his owners, Phineas Flynn and Ferb Fletcher, are building in order to make summer better.[6] Phineas and Ferb are aware that something happens to get rid of their scheme for the day, but do not know that Perry is the cause behind it and are largely dismissive of it. Their sister, Candace, also does not know that Perry is behind the destruction and is driven to near insanity trying to figure it out.[8][9] Throughout the series, Perry is aware of Phineas and Ferb's inventions, but is largely uninterested in them, save whenever he notices that their latest invention may help him thwart Doofenshmirtz.\\r\\nPerry and Doofenshmirtz at first seem to loathe each other in the beginning of the series, and have been arch-nemeses since the day they met. However, they are often cordial and friendly towards one another and it is said by Doofenshmirtz that Perry is his best friend, and Perry will often act to save Doofenshmirtz's life when his plot inevitably blows up in his face. Doofenshmirtz also went out of his way in one episode to become closer to Perry after he is assigned to a new villain.[10] Habitually, their daily brawls involve Doofenshmirtz devising a scheme, which Perry goes to stop after being briefed by Major Monogram. He is trapped by Doofenshmirtz while trying to do so and is told of the doctor's scheme, usually pertaining to some backstory or pet peeve. He then escapes and the two fight, Perry coming out victorious with Doofenshmirtz yelling \\"Curse you, Perry the Platypus!\\".[11] The two rely on this daily structure, Doofenshmirtz even specifically mentioning it in \\"Journey to the Center of Candace\\" and in episodes such as \\"It's About Time!\\" in which Doofenshmirtz temporarily replaces Perry with secret agent Peter The Panda and they become depressed about not having each other to fight.[10] Perry realizes he misses Doof too. When Perry does not arrive on the scene of Doofenshmirtz's evil plan, the doctor hesitates to execute his plans and fears for where Perry has gone, though he notes that he \\"hopes something terrible has happened to him.\\".[12] Sometimes, they decided not to fight and have fun, as shown in \\"Happy New Year!\\" and \\"Candace Disconnected\\".[13] On other occasions, depending on whatever situation Doofenshmirtz is facing, Perry would often help Doofenshmirtz with his non-evil plans, such as helping him overcome evil scientist's block, helping him put on a birthday party for his 16-year-old daughter Vanessa, impressing a square dancing girl with programmable square dancing boots that Doofenshmritz created, working together to stop a raging platypus hunter from hunting them down, or helping him convince his rich ex-wife to help pay off his mortgage debt. Also, Perry tends to use Doofenshmirtz's inventions to erase evidence of whatever contraptions Phineas and Ferb had made, leaving Candace unable to bust them. Examples include when Perry asked to borrow Doofenshmirtz's robot Norm to pick up footage from the city surveillance cameras in order to preserve his job as an agent, as well as using Doofenshmirtz's Pick-Him-Up-inator to rescue a lost Candace and bring her home.\\r\\nIn Phineas and Ferb the Movie: Across the 2nd Dimension, an alternate reality (yet more evil and ruthless) version of Perry (known as Platyborg) appears. Platyborg would later return in the episode sequel, Tales from the Resistance: Back to the 2nd Dimension.\\r\\nWhile working on the animated television series Rocko's Modern Life, Phineas and Ferb co-founders Dan Povenmire and Jeff \\"Swampy\\" Marsh utilized several recurring elements in the episodes that they wrote. Among these were actions sequences and chase scenes.[14] Povenmire and Marsh wanted to reuse these elements in their series and chose Perry to execute it.[1] The pair gave him a consistent and continuous nemesis in the form of Doofenshmirtz as a means of allowing viewers to get to know him.[15]\\r\\nWhile choosing a species for Perry, Povenmire and Marsh wanted to keep in mind selecting one that was uncommon, an animal that kids could not \\"pick out at a pet store and beg [their parents] for.\\"[16] They chose a platypus because of the animal's obscure and striking appearance.[17] The animal was scarcely used in American animated programs, so the pair opined that Perry \\"would not have to compete with preconceived notions that viewers might bring to a more conventional critter.\\"[16] The blank storyboard they were given[16] allowed them to \\"make stuff up\\" since \\"no one knows very much about [them].\\"[1]\\r\\nPerry has a theme song tentatively entitled \\"Perry,\\" performed by Randy Crenshaw and Laura Dickinson, and written by Povenmire and Marsh, who write the majority of songs in the series.[14][18] The song, along with the number \\"Gitchee Gitchee Goo\\" from the episode \\"Flop Starz,\\" was the first musical composition Povenmire and Marsh pitched to The Walt Disney Company. They were nervous doing so, because, as Povenmire explained, \\"Disney has a big history of music -- what if they hate it?\\" Their reaction, however, was considerably positive and the pair was asked to write a song for each episode, which they vehemently agreed to.[14] The opening lyrics for the song describe Perry as a standard textbook definition of a platypus: \\"He's a semi-aquatic egg-laying mammal of action.\\"[19]\\r\\nLike the other characters of the series, Perry was structured in a simple style to allow young viewers to easily draw him.[20] In keeping with the show's general design scheme, Perry is constructed of geometric shapes in a style reminiscent of deceased Looney Tunes animator Tex Avery.[21] Povenmire uses different design styles for drawing Perry depending on how he is portrayed. When Perry is portrayed as a domesticated and mindless pet, Povenmire begins with a square shaped like a loaf of bread. He then draws his front legs and feet before drawing his bill, which is set at a certain angle. Povenmire then draws his eyeballs, which are never focused and look in opposing directions in a daze. He concludes the figure by adding his hind legs, tail, hair, and finally color.[22]\\r\\nWhen portrayed as a secret agent, Povenmire starts with a similar bread loaf square design, but draws it standing up vertically and places a fedora on the top of his head, which is combined with the square torso. In contrast to his mindless and wild-eyed expression as a pet, the secret agent version of Perry is detailed with eyes \\"full of steely blue resolve.\\" Povenmire proceeds by drawing his arms, with bare hands that are open and prepared for fighting or any danger. His legs are bent, as well prepared for an act of danger or action needed. Povenmire finishes the design by adding his beaver tail and color.[22]\\r\\nPerry's undercover identity as a pet leads to characters throughout the series to deem him as a \\"mindless domestic pet\\" that \\"doesn't do much\\".[23][24] This definition of the character led to Phineas and Ferb spearheading production of a new toyline based on Perry called \\"Perry the Inaction Figure,\\" whose tagline revolved around it not doing anything but allowing the customer to make it whatever they desire it to be.[23] In all actuality, Perry is a skilled fighter who is able to perform several implausible judo fighting moves and escapes.[25] He has access to several different types of technology and inventions provided to him by The O.W.C.A., including a hover craft dubbed the \\"Platypusmobile,\\"[26] a jet ski,[27] and a whistle set that allows him to summon different types of animals.[28] His favorite color is perry-winkle.\\r\\nAlthough his appearance as a domestic pet is mostly a cover, Perry has nonetheless expressed care and devotion for the Flynn-Fletcher family. In the episode \\"The Ballad of Bad Beard\\", Perry managed to drag Candace out of the Dark Cave before it caved in because of Dr. Doofenshmirthz's \\"self destruction button\\" that which Candace had accidentally pressed while under the orange moss hallucination, thinking it was a vending machine. He did this even though he knew that Candace saw that Perry was a secret agent talking to Agent E (Eagle) and to Major Monogram in a cracked egg. Candace thought she was just hallucinating because of the orange moss she accidentally touched earlier in the episode. Also, when an invention of Doofenshmirtz's in the episode \\"Journey to the Center of Candace\\" might cause severe harm to Phineas and Ferb, Perry thoroughly beats up Doofenshmirtz and quickly handcuffs him. He then ties him to a pipe and, instead of just leaving him like he usually does in the series, calls for special forces from the O.W.C.A. to come and arrest the doctor, though they never show up.[11] In \\"Oh, There You Are, Perry,\\" Doofenshmirtz is downgraded to a low threat level and Perry is reassigned to a new nemesis. This causes him to have to leave his home with the Flynn-Fletchers, which makes him sad and he does not enjoy his new villain. Phineas and Ferb are fearful about where Perry could have gone to and put up several flyers around town for people to find him. They decide to throw a concert on the roof of a building, singing a song about how much they love Perry and want him to come home. Concurrently, Perry is reassigned to Doofenshmirtz again and returns to the brothers once more.[29]\\r\\nThough Perry is anthropomorphic, he does not speak, only communicating through an \\"aggravated purr\\" type of noise made by flapping his bill.[16] This noise is provided by actor Dee Bradley Baker; to this day, Povenmire and Marsh do not understand how Baker produces the noise. Thomas Sangster, who plays Ferb, is notoriously good at making the noise and is considered second only to Baker himself.[30] When in his \\"Agent P\\" persona, Perry is almost completely silent.\\r\\nAs a character, Perry has been well received by both fans and critics. As Cynthia Littleton of Variety magazine wrote, \\"Perry the platypus is a breakout star from the Disney Channel toon 'Phineas and Ferb.'\\"[16] The New York Times writer Susan Stewart called him \\"intrepid.\\"[5] Jean Yoo, a press member for Disney Channel, said that Perry is \\"suave\\" and \\"makes James Bond look like a rank amateur.\\"[2] Aaron H. Bynum of Animator Insider opined that he is \\"indubitably confident.\\"[31] Carly H. of Scholastic, Inc. declared Perry \\"pretty darn awesome.\\"[4] Josh Jackson, editor of Paste, described Perry and Doofenshmirtz's relationship as \\"pitch-perfect.\\"[32]\\r\\nCertain reviewers have also commented negatively about Perry and his subplot, which Sherry Robinson of the St. Petersburg Times considers \\"pretty trippy.\\"[1] Kevin McDonough of Sun Coast Today described it as \\"complicated\\" and \\"loosely connected\\" to the rest of the series, writing that he is \\"not sure what this accomplishes except to add the noise of explosions to the already constant din of singing and screaming.\\"[33] Ed Liu of Toon Zone feels it is \\"truly puzzling what Perry the secret agent is doing in this show in the first place.\\" Liu considers his subplot to be a type of \\"throw everything against the wall and see what sticks\\" element and writes that \\"many of the earlier episodes of the show don't manage to do a very good job of balancing the subplot and the main one.\\"[34]\\r\\nPerry was nominated for a Nickelodeon Kids' Choice Award in 2014 under the category of Favorite Animated Animal Sidekick.[35]\\r\\nIn addition to the main television series, Perry has appeared in several pieces of Phineas and Ferb merchandise. To date, he has appeared in all Phineas and Ferb novelizations, published by Disney Press.[36][37][38][39] The character has been adapted into a 20?inch plush toy, released by The Walt Disney Company. The plush has a button on its hand that allows it to emit Perry's signature chattering noise.[40] Certain t-shirts based on the series released by both Disney and the online retail website Zazzle also display Perry and the phrase \\"Hey, where's Perry?\\" which most characters like Phineas, Isabella, Stacy, Irving, Ferb, and Lawrence utter when Perry goes to Major Monogram in his secret lair in almost every episode. There also is a T-Shirt with Perry's face.[41][42][43] Perry appears in the Nintendo DS video game based on the series, simply titled Phineas and Ferb, where a mini-game involves Perry stopping Doofenshmirtz's latest evil scheme.[44][45] As of 1 April 2014, Perry is also a playable character in the video game Disney Infinity.[46] He also appears in the Where's My Water?: Swampy's Underground Adventures episode \\"Double Trouble\\". He will also appear in Milo Murphy's Law in a crossover special.","input":"What animal is perry from phineas and ferb?"},{"output":"210 deaths per 100,000 live births in 2013","context":"Maternal death is defined by the World Health Organization (WHO) as \\"the death of a woman while pregnant or within 42 days of termination of pregnancy, irrespective of the duration and site of the pregnancy, from any cause related to or aggravated by the pregnancy or its management but not from accidental or incidental causes.\\"[1]\\r\\nThere are two performance indicators that are sometimes used interchangeably: maternal mortality ratio and maternal mortality rate, which confusingly both are abbreviated \\"MMR\\".[2] The world maternal mortality rate has declined 44% since 1990, but still every day 830 women die from pregnancy or childbirth related causes.[3] According to the United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA) this is equivalent to \\"about one woman every two minutes and for every woman who dies, 20 or 30 encounter complications with serious or long-lasting consequences. Most of these deaths and injuries are entirely preventable.\\"[3]\\r\\nUNFPA estimated that 289,000 women died of pregnancy or childbirth related causes in 2013.[3] These causes range from severe bleeding to obstructed labour,[4] all of which have highly effective interventions[citation needed]. As women have gained access to family planning and skilled birth attendance with backup emergency obstetric care, the global maternal mortality ratio has fallen from 380 maternal deaths per 100,000 live births in 1990 to 210 deaths per 100,000 live births in 2013, and many countries halved their maternal death rates in the last 10 years.[3]\\r\\nHigh rates of maternal mortality still exist in places, particularly in impoverished communities with over 85% living in Africa and Southern Asia.[3] The effect of a mother's death results in vulnerable families and their infants, if they survive childbirth, are more likely to die before reaching their second birthday.[3]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nFactors that increase maternal death can be direct or indirect. Generally, there is a distinction between a direct maternal death that is the result of a complication of the pregnancy, delivery, or management of the two, and an indirect maternal death,[5] that is a pregnancy-related death in a patient with a preexisting or newly developed health problem unrelated to pregnancy. Fatalities during but unrelated to a pregnancy are termed accidental, incidental, or nonobstetrical maternal deaths.\\r\\nThe most common causes are postpartum bleeding (15%), complications from unsafe abortion (15%), hypertensive disorders of pregnancy (10%), postpartum infections (8%), and obstructed labour (6%).[4] Other causes include blood clots (3%) and pre-existing conditions (28%).[6] Indirect causes are malaria, anemia/anaemia,[7] HIV/AIDS, and cardiovascular disease, all of which may complicate pregnancy or be aggravated by it[citation needed].\\r\\nSociodemographic factors such as age, access to resources and income level are significant indicators of maternal outcomes. Young mothers face higher risks of complications and death during pregnancy than older mothers,[8] especially adolescents aged 15 years or younger.[9] Adolescents have higher risks for postpartum hemorrhage, puerperal endometritis, operative vaginal delivery, episiotomy, low birth weight, preterm delivery, and small-for-gestational-age infants, all of which can lead to maternal death.[9] Structural support and family support influences maternal outcomes[citation needed]. Furthermore, social disadvantage and social isolation adversely affects maternal health which can lead to increases in maternal death.[10] Additionally, lack of access to skilled medical care during childbirth, the travel distance to the nearest clinic to receive proper care, number of prior births, barriers to accessing prenatal medical care and poor infrastructure all increase maternal deaths.[citation needed]\\r\\nUnsafe abortion is another major cause of maternal death. According to the World Health Organization, every eight minutes a woman dies from complications arising from unsafe abortions. Complications include hemorrhage, infection, sepsis and genital trauma.[11] Globally, preventable deaths from improperly performed procedures constitute 13% of maternal mortality, and 25% or more in some countries where maternal mortality from other causes is relatively low, making unsafe abortion the leading single cause of maternal mortality worldwide.[12]\\r\\nThe four measures of maternal death are the maternal mortality ratio (MMR), maternal mortality rate, lifetime risk of maternal death and proportion of maternal deaths among deaths of women of reproductive years (PM).\\r\\nMaternal mortality ratio (MMR): the ratio of the number of maternal deaths during a given time period per 100,000 live births during the same time-period.[13] The MMR is used as a measure of the quality of a health care system.\\r\\nMaternal mortality rate (MMRate): the number of maternal deaths in a population divided by the number of women of reproductive age, usually expressed per 1,000 women.[13]\\r\\nLifetime risk of maternal death: refers to the probability that a 15-year-old female will die eventually from a maternal cause if she experiences throughout her lifetime the risks of maternal death and the overall levels of fertility and mortality that are observed for a given population. The adult lifetime risk of maternal mortality can be derived using either the maternal mortality ratio (MMR), or the maternal mortality rate (MMRate). [13]\\r\\nProportion of maternal deaths among deaths of women of reproductive age (PM): the number of maternal deaths in a given time period divided by the total deaths among women aged 15ÿ49 years.[14]\\r\\nApproaches to measuring maternal mortality includes civil registration system, household surveys, census, reproductive age mortality studies (RAMOS) and verbal autopsies.[14]\\r\\nAccording to the 2010 United Nations Population Fund report, developing nations account for ninety-nine percent of maternal deaths with the majority of those deaths occurring in Sub-Saharan Africa and Southern Asia.[14] Globally, high and middle income countries experience lower maternal deaths than low income countries. The Human Development Index (HDI) accounts for between 82 and 85 percent of the maternal mortality rates among countries.[15] In most cases, high rates of maternal deaths occur in the same countries that have high rates of infant mortality. These trends are a reflection that higher income countries have stronger healthcare infrastructure, medical and healthcare personnel, use more advanced medical technologies and have fewer barriers to accessing care than low income countries. Therefore, in low income countries, the most common cause of maternal death is obstetrical hemorrhage, followed by hypertensive disorders of pregnancy, in contrast to high income countries, for which the most common cause is thromboembolism.[16]\\r\\nAt a country level, India (19% or 56,000) and Nigeria (14% or 40,000) accounted for roughly one third of the maternal deaths in 2010[citation needed]. Democratic Republic of the Congo, Pakistan, Sudan, Indonesia, Ethiopia, United Republic of Tanzania, Bangladesh and Afghanistan comprised between 3 and 5 percent of maternal deaths each.[14] These ten countries combined accounted for 60% of all the maternal deaths in 2010 according to the United Nations Population Fund report. Countries with the lowest maternal deaths were Estonia, Greece and Singapore.[17]\\r\\nIn the United States, the maternal death rate averaged 9.1 maternal deaths per 100,000 live births during the years 1979ÿ1986,[18] but then rose rapidly to 14 per 100,000 in 2000 and 17.8 per 100,000 in 2009.[19] In 2013 the rate was 18.5 deaths per 100,000 live births, with some 800 maternal deaths reported.[20]\\r\\nA lot of progress has been made since the United Nations made the reduction of maternal mortality part of the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). Bangladesh, for example, cut the number of deaths per live births by almost two thirds from 1990 to 2015. However, the MDG was to reduce it by 75%. According to government data, the figure for 2015 was 181 maternal deaths per 100,000 births. The MDG mark was 143 per 100,000.[21] A further reduction of maternal mortality is now part of the Agenda 2030 for sustainable development.The target of the third Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) is to reduce the global maternal mortality rate (MMR) to less than 70 per 100,000 live births by 2030.\\r\\nThere are significant maternal mortality intracountry variations, especially in nations with large equality gaps in income and education and high healthcare disparities. Women living in rural areas experience higher maternal mortality than women living in urban and sub-urban centers because[22] those living in wealthier households, having higher education, or living in urban areas, have higher use of healthcare services than their poorer, less-educated, or rural counterparts.[23] There are also racial and ethnic disparities in maternal health outcomes which increases maternal mortality in marginalized groups.[24]\\r\\nThe death rate for women giving birth plummeted in the twentieth century. The historical level of maternal deaths is probably around 1 in 100 births.[25] Mortality rates reached very high levels in maternity institutions in the 1800s, sometimes climbing to 40 percent of patients (see Historical mortality rates of puerperal fever). At the beginning of the 1900s, maternal death rates were around 1 in 100 for live births. Currently, there are an estimated 275,000 maternal deaths each year.[26] Public health, technological and policy approaches are steps that can be taken to drastically reduce the global maternal death burden.\\r\\nFour elements are essential to maternal death prevention, according to UNFPA.[3] First, prenatal care. It is recommended that expectant mothers receive at least four antenatal visits to check and monitor the health of mother and fetus. Second, skilled birth attendance with emergency backup such as doctors, nurses and midwives who have the skills to manage normal deliveries and recognize the onset of complications. Third, emergency obstetric care to address the major causes of maternal death which are hemorrhage, sepsis, unsafe abortion, hypertensive disorders and obstructed labour. Lastly, postnatal care which is the six weeks following delivery. During this time bleeding, sepsis and hypertensive disorders can occur and newborns are extremely vulnerable in the immediate aftermath of birth. Therefore, follow-up visits by a health worker to assess the health of both mother and child in the postnatal period is strongly recommended.\\r\\nMaternal Death Surveillance and Response is another strategy that has been used to prevent maternal death . This is one of the interventions proposed to reduce maternal mortality where maternal l deaths are continuously reviewed to learn the causes and factors that led to the death. The information from the reviews is used to make recommendations for action to prevent future similar deaths.[27] .Maternal and perinatal death reviews have been in practice for a long time worldwide and the World Health Organization (WHO) introduced the Maternal and Perinatal Death Surveillance and Response (MPDSR) with a guideline in 2013. Studies have shown that acting on recommendations from MPDSR can reduce maternal and perinatal mortality by improving quality of care in the community and health facilities.\\r\\nThe decline in maternal deaths has been due largely to improved asepsis, fluid management and blood transfusion, and better prenatal care.\\r\\nTechnologies have been designed for resource poor settings that have been effective in reducing maternal deaths as well. The non-pneumatic anti-shock garment is a low-technology pressure device that decreases blood loss, restores vital signs and helps buy time in delay of women receiving adequate emergency care during obstetric hemorrhage.[28] It has proven to be a valuable resource. Condoms used as uterine tamponades have also been effective in stopping post-partum hemorrhage.[29]\\r\\nMost maternal deaths are avoidable, as the health-care solutions to prevent or manage complications are well known. Improving access to antenatal care in pregnancy, skilled care during childbirth, and care and support in the weeks after childbirth will reduce maternal deaths significantly[citation needed]. It is particularly important that all births be attended by skilled health professionals, as timely management and treatment can make the difference between life and death. To improve maternal health, barriers that limit access to quality maternal health services must be identified and addressed at all levels of the health system.[30] Recommendations for reducing maternal mortality include access to health care, access to family planning services, and emergency obstetric care, funding and intrapartum care.[31] Reduction in unnecessary obstetric surgery has also been suggested.\\r\\nFamily planning approaches include avoiding pregnancy at too young of an age or too old of an age and spacing births. Access to primary care for women even before they become pregnant is essential along with access to contraceptives.\\r\\nThe biggest global policy initiative for maternal health came from the United Nations' Millennium Declaration[32] which created the Millennium Development Goals. The fifth goal of the United Nations' Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) initiative is to reduce the maternal mortality rate by three quarters between 1990 and 2015 and to achieve universal access to reproductive health by 2015.[33]\\r\\nTrends through 2010 can be viewed in a report written jointly by the WHO, UNICEF, UNFPA, and the World Bank.[34]\\r\\nCountries and local governments have taken political steps in reducing maternal deaths. Researchers at the Overseas Development Institute studied maternal health systems in four apparently similar countries: Rwanda, Malawi, Niger, and Uganda.[35] In comparison to the other three countries, Rwanda has an excellent recent record of improving maternal death rates. Based on their investigation of these varying country case studies, the researchers conclude that improving maternal health depends on three key factors: 1. reviewing all maternal health-related policies frequently to ensure that they are internally coherent; 2. enforcing standards on providers of maternal health services; 3. any local solutions to problems discovered should be promoted, not discouraged.\\r\\nIn terms of aid policy, proportionally, aid given to improve maternal mortality rates has shrunken as other public health issues, such as HIV/AIDS, have become major international concerns.[36] Maternal health aid contributions tend to be lumped together with newborn and child health, so it is difficult to assess how much aid is given directly to maternal health to help lower the rates of maternal mortality. Regardless, there has been progress in reducing maternal mortality rates internationally.[37]\\r\\nMaternal deaths and disabilities are leading contributors in women's disease burden with an estimated 275,000 women killed each year in childbirth and pregnancy worldwide.[26] In 2011, there were approximately 273,500 maternal deaths (uncertainty range, 256,300 to 291,700).[38] Forty-five percent of postpartum deaths occur within 24 hours.[39] Ninety-nine percent of maternal deaths occur in developing countries.[6]","input":"How common is it to die in childbirth?"},{"output":"Andrew Barton (Banjo) Paterson","context":"The Australian ten dollar banknote was issued when the currency was changed from the Australian pound to the Australian dollar on 17 February 1966; it replaced the S5 note which had similar blue colouration.

Accordingly, a new article 31A was introduced with retrospective effect to uphold such measures. Further, another new article 31B was introduced to validate 13 enactments relating to zamindari abolition.[1]\\r\\nIt is laid down in Article 46 as a Directive Principle of State Policy that the State should promote with special care the educational and economic interests of the weaker sections of the people and protect them from social injustice. In order that any special provision that the State may make for the educational, economic or social advancement of any backward class of citizens may not be challenged on the ground of being discriminatory, article 15(3) was suitably amplified.[1]\\r\\nJawaharlal Nehru encouraged the Parliament of India to pass the amendment in response to State of Madras v.

The bid has come under FBI investigation for bribery and corruption, leading to the resignation of FIFA President Sepp Blatter. With a population of 2 million people, Qatar will be the first Arab state to host the World Cup.[1] Sheikh Mohammed bin Hamad bin Khalifa Al-Thani, son of Hamad bin Khalifa Al Thani the then Emir of Qatar, was the chairman of the bid committee.[2] Qatar promoted their hosting of the tournament as representing the Arab World, and has drawn support from across the member states of the Arab League. They also positioned their bid as an opportunity to bridge the gap between the Arab World and the West.[3]\\r\\nOn 17 Nov 2010 Qatar hosted a friendly match between Brazil and Argentina. This was one of 47 international exhibition games held throughout the world on this day.[4]\\r\\nPresident of FIFA Sepp Blatter endorsed the idea of having a World Cup in the Arab World, saying in April 2010: \\"The Arabic world deserves a World Cup. They have 22 countries and have not had any opportunity to organize the tournament\\". Blatter also praised Qatar's progress: \\"When I was first in Qatar there were 400,000 people here and now there are 1.6 million. In terms of infrastructure, when you are able to organise the Asian Games (in 2006) with more than 30 events for men and women, then that is not in question\\".[5] On 2 December 2010, it was announced that Qatar will host the 2022 FIFA World Cup.[6]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nWorking against the Qatar bid was the extreme temperature in the desert country. The World Cup always takes place during the European off-season in June and July. During this period the average daytime high in most of Qatar exceeds 50?C (120?F), the average daily low temperatures not dropping below 30?C (86?F).[7] In response to this issue, Sheikh Mohammed bin Hamad bin Khalifa al-Thani, the 2022 Qatar bid chairman, has stated, \\"the event has to be organized in June or July. We will have to take the help of technology to counter the harsh weather. We have already set in motion the process. A stadium with controlled temperature is the answer to the problem. We have other plans up our sleeves as well\\".[8]\\r\\nThe first five proposed stadiums for the World Cup were unveiled at the beginning of March 2010. The stadium will employ cooling technology capable of reducing temperatures within the stadium by up to 20C (36F), and the upper tiers of the stadium will be disassembled after the World Cup and donated to countries with less developed sports infrastructure.[10] All of the five stadium projects launched have been designed by German architect Albert Speer & Partners.[11]\\r\\nThe Air Conditioning in the stadiums for both the players and spectators will be solar powered, carbon neutral and provided by Arup of England.[12]\\r\\nThe Al-Khor Stadium is planned for Al-Khor city, located 50 kilometres north of Doha. The stadium will have a total capacity of 45,330, with 19,830 of the seats forming part of a temporary modular upper tier. The Al-Wakrah stadium, to be located in Al-Wakrah city in southern Qatar, will have a total capacity of 45,120 seats. The stadium will also contain a temporary upper tier of 25,500 seats. The stadium will be surrounded by large solar panels and will be decorated with Islamic art. The Al-Wakrah and Al-Khor stadiums would have been built regardless of whether Qatar was awarded the World Cup, according to the bid committee. However, the temporary upper-tier sections would not have been added if Qatar had lost the right to host the tournament.[11]\\r\\n\\r\\nA September 2013 report by The Guardian said a number of Nepalese migrant workers have faced poor conditions as companies handling construction for 2022 World Cup infrastructure forced workers to stay by denying them promised salaries and withholding necessary worker ID permits, rendering them illegal aliens. The Guardian wrote that their investigation \\"found evidence to suggest that thousands of Nepalese, who make up the single largest group of laborers in Qatar, face exploitation and abuses that amount to modern-day slavery, as defined by the International Labour Organisation, during a building binge paving the way for 2022\\". Nepalese workers in Qatar have been dying at a rate of one per day.[13]\\r\\nA video report accompanying The Guardian's article showed men living in labor camps with unsanitary and dilapidated conditions. Workers told The Guardian they were promised high salaries before coming to Qatar and then their contracts were destroyed upon their arrival to Qatar. Some said they hadn't been paid in months, but the construction companies denied them their worker IDs or passports, rendering them trapped. Workers described having to beg for food and being beaten. They could try to escape, but if caught without proper papers, they would be arrested.[14]\\r\\nThe Qatar 2022 Supreme Committee denied that construction directly related to the World Cup had yet begun but told The Guardian they are \\"deeply concerned with the allegations\\" and said: \\"We have been informed that the relevant government authorities are conducting an investigation into the allegations\\".\\r\\nIn 2013, 185 Nepalese died working as migrant construction workers building infrastructure in Qatar.[15] A report released by the International Trade Union Confederation in March 2014 estimated that 4,000 more workers could die as Qatar prepares for the World Cup.[16]\\r\\nHuman rights group Amnesty International has asked FIFA to intervene to protect migrant workers from mistreatment.[17]\\r\\nIn March 2016, Amnesty International accused Qatar of using forced labour and forcing the employees to live in poor conditions and withholding their wages and passports. It accused Fifa of failing to stop the stadium being built on \\"human right abuses\\". Migrant workers told Amnesty about verbal abuse and threats they received after complaining about not being paid for up to several months. Nepali workers were even denied leave to visit their family after the 2015 Nepal earthquake. [18]\\r\\nDuring May 2011, allegations of bribery on the part of two members of the FIFA Executive Committee were tabled by Lord Triesman of the English FA. These allegations were based on information from a whistleblower involved with the Qatari bid. FIFA has since opened an internal inquiry into the matter, and a revote on the 2022 World Cup remains a possibility if the allegations are proven. FIFA president Sepp Blatter has admitted that there is a ground swell of popular support to re-hold the 2022 vote won by Qatar.[19]\\r\\nIn testimony to a UK parliamentary inquiry board in May 2011, Lord Triesman alleged that Trinidad and Tobago's Jack Warner demanded $4 million for an education center in his country and Paraguay's Nicols Loz asked for an honorary knighthood in exchange for their votes. Also, two Sunday Times reporters testified that they had been told that Jacques Anouma of the Ivory Coast and Issa Hayatou of Cameroon were each paid $1.5 million to support Qatar's bid for the tournament. All four have denied the allegations.[20] Mohammed bin Hammam, who played a key role in securing the games for Qatar, withdrew as a candidate for president of FIFA in May 2011 after being accused of bribing 25 FIFA officials to vote for his candidacy.[21] Both Bin Hammam and Warner were suspended by FIFA in wake of these allegations,[22] with Warner reacting to his suspension by questioning Blatter's conduct and adding that FIFA secretary general Jerome Valcke had also told him that Qatar had bought the 2022 World Cup.[23] Valcke subsequently issued a statement denying he had suggested it was bribery, saying instead that the country had \\"used its financial muscle to lobby for support\\".\\r\\nQatar officials denied any impropriety and insist that the corruption allegations are being driven by envy and mistrust by those who do not want the World Cup staged in such a country. Qatar Airways CEO Akbar Al Baker gave an interview to German media in June 2014 stating that \\"the country is not getting the respect it deserves over its efforts to hold the World Cup and that the Qatari Emir strictly punishes and forbids instances of corruption and bribery with a zero-tolerance policy\\".[24][25]\\r\\nThe World Cup is usually held in the northern hemisphere summer. During this season in Qatar, the temperature can get to 50?C (122?F).[26] Qatar says that this will not be a problem for it hosting the World Cup. A section from Qatar 2022 Bid official site explains:\\r\\nQatar declared their intention to change the dates of the World Cup to winter immediately upon being award the Cup because of all the controversy surrounding the topic. An example of this is during the 2018 World Cup qualifier with China under air conditioning, which happened in 8 October 2015.\\r\\nSuch cooling techniques will be able to reduce temperatures from 45 to 25 degrees Celsius (113 to 77?F), which would be comfortable for players and spectators during matches, the bid also proposes these cooling technologies to be used in fan-zones, training pitches and walkways between Metro stations and stadia.[27] But if anyone enters an area without this technology, they may still be exposed to extreme levels of heat.\\r\\nAlcohol can currently be consumed legally in hotel bars and clubs by showing a passport for reporting and a special permit to attend the club. The question of whether alcohol was allowed to be consumed in additional areas and at the games themselves was asked, Hassan Abdullah al Thawed, chief executive of the Qatar 2022 World Cup bid, said the Muslim state would also permit alcohol consumption during the World Cup. A few specific fan-zones will be set up during the event, that will provide alcohol for sale. Also certain bars are now being developed for all the tourists coming to support their chosen teams in the World Cup.[28][29]\\r\\nThe selection of Qatar as hosts attracted controversy, as homosexuality is illegal in Qatar. FIFA President Sepp Blatter came under fire for joking: \\"I would say they should refrain from any sexual activities\\". He added, however: \\"We are definitely living in a world of freedom and I'm sure when the World Cup will be in Qatar in 2022, there will be no problems\\". [30] He later said: \\"We (FIFA) don't want any discrimination. What we want to do is open this game to everybody, and to open it to all cultures, and this is what we are doing in 2022\\".[31][32][33][34][35][36][37]\\r\\nDuring and after the bidding process, the Qatari government stated that it would let the Israel national football team participate in the World Cup on their territory despite not recognizing the State of Israel,[28][29][38] the head of Qatars World Cup bid said. Israeli athletes had competed previously in Qatar, such as Israeli tennis player Shahar Pe'er in 2008.[39] In addition, an Israeli also participated in the Doha 2010 Indoor Championships.[40]\\r\\nDuring the 2014 Protective Edge operation in the Gaza Strip between Israel and Hamas, Israel's economy minister Naftali Bennett alleged that Qatar supported Hamas and was \\"a terror sponsor\\", and called upon FIFA to give the 2022 World Cup to another country.[41][42]","input":"When was qatar chosen for the world cup?"},{"output":"Morgans Hotel Group","context":"The Clift is a luxury hotel located two blocks from Union Square at the intersection of Geary Street and Taylor Street, San Francisco, California.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1913, Frederick C.

It is believed to have been the largest chariot battle ever fought, involving between 5,000 and 6,000 chariots in total.[12][13][14]\\r\\nAs a result of the multiple Kadesh inscriptions, it is the best documented battle in all of ancient history.[15]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter expelling the Hyksos 15th dynasty around 1550 BC, the native Egyptian New Kingdom rulers became more aggressive in reclaiming control of their state's borders. Thutmose I, Thutmose III and his son and coregent Amenhotep II fought battles from Megiddo north to the Orontes River, including conflict with Kadesh.[citation needed]\\r\\nMany of the Egyptian campaign accounts between c. 1400 and 1300 BC reflect the general destabilization of the region of the Djahi (Southern Canaan). The reigns of Thutmose IV and Amenhotep III were undistinguished, except that Egypt continued to lose territory to Mitanni in northern Syria.[citation needed]\\r\\nDuring the late Egyptian 18th dynasty, the Amarna Letters[16] tell the story of the decline of Egyptian influence in the region. The Egyptians showed flagging interest here until almost the end of the dynasty. Horemheb (d 1292 BC), the last ruler of this dynasty, campaigned in this region, finally beginning to turn Egyptian interest back to this region.[citation needed]\\r\\nThis process continued in the 19th Dynasty. Like his father Ramesses I, Seti I was a military commander that set out to restore Egypt's empire to the days of the Tuthmosis kings almost a century before. Inscriptions on Karnak temple walls record the details of his campaigns into Canaan and Syria.[17] He took 20,000 men and reoccupied abandoned Egyptian posts and garrisoned cities. He made an informal peace with the Hittites, took control of coastal areas along the Mediterranean, and continued to campaign in Canaan. A second campaign led to his capture of Kadesh (where a stela commemorated his victory) and Amurru. His son and heir Ramesses II campaigned with him. There are historical records that record a large weapons order by Ramesses II in the year prior to the expedition he led to Kadesh in his fifth regnal year.[citation needed]\\r\\nHowever, at some point, both regions may have lapsed back into Hittite control. What exactly happened to Amurru is disputed. The Hittitologist Trevor Bryce suggests that, although it may have fallen once again under Hittite control, it is more likely Amurru remained a Hittite vassal state.[18]\\r\\nThe immediate antecedents to the Battle of Kadesh were the early campaigns of Ramesses II into Canaan. In the fourth year of his reign, he marched north into Syria, either to recapture Amurru[19] or, as a probing effort, to confirm his vassals' loyalty and explore the terrain of possible battles.[18] The recovery of Amurru was Muwatalli's stated motivation for marching south to confront the Egyptians. Ramesses marched north in the fifth year of his reign and encountered the Hittites at Kadesh.[citation needed]\\r\\nRamesses' army crossed the Egyptian border in the spring of year five of his reign and, after a month's march, reached the area of Kadesh from the south.[citation needed]\\r\\nThe Hittite king Muwatalli, who had mustered several of his allies (among them Rimisharrinaa, the king of Aleppo), had positioned his troops behind \\"Old Kadesh\\", but Ramesses, misled by two spies whom the Egyptians had captured, thought the Hittite forces were still far off, at Aleppo,[13] and ordered his forces to set up camp.[citation needed]\\r\\nIn the spring of the fifth year of his reign, in May 1274 BC, Ramesses II launched his campaign from his capital Pi-Ramesses (modern Qantir). The army moved beyond the fortress of Tjel and along the coast leading to Gaza.[20] Ramesses led an army of four divisions: Amun, Re (P're), Seth (Suteh) and the apparently newly formed Ptah division.[21]\\r\\nThere was also a poorly documented troop called the nrrn (Ne'arin or Nearin), possibly Canaanite military mercenaries with Egyptian allegiance[22] or even Egyptians,[23] which Ramesses II had left in Amurru, apparently in order to secure the port of Sumur.[24] This division would come to play a critical role in the battle. Also significant was the presence of Sherden troops within the Egyptian army. This is the first time they appear as Egyptian mercenaries, and they would play an increasingly significant role in Late Bronze Age history, ultimately appearing among the Sea Peoples that ravaged the east Mediterranean at the end of the Bronze Age. Healy in Armies of the Pharaohs observes:\\r\\nOn the Hittite side, Ramesses II recorded a long list of nineteen Hittite allies brought to Kadesh by Muwatalli. This list is of considerable interest to Hittitologists, as it reflects the extent of Hittite influence at the time.\\r\\nRamesses II describes his arrival on the battlefield in the two principal inscriptions he wrote concerning the battle, the so-called \\"Poem\\" and the \\"Bulletin\\":\\r\\nHis majesty proceeded northward. After his majesty reached the mountain range of Kadesh, then his majesty went forward...and he crossed the ford of the Orontes, with the first division of Amon (named) \\"He Gives Victory to User-maat-Re Setep-en-Re\\". His majesty reached the town of Kadesh ....The division of Amon was on the march behind him; the division of Re was crossing the ford in a district south of the town of Shabtuna at the distance of one iter from the place where his majesty was; the division of Ptah was on the south of the town of Arnaim; the division of Set was marching on the road. His majesty had formed the first ranks of battle of all the leaders of his army, while they were [still] on the shore in the land of Amurru.\\r\\n(From the \\"Bulletin\\") \\"Year 5, 3rd month of the third season, day 9, under the majesty of (Ramesses II)...The lord proceeded northward, and his majesty arrived at a vicinity south of the town of Shabtuna.[26]\\r\\nAs Ramesses and the Egyptian advance guard were about 11 kilometers from Kadesh, south of Shabtuna, he met two Shasu nomads who told him that the Hittite king was \\"in the land of Aleppo, on the north of Tunip\\" 200 kilometers away, where, the Shasu said, he was \\"(too much) afraid of Pharaoh, L.P.H., to come south.\\"[27] This was, state the Egyptian texts, a false report ordered by the Hittites \\"with the aim of preventing the army of His Majesty from drawing up to combat with the foe of Hatti.\\"[27] An Egyptian scout then arrived at the camp bringing two Hittite prisoners. The prisoners revealed that the entire Hittite army and the Hittite king were actually close at hand:\\r\\nAfter this, Ramesses II called his princes to meet with him and discuss the fault of his governors and officials in not informing the position of Muwatalli II and his army. As Ramesses was alone with his bodyguard and the Amun division, the vizier was ordered to hasten the arrival of the Ptah and Seth divisions, with the Re division having almost arrived at the camp.[29] While Ramesses was talking with the princes, the Hittite chariots crossed the river and charged the middle of the Re division as they were making their way toward Ramesses' position. The Re division was caught in the open and scattered in all directions. Some fled northward to the Amun camp, all the while being pursued by Hittite chariots.\\r\\nThe Hittite chariotry then rounded north and attacked the Egyptian camp, crashing through the Amun shield wall and creating panic among the Amun division. However, the momentum of the Hittite attack was already starting to wane, as the impending obstacles of such a large camp forced many Hittite charioteers to slow their attack; some were killed in chariot crashes.[30] In the Egyptian account of the battle, Ramesses describes himself as being deserted and surrounded by enemies:\\r\\nOnly with help from the gods did Ramesses II defeat his attackers and return to the Egyptian lines:\\r\\nThe Hittites, who believed their enemies to be totally routed, had stopped to plunder the Egyptian camp and, in doing so, became easy targets for Ramesses' counterattack. Ramesses' action was successful in driving the looters back towards the Orontes river and away from the Egyptian camp,[32] while in the ensuing pursuit, the heavier Hittite chariots were easily overtaken and dispatched by the lighter, faster, Egyptian chariots.[13]\\r\\nThe pharaoh, now facing a desperate fight for his life, summoned up his courage, called upon his god Amun, and fought valiantly to save himself. Ramesses personally led several charges into the Hittite ranks together with his personal guard, some of the chariots from his Amun division and survivors from the routed division of Re.[30]\\r\\nAlthough he had suffered a significant reversal, Muwatalli still commanded a large force of reserve chariotry and infantry, plus the walls of the town. As the retreat reached the river, he ordered another thousand chariots to attack the Egyptians, the stiffening element consisting of the high nobles who surrounded the king. As the Hittite forces approached the Egyptian camp again, the Ne'arin troop contingent from Amurru suddenly arrived, this time surprising the Hittites. Finally, the Ptah division arrived from the south, threatening the Hittite rear.[33]\\r\\nAfter six charges, the Hittite forces were almost surrounded, and the survivors were pinned against the Orontes.[24] The remaining Hittite elements not overtaken in the withdrawal were forced to abandon their chariots and attempt to swim across the river, according to Egyptian accounts hurriedly (\\"as fast as crocodiles swimming\\"), where many of them drowned.[34]\\r\\nThere is no consensus about the outcome or what took place, with views ranging from an Egyptian victory to a draw,[35] or, in the view of Iranian Egyptologist Mehdi Yarahmadi, an Egyptian defeat (with the Egyptian accounts simply propaganda).[36] The Hittite army was ultimately forced to retreat, but the Egyptians were unsuccessful in capturing Kadesh.[37]\\r\\nLogistically[3] unable to support a long siege of the walled city of Kadesh, Ramesses gathered his troops and retreated south towards Damascus and ultimately back to Egypt. Once back in Egypt, Ramesses proclaimed victory, having routed his enemies, however he didn't try further to capture Kadesh.[2] In a personal sense, however, the Battle of Kadesh was a triumph for Ramesses since, after blundering into a devastating Hittite chariot ambush, the young king had courageously rallied his scattered troops to fight on the battlefield while escaping death or capture. The new lighter, faster, two-man Egyptian chariots were able to pursue and take down the slower three-man Hittite chariots from behind as they overtook them.[3]\\r\\nHittite records from Boghazkoy, however, tell of a very different conclusion to the greater campaign, where a chastened Ramesses was forced to depart from Kadesh in defeat. Modern historians essentially conclude the battle was a draw, a great moral victory for the Egyptians, who had developed new technologies and rearmed before pushing back against the years-long steady incursions by the Hittites.[3]\\r\\nThe Hittite king, Muwatalli II, continued to campaign as far south as the Egyptian province of Upi (Apa), which he captured and placed under the control of his brother Hattusili, the future Hattusili III.[38] Egypt's sphere of influence in Asia was now restricted to Canaan.[38] Even this was threatened for a time by revolts among Egypt's vassal states in the Levant, and Ramesses was compelled to embark on a series of campaigns in Canaan in order to uphold his authority there before he could initiate further assaults against the Hittite Empire.[citation needed]\\r\\nIn the eighth and ninth years of his reign, Ramesses extended his military successes; this time, he proved more successful against his Hittite foes when he successfully captured the cities of Dapur and Tunip,[39] where no Egyptian soldier had been seen since the time of Thutmose III almost 120 years previously. His victory proved to be ephemeral, however. The thin strip of territory pinched between Amurru and Kadesh did not make for a stable possession. Within a year, they had returned to the Hittite fold, which meant that Ramesses had to march against Dapur once more in his tenth year. His second success here was equally as meaningless as his first, since neither Egypt nor Hatti could decisively defeat the other in battle.[24]\\r\\nThe running borderlands conflicts were finally concluded some fifteen years after the Battle of Kadesh[3] by an official peace treaty in the 21st year of Ramesses II's reign (1258 BC in conventional chronology), with Hattusili III, the new king of the Hittites. The treaty that was established was inscribed on a silver tablet, of which a clay copy survived in the Hittite capital of Hattusa, in modern Turkey, and is on display at the Istanbul Archaeology Museum. An enlarged replica of the Kadesh agreement hangs on a wall at the headquarters of the United Nations, as the earliest international peace treaty known to historians.[3] Its text, in the Hittite version, appears in the links below. An Egyptian version survives on a papyrus.[citation needed]\\r\\nAlthough there is more evidence in the form of texts and wall reliefs for this battle than for any other battle in the Ancient Near East, almost all of it is from an Egyptian perspective. Indeed, the first scholarly report on the battle, by James Henry Breasted in 1903, praised the sources that allowed the reconstruction of the battle with certainty.[40] However, some historians argue that the battle was a draw at best and that Egyptian influence over Amurru and Qadesh seems to have been lost forever.[41]\\r\\nThe main source of information is in the Egyptian record of the battle for which a general level of accuracy is assumed despite factual errors and propaganda.[42] The bombastic nature of Ramesses' version has long been recognized.[43] The Egyptian version of the battle of Kadesh is recorded in two primary forms, known as the Poem and the Bulletin. The Poem has been questioned as actual verse, as opposed to a prose account similar to what other pharaohs had recorded. Similarly, the Bulletin is itself simply a lengthy caption accompanying the reliefs.[44] These inscriptions are repeated multiple times (seven for the Bulletin and eight for the Poem, in temples in Abydos, Temple of Luxor, Karnak, Abu Simbel and the Ramesseum).[45]\\r\\nIn addition to these lengthy presentations, there are also numerous small captions used to point out various elements of the battle. Outside of the inscriptions, there are textual occurrences preserved in Papyrus Raifet and Papyrus Sallier III,[46] and a rendering of these same events in a letter from Ramesses to Hattusili III written in response to a scoffing complaint by Hattusili about the pharaoh's victorious depiction of the battle.[47]\\r\\nHittite references to the battle, including the above letter, have been found at Hattusa, although no annals have been discovered that might describe it as part of a campaign. Instead, there are various references made to it in the context of other events. This is especially true of Hattusili III, for whom the battle marked an important milestone in his career.[citation needed]\\r\\nSources: Goetze, A., \\"The Hittites and Syria (1300ÿ1200 B.C.)\\", in Cambridge Ancient History (1975) p.?253; Gardiner, Alan, The Kadesh Inscriptions of Ramesses II (1975) pp.?57ff.; Breasted, James Henry, Ancient Records of Egypt; Historical Records (1906) pp.?125ff.; Lichtheim, Mirian, Ancient Egyptian Literature, Vol. 2: The New Kingdom (1978) pp.?57ff.\\r\\nIn addition to these allies, the Hittite king also hired the services of some of the local Shasu tribes.\\r\\nSource: Gardiner, Alan, The Kadesh Inscriptions of Ramesses II (1975) pp.?39ÿ41.","input":"Who fought at the ancient battle of kadesh?"},{"output":"November 14, 2004","context":"The National Food for Work Programme was launched by minister of rural development,central government on November 14, 2004 in 150 of the most backward districts of India with the objective of generating supplementary wage employment.

Because of this influence, the red and white variety of the King Charles Spaniel and thus the Cavalier King Charles Spaniel became known as the Blenheim.[4]\\r\\nAttempts were made to recreate the original Cavalier King Charles Spaniel as early as the turn of the 20th century, using the now extinct Toy Trawler Spaniels. These attempts were documented by Judith Blunt-Lytton, 16th Baroness Wentworth, in the book \\"Toy Dogs and Their Ancestors Including the History And Management of Toy Spaniels, Pekingese, Japanese and Pomeranians\\" published under the name of the \\"Hon. Mrs Neville Lytton\\" in 1911.[5]\\r\\nIn 1926, the American Roswell Eldridge offered a dog show class prize of twenty-five pounds each as a prize for the best male and females of \\"Blenheim Spaniels of the old type, as shown in pictures of Charles II of England's time, long face, no stop, flat skull, not inclined to be domed, with spot in centre of skull.\\"[6] The breeders of the era were appalled, although several entered what they considered to be sub-par Cavalier King Charles Spaniels in the competition. Eldridge died before seeing his plan come to fruition, but several breeders believed in what he said and in 1928 the first Cavalier club was formed.[6] The first standard was created, based on a dog named \\"Ann's Son\\" owned by Mostyn Walker,[7] and the Kennel Club recognised the variety as \\"King Charles Spaniels, Cavalier type\\".[6]\\r\\nThe Second World War caused a drastic setback to the emerging breed, with the vast majority of breeding stock destroyed because of wartime hardship and food shortages. For instance, in the Ttiweh Cavalier Kennel, the population of sixty dogs dropped to three during the 1940s.[8] Following the war, just six dogs would survive as the new beginning from which all present-day Cavaliers descend.[6] These dogs were Ann's Son, his litter brother Wizbang Timothy, Carlo of Ttiweh, Duce of Braemore, Kobba of Kuranda and Aristide of Ttiweh.[9] The numbers increased gradually, and in 1945[10] the Kennel Club first recognised the breed in its own right as the Cavalier King Charles Spaniel.[6]\\r\\nThe history of the breed in America is relatively recent. The first recorded Cavalier living in the United States was brought from the United Kingdom in 1956 by W. Lyon Brown, together with Elizabeth Spalding and other enthusiasts, she founded the Cavalier King Charles Club USA which continues to the present day. In 1994, the American Cavalier King Charles Spaniel Club was created by a group of breeders to apply for recognition by the American Kennel Club. The Cavalier would go on to be recognised by the American Kennel Club in 1995,[2] and the ACKCSC became the parent club for Cavaliers.[11]\\r\\nHistorically the Cavalier King Charles Spaniel was a lap dog and is small for a spaniel, with fully grown adults comparable in size to adolescents of other larger spaniel breeds. Breed standards state that height of a Cavalier should be between 12 to 13 inches (30 to 33?cm) with a proportionate weight between 13 to 18 pounds (5.9 to 8.2?kg). The tail is usually not docked,[12] and the Cavalier should have a silky coat of moderate length. Standards state that it should be free from curl, although a slight wave is allowed. Feathering can grow on their ears, feet, legs and tail in adulthood. Standards require this be kept long, with the feathering on the feet a particularly important aspect of the breed's features.[12]\\r\\nThe Cavalier King Charles Spaniel and the English Toy Spaniel can be often confused with each other. In the United Kingdom, the English Toy Spaniel is called the King Charles Spaniel while in the United States, one of the colours of the Toy Spaniel is known as King Charles. The two breeds share similar history and only diverged from each other about 100 years ago. There are several major differences between the two breeds, with the primary difference being the size. While the Cavalier weighs on average between 13 to 18 pounds (5.9 to 8.2?kg), the King Charles is smaller at 9 to 15 pounds (4.1 to 6.8?kg). In addition their facial features while similar, are different; the Cavalier's ears are set higher and its skull is flat while the King Charles's is domed. Finally the muzzle length of the Cavalier tends to be longer than that of its King Charles cousin.[6][13]\\r\\nThe breed has four recognized colours. Cavaliers which have rich chestnut markings on a pearly white background are known as Blenheim in honour of Blenheim Palace, where John Churchill, 1st Duke of Marlborough, raised the predecessors to the Cavalier breed in this particular colour. In some dogs there is a chestnut spot in the middle of the forehead: this is called the \\"Blenheim\\" spot.[14] The Blenheim spot is also known as the mark of the \\"Duchess Thumb Print\\", based on the legend that Sarah Churchill, Duchess of Marlborough while awaiting news of her husband's safe return from the Battle of Blenheim, pressed the head of an expecting dam with her thumb, resulting in five puppies bearing the lucky mark after news that the battle had been won.[15] Black and Tan are dogs with black bodies with tan highlights, particularly eyebrows, cheeks, legs and beneath the tail.[16] Black and Tan is referred to as \\"King Charles\\" in the King Charles Spaniel.[6] Ruby Cavaliers should be entirely chestnut all over,[1] although some can have some white in their coats which is considered a fault under American Kennel Club conformation show rules.[17] The fourth colour is known as Tricolour, which is black and white with tan markings on cheeks, inside ears, on eyebrows, inside legs, and on underside of tail.[16] This colour is referred to as \\"Prince Charles\\" in the King Charles Spaniel.[6]\\r\\nRich chestnut markings on a white pearly coat\\r\\nBlack-and-tan Cavalier King Charles Spaniel\\r\\nFront and top view of Blenheim Spot\\r\\nCavalier King Charles Spaniel in the window\\r\\nPortrait of a young female\\r\\nTwo Cavalier King Charles Spaniels\\r\\nAccording to statistics released by The Kennel Club, Cavaliers were the sixth most popular dog in the United Kingdom in 2007 with 11,422 registrations in a single year. Labrador Retrievers were the most popular with 45,079 registrations in that year.[18] Their popularity is on the rise in America; in 1998 they were the 56th most popular breed but in both 2007 and 2008 they were the 25th most popular.[19] They ranked higher in some individual US cities in the 2008 statistics, being eighth in both Nashville and Minneapolis-St.Paul,[20] seventh in Boston, Atlanta[21] and Washington D.C.,[22] and sixth in both New York City[20] and San Francisco.[22] The breed's popularity has continued to grow, ranking in 18th place in 2013.[23] In 2009, the Cavalier was the fourth most popular breed in Australia with 3,196 registrations behind only Labrador Retrievers, German Shepherd Dogs and Staffordshire Bull Terriers.[24] In addition, there are also national breed clubs in Belgium, Canada, Czech Republic, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, South Africa, Spain and Sweden.[25]\\r\\nThe breed is highly affectionate, playful, extremely patient and eager to please. As such, dogs of the breed are good with children and other dogs.[2] Cavaliers are not shy about socialising with much larger dogs.[26] They will adapt quickly to almost any environment, family, and location and suit city and country life.[2] Their ability to bond with larger and smaller dogs makes them ideal in houses with more than one breed of dog as long as the other dog is trained. Cavaliers rank 44th in Stanley Coren's The Intelligence of Dogs, being of average intelligence in working or obedience. Cavaliers are naturally curious and playful, but also enjoy simply cuddling up on a cushion or lap, making them excellent companion or lap dogs for medical patients and the elderly.[27]\\r\\nCavaliers are active and sporting. Cavaliers are successful in conformation shows, obedience and agility and they also make wonderful therapy dogs due to their sweet, gentle natures.[2] The breed is adaptable in their need for exercise, happy with either sleeping on the couch or taking long walks.[2]\\r\\nThey have an instinct to chase most things that move including vehicles on busy streets, and so most Cavaliers will never become \\"street-wise\\".[28] As they tend to regard all strangers as friends, members of the breed will usually not make good guard dogs. Spaniels have a strong hunting instinct and may endanger birds and small animals. However, owners have reported that through training their Cavaliers live happily with a variety of small animals including hamsters and gerbils.[29]\\r\\nThe Cavalier's coat requires weekly brushing, but no trimming.[2] However, some owners prefer to trim their Cavalier's long feathers and slippers which can become very dirty when walking or playing outside.\\r\\nCavaliers can notably be prone to mitral valve disease, which leads to heart failure. This appears in many Cavaliers at some point in their lives and is the most common cause of death. Some serious genetic health problems, including early-onset mitral valve disease (MVD), the potentially severely painful syringomyelia (SM), hip dysplasia, luxating patellas, and certain vision and hearing disorders are health problems for this breed.[30] As today's Cavaliers all descend from only six dogs, any inheritable disease present in at least one of the original founding dogs can be passed on to a significant proportion of future generations. This is known as the founder effect and is the likely cause of the prevalence of MVD in the breed.[31] The health problems shared with this breed include mitral valve disease, luxating patella, and hereditary eye issues such as cataracts and retinal dysplasia.[32] Cavaliers are also affected by ear problems, a common health problem among spaniels of various types, and they can have such other general conditions as hip dysplasia, which are common across many types of dog breeds.\\r\\nNearly all Cavaliers eventually have mitral valve disease, with heart murmurs which may progressively worsen, leading to heart failure. This condition is polygenic (affected by multiple genes), and therefore all lines of Cavaliers worldwide are susceptible. It is the leading cause of death in the breed. A survey by The Kennel Club of the United Kingdom showed that 42.8% of Cavalier deaths are cardiac related. The next most common causes are cancer (12.3%) and old age (12.2%).[33] The condition can begin to emerge at an early age and statistically may be expected to be present in more than half of all Cavalier King Charles Spaniels by age 5. It is rare for a 10-year-old Cavalier not to have a heart murmur. While heart disease is common in dogs generally?ÿ one in 10 of all dogs will eventually have heart problems?ÿ mitral valve disease is generally (as in humans) a disease of old age. The \\"hinge\\" on the heart's mitral valve loosens and can gradually deteriorate, along with the valve's flaps, causing a heart murmur (as blood seeps through the valve between heartbeats) then congestive heart failure. The Cavalier is particularly susceptible to early-onset heart disease, which may be evident in dogs as young as one or two years of age.[34]\\r\\nVeterinary geneticists and cardiologists have developed breeding guidelines to eliminate early-onset mitral valve disease in the breed, but it is unclear if a statistically significant number of breeders follow these guidelines.[35] The chairperson of the UK CKCS Club said in 2009: \\"There are many members who are still not prepared to health check their breeding stock, and of those who do, it would appear that many would not hesitate to breed from affected animals.\\"[36] The MVD breeding protocol recommends that parents should be at least 2.5 years old and heart clear, and their parents (i.e., the puppy's grandparents) should be heart clear until age 5.[37]\\r\\nSyringomyelia (SM) is a condition affecting the brain and spine, causing symptoms ranging from mild discomfort to severe pain and partial paralysis. It is caused by a malformation, commonly known as Chiari Malformation, in the lower back of the skull which reduces the space available to the brain, compressing it and often forcing it out (herniating it) through the opening into the spinal cord. This blocks the flow of cerebral spinal fluid (CSF) around the brain and spine and increases the fluid's pressure, creating turbulence which in turn is believed to create fluid pockets, or syrinxes (hence the term syringomyelia), in the spinal cord. Syringomyelia is rare in most breeds but has become widespread in the Cavalier King Charles Spaniel, with international research samples in the past few years consistently showing over 90% of Cavaliers have the malformation, and that between 30ÿ70% have syrinxes.[38] However, most dogs with syrinxes are not symptomatic. Although symptoms of syringomyelia can present at any age, they typically appear between six months and four years of age in 85% of symptomatic dogs, according to Clare Rusbridge, a research scientist. Symptoms include sensitivity around the head, neck, or shoulders, often indicated by a dog whimpering or frequently scratching at the area of his neck or shoulder. Scratching is often unilateral?ÿ restricted to one side of the body. Scratching motions are frequently performed without actually making physical contact with the body (\\"air scratching\\"). The scratching behavior appears involuntary and the dog frequently scratches while walking?ÿ without stopping?ÿ in a way that is very atypical of normal scratching (\\"bunny hopping\\"). Scratching typical of SM is usually worse when the dog is wearing a collar, is being walked on leash, or is excited, and first thing in the morning or at night.[39]\\r\\nNot all dogs with SM show scratching behavior. Not all dogs who show scratching behavior appear to be in pain, though several leading researchers, including Dr Clare Rusbridge in the UK and Drs Curtis Dewey and Dominic Marino in the US, believe scratching in SM cavaliers is a sign of pain and discomfort and of existing neurological damage to the dorsal horn region of the spine. If onset is at an early age, a first sign may be scratching and/or rapidly appearing scoliosis. If the problem is severe, there is likely to be poor proprioception (awareness of body position), especially with regard to the forelimbs. Clumsiness and falling results from this problem. Progression is variable though the majority of dogs showing symptoms by age four tend to see progression of the condition.[39]\\r\\nA veterinarian will rule out basic causes of scratching or discomfort such as ear mites, fleas, and allergies, and then, primary secretory otitis media (PSOM?ÿ glue ear), as well as spinal or limb injuries, before assuming that a Cavalier has SM. PSOM can present similar symptoms but is much easier and cheaper to treat.[40] Episodic Falling Syndrome can also present similar symptoms. An MRI scan is normally done to confirm diagnosis of SM (and also will reveal PSOM). If a veterinarian suspects SM he or she will recommend an MRI scan. Neurologists give scanned dogs a signed certificate noting its grade.[39]\\r\\nEpisodic Falling causes \\"exercise-induced paroxysmal hypertonicity\\" meaning that there is increased muscle tone in the dog and the muscles cannot relax. Previously thought to be a muscular disorder, it is now known to be neurological. EF is caused by a single recessive gene, and a genetic test is available.[41] Except for severe cases, episodes will be in response to exercise, excitement or similar exertions. Although EF is often misdiagnosed as epilepsy, which typically results in loss of consciousness, the dog remains conscious throughout the episode.[42] Severity of symptoms can range from mild, occasional falling to freezing to seizure-like episodes lasting hours. Episodes can become more or less severe as the dog gets older and there is no standard pattern to the attacks. The onset of symptoms usually occurs when a dog is between 4 months and 4 years of age.[41] It is similar to Scotty Cramp, a genetic disorder in Scottish Terriers.[43] About 1% of Cavaliers are affected by the condition, with 19% being carriers. Dogs with whole coloured coats were more likely to be affected than dogs with parti-coloured coats.[44]\\r\\nAs many as half of all Cavalier King Charles Spaniels may have a congenital blood disorder called idiopathic asymptomatic thrombocytopenia, an abnormally low number of platelets in the blood, according to recent studies in Denmark and the United States. Platelets, or thrombocytes, are disk-shaped blood elements which aid in blood clotting. Excessively low numbers are the most common cause of bleeding disorders in dogs. The platelets in the blood of many Cavalier King Charles Spaniels are a combination of those of normal size for dogs and others that are abnormally oversized, or macrothrombocytes. Macrothrombocytosis also is a congenital abnormality found in at least a third of CKCSs. These large platelets function normally, and the typical Cavalier does not appear to experience any health problems due to either the size or fewer numbers of its platelets.[45]\\r\\nHip dysplasia is a common genetic disease that affects Cavalier King Charles Spaniels. It is not present at birth but develops with age. Hip dysplasia is diagnosed by X-rays, but it is not usually evident in X-rays of Cavaliers until they mature. Even in adult spaniels with severe hip dysplasia, X-rays may not always indicate the disease.[46] In a series of evaluations by the Orthopedic Foundation for Animals, the Cavalier was ranked 78th worst out of 157 breeds. The worst affected breeds were the Bulldog, Pug and Dogue de Bordeaux.[47]\\r\\nCavaliers can be subject to a genetic defect of the femur and knee called luxating patella. This condition is most often observed when a puppy is 4 to 6 months old. In the most serious cases, surgery may be indicated. The grading system for the patella runs from 1 (a tight knee), to 4 (a knee so loose that its cap is easily displaced). If a cavalier has a grade 1ÿ2, physical rehabilitation therapy and exercise may reduce the grading and potentially avoid surgery. The grades 3ÿ4 are most severe where surgery will most likely be needed to correct the problem to avoid the development of arthritis and lameness in the limb.[48]\\r\\nA disorder commonly found in Cavaliers is keratoconjunctivitis sicca, colloquially known as \\"dry eye\\". The usual cause of this condition is an autoimmune reaction against the dog's lacrimal gland (tear gland), reducing the production of tears. According to the Canine Inherited Disorders Database, the condition requires continual treatment and if untreated may result in partial or total blindness.[49] This disorder can decrease or heal over time.[50]\\r\\nA 1999 study of Cavaliers conducted by the Canine Eye Registration Foundation showed that an average of 30% of all Cavalier King Charles Spaniels evaluated had eye problems.[51] They include hereditary cataracts, corneal dystrophy, distichiasis, entropion, microphthalmia, progressive retinal atrophy, and retinal dysplasia.[52]\\r\\nPrimary Secretory Otitis Media (PSOM), also known as glue ear, consists of a highly viscous mucus plug which fills the dog's middle ear and may cause the tympanic membrane to bulge. PSOM has been reported almost exclusively in Cavaliers, and it may affect over half of them. Because the pain and other sensations in the head and neck areas, resulting from PSOM, are similar to some symptoms caused by syringomyelia (SM), some examining veterinarians have mis-diagnosed SM in Cavaliers which actually have PSOM and not SM.[53]\\r\\nCavalier King Charles Spaniels may be predisposed to a form of congenital deafness, which is present at birth, due to a lack of formation or early degeneration of receptors in the inner ear, although this is relatively rare. In addition, more recent studies have found Cavaliers that develop a progressive hearing loss, which usually begins during puppyhood and progresses until the dog is completely deaf, usually between the ages of three and five years. The progressive nature of this form of deafness in Cavaliers is believed to be caused by degeneration of the hearing nerve rather than the lack of formation or early degeneration of the inner ear receptors.[54]\\r\\nAn urban legend claims that Charles II issued a special decree granting King Charles Spaniels permission to enter any establishment in the UK,[55][56] overriding \\"no dog except guide dogs\\" rules. A variant of this myth relates specifically to the Houses of Parliament.[57][58] This myth is sometimes instead applied to the Cavalier King Charles Spaniel.[59]\\r\\nThe UK Parliament website states: \\"Contrary to popular rumour, there is no Act of Parliament referring to King Charles spaniels being allowed anywhere in the Palace of Westminster. We are often asked this question and have thoroughly researched it.\\"[57] Similarly, there is no proof of any such law covering the wider UK. A spokesman for the Kennel Club said: \\"This law has been quoted from time to time. It is alleged in books that King Charles made this decree but our research hasn't tracked it down.\\"[55]","input":"Where did cavalier king charles spaniel dog originated?"},{"output":"around 90%","context":"Coordinates: 9000N 000E? / ?90.00000N 0.00000E? / 90.00000; 0.00000\\r\\nThe Northern Hemisphere is the half of Earth that is north of the equator. For other planets in the Solar System, north is defined as being in the same celestial hemisphere relative to the invariable plane of the solar system as Earth's North pole.[1]\\r\\nOwing to the Earth's axial tilt, winter in the Northern Hemisphere lasts from the December solstice (typically December?21 UTC) to the March Equinox (typically March?20 UTC), while summer lasts from the June solstice (typically June?21 UTC) through to the September equinox (typically September?23 UTC). The dates vary each year due to the difference between the calendar year and the astronomical year.\\r\\nIts surface is 60.7% water, compared with 80.9% water in the case of the Southern Hemisphere, and it contains 67.3% of Earth's land.[2]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Arctic is the region north of the Arctic Circle. Its climate is characterized by cold winters and cool summers. Precipitation mostly comes in the form of snow. The Arctic experiences some days in summer when the Sun never sets, and some days during the winter when it never rises. The duration of these phases varies from one day for locations right on the Arctic Circle to several months near the North Pole, which is the middle of the Northern Hemisphere.\\r\\nBetween the Arctic Circle and the Tropic of Cancer lies the Northern temperate zone. The changes in these regions between summer and winter are generally mild, rather than extreme hot or cold. However, a temperate climate can have very unpredictable weather.\\r\\nTropical regions (between the Tropic of Cancer and the equator) are generally hot all year round and tend to experience a rainy season during the summer months, and a dry season during the winter months.\\r\\nIn the Northern Hemisphere, objects moving across or above the surface of the Earth tend to turn to the right because of the coriolis effect. As a result, large-scale horizontal flows of air or water tend to form clockwise-turning gyres. These are best seen in ocean circulation patterns in the North Atlantic and North Pacific oceans.\\r\\nFor the same reason, flows of air down toward the northern surface of the Earth tend to spread across the surface in a clockwise pattern. Thus, clockwise air circulation is characteristic of high pressure weather cells in the Northern Hemisphere. Conversely, air rising from the northern surface of the Earth (creating a region of low pressure) tends to draw air toward it in a counterclockwise pattern. Hurricanes and tropical storms (massive low-pressure systems) spin counter-clockwise in the Northern Hemisphere.\\r\\nThe shadow of a sundial moves clockwise in the Northern Hemisphere (opposite of the Southern Hemisphere). During the day, the Sun tends to rise to its maximum at a southerly position except between the Tropic of Cancer and the Equator, where the sun can be seen to the north, directly overhead, or to the south at noon dependent on the time of year.\\r\\nWhen viewed from the Northern Hemisphere, the Moon appears inverted compared to a view from the Southern Hemisphere.[3][4] The North Pole faces away from the galactic center of the Milky Way. This results in the Milky Way being sparser and dimmer in the Northern Hemisphere compared to the Southern Hemisphere, making the Northern Hemisphere more suitable for deep-space observation, as it is not \\"blinded\\" by the Milky Way.[citation needed]\\r\\nThe Northern Hemisphere is home to approximately 6.57 billion people which is around 90% of the earth's total human population of 7.3 billion people.[5][6]\\r\\n Media related to Northern Hemisphere at Wikimedia Commons","input":"What percentage of the population live in the northern hemisphere?"},{"output":"thirteen","context":"\\r\\n\\r\\nMario Kart (Ѩ, Mario Kto) is a series of go-kart-style racing video games developed and published by Nintendo as spin-offs from its trademark Super Mario series. The first in the series, Super Mario Kart, was launched in 1992 on the Super Nintendo Entertainment System to critical and commercial success.[1]\\r\\n\\r\\nThere have been six Mario Kart games released for home consoles, three portable games, and four Namco co-developed arcade games, for a total of thirteen. The latest title in the main series, Mario Kart 8 Deluxe, was released on Nintendo Switch in April 2017. The series has sold over 100 million copies worldwide to date.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe first title in the Mario Kart series is Super Mario Kart which was released for the Super Nintendo Entertainment System in 1992. The development of the first game was overseen by Shigeru Miyamoto, the Japanese video game designer who created the original Super Mario Bros., as well as many other successful games for Nintendo. Darran Jones of NowGamer suggests that the original success of Super Mario Kart was the result of including characters previously seen in Mario Bros. games, while also being a new type of racing game.[2]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the Mario Kart series, players compete in go-kart races, controlling one of a selection of characters, typically from the Mario franchise. Up to twelve characters can compete in each race, the exact number varies between titles.\\r\\n\\r\\nOne of the features of the series is the use of various power-up items obtained by driving into item boxes laid out on the course. These power-ups include mushrooms to give players a speed boost, Koopa Shells to be thrown at opponents, and banana peels and fake item boxes that can be laid on the course as hazards. The type of weapon received from an item box is often random, though sometimes influenced by the player's current position in the race.[3] For example, players lagging far behind may receive more powerful items while the leader will only receive small defensive items. Called rubber banding, this gameplay mechanism allows other players or computers a realistic chance to catch up to the leading player.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs the series has progressed, each new installment has introduced new gameplay elements, such as new courses, items, modes, and playable characters.[3] These changes include:\\r\\n\\r\\nMany course themes recur throughout the series. Most are based on an existing area in the Mario franchise (Bowser's Castle being among the most prominent), but there are a number of courses that have not appeared elsewhere, but still belong in the Mushroom Kingdom, such as Rainbow Road.[3] Each game in the series includes at least 16 original courses and up to 6 original battle arenas.[3] Each game's tracks are divided into four \\"cups\\", or groups in which the player has to have the highest overall placing to win. Most courses can be done in three laps. The first game to feature courses from previous games was Mario Kart: Super Circuit, which contained all of the tracks from the original Super NES game. Starting with Mario Kart DS, each entry in the series has featured 16 \\"nitro\\" (courses belonging to its own game) and 16 \\"retro\\" tracks (courses from previous Mario Kart titles), spread across four cups each with four races. In Mario Kart 8, 16 additional tracks are available across two downloadable packages, eight for each package downloaded, including seven retro courses, four original courses, and five courses based on other Nintendo franchises, including Excitebike, F-Zero, The Legend of Zelda, and Animal Crossing.[5]\\r\\n\\r\\nEach installment features a variety of different modes. The following four modes recur most often in the series:\\r\\n\\r\\nAt one point, there was also a game in the series planned for the Virtual Boy in 1995. Tentatively entitled VB Mario Kart, it was likely to be the first sequel to Super Mario Kart. The game was cancelled due to the Virtual Boy's failure, but was revealed in a 2000 issue of German gaming magazine The Big N.[6]\\r\\n\\r\\nSeveral Mario Kart-related items appear in the Super Smash Bros. series, with Super Smash Bros. Brawl in particular featuring a Mario Circuit stage based on Figure-8 Circuit from Mario Kart DS,[10] Super Smash Bros. for Nintendo 3DS featuring a Rainbow Road stage based on its appearance in Mario Kart 7, and Super Smash Bros. for Wii U featuring a Mario Circuit stage based on its appearance in Mario Kart 8, along with the returning Mario Circuit stage from Brawl.\\r\\n\\r\\nCertain courses from the series have also appeared in F-Zero X, Fortune Street, the Mario & Sonic series, Paper Mario: Color Splash, and the WarioWare series. Various items from the series can also be seen in games such as Nintendogs and Animal Crossing.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Mario Kart series has had a range of merchandise released.\\r\\n\\r\\nAmong them are a slot car racer series based on Mario Kart DS, which comes with Mario and Donkey Kong figures, while Wario and Luigi are available separately. A line of radio-controlled karts have also been marketed, with are controlled by Game Boy Advance-shaped controllers, and feature Mario, Donkey Kong, and Yoshi. There are additional, larger karts that depict the same trio and are radio-controlled by a GameCube-shape controller.\\r\\n\\r\\nJapanese figurines of Mario, Luigi, Peach, Toad, Yoshi, Wario, Donkey Kong, and Bowser are also available for purchase as well as for Mario Kart 64, figures of Mario, Luigi, Wario, Bowser, Donkey Kong, and Yoshi were made by Toybiz. There are also Sound Drops inspired by Mario Kart Wii with eight sounds from the game. A land-line telephone featuring Mario holding a lightning bolt while seated in his kart, has also been marketed.\\r\\n\\r\\nK'Nex released Mario Kart Wii sets, with Mario, Luigi, Yoshi, Donkey Kong, and Bowser in karts and bikes, as well as tracks from the game.[11] Mario Kart 7 and Mario Kart 8 K'Nex sets have also been released.\\r\\n\\r\\nNintendo's own customer rewards program Club Nintendo released merchandise from the series as well. These included a Mario Kart 8 soundtrack, a Mario Kart Wii-themed stopwatch, and gold trophies modeled after those in Mario Kart 7. Before Club Nintendo, a Mario Kart 64 soundtrack was offered by mail.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 2014, McDonald's released Mario Kart 8 toys with Happy Meals. They featured eight of the characters in karts that were customizable with stickers.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 2018, the board game Monopoly Gamer features a Mario Kart theme with courses from Mario Kart 8 and Mario Kart 8 Deluxe serving as properties.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Mario Kart series has received acclaim from both critics and fans. Nintendo Power listed the series as being one of the greatest multi-player experiences, citing the diversity in game modes as well as the entertainment value found.[12]\\r\\n\\r\\nGuinness World Records listed six records set by the Mario Kart series, including \\"First Console Kart Racing Game\\", \\"Best Selling Racing Game\\" and \\"Longest Running Kart Racing Franchise.\\" Guinness World Records ranked the original Super Mario Kart number 1 on the list of top 50 console games of all time based on initial impact and lasting legacy.[13]\\r\\n\\r\\nLike the Super Mario series, the Mario Kart series has achieved successful sales with over 100 million copies sold in total.[20] Super Mario Kart has sold 8.76 million copies and is the fourth best-selling game on the Super Nintendo Entertainment System console.[14] Mario Kart 64 is the second best-selling title for the Nintendo 64 (behind Super Mario 64), selling a total of 9.87 million copies.[14]Mario Kart: Double Dash has sold 6.96 million copies.[14] It is the second best-selling game on the GameCube (next to Super Smash Bros.

Mario Kart Wii has achieved highly successful numbers, selling a total of 37.10 million copies.[16] It is the best-selling installment in the series and is the second best-selling game for the Wii (next to Wii Sports).[16] Mario Kart 8, released for the Wii U, has shipped 1.2 million copies in North America and Europe combined on its first few days since launch, which was the console's fastest-selling game until the record was beaten by Super Smash Bros. for Wii U.[21][22] It sold a total of 8.42 million copies and is the Wii U's best-selling game.[18] In contrast, the enhanced port for the Nintendo Switch system, titled Mario Kart 8 Deluxe, has sold 459,000 units in the United States in one day of its launch, making it the fastest-selling game in the series to date.[23] Deluxe sold a total of 10.35 million copies worldwide, outperforming the original Wii U version, and is the second best-selling Nintendo Switch title of all time (behind Super Mario Odyssey).[19] Both versions sold a combined total of 18.77 million copies\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the portable entries, the series also performed outstanding sales. Mario Kart: Super Circuit, has sold a total of 5.9 million copies, making it the fourth best-selling game on the Game Boy Advance.[14] The second portable title, Mario Kart DS, has sold a total of 23.60 million copies.[15] The third best-selling game for the Nintendo DS, it is also the best-selling portable title in the series.[15] Mario Kart 7, released for the Nintendo 3DS, has sold 17.21 million copies, and is the best-selling 3DS game as of June 2018.[17]\\r\\n\\r\\nCite error: There are <ref?group=n> tags on this page, but the references will not show without a {{reflist|group=n}} template (see the help page).","input":"How many versions of mario kart are there?"},{"output":"P is the pressure of the gas","context":"Boyle's law (sometimes referred to as the BoyleÿMariotte law, or Mariotte's law[1]) is an experimental gas law that describes how the pressure of a gas tends to increase as the volume of the container decreases. A modern statement of Boyle's law is\\r\\n\\r\\nThe absolute pressure exerted by a given mass of an ideal gas is inversely proportional to the volume it occupies if the temperature and amount of gas remain unchanged within a closed system.[2][3]\\r\\n\\r\\nMathematically, Boyle's law can be stated as\\r\\n\\r\\nor\\r\\n\\r\\nwhere P is the pressure of the gas, V is the volume of the gas, and k is a constant.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe equation states that the product of pressure and volume is a constant for a given mass of confined gas and this holds as long as the temperature is constant. For comparing the same substance under two different sets of conditions, the law can be usefully expressed as\\r\\n\\r\\nThe equation shows that, as volume increases, the pressure of the gas decreases in proportion. Similarly, as volume decreases, the pressure of the gas increases. The law was named after chemist and physicist Robert Boyle, who published the original law in 1662.[4]\\r\\n\\r\\nThis relationship between pressure and volume was first noted by Richard Towneley and Henry Power in the seventeenth century.[5][6] Robert Boyle confirmed their discovery through experiments and published the results.[7]  According to Robert Gunther and other authorities, it was Boyle's assistant, Robert Hooke, who built the experimental apparatus.  Boyle's law is based on experiments with air, which he considered to be a fluid of particles at rest in between small invisible springs. At that time, air was still seen as one of the four elements, but Boyle disagreed. Boyle's interest was probably to understand air as an essential element of life;[8] for example, he published works on the growth of plants without air.[9] Boyle used a closed J-shaped tube and after pouring mercury from one side he forced the air on the other side to contract under the pressure of mercury. After repeating the experiment several times and using different amounts of mercury he found that under controlled conditions, the pressure of a gas is inversely proportional to the volume occupied by it.[10] The French physicist Edme Mariotte (1620ÿ1684) discovered the same law independent of Boyle in 1679,[11] but Boyle had already published it in 1662.[12] Mariotte did, however, discover that air volume changes with temperature.[13] Thus this law is sometimes referred to as Mariotte's law or the BoyleÿMariotte law. Later, in 1687 in the Philosophi? Naturalis Principia Mathematica, Newton showed mathematically that if an elastic fluid consisting of particles at rest, between which are repulsive forces inversely proportional to their distance, the density would be directly proportional to the pressure,[14] but this mathematical treatise is not the physical explanation for the observed relationship. Instead of a static theory a kinetic theory is needed, which was provided two centuries later by Maxwell and Boltzmann.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis law was the first physical law to be expressed in the form of an equation describing the dependence of two variable quantities.[12]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe law itself can be stated as follows:\\r\\n\\r\\nFor a fixed amount of an ideal gas kept at a fixed temperature, pressure and volume are inversely proportional.[3]\\r\\n\\r\\nOr Boyle's law is a gas law, stating that the pressure and volume of a gas have an inverse relationship, when temperature is held constant. If volume increases, then pressure decreases and vice versa, when temperature is held constant.\\r\\n\\r\\nTherefore, when the volume is halved, the pressure is doubled; and if the volume is doubled, the pressure is halved.\\r\\n\\r\\nBoyle's law states that at constant temperature for a fixed mass, the absolute pressure and the volume of a gas are inversely proportional.  The law can also be stated in an equivalent manner, that the product of absolute pressure and volume is always constant.\\r\\n\\r\\nMost gases behave like ideal gases at moderate pressures and temperatures.  The technology of the 17th century could not produce high pressures or low temperatures. Hence, the law was not likely to have deviations at the time of publication. As improvements in technology permitted higher pressures and lower temperatures, deviations from the ideal gas behavior became noticeable, and the relationship between pressure and volume can only be accurately described employing real gas theory.[15]  The deviation is expressed as the compressibility factor.\\r\\n\\r\\nBoyle (and  Mariotte) derived the law solely on experimental grounds.  The law can also be derived theoretically based on the presumed existence of atoms and molecules and assumptions about motion and perfectly elastic collisions (see kinetic theory of gases).  These assumptions were met with enormous resistance in the positivist scientific community at the time however, as they were seen as purely theoretical constructs for which there was not the slightest observational evidence.\\r\\n\\r\\nDaniel Bernoulli in 1737-1738 derived Boyle's law using Newton's laws of motion with application on a molecular level. It remained ignored until around 1845, when John Waterston published a paper building the main precepts of kinetic theory; this was rejected by the Royal Society of England.  Later works of James Prescott Joule, Rudolf Clausius and in particular Ludwig Boltzmann firmly established the kinetic theory of gases and brought attention to both the theories of Bernoulli and Waterston.[16]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe debate between proponents of Energetics and Atomism led Boltzmann to write a book in 1898, which endured criticism up to his suicide in 1906.[16] Albert Einstein in 1905 showed how kinetic theory applies to the Brownian motion of a fluid-suspended particle, which was confirmed in 1908 by Jean Perrin.[16]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe mathematical equation for Boyle's law is:\\r\\n\\r\\nwhere:\\r\\n\\r\\nSo long as temperature remains constant the same amount of energy given to the system persists throughout its operation and therefore, theoretically, the value of k will remain constant. However, due to the derivation of pressure as perpendicular applied force and the probabilistic likelihood of collisions with other particles through collision theory, the application of force to a surface may not be infinitely constant for such values of v, but will have a limit when differentiating such values over a given time. Forcing the volume V of the fixed quantity of gas to increase, keeping the gas at the initially measured temperature, the pressure p must decrease proportionally. Conversely, reducing the volume of the gas increases the pressure. Boyle's law is used to predict the result of introducing a change, in volume and pressure only, to the initial state of a fixed quantity of gas.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe initial and final volumes and pressures of the fixed amount of gas, where the initial and final temperatures are the same (heating or cooling will be required to meet this condition), are related by the equation:\\r\\n\\r\\nHere P1 and V1 represent the original pressure and volume, respectively, and P2 and V2 represent the second pressure and volume.\\r\\n\\r\\nBoyle's law, Charles's law, and Gay-Lussac's law form the combined gas law. The three gas laws in combination with Avogadro's law can be generalized by the ideal gas law.\\r\\n\\r\\nBoyle's law is often used as part of an explanation on how the breathing system works in the human body. This commonly involves explaining how the lung volume may be increased or decreased and thereby cause a relatively lower or higher air pressure within them (in keeping with Boyle's law). This forms a pressure difference between the air inside the lungs and the environmental air pressure, which in turn precipitates either inhalation or exhalation as air moves from high to low pressure.[17]\\r\\n\\r\\nRelated phenomena:\\r\\n\\r\\nOther gas laws in chemistry:","input":"What are the variables of boyle's law?"},{"output":"Max Mutchnick","context":"Will & Grace is an American sitcom created by Max Mutchnick and David Kohan. Set in New York City, the show focuses on the relationship between best friends Will Truman (Eric McCormack), a gay lawyer, and Grace Adler (Debra Messing), a straight interior designer. The show was broadcast on NBC from September 21, 1998 to May 18, 2006, for a total of eight seasons, and restarted its run on NBC on September 28, 2017. During its original run, Will & Grace was one of the most successful television series with gay principal characters.[2]\\r\\nDespite initial criticism for its particular portrayal of homosexual characters, it went on to become a staple of NBC's Must See TV Thursday night lineup and was met with continued critical acclaim. It was ensconced in the Nielsen top 20 for half of its network run. The show was the highest-rated sitcom among adults 18ÿ49, from 2001 and 2005. Throughout its eight-year run, Will & Grace earned 16 Emmy Awards and 83 nominations. Each main actor, with the exception of Morrison, received an Emmy Award throughout the series. In 2014 the Writers Guild of America placed the sitcom at number 94 in their list of the 101 Best Written TV series of all time.[3] Since the final episode aired, the sitcom has been credited with helping and improving public opinion of the LGBT community, with former U.S. Vice President Joe Biden commenting that the show \\"probably did more to educate the American public\\" on LGBT issues \\"than almost anything anybody has ever done so far\\".[4] In 2014, the Smithsonian Institution added an LGBT history collection to their museum which included items from Will and Grace. The curator Dwight Blocker Bowers stated that the sitcom used \\"comedy to familiarize a mainstream audience with gay culture\\" that was \\"daring and broke ground\\" in American media.[5]\\r\\nDuring its original run, Will & Grace was filmed in front of a live studio audience (most episodes and scenes) on Tuesday nights,[6] at Stage 17 in CBS Studio Center, a space that totals 14,000?sq?ft (1,300?m2). Will and Grace's apartment is on display at the Emerson College Library, having been donated by series creator Max Mutchnick.[7] When the set was removed in April 2014, rumors came up about a cast reunion, but the actors involved denied that such a reunion was planned. It was merely moved to Emerson's new center in Los Angeles. A long-running legal battle between both the original executive producers and creators and NBC took place between 2003 and 2007. All seasons of the series have been released on DVD and the show has been broadcast in more than 60 countries.\\r\\nOn September 26, 2016, the cast reunited for a 10-minute special (released online), urging Americans to vote in the 2016 presidential election.[8] After the success of the 10-minute reunion special, NBC announced that the network was exploring the idea of putting Will & Grace back into production.[9] In January 2017, NBC confirmed the series' return, for a ten-episode ninth season, for the 2017ÿ18 television season.[10][11] The episode order was increased to 12 on April 5, 2017 and later to 16.[12] The season premiered on September 28, 2017.[13] On August 3, 2017, NBC renewed the series for a tenth season of 13 episodes.[12]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nWill & Grace is set in New York City and focuses on the relationship between Will Truman, a gay lawyer, and his best friend Grace Adler, a Jewish woman who owns an interior design firm. Also featured are their friends Karen Walker, an alcoholic socialite, and Jack McFarland, a flamboyantly gay actor. The interplay of relationships features the trials and tribulations of dating, marriage, divorce, and casual sex; as well as comical key stereotypes of gay and Jewish culture.\\r\\nCreators of Will & Grace and real-life friends Max Mutchnick and David Kohan modeled the show after Mutchnick's relationship with childhood friend Janet Eisenberg, a New York City voice-over casting agent. Mutchnick, who is openly gay, met Eisenberg while rehearsing a play at Temple Emanuel in Beverly Hills, California at age of 13.[24] He was the main star of the Hebrew school musical, while she was a student in the drama department. About three years later, she introduced him to Kohan, the son of comedy writer Alan Kohan, in the drama department at Beverly Hills High School. \\"Max and Janet seemed to have a lovely rapport, but the romantic element confused me, and it confused them as well,\\" Kohan later recalled. \\"They went out for a couple of years, then they went off to different colleges. And Max comes out of the closet, springs it on her ÿ and she was stunned. It was a shocking revelation for her, so I kind of functioned as a liaison between the two of them, because they both still really loved each other.\\"[24]\\r\\nWhile Kohan practiced his shuttle diplomacy, he and Mutchnick began developing sitcom ideas, which prompted the pair to start writing as a duo.[24] They eventually landed staff jobs on HBO's adult-themed sitcom Dream On and executive produced the short-lived NBC sitcom Boston Common.[24] In 1997, they developed an ensemble comedy about six friends, two of them based on Mutchnick and Eisenberg.[24] At the same time, Warren Littlefield, the then-president of NBC Entertainment, was seeking another relationship comedy for the network as Mad About You was going off the air.[25][26] When Kohan and Mutchnick pitched their idea, which centered on three couples, one of which was a gay man living with a straight woman, Littlefield was not excited about the first two couples, but wanted to learn more about the gay and straight couple, so Mutchnick and Kohan were sent to create a pilot script centering on those two characters.[26] While Kohan and Mutchnick elaborated on the pilot script, they spent four tense months faxing Littlefield the box office grosses from hit films with gay characters such as The Birdcage and My Best Friend's Wedding.[24]\\r\\nNBC was positive about the project, but there was still some concern that the homosexual subject matter would cause alarm. Ellen DeGeneres' sitcom Ellen, which aired on ABC, was canceled the year before Will & Grace premiered because ratings had plummeted after the show became \\"too gay.\\"[27][28] Despite the criticism ABC received for DeGeneres's coming out episode, \\"The Puppy Episode,\\" Kohan said, \\"there's no question that show made it easier for Will & Grace to make it on the air.\\" He added: \\"Will & Grace had a better shot at succeeding where Ellen failed, however, because Will has known about his homosexuality for 20 years. He's not exploring that awkward territory for the first time, as Ellen did. The process of self-discovery and the pain most gay men go through is fascinating, but the average American is put off by it.\\"[29]\\r\\nNBC went to sitcom director James Burrows to see what he thought of the homosexual subject matter and if an audience would be interested in the show.[31] Burrows liked the idea and when he first read the script in November 1997, he decided that he wanted to direct it. Burrows said, \\"I knew that the boys had captured a genre and a group of characters I have never read before.\\"[25] The filming of the pilot began in March 15, 1998. The actors behind Will and Grace, Eric McCormack and Debra Messing, were positive about the series and they thought it had the potential to last long on television. McCormack said: \\"When shooting was finished that night, Debra and I were sitting on the couch and looking at each other and I said, Were gonna be on this set for a while. And we sort of clasped hands, but we didnt want to say anything beyond that and jinx it.\\"[32]\\r\\nThe part of Will Truman went to Eric McCormack, who was the first actor cast in the series.[30] Having played gay characters several times in his career, McCormack did not have a problem with it and thought his character could become a \\"poster boy for some gay movement\\", like DeGeneres became a spokesperson with her character.[33] Sean Hayes was invited to audition for Jack after a NBC casting executive saw him in a role in the indie gay romance film Billy's Hollywood Screen Kiss. Even though Hayes enjoyed the script when he read it, he threw it away and decided not to try out for the audition until he was sent the script again.[34] Megan Mullally initially auditioned for the role of Grace Adler, but admitted that she did not want to audition for the part of Karen.[35] By contrast, Debra Messing, with whom Mullally had first worked on Ned & Stacey, was initially unsure if she wanted to play the role of Grace.[36] The last actor to be cast, she later admitted that director Burrows was the reason for doing Will & Grace.[31]\\r\\nIn January 2017, NBC closed a deal for a new 10-episode season of the series, which is airing during the 2017-18 season. Hayes will executive produce this season as well as creators/executive producers Max Mutchnick and David Kohan. Veteran director James Burrows is on board to direct and executive produce.[37] In April 2017, the episode order was increased to 12 episodes.[38] In August 2017, it was extended again to 16 episodes, and a second 13-episode season was ordered.[39] The revival is filmed at Stage 22 at Universal Studios Hollywood, as opposed to Stage 17 at CBS Studio Center.\\r\\nIn December 2003, in the midst of the series' sixth season, executive producers and creators David Kohan and Max Mutchnick sued NBC and NBC Studios. Alleging that the network sold the rights to the series in an attempt to keep profits within the NBC family, Kohan and Mutchnick felt that they were cheated out of considerable profits by the network's not shopping of the show to the highest bidder. Another allegation against the network was that during the first four seasons of the series, the studio licensed the rights for amounts that were insufficient for covering production costs, thus leading to extraordinarily large production deficits.[40] Three months later, NBC filed a countersuit against Kohan and Mutchnick stating that the co-creators were expected to act as an independent third party in the negotiations between NBC and its subsidiary, NBC Studios (since subsumed into Universal Television).[41]\\r\\nWith a pending lawsuit and production beginning on other projects, Kohan and Mutchnick were absent on the Will & Grace set for most of its final seasons. They wrote the season 4 episode, \\"A Buncha White Chicks Sittin' Around Talkin'\\" and did not return to the writers' seat until the series finale four years later. Three years after NBC's countersuit and one year after the series ended, the legal battle between NBC and Kohan and Mutchnick ended in 2007 when all parties agreed on a settlement, with the series creators being awarded $49 million, of their original $65 million lawsuit.[42]\\r\\nWill & Grace entered off-network syndication in the fall of 2002 and aired locally till 2008. In 2002 WGN America acquired the cable rights to air the series, where it aired until 2005 when Lifetime Television acquired the cable rights to air the series. After eight years and the expiration of Lifetime's contract, the rights to the series were picked up by WeTV and Logo TV in the fall of 2013. The streaming service Hulu later picked up the show, in anticipation of the show's revival in the fall of 2017.\\r\\nIn the United Kingdom, the series was aired on Channel 4 up until its season finale in 2006. It was confirmed on 4 December 2017 that the series would premiere in January 2018 on Channel 5,\\r\\nThe show garnered a fair amount of criticism and negative reviews upon its debut in 1998, most of which compared the show to the recently canceled ABC sitcom Ellen. Some called it \\"a gay Seinfeld\\". One such review said, \\"If Will & Grace can somehow survive a brutal time period opposite football and Ally McBeal, it could grow into a reasonably entertaining little anomaly ÿ that is, a series about a man and a woman who have no sexual interest in one another. But don't bet on it. If it's doomed relationships viewers want, they'll probably opt for Ally.\\"[43] As popular as the show came to be, particularly among gay viewers, Will & Grace continuously dealt with criticism for having a limited view of the gay community and for reinforcing stereotypes when some felt it should have torn them down.[44]\\r\\nThe series finale was heavily promoted by NBC, and McCormack, Messing, Mullally and Hayes appeared on The Oprah Winfrey Show and The Today Show to bid farewell, on May 10 and 18, respectively. NBC devoted a two-hour block in its primetime schedule on May 18, 2006, for the Will & Grace send-off. An hour-long series retrospective, \\"Say Goodnight, Gracie\\", featuring interviews with the cast, crew, and guest stars, preceded the hour-long series finale. Series creators and executive producers Kohan and Mutchnick, who had not served as writers since the season 4 finale, penned the script for \\"The Finale\\". Regarding the finale, Mutchnick stated, \\"We wrote about what you want to have happen with people you love... All the things that matter in life, they end up having.\\"[45]\\r\\nThe ninth season was met with generally positive reviews. On Rotten Tomatoes the season has a rating of 86% based on 37 reviews, with an average rating of 7.3/10. The sites critical consensus reads, \\"Will & Grace reunites its ever-hilarious cast for a revival season that picks up right where the show left off 11 years ago -- adding a fresh relevance and a series of stories that make sharply funny use of the passage of time.\\"[46] On Metacritic, the season has a weighted average score of 73 out of 100, based on 26 critics, indicating \\"generally favorable reviews\\".[47]\\r\\nWill & Grace was nominated for 83 Primetime Emmy Awards, winning 16 of them. McCormack, Messing, Hayes, and Mullally each won at least one Emmy Award for their respective performances. Mullally also won a second time for her performance in 2006, a year when Will & Grace was nominated for 10 Emmys for its final season. The year before, the show had garnered 15 nominations, tied with Desperate Housewives as the series receiving the most nominations. This was almost an all-time record; the two shows were second behind The Larry Sanders Show, with 16 nominations in 1996.\\r\\nWith three each, both Hayes and Mullally held the record of winning the most Screen Actors Guild Awards for the categories Best Performance by an Actor in a Comedy Series and Best Performance by an Actress in a Comedy Series, respectively, for their roles in Will & Grace; however, Tina Fey went on to tie with Mullally and Alec Baldwin went on to surpass Hayes, both for their roles on the series 30 Rock. Will & Grace has won several GLAAD Media Awards for its advocacy of the gay community. Despite more than two dozen nominations, Will & Grace never won a Golden Globe Award.\\r\\nThe show debuted on Mondays beginning on September 21, 1998 and steadily gained in popularity, culminating when it moved to Thursday night as part of NBC's Must See TV line-up. The show ultimately became a highly rated television show in the United States, earning a top-twenty rating during four of its eight seasons, including one season at # 9. From 2001ÿ2005, Will & Grace was the highest-rated sitcom among adults 18ÿ49. However, when the show lost Friends as its lead-in after the 2003ÿ04 season, Will & Grace began shedding viewers and slipped out of the top 20 during its last two seasons.\\r\\n\\"The Finale\\" drew over 18 million viewers,[48][49] ranking # 8 for the week, easily making it the most watched episode of the final two seasons. While the series finale is considered a ratings success, it is far from being the most watched episode of Will & Gracethat accolade remains with the season four episode \\"A Chorus Lie\\", which aired on February 7, 2002 and ranked #8 for the week. When the show was at the height of its popularity (seasons 3ÿ5), ranking in the Top 10 was a common occurrence, but the finale's Top 10 rank was the only such rank for season 8 and the first such rank since the season 7 premiere \\"FYI: I Hurt, Too\\".\\r\\nThe series was the first prime-time television series on U.S. terrestrial television to star openly gay lead characters, making it the highest-profile presence of LGBT characters on U.S. broadcast television since Ellen's eponymous lead character's coming-out in the 1997 \\"Puppy Episode\\". It has also been heralded as responsible for opening the door to a string of gay-themed television programs, such as Queer as Folk, Queer Eye for the Straight Guy and Boy Meets Boy.\\r\\nIn May 2012, during a Meet the Press interview with host David Gregory, U.S. Vice President Joe Biden cited the series as an influence in American thinking regarding LGBT rights, saying, \\"I think Will & Grace did more to educate the American public than almost anything anybody has ever done. People fear that which is different. Now they're beginning to understand.\\"[58] In the same interview, Biden stated that he was \\"absolutely comfortable\\" with same-sex marriage, a statement which was followed on May 9 by President Barack Obama's speaking in favor of it.[59] The day after Obama's statement, series co-creator Mutchnick later told CBS This Morning that Biden had spoken similar words at a private function which Mutchnick and his husband had attended two weeks prior to Biden's statement, although a White House official was cited by CBS This Morning's Bill Plante as asserting that the Meet the Press interview was not a \\"trial balloon\\" for the statement.[60] Both Mutchnick and Kohan praised Biden's statement, but were critical of Obama's stance on marriage during the time between Biden's and Obama's statements.[61]\\r\\nIn 2004, the cast of the show were listed in Bravo's 100 Greatest TV Characters.[62] In 2012, The Washington Post ranked Will & Grace the ninth-best NBC comedy of all time.[63]\\r\\nIn 2014, scripts, props, and set decor from Will & Grace were donated to the National Museum of American History, which is part of the Smithsonian.[64]\\r\\nLionsgate Home Entertainment has released all eight seasons of Will & Grace on DVD in Region 1, 2 and 4. The show was re-released and re-packaged on October 3, 2011 on region 2.\\r\\nIt had been announced that Megan Mullally would be creating and starring in a new Broadway musical entitled Karen: The Musical. This musical would have had Mullally reprising her role of Karen Walker. She stated in an interview that the show may also involve recurring guest star Leslie Jordan in his role as Beverley Leslie, with a story revolving around their rivalry.[66]\\r\\nAccording to Mullally, the project was cancelled due to the rights to the Karen character being withdrawn. Mullally stated to have already gained approval from the network, as well as having the Broadway production company Fox Theatricals, director and choreographer Casey Nicholaw and composer Jeff Blumenkrantz all lined up to participate in the production, before certain stakeholders in the Karen Walker character withdrew the rights for its use in the production.[67]\\r\\nThere had been talk in 2008 that a spin-off was being developed by NBC entitled Jack & Karen, featuring Sean Hayes and Megan Mullally reprising their roles. Hayes initially showed interest in the spin-off but was ultimately put off by the short-lived Friends spin-off, Joey. Furthermore, Mullally's new work schedule in the form of her talk show, which was canceled several months later, did not allow her to pursue the spin-off at the time.[68]\\r\\nOn September 26, 2016, the main castMcCormack, Messing, Hayes, and Mullally, plus Morrison in a cameo rolereunited for a 10-minute web special, urging Americans to vote in the 2016 presidential election.[8] In the special, Karen, an avid Donald Trump supporter, tries to persuade Jack to vote for Trump, while Will and Grace, both avid Hillary Clinton supporters, try to persuade him to vote for Clinton. At the end, Will reveals that singer Katy Perry is a supporter of Clinton, which persuades Jack to vote for Clinton.","input":"Who are the writers of will and grace?"},{"output":"a renewal of language through extreme reduction","context":"\\"Oread\\" is a poem by Hilda Doolittle, originally published under the name H. D. Imagiste.\\r\\n\\"Oread\\", one of her earliest and best-known poems, which was first published in the 1915 anthology,[which?] serves to illustrate this early style well. The title Oread (cf. Oread) was added after the poem was first written, to suggest that a nymph was ordering up the sea.\\r\\n\\"Oread\\" may serve to illustrate some prominent features of Imagist poetry. Rejecting the rhetorics of Late Romanticism and Victorianism, the Imagists aimed at a renewal of language through extreme reduction. This reduction is what Ezra Pound had in mind, when he wrote, counseling future poets: \\"use no superfluous word, no adjective, which does not reveal something\\".[1]\\r\\nIn this poem, the reduction is brought to such an extreme that two images are superimposed on each other, depriving the reader of the possibility to determine, which is the \\"primary\\" one. The two image domains relevant here are the sea and the forest. The Oread, apparently the speaker of the poem, expresses her wish that the sea unite with the land. But while from the first line it seems clear that the sea is addressed, the second line counters this impression with the \\"pointed pines\\" of a forest. The anaphoric link between the first two lines and the use of epistrophe in the second and third lines enhance the connection between the two domains and much the same might be said about the expression \\"pools of fir\\" in the last line.\\r\\nAnother way of putting this is to grasp the poem as one single metaphor. A metaphor usually consists of three elements: the \\"tenor\\" (target), a \\"vehicle\\" (source) and the \\"tertium comparationis\\" (some common ground that exists between target and source domain). Here, however, it is not possible to identify target and source beyond individual words. Both forest and sea might represent each of these two elements, and the green color of either forest and sea might be one plausible \\"tertium comparationis\\" for the metaphor.\\r\\nIn fusing the images of forest and sea in such a way, the poem seems to accomplish the speaker's wish of unison between sea and land. In doing so, it is however in danger of abolishing the specificity of each of them. Neither is the sea a forest, nor the other way around, as metaphor would seem to suggest. While presenting a forceful image, in the sense of Pound's definition (\\"an Image is that which presents an intellectual and emotional complex in an instant of time\\" [2]), the poem seems to be shrewdly aware that linguistic representation will always distort and refract its referent.","input":"How is oread by hd an imagist poem?"},{"output":"10-11","context":"Fifth grade (called Grade 5 in some regions) is a year of education in many nations.

The installation borders the towns of Fayetteville, Spring Lake and Southern Pines. It was also a census-designated place in the 2010 Census, during which a population of 39,457 was identified. It is named for Confederate General Braxton Bragg. It covers over 251 square miles (650?km2). It is the home of the Army's XVIII Airborne Corps and is the headquarters of the United States Army Special Operations Command, which oversees the U.S. Army 1st Special Forces Command (Airborne) (Provisional) and 75th Ranger Regiment.[2] It is also home to the U.S. Army Forces Command, U.S. Army Reserve Command, and Womack Army Medical Center. Fort Bragg maintains two airfields: Pope Field, where the United States Air Force stations global airlift and special operations assets as well as the Air Force Combat Control School, and Simmons Army Airfield, where Army aviation units support the needs of airborne and special operations forces on post.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCamp Bragg was established in 1918 as an artillery training ground. The Chief of Field Artillery, General William J. Snow, was seeking an area having suitable terrain, adequate water, rail facilities and a climate for year-round training, and he decided that the area now known as Fort Bragg met all of the desired criteria.[4] Camp Bragg was named to honor a native North Carolinian, Braxton Bragg, who commanded Confederate States Army forces in the Civil War.\\r\\nThe aim was for six artillery brigades to be stationed there and $6,000,000 was spent on the land and cantonments.[5] There was an airfield on the camp used by aircraft and balloons for artillery spotters. The airfield was named Pope Field on April 1, 1919, in honor of First Lieutenant Harley H. Pope,[5] an airman who was killed while flying nearby. The work on the camp was finished on November 1, 1919.[5]\\r\\nThe original plan for six brigades was abandoned after World War I ended[5] and once demobilization had started. The artillery men, their equipment and material from Camp McClellan, Alabama, were moved over to Fort Bragg and testing began on long-range weapons that were a product of the war.[5] The six artillery brigades were reduced to two cantonments and a garrison was to be built for Army troops as well as a National Guard training center.[5] In early 1921 two field artillery units, the 13th and 17th Field Artillery Brigades, began training at Camp Bragg. The same year, the Long Street Church and six acres of property were acquired for the reservation.[6] The church was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1974.[7]\\r\\nDue to the post-war cutbacks, the camp was nearly closed for good when the War department issued orders to close the camp on August 7, 1921. General Albert J. Bowley was commander at the camp and after much campaigning, and getting the Secretary of War to visit the camp, the closing order was cancelled on September 16, 1921. The Field Artillery Board was transferred to Fort Bragg on February 1, 1922.\\r\\nCamp Bragg was renamed Fort Bragg, to signify becoming a permanent Army post, on September 30, 1922. From 1923 to 1924 permanent structures were constructed on Fort Bragg, including four barracks.[5]\\r\\nBy 1940, during World War II, the population of Fort Bragg had reached 5,400; however, in the following year, that number ballooned to 67,000. Various units trained at Fort Bragg during World War II, including the 9th Infantry Division, 2nd Armored Division, 82nd Airborne Division, 100th Infantry Division, and various field artillery groups. The population reached a peak of 159,000 during the war years.[8]\\r\\nFollowing World War II, the 82nd Airborne Division was permanently stationed at Fort Bragg, the only large unit there for some time. In July 1951, the XVIII Airborne Corps was reactivated at Fort Bragg. Fort Bragg became a center for unconventional warfare, with the creation of the Psychological Warfare Center in April 1952, followed by the 10th Special Forces Group.[9]\\r\\nIn 1961, the 5th Special Forces Group (Airborne) was activated at Fort Bragg, with the mission of training counter-insurgency forces in Southeast Asia. Also in 1961, the \\"Iron Mike\\" statue, a tribute to all Airborne soldiers, past, present and future, was dedicated. In early 1962 the 326 Army Security Agency Company, de-activated after the Korean War, was reactivated at Ft. Bragg under XVIII Corps. In August of that year, an operational contingent of that Company was relocated to Homestead AFB Florida, due to the Cuban Missile Crisis. Circa 1963, that contingent was re-assigned to the newly created USASA 6th Field Station. [10] More than 200,000 young men underwent basic combat training here during the period 1966ÿ70. At the peak of the Vietnam War in 1968, Fort Bragg's military population rose to 57,840. In June 1972, the 1st Corps Support Command arrived at Fort Bragg.[11]\\r\\nIn the 1980s, there was a series of deployments of tenant units to the Caribbean, first to Grenada in 1983, Honduras in 1988, and to Panama in 1989. The 5th Special Forces Group departed Fort Bragg in the late 1980s.[12]\\r\\nIn 1990, the XVIII Airborne Corps and the 82nd Airborne Division deployed to Saudi Arabia in support of Operation Desert Shield and Operation Desert Storm. In the mid- and late 1990s, there was increased modernization of the facilities in Fort Bragg. The World War II wooden barracks were largely removed, a new main post exchange was built, and Devers Elementary School was opened, along with several other projects.[13]\\r\\nAs a result of campaigns in Afghanistan and Iraq, the units on Fort Bragg have seen a sizeable increase to their operations tempo (OPTEMPO), with units conducting two, three, or even four or more deployments to combat zones. As directed by law, and in accordance with the recommendations of the 2005 Base Realignment and Closure Commission, Fort McPherson, Georgia, closed and U.S. Army Forces Command and U.S. Army Reserve Command relocated to Fort Bragg, North Carolina. A new FORSCOM/U.S. Army Reserve Command Headquarters facility completed construction at Fort Bragg in June 2011. Forces Command hosted June 24, 2011 an Army \\"Casing of the Colors\\" ceremony on Fort McPherson and an \\"uncasing of colors ceremony\\" on August 1, 2011, at Fort Bragg. On March 1, 2011, Pope Field, the former Pope Air Force Base, was absorbed into Fort Bragg.\\r\\nThe major commands at the installation are the United States Army Forces Command, the United States Army Reserve Command, and the United States Army Special Operations Command. Several airborne and special operations units of the United States Army are stationed at Fort Bragg, notably the 82nd Airborne Division, the 3rd Special Forces Group (Airborne), and the Delta Force. The latter is controlled by the Joint Special Operations Command, based at Pope Field within Fort Bragg.\\r\\nFort Bragg is at 358'21\\" north, 7859'57\\" west (35.139064, ?78.999143).[14]\\r\\nAccording to the United States Census Bureau, the post has a total area of 19.0?square miles (49.2?km2), of which, 19.0?square miles (49.1?km2) of it is land and 0.1?square miles (0.2?km2) of it is water.

St. Francis' satyr is found in wetland habitat dominated by graminoids and sedges such as abandoned beaver dams or along streams with beavers.\\r\\nFort Bragg fever, a bacterial zoonotic disease, has been named after it, in reference to an outbreak in 1942.\\r\\nIn 1990, the endangered red-cockaded woodpecker came under the protection of the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. This caused a tremendous problem for Fort Bragg, where many of these birds lived. Training stopped, ranges were closed, and troops were temporarily moved to other installations for training.\\r\\nThe Army and the conservationists eventually came to an agreement, which put in place training restrictions around the woodpeckers' habitat. White stripes were painted on trees to indicate the location of the habitats, and restrictions limited the scope and duration of training that could take place within 200 feet of these locations.\\r\\nToday, the clusters of woodpeckers has more than doubled in size (200 to 493), and many of the training restrictions have been lifted.[15]\\r\\nAs of the census[3] of 2000, there are 29,183 people, 4,315 households, and 4,215 families residing on the base.

It is estimated that there were about 14,000ÿ21,000 Powhatan people in eastern Virginia when the English settled Jamestown in 1607.[2] They were also known as Virginia Algonquians, as they spoke an eastern-Algonquian language known as Powhatan or Virginia Algonquian.\\r\\nIn the late 16th and early 17th centuries, a mamanatowick (paramount chief) named Wahunsunacawh (a.k.a. Powhatan), created a powerful organization by affiliating 30 tributary peoples, whose territory was much of eastern Virginia. They called this area Tsenacommacah (\\"densely inhabited Land\\"). Wahunsunacawh came to be known by the English as \\"Powhatan\\".[3][4] Each of the tribes within this organization had its own weroance (chief), but all paid tribute to Powhatan.[5]\\r\\nAfter Powhatan's death in 1618, hostilities with colonists escalated under the chiefdom of his brother, Opechancanough, who sought in vain to drive off the encroaching English. His large-scale attacks in 1622 and 1644 met strong reprisals by the English, resulting in the near elimination of the tribe. By 1646, what is called the Powhatan Paramount Chiefdom by modern historians had been decimated. More important than the ongoing conflicts with the English settlements was the high rate of deaths the Powhatan suffered due to new infectious diseases carried to North America by Europeans, such as measles and smallpox. The Native Americans did not have any immunity to these, which had been endemic in Europe and Asia for centuries. The wholesale deaths greatly weakened and hollowed out the Native American societies.\\r\\nBy the mid-17th century, the leaders of the colony were desperate for labor to develop the land. Almost half of the English and European immigrants arrived as indentured servants. As settlement continued, the colonists imported growing numbers of enslaved Africans for labor. By 1700, the colonies had about 6,000 black slaves, one-twelfth of the population. It was common for black slaves to escape and join the surrounding Powhatan; some white servants were also noted to have joined the Indians. Africans and whites worked and lived together; some natives also intermarried with them. After Bacon's Rebellion in 1676, the colony enslaved Indians for control. In 1691, the House of Burgesses abolished Indian slavery; however, many Powhatan were held in servitude well into the 18th century.[6]\\r\\nIn the 21st century, eight Indian tribes are officially recognized by Virginia as having ancestral ties to the Powhatan confederation.[7] The Pamunkey and Mattaponi are the only two peoples who have retained reservation lands from the 17th century.[5] The Powhatan Renape Nation has been recognized by the state of New Jersey.[8] The competing cultures of the Powhatan and English settlers were united through unions and marriages of members, of which the most well known was that of Pocahontas and John Rolfe. Their son Thomas Rolfe was the ancestor of many Virginians; many of the First Families of Virginia have both English and Virginia Indian ancestry.[1]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe name \\"Powhatan\\" (also transcribed by Strachey as Paqwachowng) is the name of the native village or town of Wahunsunacawh. The title \\"Chief\\" or \\"King\\" Powhatan, used by the English is believed to have been derived from the name of this site. Although the specific site of his home village is unknown, in modern times the Powhatan Hill neighborhood in the East End portion of the modern-day city of Richmond, Virginia is thought by many to be in the general vicinity of the original village. Tree Hill Farm, which is situated in nearby Henrico County a short distance to the east, is also considered as the possible site.\\r\\n\\"Powhatan\\" was also the name used by the natives to refer to the river where the town sat at the head of navigation. The English colonists chose to name it for their own leader, King James I. The English colonists named many features in the early years of the Virginia Colony in honor of the king, as well as for his three children, Elizabeth, Henry, and Charles.\\r\\nAlthough portions of Virginia's longest river upstream from Columbia were much later named for Queen Anne of Great Britain, in modern times, it is called the James River. It forms at the confluence of the Jackson and Cowpasture rivers near the present-day town of Clifton Forge, flowing east to Hampton Roads. (The Rivanna River, a tributary of the James River, and Fluvanna County, were named in reference to Queen Anne). The only water body in Virginia to retain a name related to the Powhatan peoples is Powhatan Creek, located in James City County near Williamsburg.\\r\\nPowhatan County and its county seat at Powhatan, Virginia were honorific names established years later, in locations west of the area populated by the Powhatan peoples. The county was formed in May 1777.\\r\\nVarious tribes each held some individual powers locally, and each had a chief known as a weroance (male) or, more rarely, a weroansqua (female), meaning \\"commander\\".[9]\\r\\nAs early as the era of John Smith, the individual tribes of this grouping were clearly recognized by the English as falling under the greater authority of the centralized power led by the chiefdom of Powhatan (c. June 17, 1545 ÿ c. 1618), whose proper name was Wahunsenacawh or (in 17th century English spelling) Wahunsunacock.[10]\\r\\nAt the time of the 1607 English Settlement at Jamestown, he ruled primarily from Werowocomoco, which was located on the northern shore of the York River. This site of Werowocomoco was rediscovered in the early 21st century; it was central to the tribes of the confederacy. The improvements discovered at the site during archaeological research have confirmed that Powhatan had a paramount chiefdom over the other tribes in the power hierarchy. Anthropologist Robert L. Carneiro in his The Chiefdom: Precursor of the State. The Transition to Statehood in the New World (1981), deeply explores the political structure of the chiefdom and confederacy.\\r\\nPowhatan (and his several successors) ruled what is called a complex chiefdom, referred to by scholars as the Powhatan Paramount Chiefdom. Research work continues at Werowocomoco and elsewhere that deepens understanding of the Powhatan world.\\r\\nWahunsunacawh had inherited control over six tribes, but dominated more than thirty by 1607, when the English settlers established their Virginia Colony at Jamestown. The original six tribes under Wahunsunacock were: the Powhatan (proper), the Arrohateck, the Appamattuck, the Pamunkey, the Mattaponi, and the Chiskiack.\\r\\nHe added the Kecoughtan to his fold by 1598. Some other affiliated groups included the ]Rappahannocks, Moraughtacund, Weyanoak, Paspahegh, Quiyoughcohannock, Warraskoyack, and Nansemond. Another closely related tribe of the same language group was the Chickahominy, but they managed to preserve their autonomy from the Powhatan Paramount Chiefdom. The Accawmacke, located on the Eastern Shore across the Chesapeake Bay, were nominally tributary to the Powhatan Chiefdom, but enjoyed autonomy under their own Paramount Chief or \\"Emperor\\", Debedeavon (aka \\"The Laughing King\\").\\r\\nIn his Notes on the State of Virginia (1781ÿ82), Thomas Jefferson estimated that the Powhatan Confederacy occupied about 8,000 square miles (20,000?km2) of territory, with a population of about 8,000 people, of whom 2400 were warriors.[11] Later scholars estimated the total population of the paramountcy as 15,000.\\r\\nThe Powhatan Confederacy was where the English made their first permanent settlement in North America. Conflicts began immediately between the Powhatan people and the English; the English colonists fired shots as soon as they arrived (due to a bad experience they had with the Spanish prior to their arrival). Within two weeks of the English arrival at Jamestown, deaths had occurred.\\r\\nThe settlers had hoped for friendly relations and had planned to trade with the Virginia Indians for food. Captain Christopher Newport led the first English exploration party up the James River in 1607, when he met Parahunt, weroance of the Powhatan proper. The English initially mistook him for the paramount Powhatan (mamanatowick), his father Wahunsunacawh, who ruled the confederacy.\\r\\nOn a hunting and trade mission on the Chickahominy River in December 1607, Captain John Smith, later president of the colony, was captured by Opechancanough, the younger brother of Wahunsunacawh. Smith became the first Englishman to meet the paramount chief Powhatan. According to Smith's account, Pocahontas, the Powhatan's daughter, prevented her father from executing Smith.\\r\\nSome researchers have asserted that a mock execution of Smith was a ritual intended to adopt Smith into the tribe, but other modern writers dispute this interpretation. They point out that nothing is known of 17th-century Powhatan adoption ceremonies. They note that an execution ritual is different from known rites of passage. Other historians, such as Helen Rountree, have questioned whether there was any risk of execution. They note that Smith failed to mention it in his 1608 and 1612 accounts, and only added it to his 1624 memoir, after Pocahontas had become famous.\\r\\nIn 1608, Captain Newport realized that Powhatan's friendship was crucial to the survival of the small Jamestown colony. In the summer of that year, he tried to \\"crown\\" the paramount Chief, with a ceremonial crown, to make him an English \\"vassal.\\"[12] They also gave Powhatan many European gifts, such as a pitcher, feather mattress, bed frame, and clothes. The coronation went badly because they asked Powhatan to kneel to receive the crown, which he refused to do. As a powerful leader, Powhatan followed two rules: \\"he who keeps his head higher than others ranks higher,\\" and \\"he who puts other people in a vulnerable position, without altering his own stance, ranks higher.\\" To finish the \\"coronation\\", several English had to lean on Powhatan's shoulders to get him low enough to place the crown on his head, as he was a tall man. Afterwards, the English might have thought that Powhatan had submitted to King James, whereas Powhatan likely thought nothing of the sort.[13]\\r\\nAfter John Smith became president of the colony, he sent a force under Captain Martin to occupy an island in Nansemond territory and drive the inhabitants away. At the same time, he sent another force with Francis West to build a fort at the James River falls. He purchased the nearby fortified Powhatan village (present site of Richmond, Virginia) from Parahunt for some copper and an English servant named Henry Spelman, who wrote a rare firsthand account of the Powhatan ways of life. Smith then renamed the village \\"Nonsuch\\", and tried to get West's men to live in it. Both these attempts at settling beyond Jamestown soon failed, due to Powhatan resistance. Smith left Virginia for England in October 1609, never to return, because of an injury sustained in a gunpowder accident. Soon afterward, the English established a second fort, Fort Algernon, in Kecoughtan territory.\\r\\nIn November 1609, Captain John Ratcliffe was invited to Orapakes, Powhatan's new capital. After he had sailed up the Pamunkey River to trade there, a fight broke out between the colonists and the Powhatan. All of the English ashore were killed, including Ratcliffe, who was tortured by the women of the tribe. Those aboard the pinnace escaped and told the tale at Jamestown.\\r\\nDuring that next year, the tribe attacked and killed many Jamestown residents. The residents fought back, but only killed twenty. However, arrival at Jamestown of a new Governor, Thomas West, 3rd Baron De La Warr, (Lord Delaware) in June 1610 signalled the beginning of the First Anglo-Powhatan War. A brief period of peace came only after the capture of Pocahontas, her baptism, and her marriage to tobacco planter John Rolfe in 1614. Within a few years both Powhatan and Pocahontas were dead. Powhatan died in Virginia, but Pocahontas died while in England. Meanwhile, the English settlers continued to encroach on Powhatan territory.\\r\\nAfter Wahunsunacawh's death, his younger brother, Opitchapam, briefly became chief, followed by their younger brother Opechancanough. In 1622 (Indian massacre of 1622) and 1644 he attacked the English to force them from Powhatan territories. Both these attempts were met with strong reprisals from the English, ultimately resulting in the near destruction of the tribe. The Second AngloÿPowhatan War that followed the 1644 incident ended in 1646, after Royal Governor of Virginia William Berkeley's forces captured Opechancanough, thought to be between 90 and 100 years old. While a prisoner, Opechancanough was killed, shot in the back by a soldier assigned to guard him. He was succeeded as Weroance by Necotowance, and later by Totopotomoi and by his daughter Cockacoeske.\\r\\nThe Treaty of 1646 marked the effective dissolution of the united confederacy, as white colonists were granted an exclusive enclave between the York and Blackwater Rivers. This physically separated the Nansemonds, Weyanokes and Appomattox, who retreated southward, from the other Powhatan tribes then occupying the Middle Peninsula and Northern Neck. While the southern frontier demarcated in 1646 was respected for the remainder of the 17th century, the House of Burgesses lifted the northern one on September 1, 1649. Waves of new immigrants quickly flooded the peninsular region, then known as Chickacoan, and restricted the dwindling tribes to lesser tracts of land that became some of the earliest Indian reservations.\\r\\nIn 1665, the House of Burgesses passed stringent laws requiring the Powhatan to accept chiefs appointed by the governor. After the Treaty of Albany in 1684, the Powhatan Confederacy all but vanished.\\r\\nThe capital village of \\"Powhatan\\" was believed to be in the present-day Powhatan Hill section of the eastern part of Richmond, Virginia, or perhaps nearby in a location which became part of Tree Hill Farm.\\r\\nAnother major center of the confederacy about 75 miles (121?km) to the east was called Werowocomoco. It was located near the north bank of the York River in present-day Gloucester County.\\r\\nWerowocomoco was described by the English colonists as only 15 miles (24?km) as the crow flies from Jamestown, but also described as 25 miles (40?km) downstream from present-day West Point, measurements which conflict with each other. In 2003 archaeologists initiated excavations at a site in Gloucester County that have revealed an extensive indigenous settlement from about 1200 (the late Woodland period) through the early Contact period. Work since then has added to their belief that this is the location of Werowocomoco. The site is on a farm bordering on Purtain Bay of the York River, about 12 nautical miles (22?km) from Jamestown. The more than 50 acres (200,000?m2) residential settlement extends up to 1,000 feet (300?m) back from the river. In 2004, researchers excavated two curving ditches of 200 feet (60?m) at the far edge, which were constructed about 1400 CE. In addition to extensive artifacts from hundreds of years of indigenous settlement, researchers have found a variety of trade goods related to the brief interaction of Native Americans and English in the early years of Jamestown.\\r\\nAround 1609, Wahunsunacock shifted his capital from Werowocomoco to Orapakes, located in a swamp at the head of the Chickahominy River, near the modern-day interchange of Interstate 64 and Interstate 295. Sometime between 1611 and 1614, he moved further north to Matchut, in present-day King William County on the north bank of the Pamunkey River, not far from where his brother Opechancanough ruled one of the member tribes at Youghtanund.\\r\\nThe Powhatan lived east of the fall line in Tidewater Virginia. They built their houses, called yehakins, by bending saplings and placing woven mats or bark over top of the saplings. They supported themselves primarily by growing crops, especially maize, but they also fished and hunted in the great forest in their area. Villages consisted of a number of related families organized in tribes led by a chief (weroance/werowance or weroansqua if female). They paid tribute to the paramount chief (mamanatowick), Powhatan.[3]\\r\\nAccording to research by the National Park Service, Powhatan \\"men were warriors and hunters, while women were gardeners and gatherers. The English described the men, who ran and walked extensively through the woods in pursuit of enemies or game, as tall and lean and possessed of handsome physiques. The women were shorter, and were strong because of the hours they spent tending crops, pounding corn into meal, gathering nuts, and performing other domestic chores. When the men undertook extended hunts, the women went ahead of them to construct hunting camps. The Powhatan domestic economy depended on the labor of both sexes.\\" [14]\\r\\nAll of Virginia's natives practiced agriculture. They periodically moved their villages from site to site. Villagers cleared the fields by felling, girdling, or firing trees at the base and then using fire to reduce the slash and stumps. A village became unusable as soil productivity gradually declined and local fish and game were depleted. The inhabitants then moved on. With every change in location, the people used fire to clear new land. They left more cleared land behind. The natives also used fire to maintain extensive areas of open game habitat throughout the East, later called \\"barrens\\" by European colonists. The Powhatan also had rich fishing grounds. Bison had migrated to this area by the early 15th century.[15]\\r\\nAs of 2014, the state of Virginia has recognized eight Powhatan Indian-descended tribes in Virginia. Collectively, the tribes currently have 3,000-3,500 enrolled tribal members.[16] It is estimated, however, that 3 to 4 times that number are eligible for tribal membership.[12] Two of these tribes, the Mattaponi and Pamunkey, still retain their reservations from the 17th century and are located in King William County, Virginia.\\r\\nSince the 1990s, the Powhatan Indian tribes which have state recognition, along with other Virginia Indian tribes which have state recognition, have been seeking federal recognition. That recognition process has proved difficult as it has been hampered by the lack of official records to verify heritage and by the historical misclassification of family members in the 1930s and 1940s, largely a result of Virginia's state policy of race classification on official documents.\\r\\nAfter Virginia passed stringent segregation laws in the early 20th century and ultimately the Racial Integrity Act of 1924 which mandated every person who had any African heritage be deemed black, Walter Plecker, the head of Vital Statistics office, directed all state and local registration offices to use only the terms \\"white\\" or \\"colored\\" to denote race on official documents and thereby eliminated all traceable records of Virginia Indians. All state documents, including birth certificates, death certificates, marriage licenses, tax forms and land deeds, thus bear no record of Virginia Indians. Plecker oversaw the Vital Statistics office in the state for more than 30 years, beginning in the early 20th century, and took a personal interest in eliminating traces of Virginia Indians. Plecker surmised that there were no true Virginia Indians remaining as years of intermarriage has diluted the race. Over his years of service, he conducted a campaign to reclassify all bi-racial and multi-racial individuals as black, believing such persons were fraudulently attempting to claim their race to be Indian or white. The effect of his reclassification has been described by tribal members as \\"paper genocide\\".[17]\\r\\nInitially, the Virginia tribes' efforts to gain federal recognition encountered resistance due to federal legislators' concerns over whether gambling would be established on their lands if recognition were granted. Casinos are illegal in Virginia and concerns were expressed about tax effects. In March 2009, five of the state-recognized Powhatan Indian tribes and the other state-recognized Virginia Indian tribe introduced a bill to gain federal recognition through an act of Congress. The bill, \\"The Thomasina E. Jordan Indian Tribes of Virginia Federal Recognition Act\\", included a section forbidding the tribes from opening casinos, even if casinos became legal in Virginia. The House Committee on Natural Resources recommended the bill be considered by the US House of Representatives at the end of April, and the House approved the bill on June 3, 2009. The bill was sent to the Senate's Committee on Indian Affairs, who recommended it be heard by the Senate as a whole in October. On December 23, 2009, the bill was placed on the Senate Legislative Calendar under general orders, which is where the bill is currently.[18][19] The bill had a hold on it placed for \\"jurisdictional concerns,\\" as Senator Tom Coburn (R-Ok) believes requests for tribal recognition should be processed through the Bureau of Indian Affairs. The Virginia tribes say that the disrupted record keeping under the racially discriminatory practices of Walter Plecker destroyed their ability to demonstrate historical continuity of identity.[20] The bill died in the Senate.\\r\\nIn February 2011, the six Virginia tribes started the process again to try to gain federal recognition. They introduced a bill in the US House of Representatives and a companion bill in the Senate on the same day.[21] As of April 2011, the bills are in the Senate Committee on Indian Affairs and the Subcommittee Indian and Alaska Native Affairs, respectively.[22][23]\\r\\nThe tribes of the Powhatan confederacy shared mutually intelligible Algonquian languages. The most common was likely Powhatan. Its use became dormant due to the widespread deaths and social disruption suffered by the peoples. Much of the vocabulary bank is forgotten. Attempts have been made to reconstruct the vocabulary of the language using sources such as word lists provided by Smith and by the 17th-century writer William Strachey.\\r\\nThe Powhatan Renape Nation are descendants of Powhatan peoples who migrated to present-day southern New Jersey, where they have been concentrated in the areas of Morrisville and Medford.[24] They have been officially recognized as an American Indian tribe by that state since 1980.[8] They have not been officially recognized by the U.S. government.[25]\\r\\nNo cognate of Renape was ever recorded for Virginia Algonquian, although the form Renapoaks was recorded for Carolina Algonquian by Ralph Lane in 1586 (as a term used by the inhabitants of Roanoke Island for all those on the mainland).[26]\\r\\nThe Powhatan Renape maintained a 237-acre (96?ha) reservation in Rancocas State Park from 1982 until 2011, when it was closed down due to lack of maintenance.[27][28][29]\\r\\nThe Powhatan people are featured in the Disney animated film Pocahontas (1995). They also appeared in the straight-to-video sequel Pocahontas II: Journey to a New World (1998). Some of the current members of Powhatan-descended tribes complained about the Disney film. Roy Crazy Horse of the Powhatan Renape Nation said the Disney movie \\"distorts history beyond recognition.\\"[30]\\r\\nAn attempt at a more historically accurate representation was the drama The New World (2005), directed by Terrence Malick, which had actors speaking a reconstructed Powhatan language devised by the linguist Blair Rudes. The Powhatan people generally criticize the film for continuing the myth of a romance between Pocahontas and John Smith. Her English husband was John Rolfe, whom she married on April 5, 1614.","input":"What brought the powhatan confederacy to an end?"},{"output":"eight","context":"\\r\\n\\r\\nHarry Potter is a British-American film series based on the Harry Potter novels by author J. K. Rowling. The series is distributed by Warner Bros. and consists of eight fantasy films, beginning with Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone (2001) and culminating with Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows ÿ Part 2 (2011).[2][3] A spin-off prequel series will consist of five films, starting with Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them (2016), marking the beginning of the Wizarding World shared media franchise.[4]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe series was mainly produced by David Heyman, and stars Daniel Radcliffe, Rupert Grint, and Emma Watson as the three leading characters: Harry Potter, Ron Weasley, and Hermione Granger. Four directors worked on the series: Chris Columbus, Alfonso Cuar܇n, Mike Newell, and David Yates.[5] Michael Goldenberg wrote the screenplay for Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix (2007), while the remaining films had their screenplays written by Steve Kloves. Production took place over ten years, with the main story arc following Harry Potter's quest to overcome his arch-enemy Lord Voldemort.[6]\\r\\n\\r\\nHarry Potter and the Deathly Hallows, the seventh and final novel in the series, was adapted into two feature-length parts.[7] Part 1 was released in November 2010, and Part 2 was released in July 2011.[8][9]\\r\\n\\r\\nSix of the series' eight films are among the 50 highest-grossing films of all time, with Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows ÿ Part 2, the highest-grossing film in the series and one of 31 films to gross over $1 billion, ranking at number eight.[10] Without inflation adjustment, it is the third highest-grossing film series with $7.7 billion in worldwide receipts.\\r\\n\\r\\nLate in 1997, film producer David Heyman's London offices received a copy of the first book in what would become Rowling's series of seven Harry Potter novels. The book, Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone, was relegated to a low-priority bookshelf, where it was discovered by a secretary who read it and gave it to Heyman with a positive review. Consequently, Heyman, who had originally disliked \\"the rubbish title\\", read the book himself. Highly impressed by Rowling's work, he began the process that led to one of the most successful cinematic franchises of all time.[11]\\r\\n\\r\\nHeyman's enthusiasm led to Rowling's 1999 sale of the film rights for the first four Harry Potter books to Warner Bros. for a reported S1 million (US$2,000,000).[12] A demand Rowling made was that the principal cast be kept strictly British, allowing nevertheless for the inclusion of many Irish actors, such as Richard Harris as Dumbledore, and for casting of French and Eastern European actors in Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire where characters from the book are specified as such.[13] Rowling was hesitant to sell the rights because she \\"didn't want to give them control over the rest of the story\\" by selling the rights to the characters, which would have enabled Warner Bros. to make non-author-written sequels.[14]\\r\\n\\r\\nAlthough Steven Spielberg initially negotiated to direct the first film, he declined the offer.[15] Spielberg wanted the adaptation to be an animated film, with American actor Haley Joel Osment providing Harry Potter's voice.[16][not in citation given] Spielberg contended that, in his opinion, there was every expectation of profit in making the film. He claims that making money would have been like \\"shooting ducks in a barrel. It's just a slam dunk. It's just like withdrawing a billion dollars and putting it into your personal bank accounts. There's no challenge\\".[17] In the \\"Rubbish\\" Bin section of her website, Rowling maintains that she had no role in choosing directors for the films, writing \\"Anyone who thinks I could (or would) have 'veto-ed' him [Spielberg] needs their Quick-Quotes Quill serviced.\\"[18]\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter Spielberg left, conversations began with other directors, including Chris Columbus, Jonathan Demme, Terry Gilliam, Mike Newell, Alan Parker, Wolfgang Petersen, Rob Reiner, Tim Robbins, Brad Silberling, and Peter Weir.[19] Petersen and Reiner both pulled out of the running in March 2000.[20] It was then narrowed down to Columbus, Gilliam, Parker, and Silberling.[21] Rowling's first choice was Terry Gilliam.[22] However, on 28 March 2000 Columbus was appointed as director of the film, with Warner Bros. citing his work on other family films such as Home Alone and Mrs. Doubtfire as influences for their decision.[23]\\r\\n\\r\\nHarry Potter is the kind of timeless literary achievement that comes around once in a lifetime. Since the books have generated such a passionate following across the world, it was important to us to find a director that has an affinity for both children and magic. I can't think of anyone more ideally suited for this job than Chris [Columbus].\\r\\nSteve Kloves was selected to write the screenplay for the first film. He described adapting the book as \\"tough\\" since it did not \\"lend itself to adaptation as well as the next two books\\". Kloves was sent a \\"raft\\" of synopses of books proposed as film adaptations, with Harry Potter being the only one that jumped out at him. He went out and bought the book, becoming an instant fan. When speaking to Warner Bros. he stated that the film had to be British and true to the characters.[24] David Heyman was confirmed to produce the film.[23] Rowling received a large amount of creative control for the film, an arrangement that Columbus did not mind.[25]\\r\\n\\r\\nWarner Bros. had initially planned to release the first film over the 4 July 2001 weekend, making for such a short production window that several of the originally proposed directors had withdrawn themselves from contention. Eventually, due to time constraints, the date was put back to 16 November 2001.[26]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 2000, after a seven-month search, lead actor Daniel Radcliffe was discovered by producer David Heyman and writer Steve Kloves seated just behind them in a theatre. In Heyman's own words, \\"There sitting behind me was this boy with these big blue eyes. It was Dan Radcliffe. I remember my first impressions: He was curious and funny and so energetic. There was real generosity too, and sweetness. But at the same time he was really voracious and with hunger for knowledge of whatever kind.\\"[11]\\r\\n\\r\\nRadcliffe had already established himself as an actor in the 1999 BBC television production of David Copperfield in which he played the title role's childhood years. Heyman persuaded Radcliffe's parents to allow him to audition for the part of Harry Potter, which involved Radcliffe being filmed.[11] (This screen test footage was released via the first set of Ultimate Editions in 2009.)[27] Rowling was enthusiastic after viewing Radcliffe's filmed test, saying she didn't think there was a better choice for the part of Harry Potter.[11][28]\\r\\n\\r\\nAlso in 2000, the then unknown British actors Emma Watson and Rupert Grint were selected from thousands of auditioning children to play the roles of Hermione Granger and Ron Weasley, respectively. Their only previous acting experience was in school plays. Grint was eleven years old and Watson ten at the time they were cast.[29]\\r\\n\\r\\nLos Angeles Times writer Geoff Boucher, who conducted the above-mentioned interview with Heyman, added that the casting of the three major roles \\"is especially impressive in hindsight. The trio's selection was arguably one of the best show-business decisions over the past decade... they have shown admirable grace and steadiness in the face of teen superstardom.\\"[11][28]\\r\\n\\r\\nFilming of the series began at Leavesden Studios, Hertfordshire, England, in September 2000 and ended in December 2010, with post-production on the final film lasting until summer 2011.[6] Leavesden Studios was the main base for filming Harry Potter, and it opened to the public as a studio tour in 2012 (renamed as Warner Bros. Studios, Leavesden).[30]\\r\\n\\r\\nDavid Heyman produced all the films in the series with his production company Heyday Films, while David Barron joined the series as an executive producer on Chamber of Secrets and Goblet of Fire. Barron was later appointed producer on the last four films. Chris Columbus was an executive producer on the first two films alongside Mark Radcliffe and Michael Barnathan, but he became a producer on the third film alongside Heyman and Radcliffe. Other executive producers include Tanya Seghatchian and Lionel Wigram. J. K. Rowling, author of the series, was asked to become a producer on Goblet of Fire but declined. She subsequently accepted the role on the two-part Deathly Hallows.[31]\\r\\n\\r\\nHeyday Films and Columbus' company 1492 Pictures collaborated with Duncan Henderson Productions in 2001, Miracle Productions in 2002, and P of A Productions in 2004. Even though Prisoner of Azkaban was the final film produced by 1492 Pictures, Heyday Films continued with the franchise and collaborated with Patalex IV Productions in 2005. The sixth film in the series, Half-Blood Prince, was the most expensive film to produce as of  2009[update].\\r\\n\\r\\nWarner Bros. split the seventh and final novel in the series, Deathly Hallows, into two cinematic parts. The two parts were filmed back-to-back from early 2009 to summer 2010, with the completion of reshoots taking place on 21 December 2010; this marked the end of filming Harry Potter. Heyman stated that Deathly Hallows was \\"shot as one film\\" but released in two feature-length parts.[32]\\r\\n\\r\\nTim Burke, the visual effects supervisor of the series, said of the production on Harry Potter, \\"It was this huge family; I think there were over 700 people working at Leavesden, an industry in itself.\\" David Heyman said, \\"When the first film opened, no way did I think we'd make eight films. That didn't seem feasible until after we'd done the fourth.\\" Nisha Parti, the production consultant on the first film, said that Heyman \\"made the first film very much the way he felt the studio Warner Bros. wanted to make it.\\" After the film's success, Heyman was given \\"more freedom\\".[33]\\r\\n\\r\\nOne of the aims of the filmmakers from the beginning of production was to develop the maturity of the films. Chris Columbus stated, \\"We realised that these movies would get progressively darker. Again, we didn't know how dark but we realised that as the kids get older, the movies get a little edgier and darker.\\"[34] This transpired with the succeeding three directors who would work on the series in the following years, with the films beginning to deal with issues such as death, betrayal, prejudice, and political corruption as the series developed narratively and thematically.[5][35]\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter Chris Columbus had finished working on Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone, he was hired to direct the second film, Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets. The production started within a week after the release of the first film. Columbus was set to direct all entries in the series,[36] but he did not want to return for the third film, Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban, claiming he was \\"burned out\\".[37] He moved to the position of producer, while Alfonso Cuar܇n was approached for the role of director. He was initially nervous about directing the instalment since he had not read any of the books or seen the films. After reading the series, he changed his mind and signed on to direct since he had immediately connected to the story.[38]\\r\\n\\r\\nBecause Cuar܇n decided not to direct the fourth instalment, Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire, a new director had to be selected.[39] Mike Newell was chosen to direct the film, but he declined to direct the next film, Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix, which was given to David Yates, who also directed Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince and Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows, becoming the only director to helm more than one film since Chris Columbus.\\r\\n\\r\\nChris Columbus said his vision of the first two films was of a \\"golden storybook, an old-fashioned look\\", while Alfonso Cuar܇n changed the visual tone of the series, desaturated the colour palette, and expanded the landscape around Hogwarts.[34][39] Mike Newell decided to direct the fourth film as a \\"paranoid thriller\\", while David Yates wanted to \\"bring a sense of jeopardy and character to the world\\".[40][41] Cuar܇n, Newell, and Yates have said that their challenge was striking a balance between making the films according to their individual vision, while working within a cinematic world already established by Columbus.[39][40][41]\\r\\n\\r\\nDavid Heyman commented on the \\"generosity of the directors\\" by revealing that \\"Chris spent time with Alfonso, Alfonso spent time with Mike and Mike spent time with David, showing him an early cut of the film, talking through what it means to be a director and how they went about [making the films].\\"[42]\\r\\n\\r\\nDavid Heyman also said, \\"I suppose Chris Columbus was the most conservative choice from the studio's point of view. But he expressed real passion.\\"[33] Producer Tanya Seghatchian said they were \\"more adventurous\\" in choosing a director for the third film and went straight to Alfonso Cuar܇n.[33] Mike Newell became the first British director of the series when he was chosen for the fourth film; Newell was considered to direct the first film before he dropped out.[33] David Yates directed the final films after David Heyman thought him capable of handling the edgy, emotional, and political material of the later novels.[43]\\r\\n\\r\\nAll the directors have been supportive of each other. Chris Columbus praised the character development in the films, while Alfonso Cuar܇n admired the \\"quiet poetry\\" of David Yates' films.[34][39] Mike Newell noted that each director had a different heroism, and David Yates views the first four films \\"respectfully and enjoy[s] them.\\"[40][41] Daniel Radcliffe said Yates \\"took the charm of the films that Chris made and the visual flair of everything that Alfonso did and the thoroughly British, bombastic nature of the film directed by Mike Newell\\" and added \\"his own sense\\" of realism.[44]\\r\\n\\r\\nSteve Kloves wrote the screenplays for all but the fifth film, which was penned by Michael Goldenberg. Kloves had direct assistance from J.K. Rowling, though she allowed him what he described as \\"tremendous elbow room\\". Rowling asked Kloves to remain faithful to the spirit of the books; thus, the plot and tone of each film and its corresponding book are virtually the same, albeit with some changes and omissions for purposes of cinematic style, time, and budget constraints. Michael Goldenberg also received input from Rowling during his adaptation of the fifth novel; Goldenberg was originally considered to adapt the first novel before the studio chose Kloves.[45]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn a 2010 interview, David Heyman briefly explained the book-to-film transition. He commented on Rowling's involvement in the series, stating that she understood that \\"books and films are different\\" and was \\"the best support\\" a producer could have. Rowling had overall approval on the scripts, which were viewed and discussed by the director and the producers. Heyman also said that Kloves was the \\"key voice\\" in the process of adapting the novels and that certain aspects from the books needed to have been excluded from the scripts due to the filmmakers' decision to keep the main focus on Harry's journey as a character, which would ultimately give the films a defined structure. Heyman mentioned that some fans \\"don't necessarily understand the adaptation process\\" and that the filmmakers would have loved to \\"have everything\\" from the books in the films but noted that it was not possible since they had \\"neither time nor cinematic structure\\" to do so. He finished by saying that adapting a novel to the screen is \\"a really considered process.\\"[46]\\r\\n\\r\\nBecause the films were being made as the novels were being published, the filmmakers had no idea of the story's outcome until the release of the final novel in 2007. Kloves spoke of his relationship with Rowling when adapting the novels by saying, \\"The thing is about Jo, which is remarkable for someone who had no experience with the filmmaking process, was her intuition. We had a conversation the very first day I met her where she said, 'I know the movies can't be the books... because I know what's coming and it's impossible to fully dramatise on screen what I'm going to write. But I just ask you to be true to the characters; that's all I care about.'\\"[47] Kloves also said, \\"I don't know what compelled me to say this [to Rowling], but I said, 'I've just got to warn you my favourite character is not Harry. My favourite character is Hermione.' And I think for some weird reason, from that moment on, she sort of trusted me.\\"[47]\\r\\n\\r\\nAside from the three lead actors, other notable cast members include Robbie Coltrane as Rubeus Hagrid, Tom Felton as Draco Malfoy, Alan Rickman as Severus Snape, and Dame Maggie Smith as Minerva McGonagall. Richard Harris, who played the role of Professor Albus Dumbledore, died on 25 October 2002 causing the role to be re-cast for the third instalment, Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban. David Heyman and director Alfonso Cuar܇n chose Michael Gambon to portray the character of Dumbledore, which he did for all succeeding films. Notable recurring cast members include Helena Bonham Carter as Bellatrix Lestrange, Warwick Davis as Filius Flitwick, Ralph Fiennes as Lord Voldemort, Brendan Gleeson as Alastor Moody, Richard Griffiths as Vernon Dursley, Jason Isaacs as Lucius Malfoy, Gary Oldman as Sirius Black, Fiona Shaw as Petunia Dursley, Timothy Spall as Peter Pettigrew, David Thewlis as Remus Lupin, Emma Thompson as Sybill Trelawney, Mark Williams as Arthur Weasley, and Julie Walters as Molly Weasley.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe series has seen many returning crew members from various departments, including Tim Burke, visual effects supervisor; Peter Doyle, digital film colourist; Nick Dudman, make-up and creature effects designer; David Holmes, stunt double; Amanda Knight, make-up artist; Stephenie McMillan, set designer; Greg Powell, stunt coordinator; Jany Temime, costume designer; and Fiona Weir, casting director.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe production designer for all eight films is Stuart Craig. Assisted by Stephenie McMillan, Craig has created iconic sets pieces including the Ministry of Magic, the Chamber of Secrets, Malfoy Manor, and the layout for the CGI Horcrux Cave. Because the novels were being published as the films were being made, Craig was required to rebuild some sets for future films and alter the design of Hogwarts.[50]\\r\\n\\r\\nHe said, \\"In the early days, every time you saw the exterior of Hogwarts, it was a physical miniature,\\" which was made by craftsmen and occupied a large sound stage.[52][53] \\"We ended up with a profile of how Hogwarts looked, a skyline that actually I didn't design, and it wasn't always satisfactory, and as all the novels got written and movies got made there were new requirements [for buildings]. The [Astronomy Tower] definitely wasn't there originally, and so we were able to add that substantial piece. And in the last film, we needed an arena for the battle for Hogwarts ÿ the big courtyard outside doubled in size, and if you look at the first movie it wasn't there at all. There were quite some liberties taken with the continuity of Hogwarts.\\"[54] In the last film, Craig used a digital model instead of a miniature to \\"embrace the latest technology\\".[53]\\r\\n\\r\\nOn the method of creating the sets, Craig said he often started by sketching ideas onto a blank sheet of paper.[55] Stephanie McMillan also said that \\"each film always had plenty of new challenges,\\" citing the changes in visual style between directors and cinematographers as an example, along with the developing story in the novels. Due to J.K. Rowling's descriptions of various settings in the novels, Craig noted his \\"responsibility was to place it together\\".[56]\\r\\n\\r\\nCraig commented on his experience working in the studio environment: \\"I'm the production designer, but on a big movie like Harry Potter I may be responsible for 30 to 35 people; from the supervising art director, and a team of art directors and assistants, to draughtsmen and junior draughtsmen, and then on to model makers, sculptors and scenic artists.\\" He said, \\"Ten years ago, all the Harry Potter drawings were done in pencil. I would take my roughs and plans and sections and give them to a professional architectural illustrator, who would create concept art using pencil and colour wash on watercolour paper.\\" He said the process changed slightly throughout the years due to, what he called, the \\"digital revolution\\" of making films.[53]\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen filming of the series was completed, some of Craig's sets had to be rebuilt or transported for them to be displayed at the Warner Bros. studio tour.[52]\\r\\n\\r\\nSix directors of photography worked on the series: John Seale on the first film, Roger Pratt on the second and fourth, Michael Seresin on the third, S?awomir Idziak on the fifth, Bruno Delbonnel on the sixth, and Eduardo Serra on the seventh and eighth. Delbonnel was considered to return for both parts of Deathly Hallows, but he declined, stating that he was \\"scared of repeating\\" himself.[57] Delbonnel's cinematography in Half-Blood Prince gained the series its only Academy Award nomination for Best Cinematography. As the series progressed, each cinematographer faced the challenge of shooting and lighting older sets (which had been around since the first few films) in unique and different ways.[58] Chris Columbus said the series' vivid colouring decreased as each film was made.[34][59]\\r\\n\\r\\nMichael Seresin commented on the change of visual style from the first two films to Prisoner of Azkaban: \\"The lighting is moodier, with more shadowing and cross-lighting.\\" Seresin and Alfonso Cuar܇n moved away from the strongly coloured and brightly lit cinematography of the first two films, with dimmer lighting and a more muted colour palette being utilised for the succeeding five films.[60] After comparing a range of digital cameras with 35?mm film, Bruno Delbonnel decided to shoot the sixth movie, Half-Blood Prince, on film rather than the increasingly popular digital format. This decision was kept for the two-part Deathly Hallows with Eduardo Serra, who said that he preferred to work with film because it was \\"more technically accurate and dependable\\".[61]\\r\\n\\r\\nBecause the majority of Deathly Hallows takes place in various settings away from Hogwarts, David Yates wanted to \\"shake things up\\" by using different photographic techniques such as using hand-held cameras and very wide camera lenses.[62] Eduardo Serra said, \\"Sometimes we are combining elements shot by the main unit, a second unit, and the visual effects unit. You have to know what is being captured ÿ colours, contrast, et cetera ÿ with mathematical precision.\\" He noted that with Stuart Craig's \\"amazing sets and the story\\", the filmmakers could not \\"stray too far from the look of the previous Harry Potter films.\\"[61][63]\\r\\n\\r\\nAlong with continuous changes in cinematographers, there have been five film editors to work in post-production on the series: Richard Francis-Bruce edited the first instalment, Peter Honess the second, Steven Weisberg the third, Mick Audsley the fourth, and Mark Day films five through eight.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Harry Potter series has had four composers. John Williams scored the first three films: Philosopher's Stone, Chamber of Secrets, and Prisoner of Azkaban. However, the second entry was adapted and conducted by William Ross due to Williams's conflicting commitments. Williams also created Hedwig's Theme, which is used in every film in the series.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter Williams left the series to pursue other projects, Patrick Doyle scored the fourth entry, Goblet of Fire, which was directed by Mike Newell, with whom Doyle had worked previously. In 2006, Nicholas Hooper started work on the score to Order of the Phoenix by reuniting with director David Yates. Hooper also composed the soundtrack to Half-Blood Prince but decided not to return for the final films.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn January 2010, Alexandre Desplat was confirmed to compose the score for Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows ÿ Part 1.[64] The film's orchestration started in the summer with Conrad Pope, the orchestrator on the first three Harry Potter films, collaborating with Desplat. Pope commented that the music \\"reminds one of the old days.\\"[65] Desplat returned to score Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows ÿ Part 2 in 2011.[66]\\r\\n\\r\\nDirector David Yates stated that he wanted John Williams to return to the series for the final installment, but their schedules did not align due to the urgent demand for a rough cut of the film.[67] The final recording sessions of Harry Potter took place on 27 May 2011 at Abbey Road Studios with the London Symphony Orchestra, orchestrator Conrad Pope, and composer Alexandre Desplat.[68]\\r\\n\\r\\nDoyle, Hooper, and Desplat introduced their own personal themes to their respective soundtracks, while keeping a few of John Williams's themes.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere have been many visual effects companies to work on the Harry Potter series. Some of these include Rising Sun Pictures, Double Negative, Cinesite, Framestore, and Industrial Light & Magic. The latter three have worked on all the films in the series, while Double Negative and Rising Sun Pictures began their commitments with Prisoner of Azkaban and Goblet of Fire, respectively. Framestore contributed by developing many memorable creatures and sequences to the series.[69] Cinesite was involved in producing both miniature and digital effects for the films.[70] Producer David Barron said that \\"Harry Potter created the UK effects industry as we know it. On the first film, all the complicated visual effects were done on the [US] west coast. But on the second, we took a leap of faith and gave much of what would normally be given to Californian vendors to UK ones. They came up trumps.\\" Tim Burke, the visual effects supervisor, said many studios \\"are bringing their work to UK effects companies. Every facility is fully booked, and that wasn't the case before Harry Potter. That's really significant.\\"[33]\\r\\n\\r\\nOn 12 June 2010, filming of the Deathly Hallows ÿ Part 1 and Deathly Hallows ÿ Part 2 was completed with actor Warwick Davis stating on his Twitter account, \\"The end of an Era ÿ today is officially the last day of principal photography on 'Harry Potter' ÿ ever. I feel honoured to be here as the director shouts cut for the very last time. Farewell Harry & Hogwarts, it's been magic!\\".[71] However, reshoots of the epilogue scene were confirmed to begin in the winter of 2010. The filming was completed on 21 December 2010, marking the official closure of filming the Harry Potter franchise.[72] Exactly four years earlier on that day, author J. K. Rowling's official website revealed the title of the final novel in the series ÿ Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows.[73]\\r\\n\\r\\nHarry Potter is an orphaned boy brought up by his unkind Muggle (non-magical) aunt and uncle. At the age of eleven, half-giant Rubeus Hagrid informs him that he is actually a wizard and that his parents were murdered by an evil wizard named Lord Voldemort. Voldemort also attempted to kill one-year-old Harry on the same night, but his killing curse mysteriously rebounded and reduced him to a weak and helpless form. Harry became extremely famous in the Wizarding World as a result. Harry begins his first year at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry and learns about magic. During the year, Harry and his friends Ron Weasley and Hermione Granger become entangled in the mystery of the Philosopher's Stone which is being kept within the school.\\r\\n\\r\\nHarry, Ron, and Hermione return to Hogwarts for their second year, which proves to be more challenging than the last. The Chamber of Secrets has been opened, leaving students and ghosts petrified by an unleashed monster. Harry must face up to claims that he is the heir of Salazar Slytherin (founder of the Chamber), learn that he can speak Parseltongue, and also discover the properties of a mysterious diary, only to find himself trapped within the Chamber of Secrets itself.\\r\\n\\r\\nHarry Potter's third year sees the boy wizard, along with his friends, attending Hogwarts School once again. Professor R. J. Lupin joins the staff as Defence Against the Dark Arts teacher, while convicted murderer Sirius Black escapes from Azkaban Prison. The Ministry of Magic entrusts the Dementors of Azkaban to guard Hogwarts from Black. Harry learns more about his past and his connection with the escaped prisoner.\\r\\n\\r\\nDuring Harry's fourth year, Hogwarts plays host to a legendary event: the Triwizard Tournament. Three European schools participate in the tournament, with three 'champions' representing each school in the deadly tasks. The Goblet of Fire chooses Fleur Delacour, Viktor Krum, and Cedric Diggory to compete against each other. However, curiously, Harry's name is also produced from the Goblet thus making him a fourth champion, which results in a terrifying encounter with a reborn Lord Voldemort.\\r\\n\\r\\nHarry's fifth year begins with him being attacked by Dementors in Little Whinging. Later, he finds out that the Ministry of Magic is in denial of Lord Voldemort's return. Harry is also beset by disturbing and realistic nightmares, while Professor Umbridge, a representative of Minister for Magic Cornelius Fudge, is the new Defence Against the Dark Arts teacher. Harry becomes aware that Voldemort is after a prophecy which reveals: \\"neither can live while the other survives\\". The rebellion involving the students of Hogwarts, secret organisation Order of the Phoenix, the Ministry of Magic, and the Death Eaters begins.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn Harry's sixth year at Hogwarts, Lord Voldemort and his Death Eaters are increasing their terror upon the Wizarding and Muggle worlds. Headmaster Albus Dumbledore persuades his old friend Horace Slughorn to return to Hogwarts as a professor as there is a vacancy to fill. There is a more important reason, however, for Slughorn's return. While in a Potions lesson, Harry takes possession of a strangely annotated school textbook, inscribed 'This is the property of the Half-Blood Prince'. Draco Malfoy struggles to carry out a deed presented to him by Voldemort. Meanwhile, Dumbledore and Harry secretly work together to discover the method on how to destroy the Dark Lord once and for all.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter unexpected events at the end of the previous year, Harry, Ron, and Hermione are entrusted with a quest to find and destroy Lord Voldemort's secret to immortality ÿ the Horcruxes. It is supposed to be their final year at Hogwarts, but the collapse of the Ministry of Magic and Voldemort's rise to power prevents them from attending. The trio undergo a long journey with many obstacles in their path including Death Eaters, Snatchers, the mysterious Deathly Hallows, and Harry's connection with the Dark Lord's mind becoming ever stronger.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter destroying one Horcrux and discovering the significance of the three Deathly Hallows, Harry, Ron and Hermione continue to seek the other Horcruxes in an attempt to destroy Voldemort, who has now obtained the powerful Elder Wand. The Dark Lord discovers Harry's hunt for Horcruxes and launches an attack on Hogwarts School, where the trio return for one last stand against the dark forces that threaten the Wizarding and Muggle worlds.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe rights for the first four novels in the series were sold to Warner Bros. for S1,000,000 by J.K. Rowling. After the release of the fourth book in July 2000, the first film, Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone, was released on 16 November 2001. In its opening weekend, the film grossed $90 million in the United States alone, which set a record opening worldwide. The succeeding three motion picture adaptations followed suit in financial success, while garnering positive reviews from fans and critics. The fifth film, Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix, was released by Warner Bros. on 11 July 2007 in English-speaking countries, except for the UK and Ireland, which released the movie on 12 July.[74] The sixth, Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince, was released on 15 July 2009 to critical acclaim and finished its theatrical run ranked as the number two grossing film of 2009 on the worldwide charts.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe final novel, Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows, was split into two cinematic parts: Part 1 was released on 19 November 2010, and Part 2, the conclusion to both the final film and the series, was released on 15 July 2011.[75] Part 1 was originally scheduled to be released in 3D and 2D,[76] but due to a delay in the 3D conversion process, Warner Bros. released the film only in 2D and IMAX cinemas. However, Part 2 was released in 2D and 3D cinemas as originally planned.[77]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe television broadcast rights for the series in the United States are currently held by NBCUniversal, which typically airs the films on USA Network and Syfy. [78] The film series has accrued nearly 1.3 billion viewings since their television debutthe highest-watched franchise in television broadcast history.[79]\\r\\n\\r\\nAll the films have been a success financially and critically, making the franchise one of the major Hollywood \\"tent-poles\\" akin to James Bond, Star Wars, Indiana Jones and Pirates of the Caribbean. The series is noted by audiences for growing visually darker and more mature as each film was released.[34][80][81][82][83] However, opinions of the films generally divide book fans, with some preferring the more faithful approach of the first two films and others preferring the more stylised character-driven approach of the later films.\\r\\n\\r\\nSome also feel the series has a \\"disjointed\\" feel due to the changes in directors, as well as Michael Gambon's interpretation of Albus Dumbledore differing from that of Richard Harris. Author J. K. Rowling has been constantly supportive of the films,[84][85][86] and evaluated Deathly Hallows as her favourite one in the series. She wrote on her website of the changes in the book-to-film transition, \\"It is simply impossible to incorporate every one of my storylines into a film that has to be kept under four hours long. Obviously films have restrictions ÿ novels do not have constraints of time and budget; I can create dazzling effects relying on nothing but the interaction of my own and my readers' imaginations\\".[87]\\r\\n\\r\\nAt the 64th British Academy Film Awards in February 2011, J. K. Rowling, David Heyman, David Barron, David Yates, Alfonso Cuar܇n, Mike Newell, Rupert Grint and Emma Watson collected the Michael Balcon Award for Outstanding British Contribution to Cinema for the series.[105][106]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn addition, the American Film Institute recognised the entire series with a Special Award at the American Film Institute Awards in 2011. Special awards \\"are given to outstanding achievements in the moving image that do not fit into AFI's criteria for the other honorees.\\" [107] In its press release, the Institute referred to the films as \\"a landmark series; eight films that earned the trust of a generation who wished for the beloved books of J.K. Rowling to come to life on the silver screen. The collective wizardry of an epic ensemble gave us the gift of growing older with Harry, Ron and Hermione as the magic of Hogwarts sprung from the films and into the hearts and minds of Muggles around the world.\\" [107]\\r\\n\\r\\nHarry Potter was also recognised by the BAFTA Los Angeles Britannia Awards, with David Yates winning the Britannia Award for Artistic Excellence in Directing for his four Harry Potter films.[108][109]\\r\\n\\r\\nSix of the eight films were nominated for a total of 12 Academy Awards.\\r\\n\\r\\nSome critics, fans, and general audiences have expressed disappointment that the Harry Potter series did not win any Oscars for its achievements. However, others have pointed out that certain films in the series had uneven reviews, in contrast to the three films of The Lord of the Rings, for example, which were all critically acclaimed. This has been partially attributed to the Harry Potter franchise going through several directors with their own styles in contrast to the Lord of the Rings trilogy, which was filmed in one massive undertaking by the same director, writer, and producer.[110][111]\\r\\n\\r\\nAlthough not successful at the Oscars, the Harry Potter series has gained success in many other award ceremonies, including the annual Saturn Awards and Art Directors Guild Awards. The series has also gained a total of 24 nominations at the British Academy Film Awards presented at the annual BAFTAs, winning several, and 5 nominations at the Grammy Awards.\\r\\n\\r\\nPhilosopher's Stone achieved seven BAFTA Award nominations, including Best British Film and Best Supporting Actor for Robbie Coltrane.[112] The film was also nominated for eight Saturn Awards and won for its costumes design.[113] It was also nominated at the Art Directors Guild Awards for its production design[114] and received the Broadcast Film Critics Award for Best Live Action Family Film along with gaining two other nominations.[115]\\r\\n\\r\\nChamber of Secrets won the award for Best Live Action Family Film in the Phoenix Film Critics Society. It was nominated for seven Saturn Awards, including Best Director and Best Fantasy Film. The film was nominated for four BAFTA Awards and a Grammy Award for John Williams's score. Prisoner of Azkaban won an Audience Award, as well as Best Feature Film, at the BAFTA Awards. The film also won a BMI Film Music award along with being nominated at the Grammy Awards, Visual Effect Society Awards, and the Amanda Awards. Goblet of Fire won a BAFTA award for Best Production Design as well as being nominated at the Saturn Awards, Critic's Choice Awards, and the Visual Effects Society Awards.\\r\\n\\r\\nOrder of the Phoenix picked up three awards at the inaugural ITV National Movie Awards.[116] At the Empire Awards, David Yates won Best Director.[117] Composer Nicholas Hooper received a nomination for a World Soundtrack Discovery Award.[118] The film was nominated at the BAFTA Awards, but did not win for Best Production Design or Best Special Visual Effects.[119] Half-Blood Prince was nominated for BAFTA Awards in Production Design and Visual Effects,[120] and it was in the longlists for several other categories, including Best Supporting Actor for Alan Rickman.[121] Amongst other nominations and wins, the film also achieved Best Family Movie at the National Movie Awards as well as Best Live Action Family Film at the Phoenix Film Critics Society Awards, along with being nominated for Best Motion Picture at the Satellite Awards.\\r\\n\\r\\nDeathly Hallows ÿ Part 1 gained two nominations at the BAFTA Awards for Best Make-Up and Hair and Best Visual Effects, along with receiving nominations for the same categories at the Broadcast Film Critics Association Awards. Eduardo Serra's cinematography and Stuart Craig's production design were also nominated in various award ceremonies, and David Yates attained his second win at the Empire Awards, this time for Best Fantasy Film. He also obtained another Best Director nomination at the annual Saturn Awards, which also saw the film gain a Best Fantasy Film nomination.[122][123] Deathly Hallows ÿ Part 2 was released to critical acclaim, gaining a mix of audience awards. Part 2 of Deathly Hallows was also recognised at the Saturn Awards as well as the BAFTA Awards, where the film achieved a win for Best Special Visual Effects.[124]\\r\\n\\r\\nAs of  2018[update], the Harry Potter film series is the 3rd highest-grossing film franchise of all time, with the eight films released grossing over $7.7?billion worldwide. Without adjusting for inflation, this is higher than the first 22 James Bond films and the six films in the Star Wars franchise.[125] Chris Columbus's Philosopher's Stone became the highest-grossing Harry Potter film worldwide upon completing its theatrical run in 2002, but it was eventually topped by David Yates's Deathly Hallows ÿ Part 2, while Alfonso Cuar܇n's Prisoner of Azkaban grossed the least.[126][127][128][129]\\r\\n\\r\\nSix films in the Harry Potter franchise  Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban, Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire, Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix, Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince and Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows, Parts 1 & 2  have to date grossed around $216 million in IMAX theaters worldwide.[130]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Economist[150]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Harry Potter films and their success have been retrospectively considered to have had a significant impact on the film industry. They are cited as having helped redefine the Hollywood blockbuster in the 21st century by initiating a shift toward established media franchises forming the basis of successful films. In the wake of the final film's release, Claudia Puig of USA Today wrote that the films \\"inspired every major studio to try to capture [its] alchemic formula, spawning a range of copycats and wannabes\\" and \\"also have shown Hollywood how to make a glossy blockbuster with an eye toward keeping costs down.\\"[151] A 2009 article from The Economist argued that the films were \\"in the vanguard\\" of adaptations of established properties being the modern film franchise model, citing The Lord of the Rings, Spider-Man and The Dark Knight Trilogy as examples of successful film series that followed Harry Potter's suit.[150] Furthermore, the practice of splitting the finale of a film series into two back-to-back films began with the success of Deathly Hallows, and it would soon be replicated by The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug and The Battle of the Five Armies, The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn ÿ Parts 1 and 2, The Hunger Games: Mockingjay ÿ Parts 1 and 2, and Avengers: Infinity War and its untitled sequel.[152]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe films are also widely credited with singlehandedly signalling the popularity of films based on children's and young adult literature in the 2000s and 2010s, correlating with the book series' own literary influence. Costance Grady and Aja Romano, commenting on the whole Harry Potter franchise's legacy for Vox in light of its 20th anniversary, wrote that youth-targeted literature has since become \\"a go-to well of ideas for Hollywood,\\" pointing to the successes of The Twilight Saga and The Hunger Games.[153]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe series has spawned a vast volume of fan fiction, with nearly 600 thousand inspired stories catalogued.[154]  Youtube hosts many fan films, ranging from amateur productions to full length films.","input":"How many parts are there in harry potter series?"},{"output":"18 September 1973","context":"The relationship of Germany and the United Nations first began during World War II. The United Nations then was synonymous with the Allies of World War II and Germany then being the Greater German Reich, a member of the Axis powers. With the war ending in the defeat of Germany, the country's territory was divided amongst the victors and what was to remain Germany was under Allied administration. In 1949, two new countries were created in these occupied territories: the Federal Republic of Germany in May and the German Democratic Republic in October.\\r\\nBoth Germanys were admitted as full members of the United Nations (UN) on 18 September 1973. The two countries eventually merged on 3 October 1990, signifying an end of the Cold war era. Today, Germany is the third largest contributor to the UN budget, after the United States and Japan, with 190 million US dollars, or roughly 8% of the UN budget for the 2010-11 biennial budget.[1]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Federal Republic of Germany (West Germany) was admitted to the UN as an observer in 1955. The German Democratic Republic (East Germany) was admitted as an observer in 1972.[2] On 18 September 1973 both were admitted as full members by the United Nations General Assembly, following the recommendation of the Security Council by Resolution 335 on 22 June 1973. Through the accession of the German Democratic Republic to the Federal Republic of Germany, it was effective on 3 October 1990. The territory of the German Democratic Republic became part of the Federal Republic of Germany, today simply known as Germany. Consequently, the Federal Republic of Germany continued being a member of the UN while the German Democratic Republic ceased to exist.[3]\\r\\nFor the years of 2011 to 2012 Germany has been elected as a non-permanent member of the United Nations Security Council (UNSC). However, Germany received criticism from its European and US allies for abstaining on the Libyan no-fly zone resolution that they were voting for. Former German Foreign Minister Joschka Fischer argued that \\"Germany has lost its credibility in the United Nations and in the Middle East. German hopes for a permanent seat on the Security Council have been permanently dashed and one is now fearful of Europe's future.\\"[4][5]\\r\\nFrance and the United Kingdom have explicitly called for a permanent seat on the UN Security Council for their close EU partner.[6][7] French president Jacques Chirac said in a speech in Berlin in 2000 that \\"Germany's engagement, its ranking as a great power, its international influenceFrance would like to see them recognized with a permanent seat on the Security Council\\".[8] The former German Chancellor, Gerhard Schr?der, also identified Russia, among other countries, as a country that backed Germany's bid.[9] Italy and the Netherlands on the contrary, suggest a common European Union (EU) seat in the Council instead of Germany becoming the third European member next to France and the UK. The former German Foreign Minister Joschka Fischer said that Germany would also accept a common European seat, but as long as there is little sign that France and the UK will give up their own seats; Germany should also have a seat.[9] Thus, the German campaign for a permanent seat was intensified in 2004. Schr?der made himself perfectly clear in August 2004: \\"Germany has the right to a seat.\\"[10] Its bid is supported by Japan, India, Brazil, France, the United Kingdom and Russia, among other countries. Current German Chancellor Angela Merkel, who had initially been quiet on the issue, re-stated Germany's bid in her address to the UN General Assembly in September 2007. In July 2011, Merkel's trip to Kenya, Angola, and Nigeria was thought to be motivated, in part, by the goal of seeking support from African countries for Germany's bid for a permanent seat on the Security Council.[11]","input":"When did germany become part of the un?"},{"output":"Roman and Greek","context":"The political history of the world is the history of the various political entities created by the human race throughout their existence and the way these states define their borders. Throughout history, political entities have expanded from basic systems of self-governance and monarchy to the complex democratic and totalitarian systems that exist today. In parallel, political systems have expanded from vaguely defined frontier-type boundaries, to the national definite boundaries existing today.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nIn ancient history, civilizations did not have definite boundaries as states have today, and their borders could be more accurately described as frontiers. Early dynastic Sumer, and early dynastic Egypt were the first civilizations to define their borders. Moreover, for the past 200,000 years and up to the twentieth century, many people have lived in non-state societies. These range from relatively egalitarian bands and tribes to complex and highly stratified chiefdoms.\\r\\nThe first states of sorts were those of early dynastic Sumer and early dynastic Egypt, which arose from the Uruk period and Predynastic Egypt respectively at approximately 3000BCE.[1] Early dynastic Egypt was based around the Nile River in the north-east of Africa, the kingdom's boundaries being based around the Nile and stretching to areas where oases existed.[2] Early dynastic Sumer was located in southern Mesopotamia with its borders extending from the Persian Gulf to parts of the Euphrates and Tigris rivers.[1]\\r\\nBy 2500 BCE the Indus Valley Civilization, located in modern-day India, Pakistan and Afghanistan had formed. The civilization's boundaries extended 600?km inland from the Arabian Sea.[3]\\r\\n336 BCE saw the rise of Alexander the Great, who forged an empire from various vassal states stretching from modern Greece to the Indian subcontinent, bringing Mediterranean nations into contact with those of central and southern Asia, much as the Persian Empire had before him. The boundaries of this empire extended hundreds of kilometers.[4]\\r\\nThe Roman Empire (27 BCE - 476 CE) was the first western civilization known to accurately define their borders, although these borders could be more accurately described as frontiers;[5] instead of the Empire defining its borders with precision, the borders were allowed to trail off and were, in many cases, part of territory indirectly ruled by others.[6]\\r\\nRoman and Greek ideals of nationhood can be seen to have strongly influenced Western views on the subject, with the basis of many governmental systems being on authority or ideas borrowed from Rome or the Greek city-states. Notably, the European states of the Dark Ages and Middle Ages gained their authority from the Roman Catholic religion, and modern democracies are based in part on the example of Ancient Athens.[citation needed]\\r\\nWhen China entered the Sui Dynasty,[7] the government changed and expanded in its borders as the many separate bureaucracies unified under one banner.[8] This evolved into the Tang Dynasty when Li Yuan took control of China in 626.[9] By now, the Chinese borders had expanded from eastern China, up north into the Tang Empire.[10] The Tang Empire fell apart in 907 and split into ten regional kingdoms and five dynasties with vague borders.[11] Fifty-three years after the separation of the Tang Empire, China entered the Song Dynasty under the rule of Chao K'uang, although the borders of this country expanded, they were never as large as those of the Tang dynasty and were constantly being redefined due to attacks from the neighboring Tartar(Mongol) people known as the Khitan tribes.[12]\\r\\nAfter the death of Prophet Muhammad in 632, the Quran and the teachings of Islam inspired the genesis of a new civilization. In less than a century, the Islamic Caliphate rapidly extended its reach from the Atlantic Ocean and Andalusia in the west to Central Asia in the east. The subsequent Muslim empires of the Umayyads, Abbasids, Fatimids, Ghaznavids, Seljuqs, Safavids, Mughals, and Ottomans were among the most influential and distinguished powers in the world during Middle Ages. The period between the 8th and 13th century saw a flourishing of trade, as well as several advances in science, engineering, medecine and mathematics. In Western Europe, briefly mostly united into a single state under Charlemagne around 800CE, a few countries, including England, Scotland, Iceland and Norway, had already effectively become nation states by 1,000CE, with a kingdom (Commonwealth in Iceland's case) largely co-terminus with a people mostly sharing a language and culture.[citation needed]\\r\\nOver most of the continent, the peoples were emerging around ethnic, linguistic and geographical groups, but this was not reflected in political entities. In particular, France, Italy and Germany, though recognised by other nations as countries where the French, Italians and Germans lived, did not exist as states largely matching the countries for centuries, and struggles to form them, and define their borders, as states were a major cause of wars in Europe until the 20th century. In the course of this process, some countries, such as Poland under the Partitions and France in the High Middle Ages, almost ceased to exist as states for periods. The Low Countries, in the Middle Ages as distinct a country as France, became permanently divided, today into Belgium and the Netherlands. Spain was formed as a nation state by the dynastic union of small Christian kingdoms, augmented by the final campaigns of the Reconquista against Al-Andaluz, the vanished country of Islamic Iberia.[citation needed]\\r\\nIn 1299 CE,[13] the Aztec empire arose in lower Mexico, this empire lasted over 300 years and at their prime, held over 5,000[dubious ÿ discuss] square kilometers of land.[14][15]\\r\\n200 years after the Aztec and Toltec empires began, northern and central Asia saw the rise of the Mongol empire. By the late 13th century, the Empire extended across Europe and America, briefly creating a state capable of ruling and administrating immensely diverse cultures.[16] In 1299, the Ottomans entered the scene. These Turkish nomads took control of Asia Minor along with much of central Europe over a period of 370 years, providing what may be considered a long-lasting Islamic counterweight to Christendom.[17]\\r\\nExploiting opportunities left open by the Mongolian advance and recession as well as the spread of Islam, Russia took control of their homeland around 1613, after many years being dominated by the Tartars (Mongols). After gaining independence, the Russian princes began to expand their borders under the leadership of many tsars.[12] Notably, Catherine the Great seized the vast western part of Ukraine from the Poles, expanding Russia's size massively. Throughout the following centuries, Russia expanded rapidly, coming close to its modern size.[18]\\r\\nIn the 15th and 16th centuries three major Muslim empires formed: the Ottoman Empire in the Middle East, the Balkans and Northern Africa; the Safavid Empire in Greater Iran; and the Mughul Empire in South Asia. These imperial powers were made possible by the discovery and exploitation of gunpowder and more efficient administration. By the end of the 19th century, all three had declined, and by the early 20th century, with the Ottomans' defeat in World War I, the last Muslim empire collapsed.\\r\\nIn 1700, Charles II of Spain died, naming Phillip of Anjou, Louis XIV's grandson, his heir. Charles' decision was not well met by the British, who believed that Louis would use the opportunity to ally France and Spain and attempt to take over Europe. Britain formed the Grand Alliance with Holland, Austria and a majority of the German states and declared war against Spain in 1702. The War of the Spanish Succession lasted 11 years, and ended when the Treaty of Utrecht was signed in 1714.[19]\\r\\nLess than 50 years later, in 1740, war broke out again, sparked by the invasion of Silesia, part of Austria, by King Frederick II of Prussia. Britain, the Netherlands and Hungary supported Maria Theresa. Over the next eight years, these and other states participated in the War of the Austrian Succession, until a treaty was signed, allowing Prussia to keep Silesia.[20][21] The Seven Years' War began when Theresa dissolved her alliance with Britain and allied with France and Russia. In 1763, Britain won the war, claiming Canada and land east of the Mississippi. Prussia also kept Silesia.[22]\\r\\nInterest in the geography of the Southern Hemisphere began to increase in the 18th century.[23] In 1642, Dutch navigator Abel Tasman was commissioned to explore the Southern Hemisphere; during his voyages, Tasman discovered the island of Van Diemen's Land, which was later named Tasmania, the Australian coast, and New Zealand in 1644.[24] Captain James Cook was commissioned in 1768 to observe a solar eclipse in Tahiti and sailed into Stingray Harbor on Australia's east coast in 1770, claiming the land for the British Crown.[25] Settlements in Australia began in 1788 when Britain began to utilize the country for the deportation of convicts,[26] with the first free settles arriving in 1793.[27] Likewise New Zealand became a home for hunters seeking whales and seals in the 1790s with later non-commercial settlements by the Scottish in the 1820s and 30s.[28]\\r\\nIn Northern America, revolution was beginning when in 1770, British troops opened fire on a mob pelting them with stones, an event later known as the Boston Massacre.[29] British authorities were unable to determine if this event was a local one, or signs of something bigger[30] until, in 1775, Rebel forces confirmed their intentions by attacking British troops on Bunker Hill.[31] Shortly after, Massachusetts Second Continental Congress representative John Adams and his cousin Samuel Adams were part of a group calling for an American Declaration of Independence. The Congress ended without committing to a Declaration, but prepared for conflict by naming George Washington as the Continental Army Commander.[30] War broke out and lasted until 1783, when Britain signed the Treaty of Paris and recognized America's independence.[32] In 1788, the states ratified the United States Constitution, going from a confederation to a union[30] and in 1789, elected George Washington as the first President of the United States.[33]\\r\\nBy the late 1780s, France was falling into debt, with higher taxes introduced and famines ensuring.[34] As a measure of last resort, King Louis XVI called together the Estates-General in 1788 and reluctantly agreed to turn the Third Estate (which made up all of the non-noble and non-clergy French) into a National Assembly.[35] This assembly grew very popular in the public eye and on July 14, 1789, following evidence that the King planned to disband the Assembly,[34] an angry mob stormed the Bastille, taking gunpowder and lead shot.[35] Stories of the success of this raid spread all over the country and sparked multiple uprisings in which the lower-classes robbed granaries and manor houses.[34] In August of the same year, members of the National Assembly wrote the revolutionary document Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen which proclaimed freedom of speech, press and religion.[34] By 1792, other European states were attempting to quell the revolution. In the same year Austrian and German armies attempted to march on Paris, but the French repelled them. Building on fears of European invasion, a radical group known as the Jacobins abolished the monarchy and executed King Louis for treason in 1793. In response to this radical uprising, Britain, Spain and the Netherlands join in the fight with the Jacobins until the Reign of Terror was brought to an end in 1794 with the execution of a Jacobin leader, Maximilien Robespierre. A new constitution was adopted in 1795 with some calm returning, although the country was still at war. In 1799, a group of politicians led by Napoleon Bonaparte unseated leaders of the Directory.[35]","input":"When was the first government formed in the world?"},{"output":"electromagnetic radiation","context":"X-radiation (composed of X-rays) is a form of electromagnetic radiation. Most X-rays have a wavelength ranging from 0.01 to 10 nanometers, corresponding to frequencies in the range 30 petahertz to 30 exahertz (3G1016 Hz to 3G1019 Hz) and energies in the range 100 eV to 100 keV. X-ray wavelengths are shorter than those of UV rays and typically longer than those of gamma rays. In many languages, X-radiation is referred to with terms meaning R?ntgen radiation, after the German scientist Wilhelm R?ntgen,[1] who usually is credited as its discoverer, and who had named it X-radiation to signify an unknown type of radiation.[2] Spelling of X-ray(s) in the English language includes the variants x-ray(s), xray(s), and X ray(s).[3]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nX-rays with high photon energies (above 5ÿ10 keV, below 0.2ÿ0.1?nm wavelength) are called hard X-rays, while those with lower energy are called soft X-rays.[4] Due to their penetrating ability, hard X-rays are widely used to image the inside of objects, e.g., in medical radiography and airport security. The term X-ray is metonymically used to refer to a radiographic image produced using this method, in addition to the method itself. Since the wavelengths of hard X-rays are similar to the size of atoms they are also useful for determining crystal structures by X-ray crystallography. By contrast, soft X-rays are easily absorbed in air; the attenuation length of 600 eV (~2?nm) X-rays in water is less than 1 micrometer.[5]\\r\\nThere is no consensus for a definition distinguishing between X-rays and gamma rays. One common practice is to distinguish between the two types of radiation based on their source: X-rays are emitted by electrons, while gamma rays are emitted by the atomic nucleus.[6][7][8][9] This definition has several problems: other processes also can generate these high-energy photons, or sometimes the method of generation is not known. One common alternative is to distinguish X- and gamma radiation on the basis of wavelength (or, equivalently, frequency or photon energy), with radiation shorter than some arbitrary wavelength, such as 10?11 m (0.1 ?), defined as gamma radiation.[10] This criterion assigns a photon to an unambiguous category, but is only possible if wavelength is known. (Some measurement techniques do not distinguish between detected wavelengths.) However, these two definitions often coincide since the electromagnetic radiation emitted by X-ray tubes generally has a longer wavelength and lower photon energy than the radiation emitted by radioactive nuclei.[6] Occasionally, one term or the other is used in specific contexts due to historical precedent, based on measurement (detection) technique, or based on their intended use rather than their wavelength or source. Thus, gamma-rays generated for medical and industrial uses, for example radiotherapy, in the ranges of 6ÿ20 MeV, can in this context also be referred to as X-rays.[citation needed]\\r\\nX-ray photons carry enough energy to ionize atoms and disrupt molecular bonds. This makes it a type of ionizing radiation, and therefore harmful to living tissue. A very high radiation dose over a short period of time causes radiation sickness, while lower doses can give an increased risk of radiation-induced cancer. In medical imaging this increased cancer risk is generally greatly outweighed by the benefits of the examination. The ionizing capability of X-rays can be utilized in cancer treatment to kill malignant cells using radiation therapy. It is also used for material characterization using X-ray spectroscopy.\\r\\nHard X-rays can traverse relatively thick objects without being much absorbed or scattered. For this reason, X-rays are widely used to image the inside of visually opaque objects. The most often seen applications are in medical radiography and airport security scanners, but similar techniques are also important in industry (e.g. industrial radiography and industrial CT scanning) and research (e.g. small animal CT). The penetration depth varies with several orders of magnitude over the X-ray spectrum. This allows the photon energy to be adjusted for the application so as to give sufficient transmission through the object and at the same time good contrast in the image.\\r\\nX-rays have much shorter wavelengths than visible light, which makes it possible to probe structures much smaller than can be seen using a normal microscope. This property is used in X-ray microscopy to acquire high resolution images, and also in X-ray crystallography to determine the positions of atoms in crystals.\\r\\nX-rays interact with matter in three main ways, through photoabsorption, Compton scattering, and Rayleigh scattering. The strength of these interactions depends on the energy of the X-rays and the elemental composition of the material, but not much on chemical properties, since the X-ray photon energy is much higher than chemical binding energies. Photoabsorption or photoelectric absorption is the dominant interaction mechanism in the soft X-ray regime and for the lower hard X-ray energies. At higher energies, Compton scattering dominates.\\r\\nThe probability of a photoelectric absorption per unit mass is approximately proportional to Z3/E3, where Z is the atomic number and E is the energy of the incident photon.[11] This rule is not valid close to inner shell electron binding energies where there are abrupt changes in interaction probability, so called absorption edges. However, the general trend of high absorption coefficients and thus short penetration depths for low photon energies and high atomic numbers is very strong. For soft tissue, photoabsorption dominates up to about 26 keV photon energy where Compton scattering takes over. For higher atomic number substances this limit is higher. The high amount of calcium (Z=20) in bones together with their high density is what makes them show up so clearly on medical radiographs.\\r\\nA photoabsorbed photon transfers all its energy to the electron with which it interacts, thus ionizing the atom to which the electron was bound and producing a photoelectron that is likely to ionize more atoms in its path. An outer electron will fill the vacant electron position and produce either a characteristic photon[clarification needed] or an Auger electron. These effects can be used for elemental detection through X-ray spectroscopy or Auger electron spectroscopy.\\r\\nCompton scattering is the predominant interaction between X-rays and soft tissue in medical imaging.[12] Compton scattering is an inelastic scattering of the X-ray photon by an outer shell electron. Part of the energy of the photon is transferred to the scattering electron, thereby ionizing the atom and increasing the wavelength of the X-ray. The scattered photon can go in any direction, but a direction similar to the original direction is more likely, especially for high-energy X-rays. The probability for different scattering angles are described by the KleinÿNishina formula. The transferred energy can be directly obtained from the scattering angle from the conservation of energy and momentum.\\r\\nRayleigh scattering is the dominant elastic scattering mechanism in the X-ray regime.[13] Inelastic forward scattering gives rise to the refractive index, which for X-rays is only slightly below 1.[14]\\r\\nWhenever charged particles (electrons or ions) of sufficient energy hit a material, X-rays are produced.\\r\\nX-rays can be generated by an X-ray tube, a vacuum tube that uses a high voltage to accelerate the electrons released by a hot cathode to a high velocity. The high velocity electrons collide with a metal target, the anode, creating the X-rays.[17] In medical X-ray tubes the target is usually tungsten or a more crack-resistant alloy of rhenium (5%) and tungsten (95%), but sometimes molybdenum for more specialized applications, such as when softer X-rays are needed as in mammography. In crystallography, a copper target is most common, with cobalt often being used when fluorescence from iron content in the sample might otherwise present a problem.\\r\\nThe maximum energy of the produced X-ray photon is limited by the energy of the incident electron, which is equal to the voltage on the tube times the electron charge, so an 80?kV tube cannot create X-rays with an energy greater than 80?keV. When the electrons hit the target, X-rays are created by two different atomic processes:\\r\\nSo the resulting output of a tube consists of a continuous bremsstrahlung spectrum falling off to zero at the tube voltage, plus several spikes at the characteristic lines. The voltages used in diagnostic X-ray tubes range from roughly 20 kV to 150 kV and thus the highest energies of the X-ray photons range from roughly 20 keV to 150 keV.[18]\\r\\nBoth of these X-ray production processes are inefficient, with a production efficiency of only about one percent, and thus most of the electric power consumed by the tube is released as waste heat. When producing a usable flux of X-rays, the X-ray tube must be designed to dissipate the excess heat.\\r\\nShort nanosecond bursts of X-rays peaking at 15-keV in energy may be reliably produced by peeling pressure-sensitive adhesive tape from its backing in a moderate vacuum. This is likely to be the result of recombination of electrical charges produced by triboelectric charging. The intensity of X-ray triboluminescence is sufficient for it to be used as a source for X-ray imaging.[19]\\r\\nA specialized source of X-rays which is becoming widely used in research is synchrotron radiation, which is generated by particle accelerators. Its unique features are X-ray outputs many orders of magnitude greater than those of X-ray tubes, wide X-ray spectra, excellent collimation, and linear polarization.[20]\\r\\nX-rays can also be produced by fast protons or other positive ions. The proton-induced X-ray emission or particle-induced X-ray emission is widely used as an analytical procedure. For high energies, the production cross section is proportional to Z12Z2?4, where Z1 refers to the atomic number of the ion, Z2 to that of the target atom.[21] An overview of these cross sections is given in the same reference.\\r\\nX-ray detectors vary in shape and function depending on their purpose. Imaging detectors such as those used for radiography were originally based on photographic plates and later photographic film, but are now mostly replaced by various digital detector types such as image plates and flat panel detectors. For radiation protection direct exposure hazard is often evaluated using ionization chambers, while dosimeters are used to measure the radiation dose a person has been exposed to. X-ray spectra can be measured either by energy dispersive or wavelength dispersive spectrometers.\\r\\nSince R?ntgen's discovery that X-rays can identify bone structures, X-rays have been used for medical imaging. The first medical use was less than a month after his paper on the subject.[22] Up to 2010, 5?billion medical imaging examinations had been conducted worldwide.[23] Radiation exposure from medical imaging in 2006 made up about 50% of total ionizing radiation exposure in the United States.[24]\\r\\nProjectional radiography is the practice of producing two-dimensional images using x-ray radiation. Bones contain much calcium, which due to its relatively high atomic number absorbs x-rays efficiently. This reduces the amount of X-rays reaching the detector in the shadow of the bones, making them clearly visible on the radiograph. The lungs and trapped gas also show up clearly because of lower absorption compared to tissue, while differences between tissue types are harder to see.\\r\\nProjectional radiographs are useful in the detection of pathology of the skeletal system as well as for detecting some disease processes in soft tissue. Some notable examples are the very common chest X-ray, which can be used to identify lung diseases such as pneumonia, lung cancer, or pulmonary edema, and the abdominal x-ray, which can detect bowel (or intestinal) obstruction, free air (from visceral perforations) and free fluid (in ascites). X-rays may also be used to detect pathology such as gallstones (which are rarely radiopaque) or kidney stones which are often (but not always) visible. Traditional plain X-rays are less useful in the imaging of soft tissues such as the brain or muscle.\\r\\nDental radiography is commonly used in the diagnoses of common oral problems, such as cavities.\\r\\nIn medical diagnostic applications, the low energy (soft) X-rays are unwanted, since they are totally absorbed by the body, increasing the radiation dose without contributing to the image. Hence, a thin metal sheet, often of aluminium, called an X-ray filter, is usually placed over the window of the X-ray tube, absorbing the low energy part in the spectrum. This is called hardening the beam since it shifts the center of the spectrum towards higher energy (or harder) x-rays.\\r\\nTo generate an image of the cardiovascular system, including the arteries and veins (angiography) an initial image is taken of the anatomical region of interest. A second image is then taken of the same region after an iodinated contrast agent has been injected into the blood vessels within this area. These two images are then digitally subtracted, leaving an image of only the iodinated contrast outlining the blood vessels. The radiologist or surgeon then compares the image obtained to normal anatomical images to determine whether there is any damage or blockage of the vessel.\\r\\nComputed tomography (CT scanning) is a medical imaging modality where tomographic images or slices of specific areas of the body are obtained from a large series of two-dimensional X-ray images taken in different directions.[25] These cross-sectional images can be combined into a three-dimensional image of the inside of the body and used for diagnostic and therapeutic purposes in various medical disciplines.\\r\\nFluoroscopy is an imaging technique commonly used by physicians or radiation therapists to obtain real-time moving images of the internal structures of a patient through the use of a fluoroscope. In its simplest form, a fluoroscope consists of an X-ray source and a fluorescent screen, between which a patient is placed. However, modern fluoroscopes couple the screen to an X-ray image intensifier and CCD video camera allowing the images to be recorded and played on a monitor. This method may use a contrast material. Examples include cardiac catheterization (to examine for coronary artery blockages) and barium swallow (to examine for esophageal disorders).\\r\\nThe use of X-rays as a treatment is known as radiation therapy and is largely used for the management (including palliation) of cancer; it requires higher radiation doses than those received for imaging alone. X-rays beams are used for treating skin cancers using lower energy x-ray beams while higher energy beams are used for treating cancers within the body such as brain, lung, prostate, and breast.[26][27]\\r\\nDiagnostic X-rays (primarily from CT scans due to the large dose used) increase the risk of developmental problems and cancer in those exposed.[28][29][30] X-rays are classified as a carcinogen by both the World Health Organization's International Agency for Research on Cancer and the U.S. government.[23][31] It is estimated that 0.4% of current cancers in the United States are due to computed tomography (CT scans) performed in the past and that this may increase to as high as 1.5-2% with 2007 rates of CT usage.[32]\\r\\nExperimental and epidemiological data currently do not support the proposition that there is a threshold dose of radiation below which there is no increased risk of cancer.[33] However, this is under increasing doubt.[34] It is estimated that the additional radiation will increase a person's cumulative risk of getting cancer by age 75 by 0.6ÿ1.8%.[35] The amount of absorbed radiation depends upon the type of X-ray test and the body part involved.[36] CT and fluoroscopy entail higher doses of radiation than do plain X-rays.\\r\\nTo place the increased risk in perspective, a plain chest X-ray will expose a person to the same amount from background radiation that people are exposed to (depending upon location) every day over 10 days, while exposure from a dental X-ray is approximately equivalent to 1 day of environmental background radiation.[37] Each such X-ray would add less than 1 per 1,000,000 to the lifetime cancer risk. An abdominal or chest CT would be the equivalent to 2ÿ3 years of background radiation to the whole body, or 4ÿ5 years to the abdomen or chest, increasing the lifetime cancer risk between 1 per 1,000 to 1 per 10,000.[37] This is compared to the roughly 40% chance of a US citizen developing cancer during their lifetime.[38] For instance, the effective dose to the torso from a CT scan of the chest is about 5 mSv, and the absorbed dose is about 14 mGy.[39] A head CT scan (1.5mSv, 64mGy)[40] that is performed once with and once without contrast agent, would be equivalent to 40 years of background radiation to the head. Accurate estimation of effective doses due to CT is difficult with the estimation uncertainty range of about I19% to I32% for adult head scans depending upon the method used.[41]\\r\\nThe risk of radiation is greater to a fetus, so in pregnant patients, the benefits of the investigation (X-ray) should be balanced with the potential hazards to the fetus.[42][43] In the US, there are an estimated 62?million CT scans performed annually, including more than 4?million on children.[36] Avoiding unnecessary X-rays (especially CT scans) reduces radiation dose and any associated cancer risk.[44]\\r\\nMedical X-rays are a significant source of man-made radiation exposure. In 1987, they accounted for 58% of exposure from man-made sources in the United States. Since man-made sources accounted for only 18% of the total radiation exposure, most of which came from natural sources (82%), medical X-rays only accounted for 10% of total American radiation exposure; medical procedures as a whole (including nuclear medicine) accounted for 14% of total radiation exposure. By 2006, however, medical procedures in the United States were contributing much more ionizing radiation than was the case in the early 1980s. In 2006, medical exposure constituted nearly half of the total radiation exposure of the U.S. population from all sources. The increase is traceable to the growth in the use of medical imaging procedures, in particular computed tomography (CT), and to the growth in the use of nuclear medicine.[24][45]\\r\\nDosage due to dental X-rays varies significantly depending on the procedure and the technology (film or digital). Depending on the procedure and the technology, a single dental X-ray of a human results in an exposure of 0.5 to 4 mrem. A full mouth series may therefore result in an exposure of up to 6 (digital) to 18 (film) mrem, for a yearly average of up to 40 mrem.[46][47][48][49][50][51][52]\\r\\nOther notable uses of X-rays include\\r\\nGerman physicist Wilhelm R?ntgen is usually credited as the discoverer of X-rays in 1895, because he was the first to systematically study them, though he is not the first to have observed their effects. He is also the one who gave them the name \\"X-rays\\" (signifying an unknown quantity[57]) though many others referred to these as \\"R?ntgen rays\\" (and the associated X-ray radiograms as, \\"R?ntgenograms\\") for several decades after their discovery and even to this day in some languages, including R?ntgen's native German.\\r\\nX-rays were found emanating from Crookes tubes, experimental discharge tubes invented around 1875, by scientists investigating the cathode rays, that is energetic electron beams, that were first created in the tubes. Crookes tubes created free electrons by ionization of the residual air in the tube by a high DC voltage of anywhere between a few kilovolts and 100 kV. This voltage accelerated the electrons coming from the cathode to a high enough velocity that they created X-rays when they struck the anode or the glass wall of the tube. Many of the early Crookes tubes undoubtedly radiated X-rays, because early researchers noticed effects that were attributable to them, as detailed below. Wilhelm R?ntgen was the first to systematically study them, in 1895.[60]\\r\\nThe discovery of X-rays stimulated a veritable sensation. R?ntgen's biographer Otto Glasser estimated that, in 1896 alone, as many as 49 essays and 1044 articles about the new rays were published.[61] This was probably a conservative estimate, if one considers that nearly every paper around the world extensively reported about the new discovery, with a magazine such as Science dedicating as many as 23 articles to it in that year alone.[62] Sensationalist reactions to the new discovery included publications linking the new kind of rays to occult and paranormal theories, such as telepathy.[63][64]\\r\\nThe earliest known experimenter with X-rays was actuary William Morgan. In 1785 he presented a paper to the Royal Society of London describing the effects of passing electrical currents through a partially evacuated glass tube, the first X-ray tube.[65] This work was further extended by Humphry Davy and his assistant Michael Faraday.\\r\\nIn 1876, Eugen Goldstein proved that they came from the cathode, and named them cathode rays (Kathodenstrahlen).[66] Both William Crookes (in the 1880s)[67] and German physicist Johann Hittorf,[68] a co-inventor and early researcher of the Crookes tube, found that paper wrapped photographic plates placed near the tube became unaccountably fogged or flawed by shadows, although they had not been exposed to light. Neither found the cause nor investigated this effect.\\r\\nIn 1877 Ukrainian-born Ivan Pulyui, a lecturer in experimental physics at the University of Vienna, constructed various designs of vacuum discharge tube to investigate their properties.[69] He continued his investigations when appointed professor at the Prague Polytechnic and in 1886 he found that sealed photographic plates became dark when exposed to the emanations from the tubes. Early in 1896, just a few weeks after R?ntgen published his first X-ray photograph, Pulyui published high-quality X-ray images in journals in Paris and London.[69] Although Pulyui had studied with R?ntgen at the University of Strasbourg in the years 1873ÿ75, his biographer Gaida (1997) asserts that his subsequent research was conducted independently.[69]\\r\\nX-rays were generated and detected by Fernando Sanford (1854ÿ1948), the foundation Professor of Physics at Stanford University, in 1891. From 1886 to 1888 he had studied in the Hermann Helmholtz laboratory in Berlin, where he became familiar with the cathode rays generated in vacuum tubes when a voltage was applied across separate electrodes, as previously studied by Heinrich Hertz and Philipp Lenard. His letter of January 6, 1893 (describing his discovery as \\"electric photography\\") to The Physical Review was duly published and an article entitled Without Lens or Light, Photographs Taken With Plate and Object in Darkness appeared in the San Francisco Examiner.[70]\\r\\nStarting in 1888, Philipp Lenard, a student of Heinrich Hertz, conducted experiments to see whether cathode rays could pass out of the Crookes tube into the air. He built a Crookes tube (later called a \\"Lenard tube\\") with a \\"window\\" in the end made of thin aluminum, facing the cathode so the cathode rays would strike it. He found that something came through, that would expose photographic plates and cause fluorescence. He measured the penetrating power of these rays through various materials. It has been suggested that at least some of these \\"Lenard rays\\" were actually X-rays.[71]\\r\\nHermann von Helmholtz formulated mathematical equations for X-rays. He postulated a dispersion theory before R?ntgen made his discovery and announcement. It was formed on the basis of the electromagnetic theory of light.[72] However, he did not work with actual X-rays.\\r\\nIn 1894 Nikola Tesla noticed damaged film in his lab that seemed to be associated with Crookes tube experiments and began investigating this radiant energy of \\"invisible\\" kinds.[73][74] After R?ntgen identified the X-ray Tesla began making X-ray images of his own using high voltages and tubes of his own design,[75] as well as Crookes tubes.\\r\\nOn November 8, 1895, German physics professor Wilhelm R?ntgen stumbled on X-rays while experimenting with Lenard and Crookes tubes and began studying them. He wrote an initial report \\"On a new kind of ray: A preliminary communication\\" and on December 28, 1895 submitted it to Wrzburg's Physical-Medical Society journal.[76] This was the first paper written on X-rays. R?ntgen referred to the radiation as \\"X\\", to indicate that it was an unknown type of radiation. The name stuck, although (over R?ntgen's great objections) many of his colleagues suggested calling them R?ntgen rays. They are still referred to as such in many languages, including German, Danish, Polish, Swedish, Finnish, Estonian, Russian, Japanese, Dutch, and Norwegian. R?ntgen received the first Nobel Prize in Physics for his discovery.[77]\\r\\nThere are conflicting accounts of his discovery because R?ntgen had his lab notes burned after his death, but this is a likely reconstruction by his biographers:[78][79] R?ntgen was investigating cathode rays from a Crookes tube which he had wrapped in black cardboard so that the visible light from the tube would not interfere, using a fluorescent screen painted with barium platinocyanide. He noticed a faint green glow from the screen, about 1 meter away. R?ntgen realized some invisible rays coming from the tube were passing through the cardboard to make the screen glow. He found they could also pass through books and papers on his desk. R?ntgen threw himself into investigating these unknown rays systematically. Two months after his initial discovery, he published his paper.[citation needed]\\r\\nR?ntgen discovered their medical use when he made a picture of his wife's hand on a photographic plate formed due to X-rays. The photograph of his wife's hand was the first photograph of a human body part using X-rays. When she saw the picture, she said \\"I have seen my death.\\"[80]\\r\\nIn 1895, Thomas Edison investigated materials' ability to fluoresce when exposed to X-rays, and found that calcium tungstate was the most effective substance. Around March 1896, the fluoroscope he developed became the standard for medical X-ray examinations. Nevertheless, Edison dropped X-ray research around 1903, even before the death of Clarence Madison Dally, one of his glassblowers. Dally had a habit of testing X-ray tubes on his hands, and acquired a cancer in them so tenacious that both arms were amputated in a futile attempt to save his life.\\r\\nThe first use of X-rays under clinical conditions was by John Hall-Edwards in Birmingham, England on 11 January 1896, when he radiographed a needle stuck in the hand of an associate.[81] On 14 February 1896 Hall-Edwards was also the first to use X-rays in a surgical operation.[82] In early 1896, several weeks after R?ntgen's discovery, Ivan Romanovich Tarkhanov irradiated frogs and insects with X-rays, concluding that the rays \\"not only photograph, but also affect the living function\\".[83]\\r\\nThe first medical X-ray made in the United States was obtained using a discharge tube of Pulyui's design. In January 1896, on reading of R?ntgen's discovery, Frank Austin of Dartmouth College tested all of the discharge tubes in the physics laboratory and found that only the Pulyui tube produced X-rays. This was a result of Pulyui's inclusion of an oblique \\"target\\" of mica, used for holding samples of fluorescent material, within the tube. On 3 February 1896 Gilman Frost, professor of medicine at the college, and his brother Edwin Frost, professor of physics, exposed the wrist of Eddie McCarthy, whom Gilman had treated some weeks earlier for a fracture, to the X-rays and collected the resulting image of the broken bone on gelatin photographic plates obtained from Howard Langill, a local photographer also interested in R?ntgen's work.[22]\\r\\nIn 1901, U.S. President William McKinley was shot twice in an assassination attempt. While one bullet only grazed his sternum, another had lodged somewhere deep inside his abdomen and could not be found. \\"A worried McKinley aide sent word to inventor Thomas Edison to rush an X-ray machine to Buffalo to find the stray bullet. It arrived but wasn't used.\\" While the shooting itself had not been lethal, \\"gangrene had developed along the path of the bullet, and McKinley died of septic shock due to bacterial infection\\" six days later.[84]\\r\\nWith the widespread experimentation with x?rays after their discovery in 1895 by scientists, physicians, and inventors came many stories of burns, hair loss, and worse in technical journals of the time. In February 1896, Professor John Daniel and Dr. William Lofland Dudley of Vanderbilt University reported hair loss after Dr. Dudley was X-rayed. A child who had been shot in the head was brought to the Vanderbilt laboratory in 1896. Before trying to find the bullet an experiment was attempted, for which Dudley \\"with his characteristic devotion to science\\"[85][86][87] volunteered. Daniel reported that 21 days after taking a picture of Dudley's skull (with an exposure time of one hour), he noticed a bald spot 2 inches (5.1?cm) in diameter on the part of his head nearest the X-ray tube: \\"A plate holder with the plates towards the side of the skull was fastened and a coin placed between the skull and the head. The tube was fastened at the other side at a distance of one-half inch from the hair.\\"[88]\\r\\nIn August 1896 Dr. HD. Hawks, a graduate of Columbia College, suffered severe hand and chest burns from an x-ray demonstration. It was reported in Electrical Review and led to many other reports of problems associated with x-rays being sent in to the publication.[89] Many experimenters including Elihu Thomson at Edison's lab, William J. Morton, and Nikola Tesla also reported burns. Elihu Thomson deliberately exposed a finger to an x-ray tube over a period of time and suffered pain, swelling, and blistering.[90] Other effects were sometimes blamed for the damage including ultraviolet rays and (according to Tesla) ozone.[91] Many physicians claimed there were no effects from x-ray exposure at all.[90] On 3 August 1905 at San Francisco, California, Elizabeth Fleischman, American woman X-ray pioneer, died from complications as a result of her work with X-rays.[92][93][94]\\r\\nThe many applications of X-rays immediately generated enormous interest. Workshops began making specialized versions of Crookes tubes for generating X-rays and these first-generation cold cathode or Crookes X-ray tubes were used until about 1920.\\r\\nCrookes tubes were unreliable. They had to contain a small quantity of gas (invariably air) as a current will not flow in such a tube if they are fully evacuated. However, as time passed, the X-rays caused the glass to absorb the gas, causing the tube to generate \\"harder\\" X-rays until it soon stopped operating. Larger and more frequently used tubes were provided with devices for restoring the air, known as \\"softeners\\". These often took the form of a small side tube which contained a small piece of mica, a mineral that traps relatively large quantities of air within its structure. A small electrical heater heated the mica, causing it to release a small amount of air, thus restoring the tube's efficiency. However, the mica had a limited life, and the restoration process was difficult to control.\\r\\nIn 1904, John Ambrose Fleming invented the thermionic diode, the first kind of vacuum tube. This used a hot cathode that caused an electric current to flow in a vacuum. This idea was quickly applied to X-ray tubes, and hence heated-cathode X-ray tubes, called \\"Coolidge tubes\\", completely replaced the troublesome cold cathode tubes by about 1920.\\r\\nIn about 1906, the physicist Charles Barkla discovered that X-rays could be scattered by gases, and that each element had a characteristic X-ray spectrum. He won the 1917 Nobel Prize in Physics for this discovery.\\r\\nIn 1912, Max von Laue, Paul Knipping, and Walter Friedrich first observed the diffraction of X-rays by crystals. This discovery, along with the early work of Paul Peter Ewald, William Henry Bragg, and William Lawrence Bragg, gave birth to the field of X-ray crystallography.\\r\\nThe Coolidge X-ray tube was invented during the following year by William D. Coolidge. It made possible the continuous emissions of X-rays. X-ray tubes similar to this are still in use in 2012.\\r\\nThe use of X-rays for medical purposes (which developed into the field of radiation therapy) was pioneered by Major John Hall-Edwards in Birmingham, England. Then in 1908, he had to have his left arm amputated because of the spread of X-ray dermatitis on his arm.[95]\\r\\nThe X-ray microscope was developed during the 1950s.\\r\\nThe Chandra X-ray Observatory, launched on July 23, 1999, has been allowing the exploration of the very violent processes in the universe which produce X-rays. Unlike visible light, which gives a relatively stable view of the universe, the X-ray universe is unstable. It features stars being torn apart by black holes, galactic collisions, and novae, and neutron stars that build up layers of plasma that then explode into space.\\r\\nAn X-ray laser device was proposed as part of the Reagan Administration's Strategic Defense Initiative in the 1980s, but the only test of the device (a sort of laser \\"blaster\\" or death ray, powered by a thermonuclear explosion) gave inconclusive results. For technical and political reasons, the overall project (including the X-ray laser) was de-funded (though was later revived by the second Bush Administration as National Missile Defense using different technologies).\\r\\nPhase-contrast X-ray imaging refers to a variety of techniques that use phase information of a coherent x-ray beam to image soft tissues. It has become an important method for visualizing cellular and histological structures in a wide range of biological and medical studies. There are several technologies being used for x-ray phase-contrast imaging, all utilizing different principles to convert phase variations in the x-rays emerging from an object into intensity variations.[96][97] These include propagation-based phase contrast,[98] talbot interferometry,[97] refraction-enhanced imaging,[99] and x-ray interferometry.[100] These methods provide higher contrast compared to normal absorption-contrast x-ray imaging, making it possible to see smaller details. A disadvantage is that these methods require more sophisticated equipment, such as synchrotron or microfocus x-ray sources, X-ray optics, and high resolution x-ray detectors.\\r\\nWhile generally considered invisible to the human eye, in special circumstances X-rays can be visible. Brandes, in an experiment a short time after R?ntgen's landmark 1895 paper, reported after dark adaptation and placing his eye close to an X-ray tube, seeing a faint \\"blue-gray\\" glow which seemed to originate within the eye itself.[101] Upon hearing this, R?ntgen reviewed his record books and found he too had seen the effect. When placing an X-ray tube on the opposite side of a wooden door R?ntgen had noted the same blue glow, seeming to emanate from the eye itself, but thought his observations to be spurious because he only saw the effect when he used one type of tube. Later he realized that the tube which had created the effect was the only one powerful enough to make the glow plainly visible and the experiment was thereafter readily repeatable. The knowledge that X-rays are actually faintly visible to the dark-adapted naked eye has largely been forgotten today; this is probably due to the desire not to repeat what would now be seen as a recklessly dangerous and potentially harmful experiment with ionizing radiation. It is not known what exact mechanism in the eye produces the visibility: it could be due to conventional detection (excitation of rhodopsin molecules in the retina), direct excitation of retinal nerve cells, or secondary detection via, for instance, X-ray induction of phosphorescence in the eyeball with conventional retinal detection of the secondarily produced visible light.\\r\\nThough X-rays are otherwise invisible, it is possible to see the ionization of the air molecules if the intensity of the X-ray beam is high enough. The beamline from the wiggler at the ID11 at the European Synchrotron Radiation Facility is one example of such high intensity.[102]\\r\\nThe measure of X-rays ionizing ability is called the exposure:\\r\\nHowever, the effect of ionizing radiation on matter (especially living tissue) is more closely related to the amount of energy deposited into them rather than the charge generated. This measure of energy absorbed is called the absorbed dose:\\r\\nThe equivalent dose is the measure of the biological effect of radiation on human tissue. For X-rays it is equal to the absorbed dose.","input":"What type of radiation is used in x rays?"},{"output":"twelve","context":"American and Canadian football are gridiron codes of football that are very similar. Both have their origins in rugby football. There are, however, some key differences.\\r\\n\\r\\nRugby football was introduced to North America in Canada by the British Army garrison in Montreal, Quebec, which played a series of games with McGill University.[1]  In 1874, the U.S. Harvard University hosted Canada's McGill University to play the new game derived from rugby football in a home-and-home series. When the Canadians arrived several days early, to take advantage of the trip to see Boston and the surrounding areas, they held daily practices. During this time, the Americans were surprised to see the Canadians kick, chase, and then run with the ball. Picking up and running with the ball violated a basic rule of the American game of the day; when the U.S. captain (Henry Grant) pointed this out to the captain of the Canadian team (David Roger), the reply was simple: Running with the ball is a core part of the Canadian game. When the American asked which game the Canadians played, David replied \\"rugby\\". After some negotiation, it was decided to play a game with half and half Canadian/U.S. rules. Thus, many of the similarities and differences between the Canadian and American games indeed came out of this original series where each home team set the rules. For instance, Harvard, because of a lack of campus space, did not have a full-sized rugby pitch. Their pitch was only 100?yd (91?m) long by 50?yd (46?m) wide with undersized end zones (slightly less than the 53?-yard width of the current regulation-sized field for American football). Because of the reduced field, the Harvard team opted for 11 players per side, four fewer than the regulation 15 of Rugby Union. To generate more offense, Harvard also increased the number of downs from three, as set by McGill, to four. Furthermore, the Harvard players so enjoyed running with the ball, this rule was wholly adopted into all Harvard play following the two games with McGill. While the American team bested the Canadian (3-0 and a following tie game), both countries' flavours of football were forever changed and linked to one another. Both the Canadian and American games still have some things in common with the two varieties of rugby, especially rugby league, and because of the similarities, the National Football League (NFL) had a formal relationship with the Canadian Football League (CFL) between 1997 and 2008.[2]\\r\\n\\r\\nMany, perhaps most, of the rules differences have arisen because of rules changes in American football in the early 20th century which have not been copied by Canadian football. The major Canadian codes never abolished the onside scrimmage kick (see Kicker advancing the ball below) or restricted backfield motion, while the American college football (from whose code all American codes derive) did. Canadian football was later in adopting the hand snap and the forward pass, although one would not suspect the latter from play today. Additionally, Canadian football was slower in removing restrictions on blocking, but caught up by the 1970s so that no significant differences remain today. Similarly, differences in scoring (the Canadian game valuing touchdowns less) opened up from the late 19th century, but were erased by the 1950s. An area in which American football has been more conservative is the retention of the fair catch (see below).\\r\\n\\r\\nIn some regions along the Canada-U.S. border, especially western areas, some high schools from opposite sides of the border regularly play games against one another (typically one or two per team per season). By agreement between the governing bodies involved, the field of the home team is considered a legal field, although it is a different size from one school's normal field. In all but a few cases, the rules of the home team are followed throughout the game.\\r\\n\\r\\nMany CFL players are Americans who grew up playing American football and cannot find a place in the NFL, or who prefer to play in the CFL; strict import quotas restrict the number of non-Canadian players. Furthermore, the classifications of import (non-Canadian) and non-import (Canadian) were highly restrictive and required a player to have been in Canada since childhood to qualify as a non-import (i.e. a player cannot simply become a Canadian citizen and become a non-import, nor can he arrive in Canada during high school or college; both scenarios would still have the player in question classified as an import and counted against the team's maximum); these restrictions were loosened beginning in 2014 so that anyone who had become a Canadian citizen at any time before signing with the league for the first time could qualify as a non-import player. For individuals who played both American and Canadian football professionally, their career statistic totals are considered to be their combined totals from their careers in both the CFL and NFL. Warren Moon, for example, was the all-time professional football leader in passing yards after an illustrious career in both leagues. He was surpassed in 2006 by Damon Allen, who in turn was surpassed by Anthony Calvillo in 2011, both of whose careers were exclusively in the CFL.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere are several important specific differences between the Canadian and American versions of the game of football:\\r\\n\\r\\nThe official playing field in Canadian football is larger than the American, and similar to American fields prior to 1912. The Canadian field of play is 110 by 65 yards (101 by 59.4?m), rather than 100 by 53?1?3 yards (91.4 by 48.8?m) as in American football. The end zones in Canadian football are 10 yards deeper than American football end zones as the CFL uses 20-yard (18.3?m) end zones. Prior to 1986, however, the end zones were 25 yards, with Vancouver's BC Place the first to use the 20 yard-long end zone in 1983. However, beginning in 2016, the new home of the CFL's Toronto Argonauts, BMO Field, utilizes an 18-yard-long end zone.[3] Including the end zones, the Canadian field is almost 34% larger than the American field (87,750 square feet (8,152?m2) for the Canadian field vs 57,600 square feet (5,350?m2) for the American field). Occasionally, however, the Canadian field will have its end zone truncated at the corners so that the field fits in the infield of a running track. The only example in the CFL is the Percival Molson Memorial Stadium, home of the Montreal Alouettes. The goalposts for kicking are placed at the goal line in Canadian football and the end line in the American game. In Canadian rules, the distance between the sideline and hash marks is 24 yards (21.9?m); in American amateur rules, at the high school level, the distance is 17?yards 2?feet 4?inches (16.3?m), virtually sectioning the field into three equal columns. The hash marks are closer together at the American college level, where they are 20 yards (18.3?m) from the sideline, and in the NFL, where they are 23?yd 1?ft 9?in (21.6?m) from the sideline and the distance between them is the same as that between the goalposts.[4]\\r\\n\\r\\nBecause of the larger field, many American football venues are generally unfit for the Canadian game. While there are several American stadia which could accommodate the extra ?17?1?2?feet (nearly 6 yards (5.5?m) per side in width (multi-purpose stadiums, baseball parks converted for football, and some soccer-specific stadiums are particularly good fits), most American stadia would lose between fifteen and eighteen rows of seating in each end zone because the field is 15 yards (13.7?m) longer on each end. In many smaller venues, this would be the entire end zone section, losing seating for at least 3,000 spectators. During the CFL's failed expansion to U.S. cities, Canadian football was either played on fields designed to accommodate both American football and baseball (such as the Baltimore Stallions playing at Memorial Stadium), or in some cases, on a field designed for American football (for instance, the Memphis Mad Dogs and the Birmingham Barracudas of the CFL, playing in the Liberty Bowl and at Legion Field, respectively, played the Canadian game on modified American-sized fields because of the inability of the stadia to adapt to the larger field). The Alamodome, originally built as a multi-purpose dome, proved to best accommodate both Canadian football (the CFL's San Antonio Texans) and American football (Alamo Bowl, Dallas Cowboys training camp, the New Orleans Saints after Hurricane Katrina, the NFLPA Game, the U.S. Army All-American Bowl and the UTSA Roadrunners), although Canadian football is no longer played there. Similarly, Hornet Stadium fairly easily adapted to both the Canadian and American game, as it was built with a running track in which the Canadian field fits with only some cuts to the corners. Hornet Stadium hosts California State University, Sacramento (more often known as Sacramento State), hosted the Sacramento Surge and Sacramento Mountain Lions in American football and hosted the Sacramento Gold Miners in Canadian football.[citation needed]\\r\\n\\r\\nAmerican teams use eleven players, while Canadian teams have twelve players on the field per side. Both games have the same number of offensive players required at the line of scrimmage, so the twelfth player in the Canadian game plays a backfield position on offence, whereas this is usually a defensive back on defence.[5]\\r\\n\\r\\nBecause of this, position designations of the various offensive and defensive lines vary. For example, there is no tight end in most formations in Canadian football (this position was phased out in 1980 in the Canadian game).[6] The typical offensive arrangement in Canadian football is for there to be two slotbacks instead of the American tight end, while on the defensive end of the ball, two defensive halfbacks are used instead of one strong safety in the American game.[citation needed]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe sizes of individual American and Canadian footballs can vary within specified size limitations. Because the ball size specifications for the CFL and NFL are nearly identical, the same ball can fall within the requirements of both.[citation needed]\\r\\n\\r\\nHistorically the CFL ball was slightly larger, both because of slightly bigger specifications, but also because CFL manufacturers tended to make balls at the larger end of the allowed tolerances as opposed to NFL manufacturers who built balls to the smaller end. However, the CFL updated its specifications in 1985.[7]\\r\\n\\r\\nAccording to the current standards the regulation size for a Canadian Football League football is specified as: short circumference from 20?7?8 to 21?1?8 inches (530 to 537?mm); long circumference from 27?3?4 to 28?1?4 inches (705 to 718?mm).[8]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe regulation size for a National Football League football is specified as: short circumference from 21 to 21?1?4 inches (533 to 540?mm); long circumference from 28 to 28?1?2 inches (711 to 724?mm).[9]\\r\\n\\r\\nDespite the fact that the CFL rules allow for a smaller legal ball and the NFL rules allow for a larger legal ball, there is a common misconception among media, fans, and even players that the current CFL ball is bigger. Some professional quarterbacks have stated that they notice a difference in size.[10]\\r\\n\\r\\nAnother difference between NFL and CFL balls is that Canadian balls have two 1 inch (25?mm) complete white stripes around the football 3 inches (76?mm) from the largest diameter of the ball and NFL balls have no stripes at all. College football and high school football both specify the use of stripes, but only on two of the football's four panels (the ones adjacent to the laces).[citation needed]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn American football, a team has four downs to advance the ball ten yards, while in Canadian football the limit is three downs.[11][12]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn both games, the ball is placed at a line of scrimmage, in which a player known as the centre/center performs a snap to start a football play. In Canadian football, the snap is required to go between the centre's legs; there is no such requirement in American football, but it is invariably done this way anyway, so the center is in position to block following the snap. The defensive team must stay a set distance away from the line of scrimmage on their side of the line.[citation needed]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn Canadian football, the distance between the line of scrimmage and the defensive team is a full yard. Because of this one-yard distance, teams will tend to gamble on third and one or third and inches. If a team has possession within one yard of either goal line, the line of scrimmage is moved to the one-yard line.[13]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn American football, the set distance between the offensive and defensive teams is eleven inches?ÿ the length of the ball, creating the illusion of the teams being \\"nose-to-nose\\" against each other.[citation needed]\\r\\n\\r\\nWhile large, relatively immobile offensive line players used to form a line that cannot be easily penetrated by the defense are valued in American football, the extra distance from the defensive team means Canadian football finds value in more nimble athletes.[14]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn American football, if a punt returner sees that, in his judgment, he will be unable to advance the ball after catching it, he may signal for a fair catch by waving his hand in the air, and forgo the attempt to advance. If he makes this signal, the opposing team must allow him to attempt to catch the ball cleanly; if he is interfered with, the team covering the kick will be penalized fifteen yards. In contrast, there is no fair catch rule in Canadian football: instead no player from the kicking team, except the kicker or any player who was behind him when he kicked the ball, may approach within five yards of the ball until it has been touched by an opponent. If they do, a \\"no yards\\" penalty is called against the kicking team. Penalties for \\"no yards\\" calls vary on whether the ball made contact with the ground or not. The penalty is 5 yards if the ball has bounced and 15 if the ball is caught in the air.[15]\\r\\n\\r\\nFurthermore, in American football the receiving team may elect not to play the ball if the prospects for a return are not good and the returner is not certain he can successfully catch the ball on the fly; American players are generally taught not to attempt to touch a bouncing football. If any member of the kicking team touches the ball after the kick is made, without an intervening touch by the member of the receiving team, the receiving team may elect to scrimmage the ball from that spot of first touching, regardless of anything else (other than a penalty) that happens during the rest of the play. If the kicking team gains possession of the ball during the kick before it is touched by the receiving team, the ball is then dead. Often, the ball hits the ground and is surrounded by players from the kicking team, who allow it to roll as far as possible downfield  ÿ without going into the end zone  ÿ before grasping or holding the ball against the ground. (If a punt bounces into the receiving team's end zone, it is dead, and a touchback is awarded.) On the other hand, if the ball touches a member of the receiving team without his gaining possession (a \\"muff\\"), then the ball can be recovered by either team (but cannot be advanced by the kicking team). If the kicking team recovers the ball, they regain possession and are awarded a first down at the spot of the recovery.[citation needed]\\r\\n\\r\\nFollowing a fair catch in American football, the receiving team can elect a free kick (called a fair catch kick) from the spot the ball is received ÿ and if the kick goes through the opposite goal posts a field goal is scored. Fair catch kicks are rarely attempted in the NFL and are usually unsuccessful (The last successful fair catch kick was in 1976). The fair catch kick is not allowed in college football.[citation needed]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn Canadian football, if the receiving team does not play the ball, the kicker, and any teammates behind the kicker at the time of the kick, can attempt to retrieve and advance the ball. This is further explained in the kicker advancing the ball section.[citation needed]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn American football, after all players are set, only one offensive player is allowed to be in motion, and he cannot be moving toward the line of scrimmage while the ball is snapped. The motion player must also be behind the line of scrimmage; players on the line cannot be in motion.[16]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn Canadian football, all offensive backfield players, except the quarterback, may be in motion at the snap  ÿ players in motion may move in any direction as long as they are behind the line of scrimmage at the snap. In addition, the two players on the ends of the line of scrimmage (generally wide receivers) may also be in motion along the line.[13] Many teams encourage this unlimited motion, as it can confuse the defence. It also provides receivers the advantage of a running start, as they can time their runs so that they cross the line of scrimmage at speed when the ball is snapped, allowing them to get downfield faster than receivers in American football, allowing for comparatively longer throws in the same amount of time after the snap or quicker throws for a given distance.[citation needed]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn American football, the offensive team must run a play within 25 seconds of the referee whistling the play in ÿ except in the NCAA (college) and the NFL where teams have 40 seconds from the end of the previous play, or 25 seconds following a penalty or timeout. In Canadian football, teams have 20 seconds regardless of the preceding situation.[17]\\r\\n\\r\\nAmerican football rules allow each team to have three timeouts in each half, and the NFL stops play for a two-minute warning. However, NCAA football has no two-minute warning, but the clock stops on a first down until the ball is ready for play if the play ended in the field of play. In the CFL, each team has two time-outs a game but cannot use both in the last three minutes of the game, while at lower levels of Canadian football each team has two. In Canadian football there is a three-minute rather than a two-minute warning. Also, at all levels of Canadian football, the clock is stopped after every play during the last three minutes of each half. Once the referee has set the ball the clock will restart if the last play ended with a runner tackled in the field of play.[citation needed]\\r\\n\\r\\nTiming rules change drastically after the N-minute warning in both leagues:\\r\\n\\r\\nThese timing differences, combined with the fewer downs available for the Canadian offence to earn a first down, lead to spectacularly different end-games if the team leading the game has the ball. In American football, if the other team is out of time-outs, it is possible to run slightly more than 120 seconds (two minutes) off the clock without gaining a first down. In Canadian football, just over 40 seconds can be run off.[citation needed]\\r\\n\\r\\nCanadian football retains much more liberal rules regarding recovery of the ball by members of the kicking team. On any kick, the kicker and any member of the kicker's team behind the kicker at the time of the kick may recover and advance the ball. On a kickoff, since every member of the kicking team must be behind the ball when it is kicked, this effectively makes all twelve players \\"onside\\" and eligible to recover the kick, once it has gone ten yards downfield. On a punt or missed field goal, usually only the kicker is onside, as no one is behind the kicker. All of the players offside at the time of the kick may neither touch the ball nor be within five yards of the member of the receiving team who fields the kick; violation of this rule is a penalty for no yards. The penalty for no yards is 15 yards if the kick is in flight and 5 yards if it has been grounded.[citation needed]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe American rules are similar for the recovery of kickoffs. Any member of the kicking team may recover the ball once it has touched an opponent or once it has gone ten yards downfield and touched the ground. The ball is dead when recovered, though the kicking team is awarded possession at the spot of recovery.[citation needed]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe American rules differ from the Canadian ones for scrimmage kicks. In American rules to recover a scrimmage kick (punt or missed field goal) and retain possession, the ball must be touched beyond the line of scrimmage by a member of the receiving team (defense). If the ball is touched by the receiving team and then recovered by the kicking team, the kicking team will retain possession and be awarded a first down. If the receiving team has not touched the ball before the kicking team touches it, it is first touching as described above in fair catches and punt returns.[citation needed]\\r\\n\\r\\nAdditionally, members of the kicking team must allow the receiving team the opportunity to catch a scrimmage kick in flight. There is no required distance; the NCAA revoked its rule of a 2-yard halo.[19]\\r\\nOnce the scrimmage kick has touched the ground, the kicking team is free to recover, subject to the first touching rules.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn both codes, a scrimmage kick which is blocked and recovered by the kicking team behind the line of scrimmage is in play. The kicking team may then choose to either attempt another kick or try to advance the ball, however no turnover has taken place on the play (unless a member of the receiving team has control of the ball), and therefore, the kicking team either has to advance the ball to the first down marker, or loses the down, which often results in a turnover on downs.[citation needed]\\r\\n\\r\\nUnder Canadian rules, the defensive line can only hold up or block a receiver within one yard of the scrimmage lines. In the NFL, contact up to five yards from the line is allowed. This allows for more open plays in Canadian football.[citation needed]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn Canadian play, if the ball is fumbled out of bounds, the play ends with possession going to the team to last contact the ball in bounds (after the ball has completely left the possession of the fumbling ball carrier). A loose ball may be kicked forward (dribbled) provided it is then recovered by a player who is onside at the time of said kick. The ball may not, however, be intentionally kicked out of bounds to gain possession, this is then treated as a scrimmage kick out of bounds and possession goes to the opposing team. Incidental contact with the foot does not count as kicking the ball out of bounds. In American play, when a ball is fumbled out of bounds, the last team to have clear possession of the football is awarded possession, unless the ball goes out of the back or side of the end zone.\\r\\n\\r\\nA team may still lose possession after a fumble out of bounds if the fumble occurred on fourth down (third down in Canadian play) and the ball becomes dead short of the line to gain. Because of plays like the Holy Roller, the NFL changed its rule regarding advancing a fumbled ball on offense. If the offensive team fumbles in the last two minutes of either half, or on fourth down at any time, only the player who fumbled is allowed to advance the ball past the point of the fumble. If any other offensive player advances the ball toward the opponent's goal line, the ball is moved back to the spot of the fumble, and the defensive team gains possession on downs unless the ball is recovered behind the spot of the fumble.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn Canadian football any kick that goes into the end zone is a live ball, except for a successful field goal or if the goalposts are hit while the ball is in flight. If the player receiving the kick fails to return it out of the end zone, or (except on a kickoff) if the ball was kicked through the end zone, then the kicking team scores a single point (rouge), and the returning team scrimmages from its 35-yard line or, if the rouge is scored as a result of a missed field goal attempt, the receiving team may choose the last point of scrimmage. If a kickoff goes through the end zone without a player touching it or a kicked ball in flight hits a post without scoring a field goal, there is no score, and the receiving team scrimmages from its 25-yard line. If the kick is returned out of the end zone, the receiving team next scrimmages from the place that was reached (or if they reach the opponents' goal line, they score a touchdown); in the amateur levels of the game, they are given the ball at their 20-yard line if the kick was not returned that far.[20]\\r\\n\\r\\nSingles do not exist in American football; however, only one point is counted when a safety is scored during a conversion attempt, in contrast to the two points scored on other safeties.[citation needed]\\r\\n\\r\\nAmerican football also allows a defending team to advance a missed field goal; however, because of the absence of singles and the goalpost position at the back of the end zone, the return is rarely exercised, except on a blocked kick, or as time expires in the half or in the game (with the most famous recent example being Chris Davis' game-ending return of a missed field goal for the winning touchdown in the 2013 AlabamaÿAuburn game). Most teams instead elect not to attempt a return and assume possession  ÿ at the previous line of scrimmage in the NCAA and at the spot of the kick in the NFL. Since the goalpost is out of bounds, any non-scoring kick that strikes the goalpost is dead, and the receiving team takes over possession from the spot of the kick or their own 20-yard line, whichever is further from the receiving team's goal. Likewise, any kickoff or punt which either is kicked through the end zone, is kicked into the end zone and rolls out of bounds (without being touched by a player), is touched in the end zone by a member of the kicking team (with no member of the receiving team having touched it), or is downed in the end zone by a member of the receiving team, results in a touchback ÿ the receiving team is awarded possession on their own 20-yard line. If a player of the receiving team fields a kickoff or punt in the end zone, he has the option to down it in the end zone (resulting in a touchback) or to try and advance the ball.[citation needed]\\r\\n\\r\\nFollowing a successful field goal, in Canadian rules, the team scored upon has the option of receiving a kickoff, kicking off from its 35-yard line, or scrimmaging at its own 35-yard line (the CFL first instituted this rule in 1975, but eliminated this last option for the 2009 season, but it was reinstated for 2010). In American football, there is a kickoff by the scoring team after every score, with the exception of safeties (see below). The option for the scored-upon team to kick off after a touchdown exists in American amateur football, but it is very rarely exercised.[citation needed]\\r\\n\\r\\nCanadian football retains the open-field kick as a legal play, allowing a kick to be taken from anywhere on the field. The open-field kick may be used as a desperation last play by the offense: realizing they are unable to go the length of the field, they advance part of the way and attempt a drop kick, trying to score a field goal, or recover the ball in the end zone for a touchdown.[21]\\r\\n\\r\\nConversely, the defence, facing a last-second field goal attempt in a tie game or game they lead by one point, will often position its punter and place-kicker in the end zone. If the field goal is missed, they can punt the ball back into the field of play and not concede a single. Multiple such kicks may be attempted on the same play. During the October 29, 2010, Toronto Argonauts game against the Montreal Alouettes, four kicks occurred in one play: after a Montreal missed field goal, the Argonauts punted from the end zone to about the 20-yard line. The ball was caught and immediately punted back to the end zone by Montreal to attempt a single, and finally the Argos punted but failed to kick it out of the end zone, where the Alouettes recovered it for a touchdown.[22] [23]\\r\\n\\r\\nAmerican football only allows free kicks and scrimmage kicks made from behind the line of scrimmage; any kick beyond the line of scrimmage or after change of possession would result in a penalty.  (Some levels of American football allow the rare fair catch kick, which according to the NFL rules is neither a free kick nor scrimmage kick, but sui generis.)[citation needed]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn both American and Canadian football, a safety (or safety touch) awards 2 points to the defending team if the offensive team is brought down in their end zone. In American football, the team giving up the safety must take a free kick from their own 20-yard line. In Canadian football, the team being awarded the 2 points has the option of scrimmaging from their own 35-yard line, kicking the ball off from their own 35-yard line, or having the opposing team kick off the ball from their own 35-yard line. In 2009, the CFL changed the latter option to be a kick-off from their own 25-yard line.[24]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn both games, after a touchdown is scored, the scoring team may then attempt one play for additional points. In Canadian football, this play is called a convert, and in American football, it is formally called a try, although it is more commonly referred to as either a conversion, extra point, or point after touchdown (PAT).   The additional points may be earned through a kick or a play from scrimmage. If done via kick, the scoring team gains one point, and if done from a scrimmage, the scoring team gains two.[citation needed]\\r\\n\\r\\nHowever, the position of the ball for attempts is different in the two games. Point-after-touchdown attempts are snapped from the following points (as of the 2015 season):.[citation needed]\\r\\n\\r\\nBecause the goalposts are on the goal line in Canada and the end line in the United States, a CFL kicker is at the same distance from the goalposts as an NFL kicker. Before the 2015 CFL season, that league used the 5-yard line for all attempts, which meant that the Canadian kicker was closer to the goal posts than an American kicker at any level. Amateur Canadian kickers remain closer to their goal posts than their American counterparts.[citation needed]\\r\\n\\r\\nAccording to the rules of both the NFL and NCAA, on conversion attempts, the ball will automatically be spotted in the middle of the field at the appropriate scrimmage line unless a member of the kicking team expressly asks a referee for an alternative placement. Per the rules, the ball can be placed at another spot between the hash marks (especially for strategic positioning on a 2-point conversion attempt) or at another spot further back from the 2-, 3-, or 15-yard line (not uncommon at lower levels of football, since as the season progresses, conditions may worsen toward the center of the field, especially at the spot from which the PAT is usually kicked; the kicker may thus request a spot where the footing is surer).[citation needed]\\r\\n\\r\\nDuring conversions, the ball is considered live in the CFL, American collegiate football, some high school associations, the now-defunct NFL Europa, and starting with the 2015 season the NFL itself. As such, this allows the defensive team to gain two points on an interception or fumble return should they reach the kicking team's end zone, or (in the CFL) one point should the defensive team make an open-field drop kick through the kicking team's goalposts. Conversely, in other levels of American football and amateur Canadian football, defensive teams cannot score during a try attempt.[citation needed]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn Canadian amateur football, the ball is not dead if a player kneels momentarily to, and does, recover a rolling snap, onside/lateral pass, or opponent's kick, while in American amateur football, such a situation produces a dead ball, unless the player is the holder for a place kick. The holder is allowed to catch the snap or recover a rolling snap while on a knee to hold the kick and may also rise to catch a high snap and immediately return to a knee.[citation needed]\\r\\n\\r\\nAt professional levels in both games, unless it is a clearly willful kneel or slide by a ball carrier to go down, a player must be touched while on the ground, otherwise, the player may stand up and continue to advance the ball. Hitting a player who is kneeling, sliding, or clearly intends to run the ball out of bounds (especially quarterbacks) is generally viewed as unsportsmanlike and is often penalized, and in the most blatant of cases (especially if it happens in the dying seconds of a game), the player may be subject to off-field disciplinary action by their respective league governing body, usually in the form of fines or suspensions.[citation needed]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe procedures to settle games that are tied at the end of regulation vary considerably among football leagues.\\r\\n\\r\\nMost leagues other than the NFL, including the CFL, use a procedure frequently called the \\"Kansas Playoff\\", so named because it was first developed for high school football in that state. The rules are summarized here:[citation needed]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe NFL overtime is a modified sudden-death period of 15 minutes, for playoff games only; since the 2017 season, overtime periods in the preseason and regular season are 10 minutes, as part of an overall effort by the NFL to speed up games and reduce their length. If the team that receives the opening kickoff scores a touchdown, or the defensive team scores a safety, the game ends at that point. If the receiving team scores a field goal, the game continues with the scoring team kicking off, and the scored-upon team having a chance at possession. If that team scores a touchdown, or loses possession, the game ends; if it scores a field goal, overtime continues, with the next score by either team ending the game. In the regular season, if a game remains tied after the 10-minute period, it is declared a tie. In postseason games, there are multiple 15-minute periods until a winner is decided.[citation needed]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn American high school and college football, as well as all Canadian football, receivers need only have one foot in bounds for a catch to count as a reception. NFL play requires two feet in bounds and, up through the 2007 season, an NFL official could also award a catch if it was judged that the receiver would have come down in bounds if he had not been pushed by a defender. This rule was based on a judgment call by the official, and was criticized for being inconsistent. The rule was dropped prior to the 2008 season by the NFL.[25]\\r\\n\\r\\nCFL roster sizes are 46 players (rather than 53 as in the NFL, though only 45 will dress for a game). A CFL team may dress up to 44 players comprising 21 non-imports (essentially, Canadians), 20 imports (almost exclusively Americans), and 3 quarterbacks.[26]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe traditional NFL football season runs from the 2nd week of September until late December or the start of January, with the NFL playoffs occurring in January and February. In contrast, the CFL regular season runs from late June to late October. This is in order to ensure the Grey Cup playoffs can be completed in mid-November, before the harsh Canadian winters set in. This is an important consideration for a sport played in outdoor venues in locations such as Regina, Saskatchewan; Toronto, Ontario; Hamilton, Ontario; Calgary, Alberta; Edmonton, Alberta; Winnipeg, Manitoba and Montreal, Quebec.\\r\\n\\r\\nOfficials' penalty flags used in the CFL are orange in color. In American football, officials typically use yellow penalty flags. Conversely, coaches' challenge flags for replays are yellow in the CFL as opposed to red in the NFL. Further, in the CFL, the referee wears a black cap with white piping, and the other officials wear white caps with black piping. In American leagues, the referee wears a solid white cap, and the other officials wear black with white piping.[26]\\r\\n\\r\\nAdditionally, when announcing penalties, in American football, the penalized team is announced using generic terms (\\"offense\\"/\\"defense\\", for example), but in Canadian football (especially the CFL) the penalized team is announced by their respective city or province.\\r\\n\\r\\nAlthough the rules of Canadian and American football have similarities, the differences have a great effect on how teams play and are managed. Generally, the \\"big play\\" is more important in the Canadian game, and offensive series are more difficult to manage.[citation needed]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe red zone is an unofficial designating the portion of the field between the 20-yard line and the goal line. Due to the goalposts' being on the goal line in Canadian football, teams must avoid hitting the goalposts. Thus most touchdown throws are aimed away from the centre portion of the end zone. In the CFL, the goalposts have the same construction as the NFL posts, with the centre post being about 2 yards deep in the end zone. It is extremely rare for CFL passes to hit any part of the posts. When this occurs, a dead ball results. Occasionally, receivers can use the post to good effect in a 'rub' play to shed a defender. End zone passing becomes even more complicated when the corners of the end zone are truncated, as is the case at stadia where the field is bounded by a running track. However, the offensive team enjoys a counteracting advantage of end zones more than twice the size of those in American football (20 yards with a wider field), significantly expanding the area that must be covered by the defensive team and also allowing the freedom to run some pass patterns not available in American football's red zone. Moreover, the rule requiring only a single foot to be in bounds upon pass reception in Canadian football further stretches the amount of area that the offenses have to work with. NFL offenses generally try a run between tackles when on the one-yard line.  CFL offenses make similar attempts on first down on the one-yard line, but second and third down attempts, if required, can be much more varied than their NFL counterparts.[citation needed]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe frequency of punts is highly dependent upon the success, or lack thereof, of the offense. Punt returns are ubiquitous in Canadian football because the \\"no-yards\\" rule permits virtually every punt to be fielded and returned. Moreover, if the kicking team punts the ball out of bounds in an attempt to forestall a return and the ball goes out of bounds between the two 20-yard lines without touching the ground first, a 10-yard penalty is assessed and the ball advanced from where it left play, or the kicking team is backed up 10 yards and must replay the down.[27]  \\"Shanked\\" punts are therefore extremely costly to the kicking team. Though missed field goals may be returned in both national rule sets, the deeper end zone and goal post positioning make this much more common in Canadian rules. TSN on-air analysts state that they are the single play-from-scrimmage most likely to result in a touchdown. This set of special teams play (field goal return units) are rare in the American game to the point where a returner is not a standard part of a defensive field goal unit and will only be seen in unusual circumstances, with one especially notable example being the famous \\"Kick Six\\" college football game in 2013. Canadian kickoffs rarely result in a touchback, so special teams are more prominent in that area of the game as well. The difference in the games' final minutes procedures make comebacks  and the need for an onside kick 'hands' team, more prominent as well. The rule regarding last touch of the ball before leaving the play of field, rather than American football's last possession rule, makes the onside kick more likely to be successful as well. The most complex coaching job in Canadian football is said[by whom?] to be that of special teams co-ordinator. As many as 40 of a CFL roster of players may have a special teams role because of the wide variety of possible situations. In 2014 and 2015, the Edmonton Eskimos even used their third-string quarterbacks (Pat White in 2014 and Jordan Lynch in 2015[28]) as part of their kick and kick-coverage teams. This is highly unusual, as quarterbacks are generally discouraged from making contact plays. Kick returning was a duty generally handled by a player with another role, such as receiver or defensive back. Henry \\"The Gizmo\\" Williams[29] was the first player designated by telecasts as \\"KR\\" for a kicker returner position as his duties were almost entirely for that role, and referring to him as \\"WR\\" for wide receiver was increasingly seen as anachronistic. By far the greatest kick returner in professional football history, Gizmo Williams had more returns for touchdowns called back for infractions than any other player has ever scored (28  26 punts, 2 kick-offs).  No NFL player has enjoyed similar success and the careers of such specialists (like Devin Hester) come nowhere near to matching the impact on the game that such players have in the CFL.[citation needed]\\r\\n\\r\\nHaving three downs on a much longer and wider field with unlimited backfield motion results in Canadian teams requiring faster, more nimble athletes (comparatively) than their American counterparts. Paradoxically, this makes Canadian defense better at defending rushing plays. Rushing plays tend to be unlikely to produce a full ten yard gain, and if correctly anticipated by the defense, much gain at all. The fewer downs means that an unsuccessful rushing play leaves an offense to have a single play to make comparatively longer first down yardage, so rushing plays are less-favored unless the team on offense is actively managing the clock while maintaining the lead. Pundits often like to claim that a Canadian team that rushes for 100 yards or more per game is likely to win, but the reality is winning teams rush the ball in defense of their leads, and not as a tactic to produce drives that lead to points unless they are markedly superior to their opponents. The larger field generally permits greater YAC (yards after catch) on each individual catch, where the NFL produces passing plays where there are either very few YAC yards (immediate tackle) or huge YAC yards (missed tackle or broken coverage for huge gains.)  For this reason, Canadian teams usually prefer passing over rushing to a greater extent than American, since pass attempts generally tend to gain more yards than rushing. Offensive drives (continuous possession of the ball) tend to be shorter. Long drives of half a quarter or more are common in American football but rare in Canadian.[citation needed]\\r\\nIn theory, an NFL team taking possession on their own one-yard line, using three downs for each first-down conversion and the full 40 second clock could run 27 plays and consume a full 18 minutes of clock time covering the 99 yards. A CFL team doing something similar (two plays per conversion, 20 second clock, average 10 seconds of clock time while the officials reset the ball between plays, 109 yards) would run 24 plays and consume 12 minutes of clock at the most. Typical drive lengths in practice reflect this theoretical difference.[citation needed]\\r\\n\\r\\nOne other notable difference is the propensity of CFL quarterbacks to rush the ball, both by design and as a result of reacting to the defense. Damon Allen[30] (the younger brother of Pro Football Hall of Fame running back Marcus Allen) had 11,920 rushing yards to go along with 72,381 passing yards in his 23-year career and actually sits third overall in career rushing yards. Contrast that will Randall Cunnigham's 4928 yards over 16 seasons.[31] 1000 yard rushing seasons for CFL quarterbacks have occurred,[32] and 400+ yard seasons for playoff bound teams' starting quarterbacks, if they remain healthy for the entire schedule, are not unusual.[citation needed]\\r\\n\\r\\nPerhaps the greatest difference arises due to the virtually unlimited movement allowed in the defensive and offensive backfields on a play from scrimmage in the Canadian game vs. very restricted offensive movement in the American game. Combined with the much larger field size, this difference changes the skillsets required of the athletes. Canadian wide receivers, safeties and cornerbacks are far enough from the point where the ball is snapped that they rarely participate in rush offense or defense. Linebackers can be called upon to successfully defend running backs sent to receive passes. There is therefore a much greater premium placed on athletic speed, with former Edmonton Eskimos GM and former wide receiver Ed Hervey (6?ft 0?in?[183?cm], 195?lb?[88?kg], All-American at USC in the 200 meter) and Malcolm Frank[30] (5?ft 8?in?[173?cm] 170?lb?[77?kg]) being prototypical for the CFL. The offence has many more formation options and starting positions, forcing the defence to anticipate more possibilities. Seven of the 12 men on a CFL offense (typically the five linemen and the wide receivers) must be at the line of scrimmage at the time of the snap, and the other five must be at least one yard behind the line. Only the quarterback and linemen must be motionless at the time of the snap, allowing up to six players to be moving toward or along the line at varying speeds (typically the wide receivers are still or at a walking pace at the snap to ensure they are at the line of scrimmage.)[citation needed]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn both the college and pro games, an offensive team with the lead has more difficulty in running out the clock in the Canadian game. In the Canadian Football League, the clock is stopped while the officials place the ball, and then they whistle the game clock and play clock to begin in the last minutes of a half; whereas in the National Football League the clock remains running while the officials set the ball (dependent upon the result of the previous playpenalty, incomplete pass, out-of-bounds, or tackle inbounds in both leagues) while the play clock of 40 seconds runs down. The game clock only begins again when the play is whistled in, for an inbounds tackle, or at the snap of the ball for the other outcomes in the CFL. A team that is ahead has one fewer opportunity to kill clock time in the Canadian game with three downs, and can only take the play clock time (20 seconds) and the length of the play itself off the clock with each down. After the three-minute warning, a penalty of a loss of down (on first and second down, 10 yards on third down) results for failing to start the new play in time (time count violation). Additionally, if a Canadian team commits a time count violation on third down, the referee has the right to require that it legally start a new play before the play clock expires, and can award possession to the defending team if another time count is committed. If a team that is trailing in the CFL can begin to produce two-and-outs on defense and efficient scoring drives on offense, 14 and even 17 points can be successfully scored in the final three minutes. This comeback proclivity is so pronounced that the CFL uses it for marketing purposes: No Lead Is Safe.[33]","input":"How many players are on the field in the cfl?"},{"output":"Konrad Zuse","context":"The Z1  was a mechanical computer designed by Konrad Zuse from 1935 to 1936 and built by him from 1936 to 1938.[1][2] It was a binary electrically driven mechanical calculator with limited programmability, reading instructions from punched celluloid film.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Z1 was the first freely programmable computer in the world which used Boolean logic and binary floating-point numbers, however it was unreliable in operation.[3][4]  It was completed in 1938 and financed completely from private funds. This computer was destroyed in the bombardment of Berlin in December 1943, during World War II, together with all construction plans.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Z1 was the first in a series of computers that Zuse designed. Its original name was \\"V1\\" for VersuchsModell 1 (meaning Experimental Model 1). After WW2, it was renamed \\"Z1\\" to differentiate from the flying bombs designed by Robert Lusser.[5] The Z2 and Z3 were follow-ups based on many of the same ideas as the Z1.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Z1 contained almost all the parts of a modern computer, i.e. control unit, memory, micro sequences, floating-point logic and inputÿoutput devices. The Z1 was freely programmable via punched tape and a punched tape reader.[6] There was a clear separation between the punched tape reader, the control unit for supervising the whole machine and the execution of the instructions, the arithmetic unit, and the input and output devices.\\r\\nThe input tape unit read perforations in 35-millimeter film.[7]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Z1 was a 22-bit floating-point value adder and subtracter, with some control logic to make it capable of more complex operations such as multiplication (by repeated additions) and division (by repeated subtractions). The Z1's instruction set had nine instructions and it took between one and twenty cycles per instruction.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Z1 had a 64-word floating-point memory, where each word of memory could be read from ÿ and written to ÿ by the control unit. The mechanical memory units were unique in their design and were patented by Konrad Zuse in 1936. The machine was only capable of executing instructions while reading from the punched tape reader, so the program itself was not loaded in its entirety into internal memory in advance.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe input and output were in decimal numbers, with a decimal exponent and the units had special machinery for converting these to and from binary numbers. The input and output instructions would be read or written as floating-point numbers.

The monsoon trough, alternatively known as the intertropical convergence zone, plays a significant role in creating the climatic conditions necessary for the Earth's tropical rainforests.\\r\\nAround 40% to 75% of all biotic species are indigenous to the rainforests.[2] There may be many millions of species of plants, insects and microorganisms still undiscovered in tropical rainforests. Tropical rainforests have been called the \\"jewels of the Earth\\" and the \\"world's largest pharmacy\\", because over one quarter of natural medicines have been discovered there.[3] Rainforests are also responsible for 28% of the world's oxygen turnover, sometimes misnamed oxygen production,[4] processing it through photosynthesis from carbon dioxide and consuming it through respiration.\\r\\nThe undergrowth in some areas of a rainforest can be restricted by poor penetration of sunlight to ground level. If the leaf canopy is destroyed or thinned, the ground beneath is soon colonized by a dense, tangled growth of vines, shrubs and small trees, called a jungle. The term jungle is also sometimes applied to tropical rainforests generally.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nTropical rainforests are characterized by a warm and wet climate with no substantial dry season: typically found within 10 degrees north and south of the equator. Mean monthly temperatures exceed 18?C (64?F) during all months of the year.[5] Average annual rainfall is no less than 168?cm (66?in) and can exceed 1,000?cm (390?in) although it typically lies between 175?cm (69?in) and 200?cm (79?in).[6]\\r\\nMany of the world's tropical forests are associated with the location of the monsoon trough, also known as the intertropical convergence zone.[7] The broader category of tropical moist forests are located in the equatorial zone between the Tropic of Cancer and Tropic of Capricorn. Tropical rainforests exist in Southeast Asia (from Myanmar (Burma) to the Philippines, Malaysia, Indonesia, Papua New Guinea and Sri Lanka; also in Sub-Saharan Africa from the Cameroon to the Congo (Congo Rainforest), South America (e.g. the Amazon rainforest), Central America (e.g. Bosaws, the southern Yucatn Peninsula-El Peten-Belize-Calakmul), Australia, and on Pacific Islands (such as Hawai?i). Tropical forests have been called the \\"Earth's lungs\\", although it is now known that rainforests contribute little net oxygen addition to the atmosphere through photosynthesis.[8][9]\\r\\nTropical forests cover a large part of the globe, but temperate rainforests only occur in few regions around the world. Temperate rainforests are rainforests in temperate regions. They occur in North America (in the Pacific Northwest in Alaska, British Columbia, Washington, Oregon and California), in Europe (parts of the British Isles such as the coastal areas of Ireland and Scotland, southern Norway, parts of the western Balkans along the Adriatic coast, as well as in Galicia and coastal areas of the eastern Black Sea, including Georgia and coastal Turkey), in East Asia (in southern China, Highlands of Taiwan, much of Japan and Korea, and on Sakhalin Island and the adjacent Russian Far East coast), in South America (southern Chile) and also in Australia and New Zealand.[10]\\r\\nA tropical rainforest typically has a number of layers, each with different plants and animals adapted for life in that particular area. Examples include the emergent, canopy, understory and forest floor layers.\\r\\nThe emergent layer contains a small number of very large trees called emergents, which grow above the general canopy, reaching heights of 45ÿ55 m, although on occasion a few species will grow to 70ÿ80 m tall.[11][12] They need to be able to withstand the hot temperatures and strong winds that occur above the canopy in some areas. Eagles, butterflies, bats and certain monkeys inhabit this layer.\\r\\nThe canopy layer contains the majority of the largest trees, typically 30 metres (98?ft) to 45 metres (148?ft) tall. The densest areas of biodiversity are found in the forest canopy, a more or less continuous cover of foliage formed by adjacent treetops. The canopy, by some estimates, is home to 50 percent of all plant species. Epiphytic plants attach to trunks and branches, and obtain water and minerals from rain and debris that collects on the supporting plants. The fauna is similar to that found in the emergent layer, but more diverse. A quarter of all insect species are believed to exist in the rainforest canopy. Scientists have long suspected the richness of the canopy as a habitat, but have only recently developed practical methods of exploring it. As long ago as 1917, naturalist William Beebe declared that \\"another continent of life remains to be discovered, not upon the Earth, but one to two hundred feet above it, extending over thousands of square miles.\\" True exploration of this habitat only began in the 1980s, when scientists developed methods to reach the canopy, such as firing ropes into the trees using crossbows. Exploration of the canopy is still in its infancy, but other methods include the use of balloons and airships to float above the highest branches and the building of cranes and walkways planted on the forest floor. The science of accessing tropical forest canopy using airships or similar aerial platforms is called dendronautics.[13]\\r\\nThe understory or understorey layer lies between the canopy and the forest floor. It is home to a number of birds, snakes and lizards, as well as predators such as jaguars, boa constrictors and leopards. The leaves are much larger at this level and insect life is abundant. Many seedlings that will grow to the canopy level are present in the understory. Only about 5% of the sunlight shining on the rainforest canopy reaches the understory. This layer can be called a shrub layer, although the shrub layer may also be considered a separate layer.\\r\\nThe forest floor, the bottom-most layer, receives only 2% of the sunlight. Only plants adapted to low light can grow in this region. Away from riverbanks, swamps and clearings, where dense undergrowth is found, the forest floor is relatively clear of vegetation because of the low sunlight penetration. It also contains decaying plant and animal matter, which disappears quickly, because the warm, humid conditions promote rapid decay. Many forms of fungi growing here help decay the animal and plant waste.\\r\\nMore than half of the world's species of plants and animals are found in the rainforest.[14] Rainforests support a very broad array of fauna, including mammals, reptiles, birds and invertebrates. Mammals may include primates, felids and other families. Reptiles include snakes, turtles, chameleons and other families; while birds include such families as vangidae and Cuculidae. Dozens of families of invertebrates are found in rainforests. Fungi are also very common in rainforest areas as they can feed on the decomposing remains of plants and animals. Many rainforest species are rapidly disappearing due to deforestation, habitat loss and pollution of the atmosphere.[15]\\r\\nDespite the growth of vegetation in a tropical rainforest, soil quality is often quite poor. Rapid bacterial decay prevents the accumulation of humus. The concentration of iron and aluminium oxides by the laterization process gives the oxisols a bright red colour and sometimes produces mineral deposits such as bauxite. Most trees have roots near the surface, because there are insufficient nutrients below the surface; most of the trees' minerals come from the top layer of decomposing leaves and animals. On younger substrates, especially of volcanic origin, tropical soils may be quite fertile. If rainforest trees are cleared, rain can accumulate on the exposed soil surfaces, creating run-off and beginning a process of soil erosion. Eventually streams and rivers form and flooding becomes possible.\\r\\nA natural rainforest emits and absorbs vast quantities of carbon dioxide. On a global scale, long-term fluxes are approximately in balance, so that an undisturbed rainforest would have a small net impact on atmospheric carbon dioxide levels,[16] though they may have other climatic effects (on cloud formation, for example, by recycling water vapour). No rainforest today can be considered to be undisturbed.[17] Human-induced deforestation plays a significant role in causing rainforests to release carbon dioxide,[18][19] as do other factors, whether human-induced or natural, which result in tree death, such as burning and drought.[20] Some climate models operating with interactive vegetation predict a large loss of Amazonian rainforest around 2050 due to drought, forest dieback and the subsequent release of more carbon dioxide.[21] Five million years from now, the Amazon rainforest may long since have dried and transformed itself into savannah, killing itself in the progress (changes such as this may happen even if all human deforestation activity ceases overnight).[22] The descendants of our known animals may adapt to the dry savannah of the former Amazonian rainforest and thrive in the new, warmer temperatures.[22]\\r\\nTropical rainforests provide timber as well as animal products such as meat and hides. Rainforests also have value as tourism destinations and for the ecosystem services provided. Many foods originally came from tropical forests, and are still mostly grown on plantations in regions that were formerly primary forest.[23] Also, plant-derived medicines are commonly used for fever, fungal infections, burns, gastrointestinal problems, pain, respiratory problems, and wound treatment.[24]\\r\\nOn January 18, 2007, FUNAI reported also that it had confirmed the presence of 67 different uncontacted tribes in Brazil, up from 40 in 2005. With this addition, Brazil has now overtaken the island of New Guinea as the country having the largest number of uncontacted tribes.[25] The province of Irian Jaya or West Papua in the island of New Guinea is home to an estimated 44 uncontacted tribal groups.[26] The tribes are in danger because of the deforestation, especially in Brazil.\\r\\nCentral African rainforest is home of the Mbuti pygmies, one of the hunter-gatherer peoples living in equatorial rainforests characterised by their short height (below one and a half metres, or 59?inches, on average). They were the subject of a study by Colin Turnbull, The Forest People, in 1962.[27] Pygmies who live in Southeast Asia are, amongst others, referred to as Negrito.\\r\\nTropical and temperate rainforests have been subjected to heavy logging and agricultural clearance throughout the 20th century and the area covered by rainforests around the world is shrinking.[28] Biologists have estimated that large numbers of species are being driven to extinction (possibly more than 50,000 a year; at that rate, says E. O. Wilson of Harvard University, a quarter or more of all species on Earth could be exterminated within 50 years)[29] due to the removal of habitat with destruction of the rainforests.\\r\\nAnother factor causing the loss of rainforest is expanding urban areas. Littoral rainforest growing along coastal areas of eastern Australia is now rare due to ribbon development to accommodate the demand for seachange lifestyles.[30]\\r\\nForests are being destroyed at a rapid pace.[31][32][33] Almost 90% of West Africa's rainforest has been destroyed.[34] Since the arrival of humans, Madagascar has lost two thirds of its original rainforest.[35] At present rates, tropical rainforests in Indonesia would be logged out in 10 years and Papua New Guinea in 13 to 16 years.[36] According to Rainforest Rescue, an important reason for the increasing deforestation rate, especially in Indonesia, is the expansion of oil palm plantations to meet growing demand for cheap vegetable fats and biofuels. In Indonesia, palm oil is already cultivated on nine million hectares and, together with Malaysia, the island nation produces about 85 percent of the worlds palm oil.[37][unreliable source?]\\r\\nSeveral countries,[38] notably Brazil, have declared their deforestation a national emergency.[39] Amazon deforestation jumped by 69% in 2008 compared to 2007's twelve months, according to official government data.[40] Deforestation could wipe out or severely damage nearly 60% of the Amazon Rainforest by 2030, says a 2007 report from WWF.[41]\\r\\nHowever, a January 30, 2009 New York Times article stated, \\"By one estimate, for every acre of rain forest cut down each year, more than 50 acres of new forest are growing in the tropics...\\" The new forest includes secondary forest on former farmland and so-called degraded forest.[42]","input":"What type of animals are in the tropical rain forest?"},{"output":"Paedophryne amauensis frogs","context":"The smallest organisms found on Earth can be determined according to various aspects of organism size; including volume, mass, height, length, or genome size.\\r\\nGiven the incomplete nature of scientific knowledge, it is possible that the smallest organism is undiscovered. Furthermore, there is some debate over the definition of life, and what entities qualify as organisms; consequently the smallest known organism (microorganism) is debatable.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nMany biologists consider viruses to be non-living because they lack a cellular structure and cannot metabolize by themselves, requiring a host cell to replicate and synthesize new products. A minority of scientists hold that, because viruses do have genetic material and can employ the metabolism of their host, they can be considered organisms. As well, an emerging idea that is gaining traction among some virologists is the concept of the virocell, in which the actual phenotype of a virus is the infected cell, and the virus particle is simply a reproductive or dispersal stage, much like pollen or a spore.[1]\\r\\nThe smallest viruses in terms of genome size are single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) viruses. Perhaps the most famous is the bacteriophage Phi-X174 with a genome size of 5386 nucleotides.[2] However, some ssDNA viruses can be even smaller. For example, Porcine circovirus type 1 has a genome of only 1759 nucleotides[3] and a capsid diameter of only 17?nm.[4] As a whole, the viral family geminiviridae is only about 30?nm in length. However, the two capsids making up the virus are fused; divided, the capsids would be 15?nm in length. Other environmentally characterized ssDNA viruses such as CRESS DNA viruses as well as others can have genomes that are considerably less that 2,000 nucleotides.[5][6]\\r\\nThe smallest RNA viruses in terms of genome size are small retroviruses such as rous sarcoma virus with genomes of 3.5 kilo base pairs (kb) and particle diameters of 80 nanometres (nm). The smallest double stranded DNA viruses are the hepadnaviruses such as Hepatitis B, at 3.2 kb and 42?nm; parvoviruses have smaller capsids, at 18-26?nm, but larger genomes, at 5 kb. It is important to consider other self replicating genetic elements, such as satelliviruses, viroids and ribozymes.\\r\\nThe genome of Nasuia deltocephalinicola, a symbiont of the European pest leafhopper, Macrosteles quadripunctulatus consists of a circular chromosome of 112,031 base pairs.[7]\\r\\nNanoarchaeum equitans's genome is 490,885 nucleotides long.\\r\\nPelagibacter ubique is one of the smallest known free-living bacterium with a length of 0.37-0.89 m and an average cell diameter of 0.12-0.20 m.

With a size of approximately 200 to 300 nm, M. genitalium is an ultramicrobacterium, smaller than other small bacteria, including rickettsia and chlamydia. However, the vast majority of bacterial strains have not been studied, and the marine ultramicrobacteria Sphingomonas sp strain RB2256 is reported to have passed through a 220?nm ultrafilter. A complicating factor is nutrient-downsized bacteria, bacteria that become much smaller due to a lack of available nutrients.[9]\\r\\nNanoarchaeum equitans is a species of tiny microbe 400 nm in diameter. It was discovered in 2002 in a hydrothermal vent off the coast of Iceland by Karl Stetter.

However, these survive only by sexual parasitism and the female individuals reach the significantly larger size of 50.5 millimetres (1.99?in).[25][26][27][28]\\r\\nThe average snout-to-vent length of several specimens of the salamander Thorius arboreus was only 17 millimetres (0.67?in).\\r\\nFrogs include the smallest vertebrates known. The smallest known frog species is Paedophryne amauensis, with a snout-vent length reported as 7.7?mm, which occurs among leaf-litter in the tropical montane forests of New Guinea. Other very small frogs include Brachycephalus didactylus from Brazil (reported as 9.6-9.8?mm), several species of Eleutherodactylus such as Eleutherodactylus iberia (around 10mm) from Cuba, Gardiner's Frog Sechellophryne gardineri from the Seychelles (up to 11?mm), several species of Stumpffia such as Stumpffia tridactyla and Stumpffia pygmaea from Madagascar, and the Rough Moss-frog Arthroleptella rugosa of South Africa (11.9 - 14.1?mm). In general these extremely small frogs occur in tropical forest and montane environments. There is relatively little data on size variation among individuals, growth from metamorphosis to adulthood or size variation among populations in these species. Additional studies and the discovery of further minute frog species are likely to change the rank order of this list.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe dwarf gecko (Sphaerodactylus ariasae) and the Virgin Islands dwarf sphaero (S. parthenopion), two geckos in the genus Sphaerodactylus, are the world's smallest known reptile species and smallest lizard, with a snout-vent length of 16 millimetres (0.63?in).[29] A few Brookesia chameleons from Madagascar are equally small, with a reported snout-vent length of 15ÿ18? millimetres for male dwarf chameleons (B. minima), 14ÿ19? millimetres for male Mount d'Ambre leaf chameleons (B. tuberculata)[30] and 15ÿ16? millimetres for male B. micra,[31] though females are larger. Of the aforementioned geckos, S. ariasae was first described in 2001 by the biologists Blair Hedges and Richard Thomas. This dwarf gecko is endangered and lives in Jaragua National Park in the Dominican Republic and on Beata Island (Isla Beata), off the southern coast of Hispaniola in the Dominican Republic.[32][33]\\r\\nThe world's smallest turtle is the speckled padloper tortoise (Homopus signatus) from South Africa. The males measure 6ÿ8?cm (2.4ÿ3.1?in), while females measure up to almost 10?cm (3.9?in).[34]\\r\\nThe smallest crocodilian is the Cuvier's dwarf caiman (Paleosuchus palpebrosus) from northern and central South America. It reaches up to 1.6?m (5.2?ft) in length.[35]\\r\\nOne of the smallest snakes known is the recently discovered Barbados threadsnake (Leptotyphlops carlae). Adults average about 10?cm (3.9?in) long, which is only about twice as long as the hatchlings.\\r\\nThe smallest known dinosaur (excluding modern birds) is Anchiornis, a genus of feathered dinosaur that lived in what is now China during the Late Jurassic Period 160 to 155 million years ago. Adult specimens range from 34?cm (13?in) long, and the weight has been estimated at up to 110?g (3.9?oz).[36] Nevertheless, sizes of dinosaurs are commonly labelled with a level of uncertainty, as the available material often (or even usually) is incomplete.\\r\\nWith a mass of approximately 1.8 grams (0.063?oz) and a length of 5 centimetres (2.0?in), the bee hummingbird (Mellisuga helenae) is the world's smallest bird species and the smallest warm-blooded vertebrate. Called the zunz~n in its native habitat on Cuba, it is lighter than a Canadian or U.S. penny. It is said that it is \\"more apt to be mistaken for a bee than a bird\\".[37] The bee hummingbird eats half its total body mass and drinks eight times its total body mass each day. Its nest is 3?cm across.\\r\\nThe vulnerable Kitti's hog-nosed bat (Craseonycteris thonglongyai), also known as the bumblebee bat, from Thailand and Myanmar[38] is the smallest mammal, at 3ÿ4 centimetres (1.2ÿ1.6?in) in length and 1.5ÿ2 grams (0.053ÿ0.071?oz) in weight.\\r\\nThe Etruscan shrew (Suncus etruscus), is the smallest mammal by mass, weighing only about 1.8 grams (0.063?oz) on average. The bumblebee bat has a smaller skull size. The smallest mammal that ever lived, the shrew-like Batodonoides vanhouteni, weighed only 1.3 grams (0.046?oz).\\r\\nThe smallest member of the rodent order is the Baluchistan pygmy jerboa, with an average body length of only 4.4?cm (1.7?in).[39]\\r\\nThe smallest member of the order Carnivora is the least weasel (Mustela nivalis), with an average body length of 114ÿ260?mm (4.5-10.2?in). It weighs between 29.5 ÿ 250 grams with females being lighter.\\r\\nThe smallest marsupial is the Long-tailed planigale from Australia. It has a body length of 110ÿ130 millimetres (4.3ÿ5.1?in) (including tail) and weigh 4.3 grams (0.15?oz) on average.\\r\\nThe Pilbara ningaui is considered to be of similar size and weight.[39]\\r\\nThe smallest member of the primate order is Madame Berthe's mouse lemur (Microcebus berthae), found in Madagascar,[40] with an average body length of 92?mm (3.6?in).\\r\\nThe smallest cetacean, which is also (as of 2006) the most endangered, is the vaquita. Male vaquitas grow to an average of around 135?cm (53?in); the females are slightly longer, averaging about 141?cm (55?in) in length.\\r\\nDuckweeds of the genus Wolffia are the world's smallest flowering plants.[41] Fully grown, they measure only 300 m by 600?m and reach a mass of just 150 g.\\r\\nNanobes are thought by some scientists to be the smallest known organisms[42] about one tenth the size of the smallest known bacteria.

It is an adaptation of the 1964 novel Charlie and the Chocolate Factory by Roald Dahl. Dahl was credited with writing the film's screenplay; however, David Seltzer, who went uncredited in the film, was brought in to re-work Dahl's screenplay against his wishes, making major changes to the ending and adding musical numbers. These changes and other decisions made by the director led Dahl to disown the film.[4][5]\\r\\nThe film tells the story of Charlie Bucket (Peter Ostrum) as he receives a Golden Ticket and visits Willy Wonka's chocolate factory with four other children from around the world. Filming took place in Munich in 1970, and the film was released by Paramount Pictures on June 30, 1971. With a budget of just $3 million, the film received generally positive reviews and earned $4 million by the end of its original run. Paramount distributed the film until 1977, and beginning in the 1980s, Warner Bros. assumed control of the rights for home entertainment purposes. The film then made an additional $21 million during its re-release by Warner Bros. under its Family Entertainment banner in 1996. The film became highly popular in part through repeated television airings and home entertainment sales.[6] In 1972, the film received an Academy Award nomination for Best Original Score, and Wilder was nominated for a Golden Globe as Best Actor in a Musical or Comedy, but lost both to Fiddler on the Roof. The film also introduced the song \\"The Candy Man\\", which went on to become a popular hit when recorded by Sammy Davis Jr. In 2014, the film was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as being \\"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\\".\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nIn an unnamed town, children visit a candy shop. Charlie Bucket, a poor paperboy, stares through the window as the shop owner sings \\"The Candy Man\\". Walking home, he passes Willy Wonka's chocolate factory. A mysterious tinker recites the first lines of William Allingham's poem \\"The Fairies\\", and tells Charlie, \\"Nobody ever goes in, and nobody ever comes out.\\" Charlie rushes home to his widowed mother and bedridden grandparents. After telling Grandpa Joe about the tinker, Joe reveals that Wonka locked the factory because other candy makers, including rival Arthur Slugworth, sent in spies to steal his recipes. Wonka disappeared, but for three years resumed selling candy; the origin of Wonka's labor force is unknown.\\r\\nThe next day, Wonka announces that he hid five \\"Golden Tickets\\" in chocolate Wonka Bars. Finders of the tickets will receive a factory tour and a lifetime supply of chocolate. Four of the tickets are found by Augustus Gloop, a gluttonous boy; Veruca Salt, a spoiled girl; Violet Beauregarde, a gum-chewing girl; and Mike Teavee, a television-obsessed boy. As each winner's announced on TV, a man whispers to them. Charlie opens two Wonka Bars but finds no Golden Ticket and loses hope. The newspapers announce the fifth ticket was found by a millionaire in Paraguay. Charlie finds money in a gutter and uses it to buy a Scrumdiddlyumptious bar. With the change, he buys a Wonka Bar for Joe. Walking home, as Charlie hears newspapers[vague] revealing that the Paraguayan millionaire's ticket is a forgery, he opens the Wonka Bar and finds the fifth golden ticket. While rushing home, he is confronted by the same man seen whispering to the other winners, who introduces himself as Slugworth and offers a reward for a sample of Wonka's latest creation, the Everlasting Gobstopper.\\r\\nCharlie returns home with the Golden Ticket and chooses Grandpa Joe as his chaperone and they sing \\"I've Got A Golden Ticket\\". The next day, Wonka greets the ticket winners and leads them inside where each signs a contract before the tour. The factory includes a river of chocolate, edible mushrooms, lickable wallpaper, and other sweets and inventions. As the visitors sample these, Wonka sings \\"Pure Imagination\\". The visitors see Wonka's workers, small men known as Oompa-Loompas, who sing their song whenever a ticket holder falls into a trap. Augustus falls into the chocolate river and is sucked up a pipe to the Fudge Room. In the Inventing Room, everyone receives an Everlasting Gobstopper. Violet becomes a large blueberry after chewing an experimental gum containing a three-course meal, despite Wonka's warnings. The group reaches the Fizzy Lifting Drinks Room, where Charlie and Grandpa Joe ignore Wonka's warning and sample the drinks. They float and have a near-fatal encounter with an exhaust fan before burping back to the ground. In the Chocolate Eggs Room, Veruca demands a golden goose for herself before falling into a garbage chute leading to the furnace, with her father falling in trying to rescue her. The group tests out Wonka's Wonkavision, only to have Mike teleport himself and become only a few inches tall.\\r\\nOnly Charlie and Grandpa Joe remain, but Wonka dismisses them without the promised chocolate. When Grandpa Joe asks him why, Wonka angrily explains that they violated the contract by stealing Fizzy Lifting Drinks and will receive nothing. An angered Grandpa Joe suggests to Charlie that he should give Slugworth the Gobstopper in revenge, but Charlie returns the candy back to Wonka. With this selfless act, Wonka declares Charlie as the winner. He reveals that Slugworth is actually \\"Mr. Wilkinson\\", an employee of his, and the offer to buy the Gobstopper was a morality test which only Charlie passed. The trio enter the \\"Wonkavator\\", a multi-directional glass elevator that flies out of the factory. Soaring over the city, Wonka reveals that his actual prize is the factory; Wonka created the contest to find a worthy heir enough, and so Charlie and his family can immediately move in. Wonka then reminds Charlie not to forget about the man who suddenly received everything he ever wanted. Charlie asks, \\"What ever happened to him?\\" to which Wonka replies, \\"He lived happily ever after.\\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe idea for adapting the book into a film came about when director Mel Stuart's ten-year-old daughter read the book and asked her father to make a film out of it, with \\"Uncle Dave\\" (producer David L. Wolper) producing it. Stuart showed the book to Wolper, who happened to be in the midst of talks with the Quaker Oats Company regarding a vehicle to introduce a new candy bar from its Chicago-based Breaker Confections subsidiary (since renamed the Willy Wonka Candy Company and sold to Nestl). Wolper persuaded the company, which had no previous experience in the film industry, to buy the rights to the book and finance the picture for the purpose of promoting a new Quaker Oats Wonka Bar.[7]\\r\\nIt was agreed that the film would be a children's musical, and that Dahl himself would write the screenplay.[7] However, the title was changed to Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory.\\r\\nScreenwriter David Seltzer conceived a gimmick exclusively for the film that had Wonka quoting numerous literary sources, such as Arthur O'Shaughnessy's Ode, Oscar Wilde's The Importance of Being Earnest, Samuel Taylor Coleridge's The Rime of the Ancient Mariner and William Shakespeare's The Merchant of Venice. Seltzer also worked Slugworth (only mentioned as a rival candy maker in the book) into the plot as an actual character (only to be revealed to be Wilkinson, one of Wonka's agents, at the end of the film).[7]\\r\\nAll six members of Monty Python: Graham Chapman, John Cleese, Eric Idle, Terry Gilliam, Terry Jones and Michael Palin, expressed interest in playing Wonka, but at the time they were deemed not big enough names for an international audience. Three of the members, Cleese, Idle and Palin, were later seriously considered for the same role in Tim Burton's version.[8][9]\\r\\nBefore Wilder was officially cast for the role, producers considered Fred Astaire, Joel Grey, Ron Moody and Jon Pertwee.[9][10] Spike Milligan was Roald Dahl's original choice to play Willy Wonka.[9] Peter Sellers even begged Dahl for the role.[11]\\r\\nWhen Wilder was cast for the role, he accepted it on one condition:\\r\\nWhen I make my first entrance, I'd like to come out of the door carrying a cane and then walk toward the crowd with a limp. After the crowd sees Willy Wonka is a cripple, they all whisper to themselves and then become deathly quiet. As I walk toward them, my cane sinks into one of the cobblestones I'm walking on and stands straight up, by itself; but I keep on walking, until I realize that I no longer have my cane. I start to fall forward, and just before I hit the ground, I do a beautiful forward somersault and bounce back up, to great applause.\\r\\nThe reason why Wilder wanted this in the film was that \\"from that time on, no one will know if I'm lying or telling the truth.\\"[12]\\r\\nJean Stapleton turned down the role of Mrs. Teevee.[13][14] Jim Backus was considered for the role of Sam Beauregarde.[15] Sammy Davis, Jr. wanted to play Bill, the candy store owner, but Stuart did not like the idea because he felt that the presence of a big star in the candy store scene would break the reality.[8] Nevertheless, Davis' recording of the film's opening musical number, \\"The Candy Man,\\" would top the Billboard magazine record charts in 1972, despite the fact that Davis initially hated the song. Anthony Newley also wanted to play Bill, but Stuart also objected to this for the same reason.[15]\\r\\nPrincipal photography commenced on April 30, 1970, and ended on November 19, 1970. The primary shooting location was Munich, Bavaria, West Germany, because it was significantly cheaper than filming in the United States and the setting was conducive to Wonka's factory; Stuart also liked the ambiguity and unfamiliarity of the location. External shots of the factory were filmed at the gasworks of Stadtwerke Mnchen (Emmy-Noether-Stra?e 10); the entrance and side buildings still exist. The exterior of Charlie Bucket's house, which was only a set constructed for the film, was filmed at Quellenstra?e in Munich, Bavaria. Charlie's school was filmed at Katholisches Pfarramt St. Sylvester, Biedersteiner Stra?e 1 in Munich. Bill's Candy Shop was filmed at Lilienstra?e, Munich. The closing sequence when the Wonkavator is flying above the factory is footage of N?rdlingen in Bavaria.\\r\\nMunich Gasworks as it appears today (building on the left)\\r\\nMunich Gasworks as it appears today\\r\\nN?rdlingen, the town seen from above at the end of the film\\r\\nProduction designer Harper Goff centered the factory on the massive Chocolate Room. According to Paris Themmen, who played Mike Teevee, \\"The river was made of water with food coloring. At one point, they poured some cocoa powder into it to try to thicken it but it didn't really work. When asked this question, Michael B?llner, who played Augustus Gloop, answers, 'It vas dirty, stinking vater.'\\"[16]\\r\\nWhen interviewed for the 30th anniversary special edition, Gene Wilder stated that he enjoyed working with most of the child actors, but said that he and the crew had some problems with Paris Themmen, claiming that he was \\"a handful\\".[17]\\r\\nBefore its release, the film received advance publicity though TV commercials offering a \\"Willy Wonka candy factory kit\\" for sending $1.00 and two seals from boxes of Quaker cereals such as King Vitaman, Life and any of the Cap'n Crunch brands.[18]\\r\\nWilly Wonka was released on June 30, 1971. The film was not a big success, being the fifty-third highest-grossing film of the year in the U.S., earning just over $2.1 million on its opening weekend,[19] although it received positive reviews from critics such as Roger Ebert, who compared it to The Wizard of Oz.[20]\\r\\nBy the mid-1980s, Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory had experienced a spike in popularity thanks in large part to repeated television broadcasts and home video sales. Following a 25th anniversary theatrical re-release in 1996, it was released on DVD the next year, allowing it to reach a new generation of viewers. The film was released as a remastered special edition on DVD and VHS in 2001 to commemorate the film's 30th anniversary. In 2003, Entertainment Weekly ranked it 25th in the \\"Top 50 Cult Movies\\" of all time.\\r\\nAs of 2017[update], the film holds a 90% \\"Fresh\\" rating on Rotten Tomatoes with an average rating of 7.7/10 based on 42 reviews. The site's critical consensus states: \\"Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory is strange yet comforting, full of narrative detours that don't always work but express the film's uniqueness\\".[21]\\r\\nWilly Wonka was ranked No. 74 on Bravo's 100 Scariest Movie Moments[22] for the \\"scary tunnel\\" scene.\\r\\nDahl disowned the film, the script of which was partially rewritten by David Seltzer after Dahl failed to meet deadlines. Dahl said he was \\"disappointed\\" because \\"he thought it placed too much emphasis on Willy Wonka and not enough on Charlie\\", as well as the casting of Gene Wilder instead of Spike Milligan.[23] Dahl was also \\"infuriated\\" by the deviations in the plot Seltzer devised in his draft of the screenplay, including the conversion of Slugworth, a minor character in the book, into a spy (so that the movie could have a villain) and the \\"fizzy lifting drinks\\" scene along with music other than the original Oompa Loompa compositions (including \\"Pure Imagination\\" and \\"The Candy Man\\"), and the ending dialogue for the movie.[24] In 1996, Dahl's second wife Felicity commented on her husband's objections towards the film saying \\"they always want to change a book's storyline. What makes Hollywood think children want the endings changed for a film, when they accept it in a book?\\"[23]\\r\\nThe film made its television debut on November 23, 1975 on NBC. There was some controversy with the showing as the Oakland Raiders vs Washington Redskins (26-23) Football game went into overtime, and the first 40 minutes of the movie were cut.[25] The film placed 19th in the TV Ratings for the week ending Nov 23, beating out The Streets of San Francisco and Little House on the Prairie.[26] The next TV showing of the film was on May 2, 1976,[27] where it placed 46th in the ratings.[28] Some TV listings indicate the showing was part of the World of Disney time slot.\\r\\nIn 2017, an adaptation of the film with Tom and Jerry was released. Tom and Jerry: Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory stars JP Karliak as Willy Wonka and is dedicated to Gene Wilder, who died under a year before the release.\\r\\nThe film was first released on DVD in 1997/1999 in a \\"25th anniversary edition\\"[29] as a double sided disc containing a widescreen and \\"standard\\" version. The \\"standard\\" version is an open matte print, where the mattes used to make the image widescreen are removed, revealing information originally intended to be hidden from viewers.[30] VHS copies were also available, but only containing the \\"standard\\" version.\\r\\nA special edition DVD was released, celebrating the film's 30th anniversary, on August 28, 2001, but in fullscreen only. Due to the lack of a letterboxed release, fan petitioning eventually led Warner Home Video to issue a widescreen version on November 13, 2001. It was also released on VHS, with only one of the special features (a making-of feature). Several original cast members reunited to film documentary footage for this special edition DVD release. The two editions featured restored sound, and better picture quality. In addition to the documentary, the DVD included a trailer, a gallery, and audio commentary by the cast.\\r\\nIn 2007, Warner Home Video released the film on HD DVD with all the bonus features from the 2001 DVD.[31] The film was released on Blu-ray on October 20, 2009.[32] It includes all the bonus features from the 2001 DVD and 2007 HD-DVD as well as a 38-page book.\\r\\nIn 2011, a new deluxe-40th-anniversary edition Blu-ray/DVD set was released on November 1, consisting of the film on Blu-ray Disc and DVD as well as a bonus features disc. The set also included a variety of rarities such as a Wonka Bar-designed tin, four scented pencils, a scented eraser, a book detailing the making of the film, original production papers and a Golden Ticket to win a trip to Los Angeles. The set is now out of print.[33]\\r\\nThe Academy Award-nominated original score and songs were composed by Leslie Bricusse and Anthony Newley, and musical direction was by Walter Scharf. The soundtrack was first released by Paramount Records in 1971.

It provides the legal foundation for the existence of the republic, sets out the rights and duties of its citizens, and defines the structure of the government. The current constitution, the country's fifth, was drawn up by the Parliament elected in 1994 in the first non-racial elections. It was promulgated by President Nelson Mandela on 18th December 1996 and came into effect on 4 February 1997, replacing the Interim Constitution of 1993.[1]\\r\\nSince 1996, the Constitution has been amended by seventeen amendment acts. The Constitution is formally entitled the \\"Constitution of the Republic of South Africa, 1996.\\" It was previously also numbered as if it were an Act of ParliamentAct No. 108 of 1996but, since the passage of the Citation of Constitutional Laws Act,[2] neither it nor the acts amending it are allocated act numbers.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nAn integral part of the negotiations to end apartheid in South Africa was the creation of a new, non-discriminatory constitution (Tswana, Sotho, Northern Sotho: molaotheo; Afrikaans: grondwet; Zulu, Southern Ndebele: umthethosisekelo; Xhosa: umgaqo-siseko; Swazi: umtsetfosisekelo; Venda: ndayotewa; Tsonga: vumbiwa) for the country. One of the major disputed issues was the process by which such a constitution would be adopted. The African National Congress (ANC) insisted that it should be drawn up by a democratically elected constituent assembly, while the governing National Party (NP) feared that the rights of minorities would not be protected in such a process, and proposed instead that the constitution be negotiated by consensus between the parties and then put to a referendum.[3][4]\\r\\nFormal negotiations began in December 1991 at the Convention for a Democratic South Africa (CODESA). The parties agreed on a process whereby a negotiated transitional constitution would provide for an elected constitutional assembly to draw up a permanent constitution.[3] The CODESA negotiations broke down, however, after the second plenary session in May 1992. One of the major points of dispute was the size of the supermajority that would be required for the assembly to adopt the constitution: The NP wanted a 75 per cent requirement,[4] which would effectively have given it a veto.[3]\\r\\nIn April 1993, the parties returned to negotiations, in what was known as the Multi-Party Negotiating Process (MPNP). A committee of the MPNP proposed the development of a collection of \\"constitutional principles\\" with which the final constitution would have to comply, so that basic freedoms would be ensured and minority rights protected, without overly limiting the role of the elected constitutional assembly.[4] The parties to the MPNP adopted this idea and proceeded to draft the Interim Constitution of 1993, which was formally enacted by Parliament and came into force on 27 April 1994.\\r\\nThe Interim Constitution provided for a Parliament made up of two houses: a 400-member National Assembly, directly elected by party-list proportional representation, and a ninety-member senate, in which each of the nine provinces was represented by ten senators, elected by the provincial legislature. The Constitutional Assembly consisted of both houses sitting together, and was responsible for drawing up a final constitution within two years. The adoption of a new constitutional text required a two-thirds supermajority in the Constitutional Assembly, as well as the support of two-thirds of senators on matters relating to provincial government. If a two-thirds majority could not be obtained, a constitutional text could be adopted by a simple majority and then put to a national referendum in which sixty per cent support would be required for it to pass.\\r\\nThe Interim Constitution contained 34 constitutional principles with which the new constitution was required to comply. These included multi-party democracy with regular elections and universal adult suffrage, supremacy of the constitution over all other law, a quasi-federal system in place of centralised government, non-racism and non-sexism, the protection of \\"all universally accepted fundamental rights, freedoms and civil liberties,\\" equality before the law, the separation of powers with an impartial judiciary, provincial and local levels of government with democratic representation, and protection of the diversity of languages and cultures. The Bill of Rights, now in Chapter Two of the Constitution of South Africa, was largely written by Kader Asmal and Albie Sachs. The new constitutional text was to be tested against these principles by the newly established Constitutional Court. If the text complied with the principles, it would become the new constitution; if it did not, it would be referred back to the Constitutional Assembly.\\r\\nThe Constitutional Assembly engaged in a massive public participation programme to solicit views and suggestions from the public. As the deadline for the adoption of a constitutional text approached, however, many issues were hashed out in private meetings between the parties' representatives.[3] On 8 May 1996, a new text was adopted with the support of 86 per cent of the members of the assembly,[4] but in the First Certification judgment, delivered on 6 September 1996, the Constitutional Court refused to certify this text. The Constitutional Court identified a number of provisions that did not comply with the constitutional principles. Areas of non-compliance included failures to protect the right of employees to engage in collective bargaining; to provide for the constitutional review of ordinary statutes; to entrench fundamental rights, freedoms and civil liberties and to sufficiently safeguard the independence of the Public Protector and Auditor-General as well as other areas of non-compliance in relation to local government responsibilities and powers.[5]\\r\\nThe Constitutional Assembly reconvened and, on 11 October, adopted an amended constitutional text containing many changes relative to the previous text. Some dealt with the court's reasons for non-certification, while others tightened up the text. The amended text was returned to the Constitutional Court to be certified, which the court duly did in its Second Certification judgment, delivered on 4 December.[6] The Constitution was signed by President Mandela on 10 December and officially published in the Government Gazette on 18 December. It did not come into force immediately; it was brought into operation on 4 February 1997, by a presidential proclamation, except for some financial provisions which were delayed until 1 January 1998.\\r\\nSince its adoption, the Constitution has been amended seventeen times; these amendments are described in a separate section below.\\r\\nThe constitution consists of a preamble, fourteen chapters containing 244 sections,[7] and eight schedules. Each chapter deals with a particular topic; the schedules contain ancillary information referred to in the main text.\\r\\nChapter 1 enshrines in the constitution key national principles, defines the country's flag and national anthem, and specifies the official languages and principles of government language policy. It defines South Africa as \\"one, sovereign, democratic state\\" based on principles of human rights, constitutional supremacy, the rule of law and universal adult suffrage. The chapter contains a supremacy clause which establishes that all other law and actions are subject to the constitution.\\r\\nChapter 2 is a bill of rights which enumerates the civil, political, economic, social and cultural human rights of the people of South Africa. Most of these rights apply to anyone in the country, with the exception of the right to vote, the right to work and the right to enter the country, which apply only to citizens. They also apply to juristic persons to the extent that they are applicable, taking into account the nature of the right. The rights enumerated are:\\r\\nSection 36 allows the rights listed to be limited only by laws of general application, and only to the extent that the restriction is reasonable and justifiable in \\"an open and democratic society based on human dignity, equality and freedom.\\"[10]\\r\\nSection 37 allows certain rights to be limited during a state of emergency but places strict procedural limits on the declaration of states of emergency and provides for the rights of people detained as a result.\\r\\nChapter 3 deals with the relationships between organs of government in the three \\"spheres\\"?ÿ national, provincial and local. It lays down a set of principles requiring them to co-operate in good faith and to act in the best interests of the people. It also requires them to attempt to settle disputes amicably before resorting to the courts.\\r\\nChapter 4 defines the structure of Parliament, the legislative branch of the national government. Parliament consists of two houses, the National Assembly (the lower house), which is directly elected by the people, and the National Council of Provinces (the upper house), which is elected by the provincial legislatures.\\r\\nThe Chapter defines the principles governing the election and dissolution of the houses, qualifications for membership of Parliament, quorum requirements, procedures for the election of presiding officers, and the powers and privileges and immunities of Parliament and its members. It lays down the process for enacting bills into law; different procedures are provided for constitutional amendments, ordinary bills not affecting provincial matters, ordinary bills affecting provincial matters, and money bills.\\r\\nChapter 5 defines the structure of the national executive and the powers of the President. It provides for the election and removal of the President by the National Assembly, and limits a President to two five-year terms. It vests in him or her the powers of the head of state and head of government; it provides for the appointment of a Cabinet by the President; and it provides for the accountability to Parliament of the President and Cabinet.\\r\\nChapter 6 establishes the nine provinces of South Africa and defines the powers and structure of the provincial governments. The boundaries of the provinces are defined by reference to Schedule 1A to the Constitution, which refers in turn to the boundaries of the metropolitan and district municipalities.\\r\\nIn some respects, the chapter is a template which a province may modify to a limited extent by adopting its own provincial constitution. (The only province so far to have done this is the Western Cape.) The chapter provides for a unicameral legislature, a Premier elected by the legislature as head of the provincial executive, and an Executive Council appointed by the Premier as a provincial cabinet.\\r\\nThe provincial government is given exclusive powers over certain matters, listed in Schedule 5, and powers concurrent with the national government over other matters, listed in Schedule 4. The chapter regulates the conflict between national and provincial legislation on the same topic, setting out the circumstances under which one or the other will prevail.\\r\\nChapter 7 sets out a framework for local government. It requires municipalities to be established for the whole territory of South Africa, and provides for three categories of municipalities, whereby some areas are governed by a single \\"Category A\\" municipal authority and others are governed by a two-level system with a larger \\"Category C\\" municipality containing multiple \\"Category B\\" municipalities. The municipalities are granted the power to administer certain matters listed in Schedules 4 and 5, and the executive and legislative authority is vested in the municipal council. The chapter requires municipal elections to be held every five years.\\r\\nChapter 8 establishes the structure of the judicial system. It defines the hierarchy consisting of Magistrates' Courts, the High Court, the Supreme Court of Appeal, and the Constitutional Court. It provides for the appointment of judges by the President on the advice of the Judicial Service Commission and establishes a single National Prosecuting Authority responsible for all criminal prosecutions.\\r\\nChapter 9 creates a number of other commissions and offices to protect and support democracy and human rights. These are the Public Protector (an ombudsman), the South African Human Rights Commission, the Commission for the Promotion and Protection of the Rights of Cultural, Religious and Linguistic Communities, the Commission for Gender Equality, the Auditor-General, the Independent Electoral Commission and the Independent Communications Authority.\\r\\nChapter 10 lists values and principles for the administration of the civil service and establishes the Public Service Commission to oversee it.\\r\\nChapter 11 establishes structures for civilian control of the Defence Force, the Police Service and the intelligence services. It makes the President the Commander-in-Chief of the defence force but places conditions on when and how it may be employed and requires regular reports to Parliament. The police service is placed under the control of the national government but gives provincial governments some power to administer and oversee policing.\\r\\nChapter 12 recognises the status and authority of traditional leaders and customary law, subject to the Constitution. It allows for the creation of provincial houses of traditional leaders and a national council of traditional leaders.\\r\\nChapter 13 deals with public finance. It establishes a National Revenue Fund, from which money may be appropriated only by an act of Parliament, and Provincial Revenue Funds, from which money may only be appropriated by an act of the provincial legislature. It provides for an equitable distribution of national revenue to the provinces and municipalities, and grants provincial and local governments the powers to raise certain rates and taxes. It requires effective and transparent budgeting at all levels of government and gives the National Treasury the power to oversee budgetary processes. It places some restrictions on government procurement and government borrowing. The chapter establishes the Financial and Fiscal Commission, to advise government on financial matters, and the Reserve Bank, to oversee the currency.\\r\\nThe final chapter deals with transitional and incidental provisions. In particular, the first part deals with international law, providing that existing agreements binding South Africa will continue to bind it, and that new agreements (except those of a technical nature) will only be binding once approved by Parliament. It also provides that customary international law applies in South African unless it conflicts with national law, and that the courts must, where possible, interpret national law to be consistent with international law.\\r\\nThe remainder of the chapter contains a miscellaneous collection of provisions,\\r\\nChapter 14 also repeals the Interim Constitution and refers to Schedule 6 to govern the process of transition to the new constitution. Finally, it gives the Constitution its formal title, \\"Constitution of the Republic of South Africa, 1996,\\" and defines the schedule for its commencement, under which the President set the date of commencement for most sections, although certain sections dealing with financial matters commenced only on 1 January 1998.\\r\\nSection 74 of the Constitution provides that a bill to amend the Constitution can only be passed if at least two-thirds of the members of the National Assembly (that is, at least 267 of the 400 members) vote in favour of it. If the amendment affects provincial powers or boundaries, or if it amends the Bill of Rights, at least six of the nine provinces in the National Council of Provinces must also vote for it. To amend section 1 of the Constitution, which establishes the existence of South Africa as a sovereign, democratic state, and lays out the country's founding values, would require the support of three-quarters of the members of the National Assembly. There have been seventeen amendments since 1996.\\r\\nEffectively repealed by the 12th Amendment.\\r\\nEffectively repealed by the 14th and 15th Amendments.\\r\\nThe Loss or Retention of Membership of National and Provincial Legislatures Act, 2002, which would have allowed floor-crossing in the National Assembly and provincial legislatures, was declared unconstitutional by the Constitutional Court.\\r\\nEffectively repealed by the 14th and 15th Amendments.\\r\\nEffectively repealed by the 14th and 15th Amendments.\\r\\nThe community of Matatiele, which had been transferred from KwaZulu-Natal to the Eastern Cape, challenged the amendment before the Constitutional Court, which ruled that the KwaZulu-Natal Legislature had not allowed for the necessary public participation before approving the amendment. The court's order was suspended for eighteen months and Parliament re-enacted the changes in the 13th Amendment.\\r\\nThe South Africa Act 1909, an act of the Parliament of the United Kingdom, unified four British colonies?ÿ Cape Colony, Transvaal Colony, Orange River Colony and Natal Colony?ÿ into the Union of South Africa, a self-governing Dominion.\\r\\nThe Republic of South Africa Constitution Act, 1961 transformed the Union into a Republic, replacing the Queen with a State President, but otherwise leaving the system of government unchanged.\\r\\nThe Republic of South Africa Constitution Act, 1983 created the Tricameral Parliament, with separate houses representing white, coloured and Indian people but without representation for black people. The figurehead State President and executive Prime Minister were replaced by an executive State President.\\r\\nThe Constitution of the Republic of South Africa, 1993 or Interim Constitution was introduced at the end of apartheid to govern the period of transition. It introduced universal adult suffrage, constitutional supremacy and a bill of rights.","input":"When was the constitution of south africa completed?"}]`),I={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:C},data(){return{visibleCount:20,poemsData:M}},computed:{visiblePoems(){return this.poemsData.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{loadMore(){this.visibleCount+=20}}},B={class:"card-container"};function x(h,t,n,c,u,i){const m=p("PoemCard");return a(),o(l,null,[t[1]||(t[1]=e("section",null,[e("div",{class:"top-Banner"},[e("div",{class:"top-Banner-Title"},[e("div",{class:"top-Banner-Title-Text"},"🎉Q&A Life🥳")])])],-1)),e("section",null,[e("div",B,[(a(!0),o(l,null,g(i.visiblePoems,(r,f)=>(a(),y(m,{key:f,poem:r},null,8,["poem"]))),128))]),i.hasMorePoems?(a(),o("button",{key:0,class:"load-more-button",onClick:t[0]||(t[0]=(...r)=>i.loadMore&&i.loadMore(...r))},"See more")):w("",!0)])],64)}const P=d(I,[["render",x]]),H=JSON.parse('{"title":"","description":"","frontmatter":{"page":true},"headers":[],"relativePath":"qapage/46.md","filePath":"qapage/46.md"}'),F={name:"qapage/46.md"},N=Object.assign(F,{setup(h){return(t,n)=>(a(),o("div",null,[b(P)]))}});export{H as __pageData,N as default};
