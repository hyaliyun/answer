When factor analysis ( a statistical technique ) is applied to personality survey data , some words used to describe aspects of personality are often applied to the same person .

This theory is based therefore on the association between words but not on neuropsychological experiments . This theory uses descriptors of common language and therefore suggests five broad dimensions commonly used to describe the human personality and psyche . The five factors have been defined as openness to experience , conscientiousness , extraversion , agreeableness , and neuroticism , often represented by the acronyms OCEAN or CANOE .

Radio telescopes are the main observing instrument used in radio astronomy , which studies the radio frequency portion of the electromagnetic spectrum emitted by astronomical objects , just as optical telescopes are the main observing instrument used in traditional optical astronomy which studies the light wave portion of the spectrum coming from astronomical objects . Radio telescopes are typically large parabolic ( \`\` dish '' ) antennas similar to those employed in tracking and communicating with satellites and space probes . They may be used singly or linked together electronically in an array . Unlike optical telescopes , radio telescopes can be used in the daytime as well as at night . Since astronomical radio sources such as planets , stars , nebulas and galaxies are very far away , the radio waves coming from them are extremely weak , so radio telescopes require very large antennas to collect enough radio energy to study them , and extremely sensitive receiving equipment . Radio observatories are preferentially located far from major centers of population to avoid electromagnetic interference ( EMI ) from radio , television , radar , motor vehicles , and other manmade electronic devices ."},{"query":"who gave the slogan swaraj is my birth","short_answer":"Joseph \`\` Kaka '' Baptista","abstract":""},{"query":"who won the gubernatorial race in new york","short_answer":"","abstract":""},{"query":"when was the last perfect game thrown in baseball","short_answer":"August 15 , 2012","abstract":"Over the 140 years of Major League Baseball history , and over 210,000 games played , there have been 23 official perfect games by the current definition .

It explains the behavior of matter and its interactions with energy on the scale of atoms and subatomic particles . By contrast , classical physics only explains matter and energy on a scale familiar to human experience , including the behavior of astronomical bodies such as the Moon . Classical physics is still used in much of modern science and technology . However , towards the end of the 19th century , scientists discovered phenomena in both the large ( macro ) and the small ( micro ) worlds that classical physics could not explain . The desire to resolve inconsistencies between observed phenomena and classical theory led to two major revolutions in physics that created a shift in the original scientific paradigm : the theory of relativity and the development of quantum mechanics . This article describes how physicists discovered the limitations of classical physics and developed the main concepts of the quantum theory that replaced it in the early decades of the 20th century . It describes these concepts in roughly the order in which they were first discovered .

In nature complementarity is the base principle of DNA replication and transcription as it is a property shared between two DNA or RNA sequences , such that when they are aligned antiparallel to each other , the nucleotide bases at each position in the sequences will be complementary , much like looking in the mirror and seeing the reverse of things . This complementary base pairing allows cells to copy information from one generation to another and even find and repair damage to the information stored in the sequences . The degree of complementarity between two nucleic acid strands may vary , from complete complementarity ( each nucleotide is across from its opposite ) to no complementarity ( each nucleotide is not across from its opposite ) and determines the stability of the sequences to be together . Furthermore , various DNA repair functions as well as regulatory functions are based on base pair complementarity . In biotechnology , the principle of base pair complementarity allows the generation of DNA hybrids between RNA and DNA , and opens the door to modern tools such as cDNA libraries . While most complementarity is seen between two separate strings of DNA or RNA , it is also possible for a sequence to have internal complementarity resulting in the sequence binding to itself in a folded configuration ."},{"query":"what are the tributaries of the river brahmaputra","short_answer":"","abstract":"The Brahmaputra ( / ˌbrɑːməˈpuːtrə / is one of the major rivers of Asia , a trans - boundary river which flows through China , India and Bangladesh .

The PNS consists of the nerves and ganglia outside the brain and spinal cord .

Unlike the CNS , the PNS is not protected by the vertebral column and skull , or by the blood -- brain barrier , which leaves it exposed to toxins and mechanical injuries . The peripheral nervous system is divided into the somatic nervous system and the autonomic nervous system . In the somatic nervous system , the cranial nerves are part of the PNS with the exception of the optic nerve ( cranial nerve II ) , along with the retina . The second cranial nerve is not a true peripheral nerve but a tract of the diencephalon . Cranial nerve ganglia originated in the CNS . However , the remaining ten cranial nerve axons extend beyond the brain and are therefore considered part of the PNS . The autonomic nervous system is an involuntary control of smooth muscle and glands .

The empire was developed as the Roman Republic invaded and occupied most of Europe and portions of northern Africa and western Asia . Under the republic , regions of the empire were ruled by provincial governors answerable to and authorised by the \`\` Senate and People of Rome '' . Rome and its senate were ruled by a variety of magistrates -- of whom the consuls were the most powerful . The republic ended , and the emperors were created , when these magistrates became legally and practically subservient to one citizen with power over all other magistrates . Augustus , the first emperor , was careful to maintain the façade of republican rule , taking no specific title for his position and calling the concentration of magisterial power princeps senatus ( the first man of the senate ) . This style of government that lasted for 300 years is thus called the Principate . The modern word ' emperor ' derives from the title imperator , which was granted by an army to a successful general ; during the initial phase of the empire , it still had to be earned by the princeps . The term emperor is a modern construction , used when describing rulers of the Roman Empire because it emphasises the strong links between the ruler and the army ( on whose support the ruler 's power depended ) , and does not discriminate between the personal styles of rule and titles in different phases of the Empire ."},{"query":"who is not a member of the grand ole opry","short_answer":"","abstract":"The Grand Ole Opry is a weekly country music concert show in Nashville , Tennessee which began as a radio barn dance on November 28 , 1925 by George D.

A thermoconforming organism , by contrast , simply adopts the surrounding temperature as its own body temperature , thus avoiding the need for internal thermoregulation . The internal thermoregulation process is one aspect of homeostasis : a state of dynamic stability in an organism 's internal conditions , maintained far from thermal equilibrium with its environment ( the study of such processes in zoology has been called physiological ecology ) . If the body is unable to maintain a normal temperature and it increases significantly above normal , a condition known as hyperthermia occurs . For humans , this occurs when the body is exposed to constant temperatures of approximately 55 ° C ( 131 ° F ) , and with prolonged exposure ( longer than a few hours ) at this temperature and up to around 75 ° C ( 167 ° F ) death is almost inevitable . Humans may also experience lethal hyperthermia when the wet bulb temperature is sustained above 35 ° C ( 95 ° F ) for six hours . The opposite condition , when body temperature decreases below normal levels , is known as hypothermia . It results when the homeostatic control mechanisms of heat within the body malfunction , causing the body to lose heat faster than producing it . Normal body temperature is around 37 ° C ( 99 ° F ) , and hypothermia sets in when the core body temperature gets lower than 35 ° C ( 95 ° F ) . Usually caused by prolonged exposure to cold temperatures , hypothermia is usually treated by methods that attempt to raise the body temperature back to a normal range ."},{"query":"who plays grant ward on agents of shield","short_answer":"Brett Patrick Dalton","abstract":"Brett Patrick Dalton ( born January 7 , 1983 ) is an American actor .

In the case of electrons , the quantum numbers can be defined as \`\` the sets of numerical values which give acceptable solutions to the Schrödinger wave equation for the hydrogen atom '' .

This distinguishes quantum mechanics from classical mechanics where the values that characterize the system such as mass , charge , or momentum , range continuously . Quantum numbers often describe specifically the energy levels of electrons in atoms , but other possibilities include angular momentum , spin , etc . An important family is flavour quantum numbers -- internal quantum numbers which determine the type of a particle and its interactions with other particles through the forces .

Gradually , other territories , colonies , and provinces that were part of British North America would be added to Canada . The Royal Proclamation of 1763 enlarged the colony of Canada under the name of the Province of Quebec , which with the Constitutional Act 1791 became known as The Canadas . With the Act of Union 1840 Upper and Lower Canada were joined to become the United Province of Canada . Later , with Confederation in 1867 , the British maritime colonies of New Brunswick and Nova Scotia were joined with the British colony of Canada to form the Dominion of Canada , which was subsequently divided into four provinces , Ontario , Quebec , New Brunswick , and Nova Scotia . A number of other British colonies , such as Newfoundland and British Columbia , and large territories such as Rupert 's Land initially remained outside of the newly formed federation . Over time , the remaining colonies and territories within British North America came under the control of Canada until the current geographic extent of the country was reached when Newfoundland and Labrador joined Canada in 1949 . Although confederation in 1867 led to an enlarged Dominion with increased autonomy over domestic affairs , Canada still remained a colony within the British Empire and was thus subordinate to the British Parliament until the enactment of the Statute of Westminster in 1931 . This statute recognized Canada as an independent peer coequal with the United Kingdom , and thus provided the Parliament of Canada with legislative sovereignty over all federal matters except the power to change the constitutional laws of Canada which remained under the purview of the Parliament of the United Kingdom . Canada 's final vestige of legal dependence on the United Kingdom was terminated in 1982 with the enactment of the Canada Act , subsequently providing Canada with full legal sovereignty completely independent of the United Kingdom ."},{"query":"who owns the means of production in the usa","short_answer":"","abstract":"In economics and sociology , the means of production ( also called capital goods ) are physical and non-financial inputs used in the production of economic value .

Later attempts to respell some words in accordance with their Latin etymologies further increased the number of silent letters ( e.g. , temps vs. older tens -- compare English \`\` tense '' , which reflects the original spelling -- and vingt vs. older vint ) . Nevertheless , there are rules governing French orthography which allow for a reasonable degree of accuracy when pronouncing French words from their written forms .

It is based on common language descriptors .

For example , someone described as conscientious is more likely to be described as \`\` always prepared '' rather than \`\` messy '' . This theory is based therefore on the association between words but not on neuropsychological experiments .

The term may be misleading , as it implies that the animal has no choice but to breathe through its nose ; however , it is commonly used to describe cases where effective breathing through the mouth is possible but not preferred . Alternatively , the term has been defined by some as the ability to breathe through the nose while swallowing . While this ability is a common trait of obligate nasal breathers , clearly this definition does not require that nasal breathing in any way be obligatory to the animal . Even in obligate nasal breathers such as horses , rabbits , and rodents , there is a potentially patent path for air to travel from the mouth to the lungs which can be used for endotracheal intubation . It has been suggested that obligate nasal breathing is an adaptation especially useful in prey species , as it allows an animal to feed while preserving their ability to detect predators by scent ."},{"query":"when did the first season of fuller house come out","short_answer":"February 26 , 2016","abstract":"Fuller House is an American sitcom created by Jeff Franklin that airs as a Netflix original series , and is a sequel to the 1987 -- 1995 television series Full House .
