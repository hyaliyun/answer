One of the most well - known and heavily studied hotspots in the world , the Hawaii plume is responsible for the creation of the Hawaiian -- Emperor seamount chain , a chain of volcanoes over 5,800 kilometres ( 3,600 mi ) long . Four of these volcanoes are active , two are dormant , and more than 123 are extinct , many having since been ground beneath the waves by erosion as seamounts and atolls . The chain extends from south of the island of Hawai ʻi to the edge of the Aleutian Trench , near the eastern edge of Russia . While most volcanoes are created by geological activity at tectonic plate boundaries , the Hawaii hotspot is located far from plate boundaries . The classic hotspot theory , first proposed in 1963 by John Tuzo Wilson , proposes that a single , fixed mantle plume builds volcanoes that then , cut off from their source by the movement of the Pacific Plate , become increasingly inactive and eventually erode below sea level over millions of years . According to this theory , the nearly 60 ° bend where the Emperor and Hawaiian segments of the chain meet was caused by a sudden shift in the movement of the Pacific Plate . In 2003 , fresh investigations of this irregularity led to the proposal of a mobile hotspot theory , suggesting that hotspots are mobile , not fixed , and that the 47 - million - year - old bend was caused by a shift in the hotspot 's motion rather than the plate 's ."},{"query":"or accusatorial system of law is used in the usa and in the uk","short_answer":"","abstract":"The adversarial system or adversary system is a legal system used in the common law countries where two advocates represent their parties ' case or position before an impartial person or group of people , usually a jury or judge , who attempt to determine the truth and pass judgment accordingly .

Many student athletes are compensated with scholarships to attend these institutions but these scholarships are not mandatory to be considered a student athlete . In the United States , athletic scholarships are largely regulated by either the National Association of Intercollegiate Athletics ( NAIA ) or the National Collegiate Athletic Association ( NCAA ) , which sets minimum standards for both the individuals awarded the scholarships ( in terms of GPAs and standardized test scores ) and for the institutions granting them ( in terms of the form and value of the scholarships and the proportion of recipients who must ultimately earn degrees ) . Also students that are very talented may get scholarships for playing a particular sport . The term student - athlete was coined in 1964 by Walter Byers , the first - ever executive director of the NCAA , to counter attempts to require universities to pay workers ' compensation ."},{"query":"who wrote song i can't make you love me","short_answer":"Mike Reid and Allen Shamblin","abstract":"\`\` I Ca n't Make You Love Me '' is a song written by Mike Reid and Allen Shamblin and recorded by American singer Bonnie Raitt for her eleventh studio album Luck of the Draw ( 1991 ) .

Across species , different sexes are often characterized by different types and numbers of sex chromosomes . In order to account for varying numbers of sex chromosomes , different organisms have acquired unique methods to equalize gene expression amongst the sexes . Because sex chromosomes contain different numbers of genes , different species of organisms have developed different mechanisms to cope with this inequality . Replicating the actual gene is impossible ; thus organisms instead equalize the expression from each gene . For example , in humans , females ( XX ) silence the transcription of one X chromosome of each pair , and transcribe all information from the other , expressed X chromosome . Thus , human females have the same number of expressed X-linked genes as do human males ( XY ) , both sexes having essentially one X chromosome per cell , from which to transcribe and express genes ."},{"query":"who sang hey there you with the sad face come up to my place","short_answer":"","abstract":"\`\` Live It Up '' is a single by Australian rock band Mental As Anything , first released in 1985 in Australia and then in Europe and the U.S. in 1986 / 87 .

They were primarily used to demoralize , injure , and kill entrenched defenders , against whom the indiscriminate and generally very slow - moving or static nature of gas clouds would be most effective . The types of weapons employed ranged from disabling chemicals , such as tear gas , to lethal agents like phosgene , chlorine , and mustard gas . This chemical warfare was a major component of the first global war and first total war of the 20th century . The killing capacity of gas was limited , with only about ninety thousand fatalities from a total of some 1.3 million casualties caused by gas attacks . Gas was unlike most other weapons of the period because it was possible to develop effective countermeasures , such as gas masks . In the later stages of the war , as the use of gas increased , its overall effectiveness diminished . The widespread use of these agents of chemical warfare , and wartime advances in the composition of high explosives , gave rise to an occasionally expressed view of World War I as \`\` the chemist 's war '' and also the era where \`\` weapons of mass destruction '' were created ."},{"query":"isabella's last name from phineas and ferb","short_answer":"Garcia - Shapiro","abstract":"The following is a character list of main and secondary characters on the Disney Channel series Phineas and Ferb ."},{"query":"how to pick a girl in a dungeon","short_answer":"","abstract":"Is It Wrong to Try to Pick Up Girls in a Dungeon ?

Unlike a direct free kick , a goal may not be scored directly from the kick ; the ball must first come into contact with another player ( from either team ) . If the ball goes into the goal without touching any other player , a goal kick is awarded . The law was derived from the Sheffield Rules that stated that no goal could be scored from a free kick . This law was absorbed into the Laws of the Game in 1877 and later adapted to allow indirect free kicks as a result of dangerous play . An indirect free kick is awarded to the opposing team when a player infringes certain technical requirements of the laws ( e.g. touching the ball a second time following a restart , or the keeper touching the ball with his hands when a teammate has used his foot to pass it back to the keeper ) . An indirect free kick is also awarded to the opposing team when play is stopped to caution or send - off a player when no specific foul has occurred ( e.g. when play is stopped to caution a player for dissenting the decision of the referee ) .

If one adds up all the forms of energy that were released in the explosion , such as the kinetic energy of the pieces , as well as heat and sound , one will get the exact decrease of chemical energy in the combustion of the dynamite . Classically , conservation of energy was distinct from conservation of mass ; however , special relativity showed that mass could be converted to energy and vice versa by E = mc , and science now takes the view that mass -- energy is conserved ."},{"query":"a carbohydrate composed of three to ten sugar molecules is called a(n)","short_answer":"monosaccharides","abstract":"Polysaccharides are polymeric carbohydrate molecules composed of long chains of monosaccharide units bound together by glycosidic linkages and on hydrolysis give the constituent monosaccharides or oligosaccharides .

The Ancien Régime was ruled by the late Valois and Bourbon dynasties . The term is occasionally used to refer to the similar feudal systems of the time elsewhere in Europe . The administrative and social structures of the Ancien Régime were the result of years of state - building , legislative acts ( like the Ordinance of Villers - Cotterêts ) , internal conflicts , and civil wars , but they remained and the Valois Dynasty 's attempts at re-establishing control over the scattered political centres of the country were hindered by the Huguenot Wars ( or Wars of Religion ) . Much of the reigns of Henry IV and Louis XIII and the early years of Louis XIV were focused on administrative centralization .

Earlier in its life , the object is a protostar that grows by acquiring mass from its surrounding envelope of interstellar dust and gas . After the protostar blows away this envelope , it is optically visible , and appears on the stellar birthline in the Hertzsprung - Russell diagram . At this point , the star has acquired nearly all of its mass but has not yet started hydrogen burning ( i.e. nuclear fusion of hydrogen ) . The star then contracts , its internal temperature rising until it begins hydrogen burning on the zero age main sequence . This period of contraction is the pre-main sequence stage . An observed PMS object can either be a T Tauri star , if it has fewer than 2 solar masses ( M ) , or else a Herbig Ae / Be star , if it has 2 to 8 M . Yet more massive stars have no pre-main - sequence stage because they contract too quickly as protostars .

The adjective thermohaline derives from thermo - referring to temperature and - haline referring to salt content , factors which together determine the density of sea water . Wind - driven surface currents ( such as the Gulf Stream ) travel polewards from the equatorial Atlantic Ocean , cooling en route , and eventually sinking at high latitudes ( forming North Atlantic Deep Water ) . This dense water then flows into the ocean basins . While the bulk of it upwells in the Southern Ocean , the oldest waters ( with a transit time of around 1000 years ) upwell in the North Pacific . Extensive mixing therefore takes place between the ocean basins , reducing differences between them and making the Earth 's oceans a global system .

In nature complementarity is the base principle of DNA replication and transcription as it is a property shared between two DNA or RNA sequences , such that when they are aligned antiparallel to each other , the nucleotide bases at each position in the sequences will be complementary , much like looking in the mirror and seeing the reverse of things . This complementary base pairing allows cells to copy information from one generation to another and even find and repair damage to the information stored in the sequences . The degree of complementarity between two nucleic acid strands may vary , from complete complementarity ( each nucleotide is across from its opposite ) to no complementarity ( each nucleotide is not across from its opposite ) and determines the stability of the sequences to be together . Furthermore , various DNA repair functions as well as regulatory functions are based on base pair complementarity . In biotechnology , the principle of base pair complementarity allows the generation of DNA hybrids between RNA and DNA , and opens the door to modern tools such as cDNA libraries . While most complementarity is seen between two separate strings of DNA or RNA , it is also possible for a sequence to have internal complementarity resulting in the sequence binding to itself in a folded configuration ."},{"query":"who plays smurf's lawyer in animal kingdom","short_answer":"Laura San Giacomo","abstract":"Animal Kingdom is an American drama television series developed by Jonathan Lisco .

The debate was over whether , and if so , how , slaves would be counted when determining a state 's total population for legislative representation and taxing purposes . The issue was important , as this population number would then be used to determine the number of seats that the state would have in the United States House of Representatives for the next ten years . The effect was to give the southern states a third more seats in Congress and a third more electoral votes than if slaves had been ignored , but fewer than if slaves and free persons had been counted equally , allowing the slaveholder interests to largely dominate the government of the United States until 1861 . The compromise was proposed by delegates James Wilson and Roger Sherman ."},{"query":"what kind of plants are most like algae","short_answer":"","abstract":"Algae ( / ˈældʒi , ˈælɡi / ; singular alga / ˈælɡə / ) is an informal term for a large , diverse group of photosynthetic organisms which are not necessarily closely related , and is thus polyphyletic .

A player will hit the ball with a racquet so it will fall into the diagonally opposite service box without being stopped by the net .

The ball can only touch the net on a return and will be considered good if it falls on the opposite side . If the ball contacts the net on the serve but then proceeds to the proper service box , it is called a let ; this is not a legal serve in the major tours ( but see below ) although it is also not a fault .

Kant conceives his investigation as a work of foundational ethics -- one that clears the ground for future research by explaining the core concepts and principles of moral theory and showing that they are normative for rational agents . Kant aspires to nothing less than this : to lay bare the fundamental principle of morality and show that it applies to us . In the text , Kant provides a groundbreaking argument that the rightness of an action is determined by the character of the principle that a person chooses to act upon . Kant thus stands in stark contrast to the moral sense theories and teleological moral theories that dominated moral philosophy at the time he was writing . Central to the work is the role of what Kant refers to as the categorical imperative , the concept that one must act only according to that precept which he or she would will to become a universal law ."},{"query":"who was voted off first on total drama island","short_answer":"","abstract":"Teletoon"},{"query":"the lipid-based structure that surrounds some viruses is known as","short_answer":"","abstract":"The cell membrane ( also known as the plasma membrane or cytoplasmic membrane , and historically referred to as the plasmalemma ) is a biological membrane that separates the interior of all cells from the outside environment ( the extracellular space ) .

It is often quantified in terms of quality - adjusted life years ( QALYs ) or disability - adjusted life years ( DALYs ) , both of which quantify the number of years lost due to disease ( YLDs ) . One DALY can be thought of as one year of healthy life lost , and the overall disease burden can be thought of as a measure of the gap between current health status and the ideal health status ( where the individual lives to old age free from disease and disability ) . According to an article published in The Lancet in June 2015 low back pain and major depressive disorder were among the top ten causes of YLDs and were the cause of more health loss than diabetes , chronic obstructive pulmonary disease , and asthma combined . The study based on data from 188 countries , considered to be the largest and most detailed analysis to quantify levels , patterns , and trends in ill health and disability , concluded that \`\` the proportion of disability - adjusted life years due to YLDs increased globally from 21.1 % in 1990 to 31.2 % in 2013 . '' The environmental burden of disease is defined as the number of DALYs that can be attributed to environmental factors . These measures allow for comparison of disease burdens , and have also been used to forecast the possible impacts of health interventions . By 2014 DALYs per head were \`\` 40 % higher in low - income and middle - income regions .

Historians have traditionally divided the war into three phases . In the first phase , the Archidamian War , Sparta launched repeated invasions of Attica , while Athens took advantage of its naval supremacy to raid the coast of the Peloponnese and attempt to suppress signs of unrest in its empire . This period of the war was concluded in 421 BC , with the signing of the Peace of Nicias . That treaty , however , was soon undermined by renewed fighting in the Peloponnese . In 415 BC , Athens dispatched a massive expeditionary force to attack Syracuse in Sicily ; the attack failed disastrously , with the destruction of the entire force , in 413 BC . This ushered in the final phase of the war , generally referred to either as the Decelean War , or the Ionian War . In this phase , Sparta , now receiving support from Persia , supported rebellions in Athens ' subject states in the Aegean Sea and Ionia , undermining Athens ' empire , and , eventually , depriving the city of naval supremacy . The destruction of Athens ' fleet at Aegospotami effectively ended the war , and Athens surrendered in the following year .

Coal mining continues as an important economic activity today . Compared to wood fuels , coal yields a higher amount of energy per mass and can often be obtained in areas where wood is not readily available . Though it was used historically as a domestic fuel , coal is now used mostly in industry , especially in smelting and alloy production as well as electricity generation . Large - scale coal mining developed during the Industrial Revolution , and coal provided the main source of primary energy for industry and transportation in industrial areas from the 18th century to the 1950s . Coal remains an important energy source because of its low cost and abundance compared to other fuels , particularly for electricity generation . Coal is also mined today on a large scale by open pit methods wherever the coal strata strike the surface or are relatively shallow . Britain developed the main techniques of underground coal mining from the late 18th century onward , with further progress being driven by 19th century and early 20th century progress .

The Roman era saw both areas , except Scotland and Northern Ireland , conquered by Rome , whose fortifications exist in both countries to this day , and whose writing system introduced a common alphabet to both areas ; however , the language barrier remained . The Norman conquest of England in 1066 decisively shaped English history , as well as the English language . In the medieval period , the countries were often bitter enemies , with both nations ' monarchs claiming control over France . The Hundred Years ' War stretched from 1337 to 1453 resulting in French victory . Britain and France fought a series of five major wars , culminating in the Coalition victory over Napoleon in 1815 . After that there were some tensions , but peace generally prevailed and as the 19th century progressed , the relationship became better . Closer ties between the two began with the 1904 Entente cordiale , particularly via the alliances in World War I and World War II , wherein both countries fought against Germany , and in the latter conflict British armies helped to liberate occupied France from the Nazis . Both nations opposed the Soviet Union during the Cold War and were founding members of NATO . In recent years the two countries have experienced a quite close relationship , especially on defence and foreign policy issues ; the two countries tend , however , to disagree on a range of other matters , most notably the European Union .

However , polyploidy is found in some organisms and is especially common in plants . In addition , polyploidy occurs in some tissues of animals that are otherwise diploid , such as human muscle tissues . This is known as endopolyploidy .
