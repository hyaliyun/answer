For well - authored components , COM allows reuse of objects with no knowledge of their internal implementation , as it forces component implementers to provide well - defined interfaces that are separated from the implementation . The different allocation semantics of languages are accommodated by making objects responsible for their own creation and destruction through reference - counting .

The drought came in three waves , 1934 , 1936 , and 1939 -- 1940 , but some regions of the high plains experienced drought conditions for as many as eight years . With insufficient understanding of the ecology of the plains , farmers had conducted extensive deep plowing of the virgin topsoil of the Great Plains during the previous decade ; this had displaced the native , deep - rooted grasses that normally trapped soil and moisture even during periods of drought and high winds . The rapid mechanization of farm equipment , especially small gasoline tractors , and widespread use of the combine harvester contributed to farmers ' decisions to convert arid grassland ( much of which received no more than 10 inches ( 250 mm ) of precipitation per year ) to cultivated cropland ."},{"query":"when does the femoral artery become the popliteal artery","short_answer":"","abstract":"The popliteal artery is a deeply placed continuation of the femoral artery after it passes through the adductor hiatus , or opening in the distal portion of the adductor magnus muscle .

It is produced by a stream or river swinging from side to side as it flows across its floodplain or shifts its channel within a valley . A meander is produced by a stream or river as it erodes the sediments comprising an outer , concave bank ( cut bank ) and deposits this and other sediment downstream on an inner , convex bank which is typically a point bar . The result of sediments being eroded from the outside concave bank and their deposition on an inside convex bank is the formation of a sinuous course as a channel migrates back and forth across the down - valley axis of a floodplain . The zone within which a meandering stream shifts its channel across either its floodplain or valley floor from time to time is known as a meander belt . It typically ranges from 15 to 18 times the width of the channel . Over time , meanders migrate downstream , sometimes in such a short time as to create civil engineering problems for local municipalities attempting to maintain stable roads and bridges ."},{"query":"when did sa host the african cup of nations","short_answer":"","abstract":"The Total Africa Cup of Nations , officially CAN ( French : Coupe d'Afrique des Nations ) , also referred to as African Cup of Nations , or AFCON , is the main international association football competition in Africa .

This increase in membrane potential is what causes the cell membrane , which typically maintains a resting membrane potential of - 70 mV , to reach the threshold potential and consequently fire the next action potential ; thus , the pacemaker potential is what drives the self - generated rhythmic firing ( automaticity ) of pacemaker cells , and the rate of change ( i.e. , the slope ) of the pacemaker potential is what determines the timing of the next action potential and thus the intrinsic firing rate of the cell . In a healthy sinoatrial node ( SAN , a complex tissue within the right atrium containing pacemaker cells that normally determine the intrinsic firing rate for the entire heart ) , the pacemaker potential is the main determinant of the heart rate . Because the pacemaker potential represents the non-contracting time between heart beats ( diastole ) , it is also called the diastolic depolarization . The amount of net inward current required to move the cell membrane potential during the pacemaker phase is extremely small , in the order of few pAs , but this net flux arises from time to time changing contribution of several currents that flow with different voltage and time dependence . Evidence in support of the active presence of K , Ca , Na channels and Na / K exchanger during the pacemaker phase have been variously reported in the literature , but several indications point to the \`\` funny '' ( I ) current as one of the most important. ( see funny current ) . There is now substantial evidence that also sarcoplasmic reticulum ( SR ) Ca - transients participate to the generation of the diastolic depolarization via a process involving the Na -- Ca exchanger ."},{"query":"the role of the malaysia nature society in the conservation of nature","short_answer":"","abstract":"Malaysian Nature Society ( MNS ; Persatuan Pencinta Alam Malaysia in Malay ) is the oldest and one of the most prominent environmental not for profit , non-governmental organisations in Malaysia .

The theory of general relativity predicts that a sufficiently compact mass can deform spacetime to form a black hole .

Although the event horizon has an enormous effect on the fate and circumstances of an object crossing it , no locally detectable features appear to be observed . In many ways a black hole acts like an ideal black body , as it reflects no light . Moreover , quantum field theory in curved spacetime predicts that event horizons emit Hawking radiation , with the same spectrum as a black body of a temperature inversely proportional to its mass .

The ability of an organism or organ to respond to external stimuli is called sensitivity . When a stimulus is applied to a sensory receptor , it normally elicits or influences a reflex via stimulus transduction . These sensory receptors can receive information from outside the body , as in touch receptors found in the skin or light receptors in the eye , as well as from inside the body , as in chemoreceptors and mechanoreceptors . An internal stimulus is often the first component of a homeostatic control system . External stimuli are capable of producing systemic responses throughout the body , as in the fight - or - flight response . In order for a stimulus to be detected with high probability , its level must exceed the absolute threshold ; if a signal does reach threshold , the information is transmitted to the central nervous system ( CNS ) , where it is integrated and a decision on how to react is made . Although stimuli commonly cause the body to respond , it is the CNS that finally determines whether a signal causes a reaction or not ."},{"query":"when does the new mamma mia movie come out","short_answer":"","abstract":"Mamma Mia !

While persons with certain unconfessed mortal sins that were under some form of censure still at their death might not be allowed a Catholic Funeral Mass and burial rites , and while Catholics with unconfessed mortal sins may not receive Communion ( unless in some circumstances , ameliorating factors were present ) , these matters , though related , are not the same as whether an individual with unconfessed serious sins is condemned to Hell ."},{"query":"part of throat between the mouth and the oesophagus","short_answer":"epiglottis","abstract":"In vertebrate anatomy , the throat is the front part of the neck , positioned in front of the vertebra .
