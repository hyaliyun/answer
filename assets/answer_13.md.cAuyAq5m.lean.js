For example , beta decay of a neutron transforms it into a proton by the emission of an electron , or conversely a proton is converted into a neutron by the emission of a positron ( positron emission ) , thus changing the nuclide type . Neither the beta particle nor its associated neutrino exist within the nucleus prior to beta decay , but are created in the decay process . By this process , unstable atoms obtain a more stable ratio of protons to neutrons . The probability of a nuclide decaying due to beta and other forms of decay is determined by its nuclear binding energy . The binding energies of all existing nuclides form what is called the nuclear band or valley of stability .

Trusts were a creation of the English law of property and obligations , but also share a history with countries across the Commonwealth and the United States . Trusts developed when claimants in property disputes were dissatisfied with the common law courts and petitioned the King for a just and equitable result . On the King 's behalf , the Lord Chancellor developed a parallel justice system in the Court of Chancery . Historically , trusts were mostly used where people left money in a will , created family settlements , created charities , or some types of business venture . After the Judicature Act 1873 , England 's courts of equity and common law were merged , and equitable principles took precedence . Today , trusts play an important role in financial investments , especially in unit trusts and pension trusts , where trustees and fund managers usually invest assets for people who wish to save for retirement . Although people are generally free to write trusts in any way they like , an increasing number of statutes are designed to protect beneficiaries , or regulate the trust relationship , including the Trustee Act 1925 , Trustee Investments Act 1961 , Recognition of Trusts Act 1987 , Financial Services and Markets Act 2000 , Trustee Act 2000 , Pensions Act 1995 , Pensions Act 2004 and the Charities Act 2011 ."},{"query":"here we go around the mulberry bush meaning","short_answer":"","abstract":"\`\` Here We Go Round the Mulberry Bush '' ( also titled \`\` Mulberry Bush '' or \`\` This is the Way '' ) is an English language nursery rhyme and singing game .

Here is one reason that speech segmentation is challenging : When you read , there are spaces between the words . No such spaces occur between spoken words . So , if an infant hears the sound sequence \`\` thisisacup , '' it has to learn to segment this stream into the distinct units \`\` this '' , \`\` is '' , \`\` a '' , and \`\` cup . '' Once the child is able to extract the sequence \`\` cup '' from the speech stream it has to assign a meaning to this word .

Devance explains the decision in terms of the emphasis on masculinity in wartime , Marie Antoinette 's bad reputation for feminine interference in state affairs , and traditional male supremacy . A decade later the Napoleonic Code confirmed and perpetuated women 's second - class status ."},{"query":"where did the largest settlement of mound builders exist","short_answer":"","abstract":"The various cultures collectively termed Mound Builders were inhabitants of North America who , during a 5,000 - year period , constructed various styles of earthen mounds for religious and ceremonial , burial , and elite residential purposes .

Most impeachments have concerned alleged crimes committed while in office , though there have been a few cases in which Congress has impeached and convicted officials partly for prior crimes . The actual trial on such charges , and subsequent removal of an official upon conviction , is separate from the act of impeachment itself . Impeachment proceedings have been initiated against several presidents of the United States . Andrew Johnson and Bill Clinton are the only two presidents to have been successfully impeached by the House of Representatives , and both were later acquitted by the Senate . The impeachment process against Richard Nixon was never completed , as Nixon resigned his office before the vote of the full House for impeachment , but such a vote was widely expected to pass , and the threat of it and a subsequent conviction in the Senate was the impetus for Nixon 's departure . To date , no president has been removed from office by impeachment and conviction .

The types of weapons employed ranged from disabling chemicals , such as tear gas , to lethal agents like phosgene , chlorine , and mustard gas .

Seafloor spreading helps explain continental drift in the theory of plate tectonics . When oceanic plates diverge , tensional stress causes fractures to occur in the lithosphere. The motivating force for seafloor spreading ridges is tectonic plate pull rather than magma pressure , although there is typically significant magma activity at spreading ridges . At a spreading center basaltic magma rises up the fractures and cools on the ocean floor to form new seabed . Hydrothermal vents are common at spreading centers . Older rocks will be found farther away from the spreading zone while younger rocks will be found nearer to the spreading zone . Additionally spreading rates determine if the ridge is a fast , intermediate , or slow . As a general rule , fast ridges see spreading rate of more than 9 cm / year . Intermediate ridges have a spreading rate of 4 -- 9 cm / year while slow spreading ridges have a rate less than 4 cm / year ."},{"query":"how many promotion points is a bronze star worth air force","short_answer":"5","abstract":"The Weighted Airman Promotion System ( WAPS ) is a United States Air Force program that determines promotions to the ranks of Staff Sergeant ( E-5 ) through Master Sergeant ( E-7 ) .

Prominent Loyalists repeatedly assured the British government that many thousands of them would spring to arms and fight for the crown .

Patriots watched suspected Loyalists very closely and would not tolerate any organized Loyalist opposition . Many outspoken or militarily active Loyalists were forced to flee , especially to their stronghold of New York City .

These programs included support for farmers , the unemployed , youth and the elderly as well as new constraints and safeguards on the banking industry and changes to the monetary system . Most programs were enacted between 1933 -- 1938 , though some were later . They included both laws passed by Congress as well as presidential executive orders , most during the first term of the presidency of Franklin D. Roosevelt . The programs focused on what historians refer to as the \`\` 3 Rs '' : relief for the unemployed and poor , recovery of the economy back to normal levels and reform of the financial system to prevent a repeat depression . The New Deal produced a political realignment , making the Democratic Party the majority ( as well as the party that held the White House for seven out of the nine presidential terms from 1933 -- 1969 ) with its base in liberal ideas , the South , traditional Democrats , big city machines and the newly empowered labor unions and ethnic minorities . The Republicans were split , with conservatives opposing the entire New Deal as an alleged enemy of business and growth and liberals accepting some of it and promising to make it more efficient . The realignment crystallized into the New Deal coalition that dominated most presidential elections into the 1960s while the opposing conservative coalition largely controlled Congress from 1939 -- 1964 ."},{"query":"what is the common ingredient of lead and lead-free solder","short_answer":"","abstract":"Solder ( / ˈsoʊldər / , / ˈsɒldər / or in North America / ˈsɒdər / ) is a fusible metal alloy used to create a permanent bond between metal workpieces .

Also called Darwinian theory , it originally included the broad concepts of transmutation of species or of evolution which gained general scientific acceptance after Darwin published On the Origin of Species in 1859 , including concepts which predated Darwin 's theories . It subsequently referred to the specific concepts of natural selection , the Weismann barrier , or the central dogma of molecular biology . Though the term usually refers strictly to biological evolution , creationists have appropriated it to refer to the origin of life , and it has even been applied to concepts of cosmic evolution , both of which have no connection to Darwin 's work .
