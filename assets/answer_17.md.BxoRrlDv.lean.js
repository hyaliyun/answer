Secondary messengers are therefore one of the initiating components of intracellular signal transduction cascades . Examples of second messenger molecules include cyclic AMP , cyclic GMP , inositol trisphosphate , diacylglycerol , and calcium . The cell releases second messenger molecules in response to exposure to extracellular signaling molecules -- the first messengers . First messengers are extracellular factors , often hormones or neurotransmitters , such as epinephrine , growth hormone , and serotonin . Because peptide hormones and neurotransmitters typically are biochemically hydrophilic molecules , these first messengers may not physically cross the phospholipid bilayer to initiate changes within the cell directly -- unlike steroid hormones , which usually do . This functional limitation necessitates the cell to devise signal transduction mechanisms to transduce first messenger into second messengers , so that the extracellular signal may be propagated intracellularly . An important feature of the second messenger signaling system is that second messengers may be coupled downstream to multi-cyclic kinase cascades to greatly amplify the strength of the original first messenger signal . For example , RasGTP signals link with the Mitogen Activated Protein Kinase ( MAPK ) cascade to amplify the allosteric activation of proliferative transcription factors such as Myc and CREB ."},{"query":"where did they film bad day at black rock","short_answer":"in Lone Pine , California and the nearby Alabama Hills","abstract":"Bad Day at Black Rock is a 1955 Eastman Color in CinemaScope thriller directed by John Sturges and starring Spencer Tracy and Robert Ryan that combines elements of the western with that of film noir .

Unlike a direct free kick , a goal may not be scored directly from the kick ; the ball must first come into contact with another player ( from either team ) .

This law was absorbed into the Laws of the Game in 1877 and later adapted to allow indirect free kicks as a result of dangerous play . An indirect free kick is awarded to the opposing team when a player infringes certain technical requirements of the laws ( e.g. touching the ball a second time following a restart , or the keeper touching the ball with his hands when a teammate has used his foot to pass it back to the keeper ) . An indirect free kick is also awarded to the opposing team when play is stopped to caution or send - off a player when no specific foul has occurred ( e.g. when play is stopped to caution a player for dissenting the decision of the referee ) .

It is a type of high - intensity discharge ( HID ) gas discharge lamp . Developed in the 1960s , they are similar to mercury vapor lamps , but contain additional metal halide compounds in the quartz arc tube , which improve the efficiency and color rendition of the light . The most common metal halide compound used is sodium iodide . Once the arc tube reaches its running temperature , the sodium dissociates from the iodine , adding orange and reds to the lamp 's spectrum from the sodium D line as the metal ionizes . As a result , metal - halide lamps have high luminous efficacy of around 75 -- 100 lumens per watt , which is about twice that of mercury vapor lights and 3 to 5 times that of incandescent lights and produce an intense white light . Lamp life is 6,000 to 15,000 hours . As one of the most efficient sources of high CRI white light , metal halides as of 2005 were the fastest growing segment of the lighting industry .

One example of this is the gradual change in head size relative to body size during human growth . During prenatal growth , from conception to 5 months , the head grows more than the body . In humans , the head comprises almost 50 % of total body length at approximately the third month of intrauterine development . By the time of birth the head has decreased to approximately 30 % of total body length as a result of the limbs and trunk growing faster than the head . This trend continues postnatally along an axis of increased growth from the head to the feet . Finally , in adults , the head represents approximately 6 % of the body length . The cephalocaudal trend is also the trend of infants learning to use their upper limbs before their lower limbs . The proximodistal trend , on the other hand , is the prenatal growth from 5 months to birth when the fetus grows from the inside of the body outwards . When referring to motor development , the proximodistal trend refers to the development of motor skills from the center of the body outwards ."},{"query":"when does the nba pre season start 2017","short_answer":"September 30","abstract":"The 2017 -- 18 NBA season is the 72nd season of the National Basketball Association ( NBA ) .

The term may be misleading , as it implies that the animal has no choice but to breathe through its nose ; however , it is commonly used to describe cases where effective breathing through the mouth is possible but not preferred . Alternatively , the term has been defined by some as the ability to breathe through the nose while swallowing . While this ability is a common trait of obligate nasal breathers , clearly this definition does not require that nasal breathing in any way be obligatory to the animal . Even in obligate nasal breathers such as horses , rabbits , and rodents , there is a potentially patent path for air to travel from the mouth to the lungs which can be used for endotracheal intubation .

The term also implies the prevention of disruptive behavior . It is a difficult aspect of teaching for many teachers . Problems in this area causes some to leave teaching . In 1981 the US National Educational Association reported that 36 % of teachers said they would probably not go into teaching if they had to decide again . A major reason was negative student attitudes and discipline . Classroom management is crucial in classrooms because it supports the proper execution of curriculum development , developing best teaching practices , and putting them into action . Classroom management can be explained as the actions and directions that teachers use to create a successful learning environment ; indeed , having a positive impact on students achieving given learning requirements and goals ( Soheili , Alizadeh , Murphy , Bajestani , Ferguson and Dreikurs ) . In an effort to ensure all students receive the best education it would seem beneficial for educator programs to spend more time and effort in ensuring educators and instructors are well versed in classroom management . Teachers do not focus on learning classroom management , because higher education programs do not put an emphasis on the teacher attaining classroom management ; indeed , the focus is on creating a conducive learning atmosphere for the student ( Eisenman , Edwards , and Cushman ) . These tools enable teachers to have the resources available to properly and successfully educate upcoming generations , and ensure future successes as a nation . According to Moskowitz & Hayman ( 1976 ) , once a teacher loses control of their classroom , it becomes increasingly more difficult for them to regain that control . Also , research from Berliner ( 1988 ) and Brophy & Good ( 1986 ) shows that the time a teacher must take to correct misbehavior caused by poor classroom management skills results in a lower rate of academic engagement in the classroom . From the student 's perspective , effective classroom management involves clear communication of behavioral and academic expectations as well as a cooperative learning environment . Douglas Brooks ( 1985 ) reports seminal research on the first day of school activity selection and sequence of novice middle school teachers compared with experienced , successful classroom managers . Brooks reports that effective classroom managers organized their activities on the first day of school consistent with the emerging needs of the students . These middle school student needs were the following :"},{"query":"the bacterial promoter consists of which of the following that is recognized by the holoenzyme","short_answer":"","abstract":"In genetics , a promoter is a region of DNA that initiates transcription of a particular gene .

Historians have traditionally divided the war into three phases . In the first phase , the Archidamian War , Sparta launched repeated invasions of Attica , while Athens took advantage of its naval supremacy to raid the coast of the Peloponnese and attempt to suppress signs of unrest in its empire . This period of the war was concluded in 421 BC , with the signing of the Peace of Nicias . That treaty , however , was soon undermined by renewed fighting in the Peloponnese . In 415 BC , Athens dispatched a massive expeditionary force to attack Syracuse in Sicily ; the attack failed disastrously , with the destruction of the entire force , in 413 BC . This ushered in the final phase of the war , generally referred to either as the Decelean War , or the Ionian War . In this phase , Sparta , now receiving support from Persia , supported rebellions in Athens ' subject states in the Aegean Sea and Ionia , undermining Athens ' empire , and , eventually , depriving the city of naval supremacy .

The Virginia Company colony was looking for gold but failed and the colonists could barely feed themselves . The famine during the harsh winter of 1609 forced the colonists to eat leather from their clothes and boots and resort to cannibalism .

If the refractive index is lower on the other side of the boundary and the incident angle is greater than the critical angle , the wave can not pass through and is entirely reflected . The critical angle is the angle of incidence above which the total internal reflection occurs . This is particularly common as an optical phenomenon , where light waves are involved , but it occurs with many types of waves , such as electromagnetic waves in general or sound waves . When a wave reaches a boundary between different materials with different refractive indices , the wave will in general be partially refracted at the boundary surface , and partially reflected . However , if the angle of incidence is greater ( i.e. the direction of propagation is closer to being parallel to the boundary ) than the critical angle -- the angle of incidence at which light is refracted such that it travels along the boundary -- then the wave will not cross the boundary , but will instead be totally reflected back internally . This can only occur when the wave in a medium with a higher refractive index ( n ) reaches a boundary with a medium of lower refractive index ( n ) . For example , it will occur with light reaching air from glass , but not when reaching glass from air ."},{"query":"where does the united states rank among the nations in gross national product","short_answer":"","abstract":"This is a comparison between US states and countries ' nominal Gross Domestic Product for the Alternative Future as based on International Monetary Fund and Bureau of Economic Analysis data .

'' Further , Milward maintains that although Shakespeare \`\` may have felt obliged by the circumstances of the Elizabethan stage to avoid Biblical or other religious subjects for his plays , '' such obligation \`\` did not prevent him from making full use of the Bible in dramatizing his secular sources and thus infusing into them a Biblical meaning .

'' Steven Marx suggests \`\` a thorough familiarity with the Scriptures '' is a prerequisite to understanding the Biblical references in the plays , and that the plays ' references to the Bible \`\` illuminate fresh and surprising meanings in the biblical text .

Gills are tissues that are like short threads , protein structures called filaments .

In some fish , capillary blood flows in the opposite direction to the water , causing countercurrent exchange . The gills push the oxygen - poor water out through openings in the sides of the pharynx . Some fish , like sharks and lampreys , possess multiple gill openings .

Electrons belong to the first generation of the lepton particle family , and are generally thought to be elementary particles because they have no known components or substructure . The electron has a mass that is approximately 1 / 1836 that of the proton . Quantum mechanical properties of the electron include an intrinsic angular momentum ( spin ) of a half - integer value , expressed in units of the reduced Planck constant , ħ . As it is a fermion , no two electrons can occupy the same quantum state , in accordance with the Pauli exclusion principle . Like all elementary particles , electrons exhibit properties of both particles and waves : they can collide with other particles and can be diffracted like light . The wave properties of electrons are easier to observe with experiments than those of other particles like neutrons and protons because electrons have a lower mass and hence a longer De Broglie wavelength for a given energy ."},{"query":"is charcoal lighter fluid the same as lighter fluid","short_answer":"","abstract":"Charcoal lighter fluid is a volatile fluid used to accelerate the ignition of charcoal in a barbecue grill .

Developmental psychologists who adopt the information - processing perspective account for mental development in terms of maturational changes in basic components of a child 's mind . The theory is based on the idea that humans process the information they receive , rather than merely responding to stimuli . This perspective equates the mind to a computer , which is responsible for analyzing information from the environment . According to the standard information - processing model for mental development , the mind 's machinery includes attention mechanisms for bringing information in , working memory for actively manipulating information , and long - term memory for passively holding information so that it can be used in the future . This theory addresses how as children grow , their brains likewise mature , leading to advances in their ability to process and respond to the information they received through their senses .

When a dielectric is placed in an electric field , electric charges do not flow through the material as they do in an electrical conductor but only slightly shift from their average equilibrium positions causing dielectric polarization . Because of dielectric polarization , positive charges are displaced toward the field and negative charges shift in the opposite direction . This creates an internal electric field that reduces the overall field within the dielectric itself . If a dielectric is composed of weakly bonded molecules , those molecules not only become polarized , but also reorient so that their symmetry axes align to the field ."},{"query":"where is the honda classic 2018 being played","short_answer":"","abstract":"The Honda Classic is a professional golf tournament on the PGA Tour in south Florida .
